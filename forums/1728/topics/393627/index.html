              <div>Sogyal Rinpoche, from <em><a href="http://www.rigpaus.org/Glimpse/Glimpse.php">Glimpse of the Day</a></em></div>
              <p>What  is the View? It is nothing less than <em>seeing</em> the actual state of things as they are; it is <em>knowing</em> that the
                       true nature of mind is the true nature of everything; and it is <em>realizing</em> that the true nature of mind is the absolute truth.<br> Dudjom  Rinpoche says: “The View is the comprehension of the naked 
                      awareness,  within which everything is contained: sensory perception and
                       phenomenal  existence, samsara and nirvana. This awareness has two 
                      aspects:  ‘emptiness’ as the absolute, and ‘appearances’ or  
                      ‘perception’ as the relative.”</p>
              <p>If meditation in Dzogchen is simply to 
                      continue the flow of Rigpa after the introduction by the master, how do 
                      we know when it is Rigpa and when 
                        it is not? I asked Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche this question, and he 
                      replied with 
                        his characteristic simplicity: “If you are in an unaltered state, it 
                      is Rigpa.”<br> If we are not contriving or manipulating the mind in any way, but simply
                       resting 
                        in an unaltered state of pure and pristine awareness, that is Rigpa. If
                       there 
                        is any contriving on our part or any kind of manipulating or grasping,
                       it is 
                        not. Rigpa is a state in which there is no longer any doubt; there is 
                      not really 
                        a mind to doubt: you see directly. If you are in this state, a 
                      complete, natural 
                        certainty and confidence surge up with the Rigpa itself, and that is 
                      how you 
                        know.</p>
              <p>The  Dzogchen Tantras, the ancient teachings 
                      from which the bardo instructions come,  speak of a mythical bird, the <em>garuda</em>,
                        which is born fully grown. This image symbolizes our primordial 
                      nature, which is  already completely perfect. The garuda chick has all 
                      its wing feathers fully  developed inside the egg, but it cannot fly 
                      before it hatches. Only at the  moment when the shell cracks open can it
                       burst out and soar up into the sky.  Similarly, the masters tell us, 
                      the qualities of buddhahood are veiled by the  body, and as soon as the 
                      body is discarded, they will be radiantly  displayed.</p>
              <p>In  Tibetan we call the essential nature of 
                      mind Rigpa—primordial, pure,  pristine awareness that is at once 
                      intelligent, cognizant, radiant, and always  awake. This nature of mind,
                       its innermost essence, is absolutely and always  untouched by change or
                       death. At present it is hidden within our own mind, our <em>sem, </em>enveloped
                       and obscured by the mental  scurry of our thoughts and emotions. Just 
                      as clouds can be shifted by a strong  gust of wind to reveal the shining
                       sun and wide-open sky, so, under certain  circumstances, some 
                      inspiration may uncover for us glimpses of this nature of  mind. These 
                      glimpses have many depths and degrees, but each of them will bring  some
                       light of understanding, meaning and freedom.<br> This  is because the nature of mind is the very root itself of
                        understanding.</p>
              <p>What  is the nature of mind like? Imagine a 
                      sky, empty, spacious, and pure from the  beginning; its <em>essence </em>is like
                       this. Imagine a sun, luminous,  clear, unobstructed, and spontaneously 
                      present; its <em>nature </em>is like this. Imagine that sun shining out 
                       impartially on us and all things, penetrating all directions; its <em>energy, </em>which is the manifestation of  compassion, is like this: Nothing 
                      can obstruct it, and it pervades  everywhere.</p>
              <p>When  a much larger number of people know the
                       nature of their minds, they’ll  know also the glorious nature of the 
                      world they are in, and will struggle  urgently and bravely to preserve 
                      it. It’s interesting that the Tibetan  word for “Buddhist” is <em>nangpa</em> .  It means “insider”: someone who seeks the truth not outside but  
                      within the nature of his or her mind. All the teachings and training in 
                      Buddhism  are aimed at that one single point: to look into the nature of
                       mind, and so free  us from the fear of death and help us realize the 
                      truth of  life.</p>
              <p>If,  at the moment of death, we have already a
                       stable realization of the nature of  mind, in one instant we can purify
                       all our karma. And if we continue that stable  recognition, we will 
                      actually be able to end our karma altogether, by entering  the expanse 
                      of the primordial purity of the nature of mind, and attaining  
                      liberation.<br> Padmasambhava  explained this: “This power to attain stability
                       by just recognizing the  nature of mind is like a torch which in one 
                      instant can clear away the darkness  of aeons. <em>So  if we can 
                      recognize the nature of mind in the bardo in the same way as we can  now
                       when it is introduced by the master, there is not the slightest doubt 
                      that  we will attain enlightenment. This is why, from this very moment 
                      on, we must  become familiar with the nature of mind through  practice.”</em></p>
              <p>Remaining  in the clarity and confidence of 
                      Rigpa allows all your thoughts and emotions to  liberate naturally and 
                      effortlessly within its vast expanse, like writing in  water, or 
                      painting in the sky. If you truly perfect this practice, karma has no  
                      chance to be accumulated, and in this state of aimless, carefree 
                      abandon, what  Dudjom Rinpoche calls “uninhibited, naked ease,” the 
                      karmic law of  cause and effect can no longer bind you in any way.</p>
              <p>The  practice of mindfulness, of bringing the
                       scattered mind home, and so of bringing  the different aspects of our 
                      being into focus, is called Peacefully Remaining or  Calm Abiding.<br> All  the fragmented aspects of ourselves, which had been at 
                      war, settle and dissolve  and become friends. In that settling we begin 
                      to understand ourselves more, and  sometimes even have glimpses of the 
                      radiance of our fundamental  nature.</p>
              <p>How  can the wisdom mind of the buddhas be 
                      introduced? Imagine the nature of mind as  your face; it is always with 
                      you, but you cannot see it without help. Now  imagine that you have 
                      never seen a mirror before. The introduction by the master  is like 
                      holding up a mirror suddenly in which you can, for the first time, see  
                      your face reflected.<br> Just  like your face, this pure awareness of Rigpa is not something 
                      “new”  that the master is giving you that you did not have before, nor 
                      is it something  you could possibly find outside of yourself. It has 
                      always been yours, and has  always been with you, but up until that 
                      startling moment you have never actually  seen it directly.</p>
              <p>Just  as the ocean has waves, and the sun has
                       rays, so the mind’s own radiance  is its thoughts and emotions. The 
                      ocean has waves, yet the ocean is not  particularly disturbed by them. 
                      The waves are the <em>very  nature</em> of the ocean. Waves will rise,  
                      but <em>where</em> do they go? Back into the ocean. And where do the 
                      waves come from? The  ocean.</p>
              <p>In  the same manner, thoughts and emotions 
                      are the radiance and expression of the <em>very  nature</em> of the 
                      mind. They rise from the  mind, but where do they dissolve? Back into 
                      the mind. Whatever rises, do not see  it as a particular problem. If you
                       do not impulsively react, if you are only  patient, it will once again 
                      settle into its essential nature.<br> When  you have this understanding, then rising thoughts only enhance 
                      your practice.  But when you do not understand what they intrinsically 
                      are—the radiance of  the nature of your mind—then your thoughts become 
                      the seed of confusion.  So have a spacious, open, and compassionate 
                      attitude toward your thoughts and  emotions, because in fact your 
                      thoughts are your family, the family of your  mind. Before them, as 
                      Dudjom Rinpoche used to say: “Be like an old wise  man, watching a child
                       play.”</p>
              <p>Where  exactly is our buddha nature? It is in
                       the skylike nature of our mind. Utterly  open, free and limitless, it 
                      is fundamentally so simple and so natural that it  can never be 
                      complicated, corrupted, or stained, so pure that it is beyond even  the 
                      concept of purity and impurity.<br> To  talk of this nature of mind as skylike is, of course, only a 
                      metaphor that helps  us to begin to imagine its all-embracing 
                      boundlessness; for the buddha nature  has a quality the sky cannot have,
                       that of the radiant clarity of  awareness.<br> It  is said: “It is simply your flawless present awareness, cognizant 
                      and  empty, naked and awake.”</p>
              <p>Realizing  the View subtly but completely 
                      transforms your vision of everything. More and  more, I have come to 
                      realize how thoughts and concepts  are<em> all </em>that block us from 
                      always being, quite  simply, in the absolute. Now I see clearly why the 
                      masters so often say:  “Try hard not to create too much hope and fear,” 
                      for they only  engender more mental gossip. When the View is there, 
                      thoughts are seen for what  they truly are: fleeting and transparent, 
                      and only relative. You see through  everything directly, as if you had 
                      X-ray eyes. You do not cling to thoughts and  emotions or reject them; 
                      you welcome them all within the vast embrace of Rigpa.  The things you 
                      took so seriously before—ambitions, plans, expectations,  doubts, and 
                      passions—no longer have any deep and anxious hold on you, for  the View 
                      has helped you to see the futility and pointlessness of them all, and  
                      born in you a spirit of true renunciation.</p>
              <p>Whatever  our lives are like, our buddha 
                      nature is always there. And it is always perfect.  We say that not even 
                      the buddhas can improve it in their infinite wisdom, nor  can sentient 
                      beings spoil it in their seemingly infinite  confusion.<br> Our  true nature could be compared to the sky, and the confusion of the 
                      ordinary mind  to clouds. Some days the sky is completely obscured by 
                      clouds. When we are down  on the ground, looking up, it is very 
                      difficult to believe that there is  anything else there but clouds. Yet 
                      we have only to fly in a plane to discover  above the clouds a limitless
                       expanse of clear blue sky. From up there, the  clouds we assumed were 
                      everything seem so small and so far away down  below.<br> We  should always try to remember: The clouds are not the sky and do not
                        “belong” to it. They only hang there and pass by in their slightly  
                      ridiculous and nondependent fashion. And they can never stain or mark 
                      the sky in  any way.</p>
              <p>Our  buddha nature has an active aspect, 
                      which is our “inner teacher.”  From the very moment we became obscured, 
                      this “inner teacher” has  worked tirelessly for us, tirelessly trying to
                       bring us back to the radiance and  spaciousness of our true being. Not 
                      for one second, my master Jamyang Khyentse  said, has the inner teacher 
                      given up on us. In its infinite compassion, one with  the infinite 
                      compassion of all the buddhas and all the enlightened beings, it  has 
                      been ceaselessly working for our evolution—not only in this life but  in
                       all our past lives—using all kinds of skillful means and all types of  
                      situations to teach and awaken us and to guide us back to the  truth.</p>
              <p>Feeling  the living presence of Buddha, of 
                      Padmasambhava, of your master, and simply  opening your heart and mind 
                      to the embodiment of truth, really does bless and  transform your mind. 
                      As you invoke Buddha, your own buddha nature is inspired to  awaken and 
                      blossom, as naturally as a flower in sunlight.</p>
              <p>Dilgo  Khyentse Rinpoche describes a yogi 
                      wandering through a garden. He is completely  awake to the splendor and 
                      beauty of the flowers, and relishes their colors,  shapes and scents. 
                      But there is no trace of clinging or any  “after-thought” in his mind.<br> As  Dudjom Rinpoche says:<br> “Whatever  perceptions arise, you should be like a little child going 
                      into a beautifully  decorated temple; he looks, but grasping does not 
                      enter into his perception at  all. You leave everything fresh, natural, 
                      vivid and unspoiled. When you leave  each thing in its own state, then 
                      its shape doesn’t change, its color  doesn’t fade and its glow does not 
                      disappear. Whatever appears is  unstained by any grasping, so then all 
                      that you perceive arises as the naked  wisdom of Rigpa, which is the 
                      indivisibility of luminosity and  emptiness.”</p>
              <p>When  the teachings “click” for you somewhere
                       deep in your heart and mind,  then you really have the View. Whatever 
                      difficulties you face, you will find you  have some kind of serenity, 
                      stability, and understanding, and an internal  mechanism—you could call 
                      it an “inner transformer”—that  works for you, to protect you from 
                      falling prey to wrong views. In that View,  you will have discovered a 
                      “wisdom guide” of your own, always on  hand to advise you, support you, 
                      and remind you of the truth. Confusion will  still arise, that’s only 
                      normal, but with a crucial difference: No longer  will you focus on it 
                      in a blinded and obsessive way, but you will look on it  with humor, 
                      perspective, and compassion.</p>
              <p>One  of the greatest Buddhist traditions 
                      calls the nature of mind “the wisdom  of ordinariness.” I cannot say it 
                      enough: Our true nature and the nature  of all beings is not something 
                      extraordinary.<br> The  irony is that it is our so-called ordinary world that is 
                      extraordinary, a  fantastic, elaborate hallucination of the deluded 
                      vision of samsara. It is this  “extraordinary” vision that blinds us to 
                      the “ordinary,”  natural, inherent nature of mind. Imagine if the 
                      buddhas were looking down at us  now: How they would marvel sadly at the
                       lethal ingenuity and intricacy of our  confusion!</p>
              <p>It  is said that when Buddha attained 
                      enlightenment, all he wanted to do was to show  the rest of us the 
                      nature of mind and share completely what he had realized. But  he also 
                      saw, with the great sorrow of infinite compassion, how difficult it  
                      would be for us to understand<br> For  even though we have the same inner nature as Buddha, we have not 
                      recognized it  because it is so enclosed and wrapped up in our 
                      individual ordinary  minds.<br> Imagine  an empty vase. The space inside is exactly the same as the 
                      space outside. Only  the fragile walls of the vase separate one from the
                       other. Our buddha mind is  enclosed within the walls of our ordinary 
                      mind. But when we become enlightened,  it is as if the vase shatters 
                      into pieces. The space “inside” merges  instantly into the space 
                      “outside.” They become one: There and then  we realize that they were 
                      never separate or different; <em> they were  always the same.</em></p>
              <p>There  is a spark of hope, a playful humor 
                      about the posture we take in meditation,  which lies in the secret 
                      understanding that we all have the buddha nature. So  when you assume 
                      this posture, you are playfully imitating a buddha,  acknowledging and 
                      giving real encouragement to the emergence of your own buddha  nature. 
                      You begin to respect yourself as a potential  buddha.<br> At  the same time, you still recognize your relative condition. But 
                      because you have  let yourself be inspired by a joyful trust in your own
                       true buddha nature,<em> you  can accept your negative aspects more 
                      easily </em>and deal  with them more generously and with more humor.<br> When  you meditate, invite yourself to feel the self-esteem, the 
                      dignity, and the  strong humility of the buddha that you are. If you 
                      simply let yourself be  inspired by this joyful trust, it is enough: Out
                       of this understanding and confidence, meditation will naturally arise.</p>
              <p>The  masters stress that to stabilize the 
                      View in meditation, it is essential, first  of all, to accomplish this 
                      practice in a<em> special  environment</em> of retreat, where all the 
                      favorable conditions are present; amid the  distractions and busyness of
                       the world, however much you meditate, true  experience will not be born
                       in your mind.<br> Second,  though there is no difference in Dzogchen between meditation 
                      and everyday life,  until you have found true stability through doing 
                      the practice in<em> proper</em> sessions, you will not be able to 
                      integrate the wisdom of meditation into your  experience of daily life.<br> Third,  even when you practice, you might be able to abide by the 
                      continual flow of  Rigpa with the confidence of the View, but if you are
                       unable to continue that  flow<em> at all times and in all situations, </em>mixing
                        your practice with everyday life, it will not serve as a remedy when 
                      unfavorable  circumstances arise, and you will be led astray into 
                      delusion by thoughts and  emotions.</p>
              <p>To  recognize the nature of your mind is to 
                      engender in the ground of your being an  understanding that will change 
                      your entire worldview and help you discover and  develop, naturally and 
                      spontaneously, a compassionate desire to serve all  beings, as well as a
                       direct knowledge of how best you can do so, with whatever  skill or 
                      ability you have, in whatever circumstances you find  yourself.</p>
              <p>Buddha  was a human being, like you or me. He
                       never claimed divinity, he merely knew he  had the buddha nature, the 
                      seed of enlightenment, and that everyone else did  too. The buddha 
                      nature is simply the birthright of every sentient being, and I  always 
                      say: “Our buddha nature is as good as any buddha’s buddha  nature.”</p>
              <p>If  your mind is able to settle naturally of 
                      its own accord, and if you find you are  inspired simply to rest in its 
                      pure awareness, then you do not need any method  of meditation. However,
                       the vast majority of us find it difficult to arrive at  that state 
                      straight away. We simply do not know how to awaken it, and our minds  
                      are so wild and so distracted that we need a<em> skillful</em> means or 
                      method to evoke it.</p>
              <p>By  “skillful” I mean that you bring together
                       your understanding of the  essential nature of your mind, your 
                      knowledge of your various, shifting moods,  and the insight you have 
                      developed through your practice into how to work with  yourself, from 
                      moment to moment. By bringing these together, you learn the art  of 
                      applying whatever method is<em> appropriate</em> to any particular 
                      situation or problem, to transform that environment of your  mind.</p>
              <p>The  purpose of meditation is to awaken in us
                       the skylike nature of mind, and to  introduce us to that which we 
                      really are, our unchanging pure awareness that  underlies the whole of 
                      life and death.<br> In  the stillness and silence of meditation, we glimpse and 
                      return to that deep  inner nature that we so long ago lost sight of amid
                       the busyness and distraction  of our minds.</p>
              <p>Dudjom  Rinpoche used to tell the story of a 
                      powerful bandit in India, who, after  countless successful raids, 
                      realized the terrible suffering he had been causing.  He yearned for 
                      some way of atoning for what he had done, and visited a famous  master. 
                      He asked him: “I am a sinner, I am in torment. What’s the  way out? What
                       can I do?”<br> The  master looked the bandit up and down and then asked him what he was
                       good  at.<br> “Nothing,”  replied the bandit.<br> “Nothing?”  barked the master. “You must be good at  something!”<br> The  bandit was silent for a while, and eventually admitted: “Actually 
                      there is  one thing I have a talent for, and that’s  stealing.”<br> The  master chuckled: “Good! That’s exactly the skill you’ll need  now. 
                      Go to a quiet place and rob all your perceptions, and steal all the 
                      stars  and planets in the sky, and dissolve them into the belly of 
                      emptiness, the  all-encompassing space of the nature of mind.”<br> Within  twenty-one days, the bandit had realized the nature of his mind,
                       and eventually  came to be regarded as one of the great saints of  
                      India.</p>
              <p><em>When  the View is  constant,</em><br> <em>The  flow of Rigpa  unfailing,</em><br> <em>And  the merging of the two luminosities continuous and 
                       spontaneous,</em><br> <em>All  possible delusion is liberated at its very  root,</em><br> <em>And  your entire perception arises, without a break, as 
                      Rigpa.</em><br> A  term such as <em>meditation</em> is not really appropriate for 
                      Dzogchen practice, you can see, as ultimately it  implies meditating 
                      “on” something, whereas in Dzogchen all is only  and forever Rigpa. So 
                      there is no question of a meditation separate from simply  abiding by 
                      the pure presence of Rigpa. The only word that could possibly  describe 
                      this is <em>non-meditation.</em> In this state, the masters say, even if
                       you look for delusion there is none  left. Even if you looked for 
                      ordinary pebbles on an island of gold and jewels,  you wouldn’t have a 
                      chance of finding any.</p>
              <p>Sometimes  when I meditate, I don’t use any 
                      particular method. I just allow my mind  to rest, and I find, especially
                       when I am inspired, that I can bring my mind  home and relax very 
                      quickly. I sit quietly and rest in the nature of mind; I  don’t question
                       or doubt whether I am in the “correct” state.  There is no effort, only
                       a rich understanding, wakefulness, and unshakable  certainty.<br> When  I am in the nature of mind, the ordinary mind is no longer 
                      there. There is no  need to sustain or confirm a sense of being: <em>I 
                      simply  am.</em> A fundamental trust is present.  There is nothing in 
                      particular to do.</p>
              <p>In  death all the components of the body and 
                      mind are stripped away and  disintegrate. As the body dies, the senses 
                      and subtle elements dissolve, and  this is followed by the death of the 
                      ordinary aspect of the mind, with all its  negative emotions of anger, 
                      desire, and ignorance. Finally nothing remains to  obscure our true 
                      nature, as everything that in life has clouded the enlightened  mind has
                       fallen away. And what is revealed is the primordial ground of our  
                      absolute nature, which is like a pure and cloudless sky.<br> This  is called the dawning of the Ground Luminosity, or Clear Light, 
                      where  consciousness itself dissolves into the all-encompassing space of
                       truth. <em>The Tibetan  Book of the Dead </em>says of this  moment:<br> <em>The  nature of everything is open, empty and naked like the  sky.</em><br> <em>Luminous  emptiness, without center or circumference; the pure, 
                      naked Rigpa  dawns</em></p>
              <p>Do  not make the mistake of imagining that 
                      the nature of mind is exclusive only to  our minds. It is in fact the 
                      nature of everything. It can never be said too  often that to realize 
                      the nature of mind is to realize the nature of all  things.</p>
              <p>We  are so addicted to looking outside 
                      ourselves that we have lost access to our  inner being almost 
                      completely. We are terrified to look inward, because our  culture has 
                      given us no idea of what we will find. We may even think that if we  do,
                       we will be in danger of madness. This is one of the last and most  
                      resourceful ploys of ego to prevent us from discovering our real  
                      nature.<br> So  we make our lives so hectic that we eliminate the slightest risk of 
                      looking into  ourselves. Even the idea of meditation can scare people. 
                      When they hear the  words <em>egoless</em>or <em>emptiness, </em>they 
                      think that experiencing those  states will be like being thrown out the 
                      door of a spaceship to float forever in  a dark, chilling void. Nothing 
                      could be further from the truth. But in a world  dedicated to 
                      distraction, silence and stillness terrify us; we protect ourselves  
                      from them with noise and frantic busyness. Looking into the nature of 
                      our mind  is the last thing we would dare to do.</p>
              <p>All  the Buddhist teachings are explained in 
                      terms of Ground, Path, and Fruition. The  ground of Dzogchen is the 
                      fundamental, primordial state, our absolute nature,  which is already 
                      perfect and always present.<br> Patrul  Rinpoche says: “It is neither to be sought externally, nor is 
                      it something  you did not have before and that now has to be newly born 
                      in your mind.”  So from the point of view of the Ground—the absolute—our
                       nature is  the same as the buddhas’, and there is no question at this 
                      level,  “not a hair’s breadth,” the masters say, of teaching or  
                      practice to do.</p>
              <p>When  you have fully recognized that the 
                      nature of your mind is the same as that of  the master, from then on you
                       and the master can never be separate, because the  master is <em>one</em>with
                       the nature of  your mind, always present, as it is.<br> When  you have recognized that the master and you are inseparable, an 
                      enormous  gratitude and sense of awe and homage is born in you. Dudjom 
                      Rinpoche calls this  “the homage of the View.” It is a devotion that 
                      springs  spontaneously from seeing the View of the nature of  mind.</p>
              <p>Imagine you are sitting in front of a glass 
                      door that leads out into your garden, 
                        looking through it, gazing out into space. It seems as though there is
                       nothing 
                        between you and the sky, because you cannot see the surface of the 
                      glass. You 
                        would bang your nose if you got up and tried to walk through, thinking
                       it wasn’t 
                        there. But if you touch it you will see at once that there is 
                      something there 
                        that holds your fingerprints, something that comes between you and the
                       space 
                        outside.<br> In the same manner, the ground of the ordinary mind prevents us from 
                      breaking 
                        through to the skylike nature of our mind, even if we can still have 
                      glimpses 
                        of it. We have to break out of the ground of the ordinary mind 
                      altogether, to 
                        discover and let in the fresh air of Rigpa.</p>
              <p>There are rough as well as gentle waves in 
                      the ocean; strong emotions come, 
                        like anger, desire, jealousy. The real practitioner recognizes them 
                      not as a 
                        disturbance or an obstacle but as a great opportunity. The fact that 
                      you react 
                        to arisings such as these with habitual tendencies of attachment and 
                      aversion 
                        is a sign not only that you are distracted but that you do not have 
                      the recognition 
                        and have lost the ground of Rigpa. To react to emotions in this way 
                      empowers 
                        them and binds you even tighter in the chains of delusion.<br> The great secret of Dzogchen is to see right through them, as soon as 
                      they 
                        arise, to what they really are: the vivid and electric manifestation 
                      of the 
                        energy of Rigpa itself. As you gradually learn to do this, 
                        even the most turbulent emotions fail to seize hold of you and instead
                       dissolve, 
                        as wild waves rise and rear and sink back into the calm of the ocean.</p>
              <p>There is no swifter, more moving, or more 
                      powerful practice for invoking the 
                        help of the enlightened beings, for arousing devotion and realizing 
                      the nature 
                        of mind, than the practice of Guru Yoga. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche 
                        wrote: “The words Guru Yoga mean ‘union with the nature of the guru,’”
                       and in 
                        this practice we are given methods by which we can blend our own minds
                       with 
                        the enlightened mind of the master.<br> The master—the guru—embodies the crystallization of the blessings of 
                      all buddhas, 
                        masters, and enlightened beings. So to invoke him or her is to invoke 
                      them all; 
                        and to merge your mind and heart with your master’s wisdom mind is to 
                      merge 
                        your mind with the truth and very embodiment of enlightenment.</p>
              <p>The nature of mind is the background to the 
                      whole of life 
                        and death like the sky, which enfolds the whole universe in its 
                      embrace.</p>
              <p>The whole point of Dzogchen meditation 
                      practice is to strengthen 
                                and stabilize Rigpa and allow it to grow to full maturity. The
                       ordinary, habitual 
                                mind with its projections is extremely powerful. It keeps 
                      returning, and takes 
                                hold of us easily when we are inattentive or distracted.<br> As Dudjom Rinpoche used to say: “At present our Rigpa is like a little
                       baby, 
                        stranded on the battlefield of strong arising thoughts.” I like to say
                       that 
                        we have to begin by babysitting our Rigpa, in the secure environment 
                      of meditation.</p>
              <p>Imagine a person who suddenly wakes up in the
                       hospital after an automobile 
                        accident to find that she is suffering from total amnesia. Outwardly, 
                      everything 
                        is intact: She has the same face and form, her senses and her mind are
                       there, 
                        but she doesn’t have any idea or any trace of a memory of who she 
                      really is.<br> In exactly the same way, we cannot remember our true identity, our 
                      original 
                        nature. Frantically, and in real dread, we cast around and improvise 
                        another identity, one we clutch with all the desperation of someone 
                      falling 
                        continuously into an abyss. This false and ignorantly assumed identity
                       is “ego.”</p>
              <p>In Tibetan we call the essential nature of 
                      mind Rigpa—primordial, 
                        pure, pristine awareness that is at once intelligent, cognizant, 
                      radiant, and 
                        always awake. This nature of mind, its innermost essence, is 
                      absolutely and 
                        always untouched by change or death. At present it is hidden within 
                      our own 
                        mind, our sem, enveloped and obscured by the mental scurry of our 
                      thoughts and 
                        emotions. Just as clouds can be shifted by a strong gust of wind to 
                      reveal the 
                        shining sun and wide-open sky, so, under certain circumstances, some 
                      inspiration 
                        may uncover for us glimpses of this nature of mind. These glimpses 
                      have many 
                        depths and degrees, but each of them will bring some light of 
                      understanding, 
                        meaning and freedom.<br> This is because the nature of mind is the very root itself of 
                      understanding.</p>
              <p>According  to Dzogchen, the entire range of 
                      all possible appearances, and all possible  phenomena in all the 
                      different realities, whether samsara or nirvana, all of  these without 
                      exception have always been and will always be perfect and  complete, 
                      within the vast and boundless expanse of the nature of mind. Yet, even  
                      though the essence of everything is empty and “pure from the very  
                      beginning,” its nature is rich in noble qualities, pregnant with every  
                      possibility, a limitless, incessantly and dynamically creative field 
                      that is  always spontaneously perfect.</p>
              <p>Using  the mantra, offer your heart and soul 
                      in fervent and one-pointed devotion, and  merge and mix and blend your 
                      mind with that of Padmasambhava or your  master.<br> Gradually  you will feel yourself coming closer to Padmasambhava, and 
                      closing the gap  between you and his wisdom mind. Slowly, through the 
                      blessing and power of this  practice, you will find you actually 
                      experience your mind being transformed into  the wisdom mind of 
                      Padmasambhava and the master: You begin to recognize their  
                      indivisibility. Just as if you put your finger into water it will get 
                      wet, and  if you put it into fire it will burn, so if you invest your 
                      mind in the wisdom  mind of the buddhas it will transform into their 
                      wisdom  nature.<br> What  happens is that gradually your mind begins to find itself in the
                       state of Rigpa,  as the innermost nature of mind is nothing other than 
                      the wisdom mind of all the  buddhas. It is as if your ordinary mind 
                      gradually dies and dissolves, and your  pure awareness, your buddha 
                      nature, your inner teacher, is revealed. This is the  true meaning of 
                      “blessing”–a transformation in which your mind  transcends into the 
                      state of the absolute.</p>
              <p>The Dzogchen Tantras, the ancient teachings 
                      from which the bardo instructions 
                        come, speak of a mythical bird, the garuda, which is born fully 
                        grown. This image symbolizes our primordial nature, which is already 
                      completely 
                        perfect. The garuda chick has all its wing feathers fully developed 
                      inside the 
                        egg, but it cannot fly before it hatches. Only at the moment when the 
                      shell 
                        cracks open can it burst out and soar up into the sky. Similarly, the 
                      masters 
                        tell us, the qualities of buddhahood are veiled by the body, and as 
                      soon as 
                        the body is discarded, they will be radiantly displayed.</p>
              <p>Just as the ocean has waves, and the sun has 
                      rays, so the mind’s own radiance 
                        is its thoughts and emotions. The ocean has waves, yet the ocean is 
                      not particularly 
                        disturbed by them. The waves are the very nature of the ocean. Waves 
                      will rise, 
                        but where do they go? Back into the ocean. And where do the waves come
                       from? 
                        The ocean.<br> In the same manner, thoughts and emotions are the radiance and 
                      expression of 
                        the very nature of the mind. They rise from the mind, but where do 
                      they dissolve? 
                        Back into the mind. Whatever rises, do not see it as a particular 
                      problem. If 
                        you do not impulsively react, if you are only patient, it will once 
                      again settle 
                        into its essential nature.<br> When you have this understanding, then rising thoughts only enhance 
                      your practice. 
                        But when you do not understand what they intrinsically are—the 
                      radiance of the 
                        nature of your mind—then your thoughts become the seed of confusion. 
                      So have 
                        a spacious, open, and compassionate attitude toward your thoughts and 
                      emotions, 
                        because in fact your thoughts are your family, the family of your 
                      mind. Before 
                        them, as Dudjom Rinpoche used to say: “Be like an old wise man, 
                      watching a child 
                        play.”</p>
              <p>The  preliminary training of meditation 
                      practice and purification ripens and opens  the student’s heart and mind
                       to the direct understanding of the  truth.<br> Then,  in the powerful moment of introduction, the master can 
                      direct his realization of  the nature of mind—what we call the master’s 
                      “wisdom  mind”—into the mind of the now authentically receptive  
                      student.<br> The  master is doing nothing less than introducing the student
                       to what the Buddha  actually <em>is</em>,  awakening the student to the
                       living presence of enlightenment within. In that  experience, the 
                      Buddha, the nature of mind, and the master’s wisdom mind  are all fused 
                      into, and revealed as, one. The student then recognizes, in a  blaze of 
                      gratitude, beyond any shadow of doubt, that there is not, has never  
                      been, and could not ever be any separation: between student and master, 
                      between  the master’s wisdom mind and the nature of the student’s  mind.</p>
              <p>Dudjom  Rinpoche says of the moment when 
                      Rigpa is directly revealed: “That moment  is like taking a hood off your
                       head. What boundless spaciousness and relief!  This is the supreme 
                      seeing: seeing what was not seen before.” When you  “see what was not 
                      seen before,” everything opens, expands, and  becomes crisp, clear, 
                      brimming with life, vivid with wonder and freshness. It is  as if the 
                      roof of your mind were dying off, or a flock of birds suddenly took  off
                       from a dark nest. All limitations dissolve and fall away, as if, the  
                      Tibetans say, a seal were broken open.</p>
              <p>Imagine  you were living in a house on the 
                      top of a mountain which was itself at the top  of the whole world. 
                      Suddenly the entire structure of the house, which limited  your view, 
                      just falls away and you can see all around you, both outside and  
                      inside. But there is not any “thing” to see; what happens has no  
                      ordinary reference whatsoever; it is total, complete, unprecedented, 
                      perfect  seeing. This is how it feels when Rigpa is directly  revealed.</p>
