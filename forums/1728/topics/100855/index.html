            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Besides the Jhanas, have you experience pure empty Presence in a state of  no thought? That is the true state of a Being. It is beyond the mind, beyond concepts.<br><br>This pure Presence is all pervading, yet void at the same time. In my experience, the Jhanas are different. Jhana's are like 'looking outward' in a meditation, pure Presence is 'looking inwards'. I can't describe it very well.<br><br>Pure presence can best be felt when a person is at the moment free from desires. Pure presence is like the ray that emits its properties into the mind. The properties of the pure presence form your personality.</div>

There are many practitioners who have mistaken their jhanic experience to be Nirvana.<br><br><blockquote> I.1 Nevasanna-nasannayatana bhumi. The realm of neither perception nor non-perception, the summit of all existences. They can live a life span that is equivalent to that of 84000 Maha kappa or universes. Udaka, the ascetic who was the second teacher abandoned by the Buddha in his search for the Four Noble Truths was reborn in this Brahma realm after dying on the night before the Buddha decided to teach the Dhamma.(3) Reaching the eighth Jhana of Samatha meditation can only attain this highest existence. </blockquote>(please see topic: Different Existences and Realms in Buddhism)<br><br>There are many religions in the world that leads to such a jhanic state. However, Buddhism's Nirvana is beyond any of such states, and enters into cessation.<br><br><blockquote>    * (a) All phenomena are shunya (void, empty), as  they are relative and <strong>so lack substantiality and independent  reality; they are conditioned by and depenedent on other phenomena (this is the Buddhist theory of Pratitya-samutpanna or "dependent origination") and hence in themselves ultimately unreal.</strong><br>* (b) The Absolute Reality is shunya or shunyata, as it is devoid of empirical forms and thought constructs, <strong>no predicate ("is", "not-is", "is and not-is", neither "is nor not-is") can  legitamately be applied to it.</strong></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Sangha,<br><br>I am in no position to say whether Pure presence is nibbana. I can only write from my own experience and understanding.<br><br>This pure presence is called Rigpa in Tibetan Buddhism. I am not a Buddhist in this life, but I was a Tibetan Monk of Nyingma school several lifetimes ago. That is why I still have a lot of interest in Buddhism.<br><br>About Rigpa, when we experience it. It is formless and empty and at the same time infinite and all pervading. It is NOT BLISS. Bliss is a samadhi state but it is not the true nature yet, it is still a state in the mind. I have bliss experiences also, in fact i have then now quite often outside of meditation also.<br><br>Rigpa is a presence of 'yourself' that is connect to everything in the universe. That is probably why the Buddha say that there is 'no self'. All is connect to all in the Dharmakaya. Rigpa is a part of the Dharmakaya. When in the state, there is no separation into you or me... We are all one thing which cannot be described.<br><br>However, I must say that even now, while reading this, we are already the rigpa. We do not realise this is because we THINK we are just the mind/personality. The mind/personality is a REFLECTION from rigpa. It is not the true self. If you understand what I am write, you may get a sudden awakening/realisation. And if the realisation is deep enough, your viewpoint or way of seeing the world will change.<br><br>Just my 2 cents...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sangha:</div><div class="quote_body">Jhana is attained with no expecting, with no wanting, with no not wanting, with no unawareness, with no thoughts, with samadhi, with mindfulness.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi LongChen,<br><br>Even the "inner" and "outer" are production of the analytical mind. Only the mind requires such division, concepts and thoughts. The Presence has no room for all these.  It works through naturalness and directness. Too short to have time and too simple to have thought.<br><br>However even when one experiences this pure sense of existence, due to latent karmic tendencies,  the mind will still attempt to create a formless-transparent-like entity ('I') experiencing "things".  In reality there is no 'I'.<br><br>The 'Blueness' of the blue sky isn't 'I'.<br>Remain Silence and in Presence, all things are in their entirety.<br>No 'I' is required.<br>This itself is sufficient.<br><br>Happy Journey.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Thusness,<br><br>Thank you for your profound explanation.<br><br>May I ask ... how do one remain in Presence all the time. Does it require the clearing of all karmic tendencies (samcaras/samskara).<br><br>I understand that the Presence is there all the time.  Is it possible to be in presence even when engaged in say a conversation with another person?<br><br>Currently, switching to witness state is only possible when I am not engaged in any conversation.<br><br>Thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Long Chen,<br><br>Yes it is possible.  But as much as I would not like to say, there is no what, where, when, why and how.   Sounds senseless but it is true.  These are what Naturalness is not.<br><br>Nevertheless, the mind will be stubbornly attached to this current mode of knowing because to the mind, it is all there is.  It seems to be a destined journey that a sincere seeker has to continue penetrate its own depth, till it completely exhaust itself and meet its own DEATH. The death of the 'I'.<br><br>The giving up and full understanding of the poverty of the entire thinking and analytical mechanism will allow the mind to rest itself upon nothing.  Here karmic tendency arises and ceases as it is, no effort to struggle is made.<br>This is the time effortless knowing arise.  A complete clarity of ISness manisfesting as pure Presence.<br><br>Seek deep into the depth of our own self, there is always this Will, Effort..etc.  This Unwillingless to let go, to be.<br>Simply put, it is this that separates.<br><br>Lastly try not to find a sit in the body. The true nature fills all space.  Creating a boundary for What that is neither within nor without will eventually prove futile.  Presence finds itself in Otherness.  The body has created the illusion of 'inward' and divides.  We have engaged ourselves in too much analysis and lost our intuitiveness and directness.  Since u have experienced the pure Presence, sense the 'I' that holds and let go immeidately.<br>Presense always IS.<br><br>Nice Chat <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
