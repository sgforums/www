              <p>this one is not a ghost story but still quite scary everytime i think of it.... i got posted back to tekong after my bmt. once i was tasked to check out the number of fire extinguishers in the guard rooms. those who do guard duty b4 in tekong will noe... beside the bunk where the recruits rest for the night during thier duty... there is another room with a altar inside. walk past the room will only see the side of it...</p>
              <p>that day i entered the room to see if there is any fire extinguisher there... and i got a bloody shock.... the altar was set up for a ghost, not god. the name on the tablet literally translate as "nameless lone spirit". bloody hell i dashed out of the room and sprinted down the stairs lol.</p>

              I remembered during my NS time at Tekong.
              
              As I wore spec,dunno if I see wrongly or what? Even if I took off my spec, I still can see lar, obviously not blind though.
              
              I saw in the wee hours in the morning in my bunk that, there was someone standing beside the bunk bed, staring at the recruit lol. scary isnt it. I kept saying prayers and hoping it wouldnt come to my bed, as my bed was in the middle of the bunk.
              
              Then just before dawn, I can hear slippers noise, hurrying to leave the bunk a few times. not sure if it is recruit waking up, or what?
              
              Then once this malay 3SGT, on hearing what we told him, decided to sleep in our bunk for one night. nothing happened when he slept in the bunk lol. so the ghosts were scared of him?

              do you know what is the lifespan in ghost realm?
              
              30 days in human world is equal to their 1 day there.
              
              you know why is the special significance for 1 and 15 day of the month? It's their lunch and dinner time when you make offerings in the temple for 1 and 15 days. I heard it from a talk given by a monk.
              
              He said that in the ghost realm, alot of ghosts have become buddhists and practise the dhamma.

              yes they do. I think they live for quite a long life, maybe few hundred years. the ghosts at the Qin Dynasty, they still do exists till now.
              
              after they die, they ae reborn according to their karma.

              depend on their karma what their next life would be.
              
              if for example, they are reborn as animals, so they will die as ghost and then reborn as an animal. If they are reborn as a human being, then they would die and then reborn as a human being in the mother's womb.

            <div class='col-md body'>reborn in the ghost realm is suffering. either suffer from hunger, thirst and cold, heat and bullying from other older and powerful ghosts. they also do not have an abode for themselves. for those who committed suicide and reborn as a ghost, its even worse, as they have to suffer the same act of committing suicide once every few days. so whatever you do, dun think that commit suicide will end everything, because it wont. If for example, you commit sucide by jumping off from a building, when you die, you are reborn as a ghost and once every few days, you have to go back and repeatthe act of jumping down from a building and die.</div>

              the only way not to be reborn is to attain Nirvana. we will all be reborn. whatever we do, whether good or bad actions,we are responsible for the karma. the only people who are not reborn are the Buddha's and Arahants.
