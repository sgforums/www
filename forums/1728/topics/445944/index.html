              <p>Just now in Chinatown I saw a lot of old men sitting by the side, smiling, just relaxing and enjoying their time there with no goals, just relaxing, watching the passerbys. This is a big contrast to everyone of us... seeking to get somewhere, trying to get away from here, or for practitioners trying to reach a higher state and so on.</p>
              <p>Yet all these contrivance do not touch the natural state...</p>

              I can identify with homer28's comment.
              
              In Singapore, it's generally about economic progress as this directly affects the workers' pay.
              
              As Buddhism teaches us, we are all bounded by cravings. If we have a little money, we crave for more. If we have a lot of money, we crave for even more.
              
              This is especially true in Singapore's context. Most of the population do not see the true meaning of life. They only see the lifestyle they lead currently and crave for a higher quality lifestyle in comparison to their present and their peers' lifestyle, achivable by a higher income. 
              
              Hence, we see people pursuing worldly gains; and not true actualisation.
              
              Sad, but true.
              
              Personally, although I see the above logic, I cannot escape from the cycle of pursuing worldly material gains. When you have your friends and family all pursuing worldly gains, would you want to believe, think and act on something else?

              <div class="chapter">
              <p>Now on that occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in <a id="rajagaha" name="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a>, in the Bamboo Grove. Then thirty monks from <a id="pava" name="pava">Pava</a> — all wilderness dwellers, all alms-goers, all triple-robe wearers, all
               still with fetters — went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having 
              bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>
              <p>Then the thought occurred to the Blessed One, "These thirty monks 
              from Pava... are all still with fetters. What if I were to teach them 
              the Dhamma in such a way that in this very sitting their minds, through 
              lack of clinging, would be released from fermentations?"</p>
              <p>So he addressed the monks: "Monks."</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said, "From an inconceivable beginning comes 
              transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered
               by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating &amp; wandering
               on. What do you think, monks? Which is greater, the blood you have shed
               from having your heads cut off while transmigrating &amp; wandering 
              this long, long time, or the water in the four great oceans?"</p>
              <p>"As we understand the Dhamma taught to us by the Blessed One, this is
               the greater: the blood we have shed from having our heads cut off while
               transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time, not the water in 
              the four great oceans."</p>
              <p>"Excellent, monks. Excellent. It is excellent that you thus understand the Dhamma taught by me.</p>
              <p>"This is the greater: the blood you have shed from having your heads 
              cut off while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time, not 
              the water in the four great oceans.</p>
              <p>"The blood you have shed when, being cows, you had your cow-heads cut
               off: Long has this been greater than the water in the four great 
              oceans.</p>
              <p>"The blood you have shed when, being water buffaloes, you had your 
              water buffalo-heads cut off... when, being rams, you had your ram-heads 
              cut off... when, being goats, you had your goat-heads cut off... when, 
              being deer, you had your deer-heads cut off... when, being chickens, you
               had your chicken-heads cut off... when, being pigs, you had your 
              pig-heads cut off: Long has this been greater than the water in the four
               great oceans.</p>
              <p>"The blood you have shed when, arrested as thieves plundering 
              villages, you had your heads cut off... when, arrested as highway 
              thieves, you had your heads cut off... when, arrested as adulterers, you
               had your heads cut off: Long has this been greater than the water in 
              the four great oceans.</p>
              <p>"Why is that? From an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration. A
               beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and
               fettered by craving are transmigrating &amp; wandering on. Long have 
              you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, 
              swelling the cemeteries — enough to become disenchanted with all 
              fabrications, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released."</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in 
              the Blessed One's words. And while this explanation was being given, the
               minds of the thirty monks from Pava — through lack of clinging — were 
              released from fermentations.</p>

              <p>While Buddhism does not demand us to stop working (of course not) - only that our work is Right Livelihood, and that while we accumulate wealth for the present we should also prepare for our future, our death, our afterlife, and our liberation.</p>
              <p>But wherever we are, be contented.... even if we are poor, be contented... if we are rich, be contented... anything in between, be contented.... It doesn't mean stop working for a better future, it means rest your mind in the present.</p>

              <p>I checked http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_%28Buddhism%29 and it mentioned :</p>
              <p>"<span class="plainlinks">Enlightenment comes from within when you 
              start believing about the existence and try to conceptualize all the 
              signs given by the Almighty. This may be breaking the vicious cycle that
               you have been struck into from the past so many years. It is truly very
               difficult, almost impossible to do so. But unless and until you are not
               ready to loose yourself there is nothing that you will find as NEW in 
              your life or the next life."</span></p>

              <p>I wonder did you all read the Straits Times dated 22 January (Home page 11). There was this article about this man who was a Catholic, he took up meditation at Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery. He meditates for 90 minutes every day.</p>
              <p>He had rejected using many high technological devices like iPhone. He threw away amplifiers and he said the next to go is the laptop. He said he feels a lot happier since he simplifying his life and meditating.</p>
              <p>I pity those people who are old and yet do not bother to find out why they are in this world and where they will be going after they are gone. I don't know why I feel this way but I believe they should cherish whatever time they have to practice and relieve themselves from samsara than spending time going karaoke, mahjong, dancing etc. It is ok to do these when they are young but now  they are already old , don't have much time left to practice. If they don't practice now, there's no more chance for them. Sometimes I feel the urgency for them but I cannot understand why they don't feel the same.</p>

              Muse over this
               One cannot define awakening , one cannot define enlightement, liberation,god or ... one can define what is not .... and from that standpoint e'xplore and experience it onself. otherwise, one has already concluded and where does that conclusion arise from? The moment one concludes, one is no longer "'seeking''  one is reduced to a vested interest.
              Even when there is seeking, it is only to reaffirm what has already been concluded!

              <p>U got to see what it is that you want in life.  If you think that material stuff is more important, then you will not put effort/time into spiritual pursuit.  There are people who are willing to let go of everything for the sake of spiritual pursuit. of course in modern society, we need not let go of everything.  But it is possible to let go of ambitious plans, competitive comparing mind (ie peer pressure) and simplify life to have more time for spiritual practice.  </p>
              <p>People spend so much effort preparing for the next 20-50 years but spend so little effort preparing for an infinite time afterwards...  it is disproportionate.</p>

              <p>@fugazzi: if you think what i wrote is egoistic for whatever reasons pls consider this:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p> On the way not far from GayÃ¢ the Buddha was met by Upaka, an ascetic who, struck by the serene appearance of the Master, inquired: "Who is your teacher? Whose teaching do you profess?"
              
              The Buddha replied: "I have no teacher, one like me does not exist in all the world, for I am the Peerless Teacher, the Arahat. I alone am Supremely Enlightened. Quenching all defilements, NibbÃ¢naâ€™s calm have I attained. I go to the city of KÃ¢si (Benares) to set in motion the Wheel of Dhamma. In a world where blindness reigns, I shall beat the Deathless Drum."
              
              "Friend, you then claim you are a universal victor," said Upaka. The Buddha replied: "Those who have attained the cessation of defilements, they are, indeed, victors like me. All evil have I vanquished. Hence I am a victor."
              
              Upaka shook his head, remarking sarcastically, "It may be so, friend," and took a bypath.
