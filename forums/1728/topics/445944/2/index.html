              <p>it's only natural to see such diverse interpretations on the same subject (ie. old men sitting...) because that's the reality of how individuals interpret and give meaning to things.  we can only interpret and appreciate things from our respective (karmic) circumstances and nothing outside of it.  </p>
              <p>a person with more advanced spiritual practice may gain valuable realizations from a mundane observation like old men sitting around, whereas a person with no spiritual practice will have more mundane interpretations like poverty, health.. etc. neither is really more right or wrong because their respective (karmic) circumstances only enable them to interpret as such.  so you can say both are "right" because that's what they are able to interpret given their own circumstances.</p>
              <p>nature (or karma, ç¼˜.. etc) is not really interested in right or wrong, only what can be manifested (or perceived, interpreted by intellect.. etc) based on what the current (karmic) circumstances allows.  i guess that is why as enlightened as the Buddha is, he still has to "work within the system" and cannot simply "give" you enlightenment if your (karmic) circumstances does not allow it.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>@fugazzi: or it could mean I know and I am borrowing people's words cos they express it well. There is no problem with being conclusive as long as you don't get stuck in a purely intellectual endeavor but go and experience and realize what is being taught. To be in the know is better than to be confused.</div>

              When one is being conclusive there is no longer a seeking, , one is playing mind games - why do i say that? one is simply going to look for what has already been concluded as to what eg, is awakening about, existence is about ....  one is trying to be certain and box in ...  and  and as for being confused - the latter allows,one ... n in fact one is forced to explore and the knowing happens; even then one can never conclude - why? can one conclude about the intuitive heart, one conclude about existence .... an uncertainty.
              Mind survives on certainty, heart (soul or ....) does not need to be certain!

              In buddhism it is important that we establish right view, right understanding, right from the start of the path. Right view is the first factor of the noble eightfold path that leads to enlightenment.
              
              As Zen writer and speaker Ted Biringer says, â€œAccurate understanding is not authentic realization. At the same time, authentic realization can hardly be expected to occur without accurate understanding. And while an absence of â€œright understandingâ€� almost excludes the possibility of authentic realization, the presence of â€œwrong understandingâ€� excludes even the slimmest hope of success. If we aspire to realize what Zen practice-enlightenment truly is, then, as Dogen says, â€œWe should inquire into it, and we should experience it.â€� To follow his guidance here we will need to understand his view of what â€œitâ€� is that needs to be inquired into, and who the â€œweâ€� is that is to do the inquiring.â€�
              
              This means that even before we have personal experience of things such as karma, rebirth, enlightenment and so on, we have to accept by faith these doctrines.
              
              So for one who does not have personal experience of these matters, they should accept by faith the doctrines such as karma, rebirth, four noble truths, enlightenment, no-self, emptiness, three dharma seals, dependent origination and so on.
              
              Of course this does not mean the entire path consists only of faith. We should do our best to personally realize and experience everything the Buddha taught.
              
              In the Eastern Gatehouse sutra:
              
              SN 48.44 PTS: S v 220 CDB ii 1689
              Pubbakotthaka Sutta: Eastern Gatehouse
              translated from the Pali by
              Thanissaro Bhikkhu
              Â© 1997â€“2012
              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi, at the Eastern Gatehouse. There he addressed Ven. Sariputta: â€œSariputta, do you take it on conviction that the faculty of conviction, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation? Do you take it on conviction that the faculty of persistenceâ€¦ mindfulnessâ€¦ concentrationâ€¦ discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation?â€�
              
              â€œLord, itâ€™s not that I take it on conviction in the Blessed One that the faculty of convictionâ€¦ persistenceâ€¦ mindfulnessâ€¦ concentrationâ€¦ discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation. Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of convictionâ€¦ persistenceâ€¦ mindfulnessâ€¦ concentrationâ€¦ discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, &amp; attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of convictionâ€¦ persistenceâ€¦ mindfulnessâ€¦ concentrationâ€¦ discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation. And as for me, I have known, seen, penetrated, realized, &amp; attained it by means of discernment. I have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of convictionâ€¦ persistenceâ€¦ mindfulnessâ€¦ concentrationâ€¦ discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation.â€�
              
              â€œExcellent, Sariputta. Excellent. Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of convictionâ€¦ persistenceâ€¦ mindfulnessâ€¦ concentrationâ€¦ discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, &amp; attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of convictionâ€¦ persistenceâ€¦ mindfulnessâ€¦ concentrationâ€¦ discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation.â€�
