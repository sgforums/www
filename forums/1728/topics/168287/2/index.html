            <div class='col-md body'>This story reminds me of my master who had a rather similar story.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/learning.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/learning.htm</a><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is learning Buddhism and what is the study of Buddhism?</span><br><strong><br>Learning Buddhism and the study of Buddhism</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/voice-learn1.jpg"><br><br>Learning Buddhism and the study of Buddhism are two different things. There are many educated and knowledgeable people who treat Buddhist scriptures or sutras as subjects for research. This is call the study of Buddhism, and was especially popular after Buddhism spread from China to Japan. The Japanese people felt that they were scientifically advanced and incorporated science in their research and analysis on Buddhism. Thus, they produced many research works on Buddhist studies. However, by merely treating Buddhist principles as subjects for research, and in the absence of cultivation and self-realisation, it is not possible to attain enlightenment.<br><br>Shortly after I was ordained as Buddhist monk, I too liked to read books on Buddhism. I amassed a great number of books and papers in preparation to write my own books. However, I was admonished by my Master, the Venerable Dong Chu. He commented, "Shen-Kai, you seem to be researching on Buddhism." I replied, "ThatÂ’s right, Master. I wish to write books on Buddhism!" Master continued, <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"Do you know of any Buddha who attained the Supreme Enlightenment through research? Which patriarch became what they are through research? Come, put them aside."</span></strong> I wasnÂ’t quite sure what Master meant by his words and I asked, "What shall I do with these books then?" Master replied, "Wait till the day you establish your own mission, put them in the library and let others read them." I continued to query, "What shall I do now?" Master replied, "You should learn from the Buddha." I asked, "How do I learn from the Buddha?" This was his reply, "Whatever the Buddha does, that is what you learn." I began to understand that I should learn and practise what the Buddha taught.<br><br>Over the years I have written many books and I wrote them in the same manner as I speak. I write whatever comes to the mind. This is the difference between learning Buddhism and the study of Buddhism. But, I hope those who research on Buddhism would not forget to learn and practise Buddhism as well. Similarly, we who learn and practise Buddhism should also not forget to study Buddhism. If we excel in both areas, then we become good practitioners of Buddhism.</div>
