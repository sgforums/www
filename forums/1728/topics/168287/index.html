We should not create this kind of karmic affinities with the spirit realms. Certainly, we do not wish to be reborned in the spirit realm, which is one of the 3 lower realms.

Based on this, he could be reborned in either one of the 6 realm.  Pretty much like this.  So to your question, what do you think?</div>

In the case of spirits disturbing someone - it is a sign that the spirit is ATTACHED to the person. By continuing this attachment, both parties suffer. Not only will the spirit not be able to leave the realm, the 'human' person may risk falling into the spirit realm after life. Therefore you need to know the dharma and kindly ask the spirit not to be attached to the past.<br><br>Therefore the only ultimate solution to this is the LIBERATION of the spirit itself... from the attachments and from that realm itself. Which is why every 7th month, we dedicate the merits of offerings to the sangha and the ullabanadharma puja/ksitigarbha puja/etc to the spirits. Every 7th month you can go to a Buddhist monastery and dedicate merits to the deceased &amp; 'yuan qing zai zhu' &amp; any spirits that disturb you. In this way, spirits can be liberated from the spirit realm into the higher realms and be able to be reborn as a human again. If spirits disturb you again and again, you may need to find a Buddhist Venerable to seek advise and help from.<br><br>Many people misunderstood the purpose of Ullabanadharma - they call it the 'Ghost Festival', which is erroneous. Some people think Ghost Festival is a time where hell gates open and we have to burn paper money/hell notes so that the spirits will receive the material benefits. But in reality spirits do not use currency or be able to receive any material benefits from it all. Not only does this not work at all, even the idea of 'giving material things' to spirits is insufficient. In order to liberate spirits from their sufferings we must liberate them from the realm itself! I have posted a few times on this.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no1a.htm</a><br><br><strong>Ullambana Dharma - not Festival of Hungry Ghosts</strong><br>By Venerable Shen-Kai<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">According to a popular Chinese superstition, ghosts are released from hell in the 7th month of the Chinese calendar for a one-month break in the human world. In order to appease them, animals are slaughtered and offered to these 'hungry ghosts', together with other food. Big feasts and other festivities are held during this month and the most 'auspicious day' is the 15th day of the month. It is so widespread that this yearly affair is dubbed the Month or Festival of the Hungry Ghosts. What is this all about?</span><br><br>Among the chief disciples of the Buddha was one named Maudgalyayana. He had immense supernatural powers: Deva-foot ubiquity which made it possible for him to appear at any place at will, the divine sight of Deva-eye to have unlimited vision of all things, large and small, near and distant; Deva-ear to hear all sounds regardless of the distance. Furthermore, he had the ability to read and understand whatever was in a person's mind. He also had the ability to see clearly the events that occurred in a person's many past lives aeons ago. Thus, Maudgalyayana is considered to be a Maha-Bodhisattva who is foremost in supernatural powers.<br><br>One day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. Her throat was as small as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha and insulted the Sangha [1], had no respect for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, Maudgalyayana wept in pain.<br>Notes<br>1. 	Sangha<br>The corporate assembly of at least 3 monks; in general the term has come to mean a monk, or monks.<br>2. 	Bodhi<br>From budh; knowledge, understanding; perfect wisdom; the illuminated or enlightened mind.<br><br>The Buddha continued to console him, "It is impossible to rely solely on your own effort to save your mother from the realm of the hungry ghost. The only way is to use the combined merits of the Sangha. The 15th day of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because of the purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised cultivation, many attain the Bodhi [2]. The merits that they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha is most delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this time, you can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the suffering of the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) through their immense merits. If the parents are still living, then they shall be blessed with good health, happiness and a life of abundance. This is the truly marvellous method of giving salvation to the deceased." Maudgalyayana was delighted to hear this, and carried out the Buddha's advice accordingly. Thus, on the 15th of the 7th month after the offering to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the suffering of the realm of the hungry ghost.<br><br>To give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 'Ullambana' method. After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express our gratitude and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, the passage of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, so much so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to the Dharma. Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The original act of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for feasting and making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to invite the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.</blockquote></div>

It is meaningless to kill other living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to all forms of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the tradition of offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be changed, the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of meat with vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are not able to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we could invite them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the deceased. In this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.</blockquote></div>

Thats why if a person has a lot of craving and attachment at the time of death, there comes the danger! Unless one is confident that they are (due to his cultivation and practise) able not to be pulled under the influences of his karmic tendencies and mental factors into samsaric transmigration... then when death comes... one must one mindedly chant Namo Amitabha and rely on Amitabha's deliverance. Amitabha Sutra says those who had 'one mindedness without confusion' in Amitabha Buddha will attain deliverance. Otherwise even if Amitabha wants to lend a helping hand - the dying person may not receive it.. because he is too stuck on his attachments. I believe that is the main reason why not everyone who chants Amitabha may be borned in Pure Land. The state of 'one mindedness without confusion' means do not be attached to anything that has come to past - your spouse, your children, your properties, your relationships, etc etc... all things have come to past, you cannot bring them to your next life, therefore all must be let go of. Only one mindness in AMITABHA in the PRESENT..<br><br>Thats why my master says if possible - find a venerable to tell the dying person/dead person within 49 days to practise the dharma. Even people who know some dharma needs such 'reminders' at that crucial moment.<br><br>Therefore it is very important for us to start practising the dharma now. If we cannot practise the dharma now then at death time its 1000 times harder to do so. And some people think that death is 'liberation'... but if we cannot get liberated in life, there is no chance we can attain liberation in death.</div>

There will be a time - at the end of the Dharma Ending Age - Buddhism and its Sangha disappears from the face of Earth... until the next Buddha, Maitreya Buddha comes again.<br><br>Therefore we are very very fortunate because at this time the Buddha Sasanna still exists... therefore we are able to take refuge in the three treasures, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and be Buddha's disciple.<br><br>Nevertheless, True Law/True Dharma is eternal.<br><br><img src="http://www.bewithbuddha.org/img/sk_ever.gif"></div>

Based on this, he could be reborned in either one of the 6 realm.  Pretty much like this.  So to your question, what do you think?</blockquote>thus i heard from Master Jing Jie Fa Shi, that the next life is brought forward by the accumulation of karma not necessary just from the current life but can also be from our countless previous life.<br><br>that mean when we die that time, our mind recollect our past deeds. even consolidated karma from our previous previous lifes!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>this is how His initial ch'an teacher even though was well cultivated, the death appearance was not so good. while His later pureland teacher had a better death appearance. Why?  As recite one time Amitabha Buddha can Rid all grave offenses, accumulated in 8000 millions kalpas of rebirth cycle.<br><br><blockquote>the lowest level of the lowest grade<br>[30] The Buddha said to Ananda and Vaidehi, "Those who attain birth on the lowest level of the lowest grade are the sentient beings who commit such evils as the five gravest offenses, the ten evil acts and all kinds of immorality. Owing to such evil karma, the fool like this will fall into evil realms and suffer endless agony for many kalpas. When he is about to die, he may meet a good teacher, who consoles him in various ways, teaching him the wonderful Dharma and urging him to be mindful of the Buddha; but he is too tormented by pain to do so. The good teacher then advises him, 'If you cannot concentrate on the Buddha, then you should say instead, Homage to Amitayus Buddha.' In this way, he sincerely and continuously says 'Homage to Amitayus Buddha' [Na-mo-o-mi-t'o-fo] ten times. Because he calls the Buddha's Name, with each repetition, the evil karma which he has committed during<strong> eighty kotis of kalpas of Samsara </strong>is extinguished. When he comes to die, he sees before him a golden lotus-flower like the disk of the sun, and in an instant he is born within a lotus-bud in the Land of Utmost Bliss. After twelve great kalpas the lotus-bud opens. When the flower opens, Avalokiteshvara and Mahasthamaprapta teach him with voices of great compassion the method of extinguishing evil karma through the realization of Suchness of all dharmas. Hearing this, he rejoices and immediately awakens aspiration for Enlightenment. Such a person is called one who attains birth on the lowest level of the lowest grade. --- Contemplation Sutra</blockquote>/\<br><br></div>

His brother MahÃ¢panthaka grew impatient with him, and sent him away. The Buddha called him, gave him a piece of white cloth, and instructed him to handle it while reciting, Â“Removing impurities, removing impurities.Â” The monk did as instructed, realised the nature of mind and matter within himself, and became an arahant. It must have taken him two or three hours at the most.
