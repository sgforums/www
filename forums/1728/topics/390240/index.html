              <p><span style="font-size: small;">An object is seen by a hundred different people 
              like a hundred reflections in a hundred mirrors. But is it the same 
              object? As a first approximation, it’s the same object, but one that can
               be perceived in completely different ways by different beings. Only one
               who has attained enlightenment recognizes the object’s ultimate nature –
               that it appears, but is devoid of any intrinsic existence – as the 
              direct contemplation of absolute truth transcends any intellectual 
              concept, any duality between subject and object.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">Buddhism’s position is that of the ‘Middle Way: the world
               isn’t a projection of our minds, but it isn’t totally independent of 
              our minds, either – because it makes no sense to speak of a particular, 
              fixed reality independent of any concept, mental process, or observer. 
              Rather there is interdependence. In this manner, Buddhism avoids falling
               into either nihilism or eternalism. Phenomena arise through a process 
              of interdependent causes and conditions, but nothing exists in itself or
               by itself.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">Colors, sounds, smells, flavors, and textures aren’t 
              attributes that are inherent to the objective world, existing 
              independently of our senses. The objects we perceive seem completely 
              ‘external’ to us, but do they have intrinsic characteristics that define
               their true nature? What is the true nature of the world as it exists 
              independently of ourselves? We have no way of knowing, because our only 
              way of apprehending it is via our own mental process. So, according to 
              Buddhism, a ‘world’ independent of any conceptual designation would make
               no sense to anyone. To take an example, what is a white object? Is it a
               wavelength, a ‘color temperature’, and or moving particles? Are those 
              particles energy, mass, or what? None of those attributes are intrinsic 
              to the object, they’re only the result of our particular ways of 
              investigating it.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">Buddhist scriptures tell the story of two blind men who 
              wanted to have explained to them what colors were? One of them was told 
              that white was the color of snow. He took a handful of snow and 
              concluded that white was ‘cold’. The other blind man was told white was 
              the color of swans. He heard a swan flying overhead, and concluded that 
              white went ‘swish swish’... The complete and correct recollection of the
               story aside, the point being the world cannot be determined by itself. 
              If it was, we’d all perceive it in the same way.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">That’s not to deny reality as we observe it, nor to say 
              that there’s no reality outside the mind, but simply that no ‘reality in
               itself’ exists. Phenomena only exist in dependence on other phenomena.</span></p>

              <div style="font-style: italic;">Rizenfenix,<br> <br> It makes little difference if there is a world out there, or if there is
               not a world out there, because we don't live in the world. We live 
              almost exclusively in our minds, and what can be imagined. This is why 
              our world is called an illusion. <br> <br> We are constantly manufacturing what we think we know, out of mere 
              fragments of sense data. We are dreaming. And just like our nightly 
              dreams, these daily dreams are only temporary. Like clouds in the sky.<br> <br> Get any 2 men in a room, ask them what they see and know, and you will 
              always have 3 opinions. <br> <br> ; ^ ) <br> <br> Every thing we think that we know, about any thing in this world, must 
              first pass through the filters of our mind (senses) and be translated 
              into know-ability with little agreement and no final answers. <br> <br> The Truth or Reality lies deeper than the surface movie that seems to be
               playing before our eyes.<br> <br> S9</div>

              <div id="post_message_83681"><span style="font-size: small;">If anything, metaphysics is quite fascinating and a
               pleasurable topic of cordial discourse and personal contemplation… As 
              such, let us consider the term ‘illusion’, as it relates to the original
               question of this thread, the ‘Middle Way’, and the favor of your 
              splendid insight, comments and points of view.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">For those of us living in that illusion, the world seems 
              as real as it possibly could be. But just as ice is only solidified 
              water, the solidity we ascribe to the world isn’t its ultimate reality. 
              This illusionary nature of the world doesn’t stop the laws of cause and 
              effect being inescapable. Physicists would say that electrons aren’t 
              tiny cannonballs but concentrations of energy. Such a statement doesn’t 
              even slightly lessen the need to develop medicine, to allay suffering 
              and to solve all the problems of everyday life. Even if the self is only
               an imposture, and even if the external world isn’t made up of entities 
              endowed with true existence, it’s perfectly legitimate to remedy 
              suffering by all available means and to do whatever can be done to 
              increase the well-being of all. In the same way, a scientist who 
              understands that we’re only made of particles that can be reduced to 
              just energy won’t thereby be rendered indifferent to happiness and 
              suffering. </span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">Buddhist practice involves three complementary aspects – 
              view, meditation and action. The ‘view’ is what corresponds to the 
              metaphysical perspective, investigation of the ultimate nature of 
              things, of the phenomenal world and of the mind. Once this view has been
               established, ‘meditation’ consists of familiarizing oneself 
              (distinctively) with that view and integrating it through spiritual 
              practice into the stream of consciousness, in such a way that the view 
              becomes second nature (post-meditation). ‘Action’ is the expression in 
              the outer world of the inner knowledge acquired through ‘view’ and 
              ‘meditation’. It is a matter of applying and maintaining that knowledge 
              in all circumstances. This is the phase in which ethics, or morals, 
              enters into things. Ethics doesn’t become invalid when you realize the 
              illusionary nature of the world. Someone whose eyes of wisdom are open 
              sees even more clearly and finely the mechanisms of cause and effect, 
              and knows what should be undertaken and what should be avoided in order 
              to continue making progress on the path and bringing happiness to 
              others. Again, the ‘Middle Way’ isn’t exclusionary, but inclusionary.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">The goal isn’t to deny that there’s any such thing as the
               phenomenal world as we perceive it – what Buddhism calls relative truth
               – but to show that the world isn’t as real as we think. In fact, coming
               into existence seems impossible, because, once again, being can’t arise
               from nothingness, and if it already exists it doesn’t need to arise. At
               the same time, it doesn’t ‘cease’, because it’s never come into 
              existence. This is what leads Buddhism to say the world is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>like</em></span> a dream or an illusion. It doesn’t say the world <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>is</em></span> a 
              dream or an illusion, because that would be falling into nihilism. As 
              such and according to this ‘Middle Way’, appearances are emptiness, and 
              from emptiness arise appearances.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">As an alternate view, certain Hindu philosophers opposed 
              Buddhism with the premise that if everything’s like a dream, if your 
              suffering is like a dream, what’s the use of trying to attain 
              enlightenment? The reply is this. Since beings do undergo the experience
               of suffering, it’s right to dissipate it, even if it’s an illusory. If 
              not (exponentially), then what’s the use of taking any action, as we’re 
              just a bunch of cells directed by a bunch of neurons? What’s the use of 
              taking any action, as we’re made up of atoms and particles that ‘are not
               things’ and which, in any case, are not ‘us’?</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">Why, because it is Bodhicaryavatara, the Middle Way, the 
              right view leading to the right meditation leading to the right action.</span></div>

              <p>....................</p>
              <p><strong>On rebirth:</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://newbuddhist.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4215">http://newbuddhist.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4215</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Continuing consciousness after death is, in most 
              religions, a matter of revealed truth. In Buddhism, the evidence comes 
              from the contemplative experience of people who are certainly not 
              ordinary but who are sufficiently numerous that what they say about it 
              is worth taking seriously into account. Indeed, such testimonies begin 
              with those of the Buddha himself.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">Nevertheless, it’s important to understand that what’s 
              called reincarnation in Buddhism has nothing to do with the 
              transmigration of some ‘entity’ or other. It’s not a process of 
              metempsychosis because there is no ‘soul’. As long as one thinks in 
              terms of entities rather than function and continuity, it’s impossible 
              to understand the Buddhist concept of rebirth. As it’s said, ‘There is 
              no thread passing through the beads of the necklace of rebirths.’ Over 
              successive rebirths, what is maintained is not the identity of a 
              ‘person’, but the conditioning of a stream of consciousness.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">Additionally, Buddhism speaks of successive states of 
              existence; in other words, everything isn’t limited to just one 
              lifetime. We’ve experienced other states of existence before our birth 
              in this lifetime, and we’ll experience others after death. This, of 
              course, leads to a fundamental question: is there a nonmaterial 
              consciousness distinct from the body? It would be virtually impossible 
              to talk about reincarnation without first examining the relationship 
              between body and mind. Moreover, since Buddhism denies the existence of 
              any self that could be seen as a separate entity capable of 
              transmigrating from one existence to another by passing from one body to
               another, one might well wonder what it could be that links those 
              successive states of existence together.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">One could possibly understand it better by considering it
               as a continuum, a stream of consciousness that continues to flow 
              without there being any fixed or autonomous entity running through it… 
              Rather it could be likened to a river without a boat, or to a lamp flame
               that lights a second lamp, which in-turn lights a third lamp, and so on
               and so forth; the flame at the end of the process is neither the same 
              flame as at the outset, nor a completely different one…</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">This is most excellent and peculiar.

              <p>when i was at Bras Basah Complex , i saw this video store tv talking about iching and there was one interesting idea. He said a flower bloom and die, is consider goodå�‰ or badå‡¶? an animal in the wild live or die is consider good å�‰ or bad å‡¶. Only human having got attachment put a label to this "good" å�‰ and "bad" å‡¶.</p>
              <p>If a person die is your next of kin or u have a "relationship" with him/her, one will think it's "bad" å‡¶. Or something u cling to dearly is missing, u would label it "bad" å‡¶.</p>
              <p>And this is so also for  "goodness" å�‰, as human have attachment. but nature will keep on being 'natural'. a flower bloom and die don't have goodå�‰ or badå‡¶ .  an animal in the wild live or die don't have goodå�‰ or badå‡¶ per se.</p>
