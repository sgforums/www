            <div class='col-md body'>I think Bohiruci used to say recently that he would very much like to look into the teachings of Buddha Nature or Tathagathagarbha and has yet to learn more about it.<br><br>I was going through the pages at <a href="http://www.empty-universe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.empty-universe.com/</a>, reading something on Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) and Vipassana, and then realised how huge a resource website it is.. it contains lots of valuable Buddhist resources from all sections --  from Theravada to Prajnaparamita to Yogacara to Tathagathagarbha to Vajrayana Sadhana.<br><br>And I think I just found something valuable for Bohiruci and all readers regarding the topic on Buddha Nature and I think the commentary by Thrangu Rinpoche is well written. It is the Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra, spoken by Maitreya Bodhisattva.<br><br>Please read: <a href="http://www.empty-universe.com/tathagatagarbha/uttaratantra_thrangu.pdf" rel="nofollow">Buddha-nature with commentary by Thrangu Rinpoche</a><br><br>Excerpts:<br><br><strong>What is Buddha Nature?</strong><br><br>27. The buddha essence is always present in everyone<br>because the dharmakaya of perfect Buddhahood pervades<br>everything,<br>this suchness is undifferentiated and they have the potential.<br><br>28. It is said that all beings possess the essence of Buddhahood<br>since the buddha jnana has always been present in them,<br>also because the immaculate nature is non-dual<br>and the buddha potential is named after its fruition.<br><br>-------<br><br>40. If there were no Buddha-nature<br>there would be no discontent with suffering<br>nor desire, effort, and aspiration for nirvana.-<br><br>41. Perception of suffering, samsaraÂ’s fault,<br>and happiness, nirvanaÂ’s quality, is due to the potentialÂ’s<br>presence.<br>Why should this be?<br>Without such potential it will not be present.<br><br>-------<br><br>49. Just as space, concept free by nature is all-embracing<br>so also is the immaculate space,<br>then nature of mind, all-pervading.<br><br>50. This, the general characteristic of all,<br>permeates the good, the bad, and the ultimate,<br>like space permeates all forms<br>whether lesser, mediocre, or perfect.<br><br>51. Since the faults are but accidental,<br>whereas its qualities are part of its very character,<br>it is the changeless reality, the same after as it was before.<br><br>52. Just as space pervades all but remains absolutely<br>unaffected; because of its extreme subtlety, similarly this,<br>present in all beings, remains absolutely taint-free.<br><br>53. Just as universes always arise<br>and disintegrate in space,<br>so also do the sense arise<br>and disintegrate in the uncreated space.<br><br>54. Just as space has never been consumed by fire,<br>likewise this is never consumed<br>by death, sickness, and ageingÂ’s fires.<br><br>55. Earth is supported by water, water by air, air by space.<br>But space is supported neither by air, water, nor earth.<br><br>56. In a similar way the aggregates, the elements, and the senses<br>are based upon karma and defilements.<br>Karma and the defilements are always based<br>upon the mode of thought which is wrong.<br><br>57. This improper mode of thought has<br>its basis in the mindÂ’s purity<br>whereas the true nature of mind<br>has no basis in any of the many phenomena.<br><br>58. The aggregates, entrances, and elements<br>should be known as being similar to earth.<br>The karma and defilements of beings<br>are to be known as similar to water.<br><br>59. The improper mode of thought is similar to air<br>whereas the true nature is like the element of spaceÂ—<br>it has no base and no abiding.<br><br>60. The improper mode of thought abides<br>within the true nature of mind.<br>This improper mode of thought gives rise<br>to karma and the defilements.<br><br>61. From karma and defilementsÂ’ waters arise the aggregates, entrances, and elements,<br>arising and disintegrating just as<br>everything begins and has an end.<br><br>62. The nature of mind is like the element of space;<br>it has neither causes, nor conditions, nor these in<br>combination,<br>nor any arising, destruction, or abiding.<br><br>63. This true nature of mindÂ—clarityÂ—is like space,<br>unchanging, not becoming defiled by desire and so on,<br>passing impurities which from improper thinking spring.<br><br>64. It is not produced by the waters<br>of karma, defilements, and so forth<br>nor will it be burnt by the cruel fires<br>of ageing, sickness and death.<br><br>----------------<br><br>79. Because it has inexhaustible qualities,<br>its nature is not to alter.<br>It is the refuge of beings<br>because it has no limits in the future, right to the very end.<br>It is always non-dual<br>because it is non-conceptual.<br>It is also of indestructible character<br>because, by nature, it is uncreated.<br><br>80. This has no birth because it is permanent,<br>no death because it is eternal,<br>no harm because it is peace, and<br>no aging because it is unchanging.<br><br>81. It has no birth in a mental form<br>because it is permanent.<br>It has not death<br>through inconceivable death and transmigration,<br>because it is eternal.<br><br>82. It is unharmed by the disease<br>of the finer karmic imprint because is peace.<br>It has no aging produced by untainted karma<br>because it is immutable.<br><br>83. This uncreated space has the attributes<br>of permanence and so forth<br>which should be known respectively through the first pair of<br>verses<br>and likewise the next pair and the next pair to the last.<br><br>84.6 Â“Being endowed with inexhaustible qualities<br>it has the attribute of permanence, the quality of not altering.<br>Because it equals the furthest end<br>its attribute is eternal, the nature of a refuge.<br>Because its very character is not to conceptualize,<br>it has the attribute of peace, the non-dual true nature.<br>As its qualities are not things fabricated,<br>its attribute is immutability, the changeless nature.<br>It is the dharmakaya. It is the tathagata.<br>It is the highest truth. It is the ultimately-true nirvana.<br>Like the sun and its rays, these aspects are inseparable;<br>so there is no nirvana apart from Buddhahood itself.<br><br>---------------<br><br>158. The ultimate true nature is always<br>devoid of anything compounded:<br>so it is said that defilements, karma,<br>and their full ripening are like a cloud, etc.<br><br>159. The defilements are said to be like clouds,<br>karma is likened to the experience in dreams<br>and the full ripening of karma and the defilementsÂ—<br>the aggregatesÂ—are likened to conjurations.<br><br>(The above are related to the second turning)<br><br>160. Previously was it thus presented,<br>then, further to this, the presence of Buddha-nature<br>was taught ultimately in the Â“changeless continuityÂ” as<br>here,9<br>so that these five faults could be abandoned.<br><br>(This is the third turning)<br></div>
