              <div>I shall use the sense of sight and conceptual thinking,</div>

              <div>these two and assume it is one flow of thought. Sort of </div>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>Thoughts can be classified as collected or scattered, collected </div>
              <div>usually means our concentration is focused or the ability to </div>
              <div>comprehend and follow sequence and shift of events.</div>
              <div>Scattered thoughts usually means the inability to assemble</div>
              <div>rational thoughts or systematical of dealing with issues at </div>
              <div>hand. </div>
              <div>Our consciousness also have and agitative and dull states.</div>
              <div>And exaggerated example would be akin drinking to much</div>

              <div>is certain deja vu kind of feeling, somehow really not down to earth.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Then, there is another perception during sitting in which  awareness</div>
              <div>of outer phenomena is a collective of central, peripheral and</div>
              <div>auditory and tactile sensation.  Thoughts arises and but seems</div>
              <div>rather minor and inconsequential as one falls and another arises.</div>
              <div>The expansiveness and brilliancy of the collective perception</div>
              <div>makes normal sensation seem dull and heavy.</div>
              <div>Absence of emotion is silencing and clear, like been in a noisy</div>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>Now back normal day to day practice, just "being", is being</div>
              <div>bringing your state of consciousness to being centered on </div>
              <div>the see saw,being aware but not indulging in either. Not</div>
              <div>indulging means having a light touch, not reacting strongly</div>
              <div>or jerky, not getting overly personal. When negative emotions</div>
              <div>arises, the sensing of quickening the tensing of jaw muscles,</div>
              <div>and tightening of chest,  bringing attention to anger, </div>
              <div>acknowledging and then that too will pass.</div>

              <div>The more  we "work" at it , the more easily we can return to</div>

              <div>each time we go back to this equilibrium, we start afresh,</div>
              <div>it ok when let go of our "stories", we start at square one and</div>

              <div>Yes. Good insight. Not only is there no one flow of thoughts... There is no continuous movement of things... there is nothing constant or substantial at all to our experience. Walking from here to there, there is in fact no here and there much less a person moving from here to there, there is only this, then this, then this... but there is no The Here either. The sense of there being The Here or The Now is another illusion. Here, now, thought, sight, etc, all ungraspable, dream-like, bubble like. Then it is realized and experienced that there is no continuous flow of thought, only bubbles manifesting and popping (self-liberating) moment by moment tracelessly. There is nothing truly there! Truly groundless, truly traceless, truly free.<br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Through contemplation, after the initial insight of anatta, there can be a further insight where we discover that all phenomena are disjoint, unsupported, and self-liberating, and arising without an agent. Just this one thought, one sound.... completely distinct from a previous moment of thought, yet interdependently originated as a process.</div>

If everything is luminous and the sense of self is in abeyance, then what you are describing is a temporary experience of anatta but not the realization of anatta. This is also known as a PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) in the terminology of Actualism.

              <p>Because a perceived movement in time arises when you are comparing and contrasting, it arises when you separate yourself from this moment of experience. If you are 'in the moment' so to speak, you do not perceive time.</p>

              <p>Huh.. so is there a sense of self or not?</p>
              <p>Anyway here is something by Thusness that may be of relevance here (and as suggested here, mindfulness must complement with right view otherwise the insight into non-dual and anatta will not arise):</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Hi Kim123,<br><br> Just to add a lil, see whether it makes sense to you.</em></p>
              <p><em>As a start it is almost not possible not to feel
                                          dualistic.  An observer observing the observed is our ordinary
                                          experience and it will appear that this is an experiential
                                          fact.  Therefore we should not rush into anything but just
                                          simply recognize the ‘cause’.  The cause that made us see in
                                          such a way is termed ‘ignorance’.  Try to understand
                                          ‘ignorance’ not as not knowing but a form of knowing instead. 
                                          See it as a very deep form of ‘dualistic knowing’ that we have
                                          taken it to be truth.  We then proceed to overcome this wrong
                                          view in 2 steps; one by strongly and firmly establishing the right
                                          view to replace our existing ‘dualistic and inherent view’ and
                                          second, practice seeing in bare attention to lessen the grip of
                                          views. Practice being bare in bodily sensation till there is a very
                                          strong clear mirror feeling in bodily sensation.  Then with
                                          the right view, non-dual will dawn.  Without the right view,
                                          it will most likely turn into a mirror reflecting phenomena
                                          experience.</em></p>
              <p><em>Practices can take decades and often quite frustrating and
                                          challenging during the journey.  But have faith, be patient
                                          and have confidence, all effort will proof worthwhile
                                          eventually.</em></p>
              <p><em>A simple summary I use to help my practice:-<br><br> When there is simply a pure sense of existence;<br> When awareness appears mirror like;<br> When sensations become pristine clear and bright;<br> This is luminosity.<br><br> When all arising appear disconnected;<br> When appearance springs without a center;<br> When phenomena appears to be on their own without controller;<br> This is no doer-ship.<br><br> When subject/object division is seen as illusion;<br> When there is clarity that no one is behind thoughts;<br> When there is only scenery, sounds, thoughts and so forth;<br> This is anatta.<br><br> When phenomena appears pristinely crystal;<br> When there is merely one seamless experience;<br> When all is seen as Presence;<br> This is non-dual Presence.<br><br> When we feel fully the unfindability and unlocatability of
                                          phenomena;<br> When all experiences are seen as ungraspable;<br> When all mind boundaries of in/out, there/here, now/then
                                          dissolve;<br> This is Emptiness.<br><br> When interconnectedness of everything is wholly felt;<br> When arising appears great, effortless and wonderful;<br> When presence feels universe;<br> This is Maha.<br><br> When arising is not caged in who, where and when;<br> When all phenomena appear spontaneous and effortless;<br> When everything appears right every where, every when;<br> This is spontaneous perfection.<br>  <br> Seeing these as the ground of all experiences;<br> always and already so;<br> This is wisdom.<br><br> Experiencing the ground in whatever arises;<br> This is practice.<br><br> Happy journey. :)</em></p>
