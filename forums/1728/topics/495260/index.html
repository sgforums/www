              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Penang State in Malaysia is probably the most religiously
              diverse place I have ever visited. Walking around George Town, the capital city
              of Penang, I was completely enchanted by the density of different religious
              architectures. In the morning, Hindu deities at Sri Mahamariamman Temple are awakened
              in a puja ritual. Throughout the day, the sound of adhan, the call to prayer,
              can be heard from the minaret of Kapitan Keling Mosque. By the afternoon, I am
              overlooking the grand sea view from Kek Lok Si (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">æ¥µæ¨‚å¯º</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">) on
              Penang Hill—the largest Buddhist temple in Malaysia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As early as the beginning of the Common Era, Buddhism was
              introduced to the Malay Archipelago through Indian influence. However, Chinese
              Buddhism did not arrive until the second half of the 17th century, well after
              Islam had become the majority faith. When Chinese immigrants, mainly from
              Fujian and Guangdong provinces in southeast China, came looking for work and
              business opportunities, they also brought their beliefs and practices. The
              temple of Kong Hock Keong (Guang Fu Gong, </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">å»£ç¦�å®®</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">) in central
              George Town is a telling example. The name “Guang” refers to immigrants from
              Guangdong, while “Fu” refers to those from Fujian as the temple was funded by
              454 individuals and companies from the two Chinese communities. Since its
              construction in 1800, Kong Hock Keong has been one of the most important places
              in Penang for worshippers of Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, which is
              why the temple is better known as Kuan Yin Teng (Guanyin Ting, </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">è§€éŸ³äº­</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To me, this temple reflects several characteristics of
              Chinese Buddhism in Penang. First, it is a mixture of Buddhist, Daoist, and
              folk beliefs popular in southeast China. In the main hall, Mazu, a tutelary
              goddess of seafarers, is worshipped alongside Guanyin. Another hall houses a
              miscellaneous collection of statues, such as Guan Yu (god of martial arts),
              Wenchang Gong (god of culture), Zhusheng Niangniang (goddess of fertility), the
              Jade Emperor, the bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, and even Confucius. This is directly
              related to the second characteristic—orthodoxy is of secondary importance in
              the Chinese Buddhist community here. Indeed, many temples around Penang are run
              by lay Buddhists. As immigrants and an ethnic minority, their primary concern
              is to survive, and rites that grant protection have been given much more
              emphasis than scriptural texts. Third, Buddhist temples bind together Chinese
              originally from different regions in China. Chinese of the same locale and
              dialect group often build guildhalls, called Huiguan (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">æœƒé¤¨</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">), where
              they organize affairs among themselves. However, when a conflict occurs between
              groups of different origins, Buddhist temples provide a neutral place where
              good will and sacred witness are present. Up to this day, Kong Hock Keong has
              been managed by representatives of Guangdong and Fujian origins.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">However, these factors are merely what was obvious to me as a
              tourist. To look beneath the surface, I reached out to the Malaysian Buddhist
              Association (MBA) located on 182 Burmah Road in Penang, where I was fortunate
              to have the opportunity to talk with Loo Keat Seng, the associate secretary.
              The MBA was founded in 1959. Its headquarters in Penang was constructed in
              1971, composed of a Buddha Hall, offices, libraries, a kindergarten, and a free
              clinic. Loo explained to me that the MBA serves as a bridge between Buddhist
              temples, organizations, individuals, and the Malaysian government. While the
              government does not interfere with Buddhist activities, the association helps
              to ensure their religious needs are understood and fulfilled in this Muslim
              country. For instance, Vesak, a most important festival for Buddhists of all
              traditions as it commemorates the birth of the Buddha, was made a public
              holiday in Malaysia through the efforts of the MBA. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">According to Loo, more than 20 per cent of Malaysia’s
              population are of Chinese descent, totaling around 6 million people. About 30
              per cent of Malaysian Chinese identify as Christians, while the rest identify
              as Buddhists and Daoists, with a very small number of Muslims and other
              religious affiliations. However, Loo observed, the number of Buddhists who have
              formally taken refuge in the Three Jewels is much lower. The MBA has around
              30,000 registered members. In terms of monastic sangha, a 2016 survey showed
              that there were 562 bhikkhunis and 372 bhikkhus in the Chinese Buddhist
              community. Loo added that since he first became interested in Buddhism decades
              ago, the number of female monastics has always surpassed that of male
              monastics. They receive full ordination either at the aforementioned Kek Lok Si,
              or in monasteries in Taiwan or Hong Kong.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We have talked about the fact that Chinese Buddhism was first
              brought to what is now Malaysia and Singapore by immigrants from Guangdong and
              Fujian provinces. However, after they had settled and achieved great business
              success, Buddhists monks from the same regions followed, seeking to raise funds
              to build monasteries in their hometowns. Some of these monks returned to China,
              while others remained. Their role also shifted from merely performing rites to
              teaching the Dharma to local residents. For instance, Ven. Miaolian (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">å¦™è“®</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">, 1824–1907), a highly respected Chan master from Fujian, was
              persuaded by his followers in Penang to stay during his visit. He would later
              found Kek Lok Si. Master Zhumo (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">ç«ºæ‘©</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">, 1913–83), widely considered the
              “father of Chinese Buddhism in Malaysia,” was from Zhejiang Province. He
              established the Triple Wisdom Hall in 1965 as a major teaching center for
              Chinese Buddhism. The accounts of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis who have contributed
              to the development of Chinese Buddhism in Malaysia and Singapore are collected
              in a four-volume publication The Records of Chinese Buddhist Missionaries to
              the South (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">å�—é�Šé›²æ°´æƒ…</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">), edited by Ven. Kai Ti (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">å¼€</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei",sans-serif; ' lang="EN-US">è°›</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">).*</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What is exciting about Chinese Buddhism in Malaysia is that
              it is still evolving. The monastic sangha is growing, albeit slowly, and
              interest in Buddhism has become more and more serious over the years. In 1969,
              the Malaysian Buddhist Institute was founded under the auspices of the MBA,
              providing a program of study that takes 4–5 years to complete. Students are
              required to learn traditional Chinese calligraphy and ink painting, as well as
              the Dharma. Today, the institute has a student body of 200, consisting of both
              monastics and lay Buddhists, some of whom go on to further studies in other
              Buddhist countries, such as Sri Lanka. Other established orders have also set
              up centers in Penang, such as Dharma Drum Mountain and Fo Guang Shan from
              Taiwan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Nevertheless, this does not mean there are no challenges to
              Buddhism in Malaysia. Indeed, some might say there are simply too many
              religious groups in Malaysia. Loo himself was recently elected chairman of the
              Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism,
              and Taoism (MCCBCHST). In the Buddhist community, one finds the Theravada
              Buddhist Association, the Tibetan Buddhist Association, the Young Buddhist
              Association of Malaysia, and a myriad of smaller groups. Although the
              phenomenon itself is positive, such division has potential issues. Management
              may not always be efficient and unity can sometimes be overshadowed by
              different voices. Since all Buddhists follow the teachings of the Buddha, Loo
              believes that they could better help Buddhists and contribute to Malaysian
              society by joining hands. In the years to come, he looks forward to more
              exchange and greater mutual support among the different Buddhist groups.</span></p>
