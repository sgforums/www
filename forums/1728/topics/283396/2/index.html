For example, sleeping, walking, breathing, eating, handicraft and so forth in themselves have no moral consequence. Similarly, unintentional action is ineffective karma. In other words, if one accidentally steps on an insect, being unconscious of its existence, this also constitutes neutral karma because there is no intention - the intentional element is not there.</strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong><br><br>I have no idea what you are talking about.<br><br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/fundbud9.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/fundbud9.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Besides the two varieties of karma, wholesome and unwholesome karma, we should mention neutral or ineffective karma. [b]Neutral karma is karma that has no moral consequence either because the very nature of the action is such as to have no moral consequence or because it is done involuntarily and unintentionally. For example, sleeping, walking, breathing, eating, handicraft and so forth in themselves have no moral consequence. Similarly, unintentional action is ineffective karma. In other words, if one accidentally steps on an insect, being unconscious of its existence, this also constitutes neutral karma because there is no intention - the intentional element is not there.</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>As I said earlier neutral karma still exist but it has no moral consequence. For example, the breathing of an arhant may cause a typhoon that killed millions but yet it is still neutral karma.</div>
