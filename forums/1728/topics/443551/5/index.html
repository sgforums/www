              Muse over this - A pickpocket was trailing a gem merchant and wanted very much to get hold of this gem â€“ he tried all means and ways and to no avail and in spite of that was still trying; all this time the merchant knew what he was up to and allowed the thief to be and when an opportunity rose he dropped the precious gem into the pocket of the thief. After a lapse of some moments, the pickpocket out frustration blurted out to the merchant that he was a professional in pickpocketing and queried as to where is the gem as it could not even find it in the merchant's [person]! 
              To that the merchant replied â€“ I put it where u would least look for it â€“ in your pocket! This allegory illustrates the predicament of searching in the â€™â€™wrongâ€™â€™ places and hoping to find â€¦.
              
              Eg :When I practice a particular â€¦. thinking that I am a particular â€¦. looking for a particular â€¦ eg merits or to arrive someday somewhere I m merely spinning on my fictional â€™â€™selfâ€™â€™ â€“ I am playing mind games. As long as one has an image of what God, Buddha or englightenment, awakening or it is already a concept and when it is premised on a concept one is simply going to be like a squirrel in a cage!
              
              PS â€“ Self in quotes cos most of us assume that what we think is what we are. reality is it is not. I can hold a book and think that I am reading it. It is only a reality when the actual reading is transpiring. Many live in the mind when all in that is close,obvious n in front is missed.My standing in a church, temple cannot be construed as being holy. It can only be when I am being kind, being â€¦.
              
              PS - Buddha, Jesus, Mohd, Krishna n ... were all spiriutal beings and in being ..... (eg , being compassionate, being ....????) were sharing their being(s). Of course, it presupposed that the one who passes him'her by is open and attuned to his/her own being. As long as the sense of self predominates one's mind - one is going to miss. When one is present to one's being ..... one is absent to one's self 
              As long as one is mired in concepts, even beleifs (eg theist, atheist) one is still caught up in the game fo being divisive and the human mind is bound to rationalize and defend one's position.
              
              Enlightement/awakening or whatever one labels it has always been and always will be this lah - no adding is needed, not minusing is needed. In the acceptance of what one is not - one is all-embracing of what is and that is freeing. 
                The wise one partakes of the world but the moment the roles are fulfilled does not bring it home. Home is the source of one's being and a sythnesis of inner and outer ( in actuality, no such thing but cos of constraints of language).
              The long ing for all humanity is the longing to be free and even to use the ''self'' (even rejecting it) is merely a mental exercise. 
              
              The irony of it is Jesus never uttered he was Christian. Buddha never did about Buddhism and nor did Mohd about Islam. 
              
              Perhaps ''modern'' man has confused spirituality and religion. The essential is always spiritual and the accidental is always religion. Relgion is temporal and a reaction to ... (cos of beleifs, traditions ... which is acquired from or accepted from someone esle/book or ...) and spirituality is that which is eternal, existential and herenow. The form resonates with the masses cos it has the element of certainty! The latter cannot be be made certain and uncertainty is something the human mind cannot accept or reconcile to.
              
              As long as there is no synthesis of the essential and the accidental one is doomed and however or whichever way one may try it is probably going to split one on the inside

                                  Hey there reasonable.atheist, thanks for the hard questions.
                  It's always good to have people around that'll make you look at
                  your own beliefs. I've never studied the history of science, nor
                  actually took the time to seriously know how science "works" and
                  its goals (beyond what I *think* its goals and purposes are), and
                  my understanding of buddhism is not quite there yet to begin
                  lecturing people about my choice of religion, but I feel compelled
                  to post here about my own beliefs of the two. So just bear with me
                  here<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> .</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>What I believe, is that the purpose of science is simply to
                  understand our surroundings in a way that if we were to be able to
                  reproduce the results in a controlled environment (e.g. a lab), the
                  results will always be the same every single time. So when the
                  results aren't consistent, we keep looking and looking until we
                  find a way that works.</p>
              <p>Sometimes though, what we arrive at to be true or false is
                  simply due to the limits that we test them at. For example, Louis
                  Pasteur's experiments with boiling water that proved that
                  pasturization would work to kill off all microbes succeeded partly
                  because he got lucky; now after more experiments we have found that
                  some microbes do survive above 100c . </p>
              <p>This is the beauty of science of course, that if something that
                  was previously accepted to be true is now found out to be false, we
                  willingly throw away our old beliefs and embrace the new result(s).
                  It is interesting that some monks (Ajahn Brahm, Dalai Lama) have
                  said that Buddhism works similarly, that what was found to be true
                  should be embraced instead of scriptural authority.</p>
              <p>So in that case, why haven't these monks defrocked since certain
                  aspects of buddhism could not be proven to be true under science? I
                  can't speak for them of course, but faith in the teachings, and the
                  fact that the teachings of the Buddha worked for them probably has
                  quite a lot to do with this. After all, science is always moving
                  towards truth, and what is found to be true/untrue is only so
                  <strong><em>for now</em></strong>, until new findings overturn or
                  reinforce them.</p>
              <p>For me personally, there are certain parts of Buddhism that I do
                  not totally accept yet, and I will not elaborate here for fear of
                  bad karma (heh heh!). However, I am not particularly smart, nor
                  perceptive. Those aspects of buddhism that I'm skeptical about, I
                  just treat as I'm unable to understand them for now. I'm confident
                  that if I strive hard enough, I'll get to the point that I can see
                  for myself whether they true... or not. Not sure if this has been
                  posted, nor if it's relevant to you, but do have a read about the
                  parable of the poison arrow: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_arrow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_arrow</a> .</p>
              <p>In fact for science, I have the absolute confidence that given
                  enough time everything can be found out to be true or false for
                  sure. Who knows, the scientific formula for karma could be
                  discovered 10,000 years from now, and you'll need to plug in 84,000
                  variables for it to work perfectly. But I am naive like
                  that. </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, whoever approaches religion should do so
                  with healthy amounts of faith and the willingness to continually
                  test the teachings. I believe that after a while at it, if you ask
                  yourself if you're a happier, better person and the answer is
                  positive, then there's no problem at all. Unhappy (religionists of
                  your choice)/atheist/deists/humanists exist, so if whatever you
                  believe in doesn't work after rigorous testing, move on and find
                  something else that does.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your reply. Here's an excerpt from Carl Sagan's book, where he recounts:</p>
              <p>----------------</p>
              <p><em>"In theological discussion with religious leaders, I often ask what 
                  their response would be if a central tenet of their faith were disproved
                   by science. When I put this question to the current Fourteenth Dalai 
                  Lama, he unhesitatingly replied as no conservative of fundamentalist 
                  religious leaders do: In such a case, he said, Tibetan Buddhism would 
                  have to change.<br><br>Even, I asked, if it's a really central tenet, like (I searched for an example) reincarnation?<br><br>Even then, he answered.<br><br>However-- he added with a twinkle--it's going to be hard to disprove reincarnation.<br><br>Plainly,
                   the Dalai Lama is right. Religious doctrine that is insulated from 
                  disproof has little reason to worry about the advance of science. The 
                  grand idea, common to many faiths, of a Creator of the Universe is one 
                  such doctrine-- difficult alike to demonstrate or to dismiss."</em></p>
              <p>----------------</p>
              <p>I think this ties in very nicely with your comments. Something that is untestable and unfalsifiable will require faith to believe in it. That is not in dispute.</p>
              <p>The real question then is whether that faith is reasonable.</p>
              <p>I cannot disprove some of the tenets of Buddhism, just as I cannot disprove your claim that there's an invisible, incorporeal dragon in your bedroom.</p>
              <p>However, I can point out the historical reliability of supernatural claims has proven to be extremely poor.</p>
              <p>I can call out the inconsistencies and gaps in Buddhism that I can see -- given my limited knowledge.</p>
              <p>I will challenge you to think beyond authoritative doctrine, and decide for yourself which elements of Buddhism are reasonable -- and which are not.</p>
              <p>I will suggest, that people will believe what they want to. That is how some people can believe that the earth is 6,000 years old, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Intellectual honesty is what is needed, not blind faith.</p>
              <p>We should always think critically and to challenge ourselves and others. The truth is sometimes difficult and uncomfortable -- we want to think that there's something more to our lives. We want to think that there's a deeper reason for the things that happen to us.</p>
              <p>But the evidence suggests that this is it. This is all we have. This is uncomfortable, but we must never settle for less than the truth.</p>

              something to play with, chew on.  There will come a point in

              <p>Fundamentally, religious people and atheists are similar in that we are all seeking the for the "truth". Atheists think that reason and scientific inquiry is the way to understand the world, whereas believers see Truth in a certain doctrine.</p>

              sadly say its is IMPOSSIBLE .Science cannot explained alot of thing
              like why different people die differently,sometimes tragically .You
              say that person is a kind person , but why does he died when a tree
              just fallen on him.Does Newtons Law of gravity "sees" he is a kind
              person and waive off all calamity befallen on him</p>
              <p>Simply to use Science in your arguments is flawed and so
              childlike .I challenge you to come and practise and realise for
              yourself what the Buddha have taught.Unless you intend not to be
              liberated ,so are you SURE next life you can be a great Scientist
              ?HOW SURE ARE YOU ? HOW SURE ?HOW SURE?</p>

              <p>1. A good man is crushed by a fallen tree. I hope we agree that the physical/naturalistic causes are fully known to us. The tree was in poor health; it was struck by lightning; the man was driving to work; etc.</p>
              <p>Your question is whether there's a <strong>deeper</strong> reason for him being killed. There is no reason to think there is. Even if (big if) there is, there is no way of knowing whether it's karma at work, or whether we have a mischievous God at play.</p>
              <p>You may <strong>want</strong> to believe that there's a reason for things to happen, and that life is fair. But we may want something very badly, but it does not make it true.</p>
              <p>2. As an atheist, I don't think there's anything after I die, so I really don't care about my next life. But even if I weren't an atheist, I wouldn't be concerned about whether I'll be a scientist in my next life. I'll let my next life take care of itself, since I will have no awareness nor any influence on the decisions he/she/it makes.</p>

              <p>Muse over this – A pickpocket was trailing a gem merchant and
              wanted very much to get hold of this gem – he tried all means and
              ways and to no avail and in spite of that was still trying; all
              this time the merchant knew what he was up to and allowed the thief
              to be and when an opportunity rose he dropped the precious gem into
              the pocket of the thief. After a lapse of some moments, the
              pickpocket out frustration blurted out to the merchant that he was
              a professional in pickpocketing and queried as to where is the gem
              as it could not even find it in the merchant’s [person]!<br> To that the merchant replied – I put it where u would least look
              for it – in your pocket! This allegory illustrates the predicament
              of searching in the ’’wrong’’ places and hoping to find ….</p>
              <p>Eg :When I practice a particular …. thinking that I am a
              particular …. looking for a particular … eg merits or to arrive
              someday somewhere I m merely spinning on my fictional ’’self’’ – I
              am playing mind games. As long as one has an image of what God,
              Buddha or englightenment, awakening or it is already a concept and
              when it is premised on a concept one is simply going to be like a
              squirrel in a cage!</p>
              <p>PS – Self in quotes cos most of us assume that what we think is
              what we are. reality is it is not. I can hold a book and think that
              I am reading it. It is only a reality when the actual reading is
              transpiring. Many live in the mind when all in that is
              close,obvious n in front is missed.My standing in a church, temple
              cannot be construed as being holy. It can only be when I am being
              kind, being ….</p>
              <p>PS – Buddha, Jesus, Mohd, Krishna n … were all spiriutal beings
              and in being ….. (eg , being compassionate, being ….????) were
              sharing their being(s). Of course, it presupposed that the one who
              passes him’her by is open and attuned to his/her own being. As long
              as the sense of self predominates one’s mind – one is going to
              miss. When one is present to one’s being ….. one is absent to one’s
              self<br> As long as one is mired in concepts, even beleifs (eg theist,
              atheist) one is still caught up in the game fo being divisive and
              the human mind is bound to rationalize and defend one’s
              position.</p>
              <p>Enlightement/awakening or whatever one labels it has always been
              and always will be this lah – no adding is needed, not minusing is
              needed. In the acceptance of what one is not – one is all-embracing
              of what is and that is freeing. The wise one partakes of the world
              but the moment the roles are fulfilled does not bring it home. Home
              is the source of one’s being and a sythnesis of inner and outer (
              in actuality, no such thing but cos of constraints of
              language).<br> The long ing for all humanity is the longing to be free and even to
              use the ’’self’’ (even rejecting it) is merely a mental
              exercise.</p>
              <p>The irony of it is Jesus never uttered he was Christian. Buddha
              never did about Buddhism and nor did Mohd about Islam.</p>
              <p>Perhaps ’’modern’’ man has confused spirituality and religion.
              The essential is always spiritual and the accidental is always
              religion. Relgion is temporal and a reaction to … (cos of beleifs,
              traditions … which is acquired from or accepted from someone
              esle/book or &amp;#8230<img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"> and
              spirituality is that which is eternal, existential and herenow. The
              form resonates with the masses cos it has the element of certainty!
              The latter cannot be be made certain and uncertainty is something
              the human mind cannot accept or reconcile to.</p>
              <p>As long as there is no synthesis of the essential and the
              accidental one is doomed and however or whichever way one may try
              it is probably going to split one on the inside</p>

               the possibility for one who is BEING agnostic to be enlightened aka awakened  is there.  for an atheist or theist it is still possible but the unlearning has to be intense cos both are are premised on beliefs.
              
              There is no 'finding'' per se, but a recognition that has been overlooked , lost to many of us because of looking outwards as opposed to goin inwards. There is nothing to be found inside cos it has always been there before one's physical existence and will be there even after one's demise. It is beyond space-time and hence the label eternity.  Nothing to be added or taken away. 
              When one can see the ''creator'' (aka existence, god, Buddha, Krishna, Mohd  or whatever one calls it does not matter) in the creatures, beings, both animate and inanimate one is awakened or enlightened. This is a subjective existential phenomenon and once conceptualized or objectified loses its essence. However, for the sake of explanation and considering the constraints of lang/words one has to expand, introspect and .... I can go on talking about water, only when one has tasted ( or is tasting it with one's one experiencing) would one know. However, this searching and seeking has somehow assumed that in can be found in texts, scriptures, books  or ... it is fine to use the latter as alchemical devices but if they (devices) do not drop along the way inwards then it is merely living on borrowed concepts.  It is still egoism!

              <p><strong>Here's a thought experiment that I just developed, which I want to pose to all of you.</strong></p>
              <p>Let's assume that you've become the supreme leader of the world, and you have to make recommendations for the lives of five billion people. Say you have only two choices:</p>
              <p>(a) Recommend that they become scientists.</p>
              <p>(b) Recommend that they pursue the truths of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Let's say that, whichever your choice, these five billion people excel at their given roles.</p>
              <p>A hundred years pass.</p>
              <p>------------------</p>
              <p>Depending on your choice, I suggest these will be your outcomes:</p>
              <p><strong>(a) Five billion scientists</strong></p>
              <p>These five billion scientists make wonderful progress in science, bringing about new methods of countering natural disasters. Cancer has been cured, while genetic engineering means that birth defects and diseases have been completely eradicated. We have new, sustainable ways of using our resources, ensuring the future survival of our planet.</p>
              <p>On average, life is substantially better for everyone. There is less poverty and hunger, fewer diseases, and so on.</p>
              <p><strong>(b) Five billion earnest, devout Buddhists</strong></p>
              <p>These five billion Buddhists build up a great deal of positive karma. A few of them actually achieve enlightenment, while the majority of others are able to build up good karma for future lives.</p>
              <p>However, the progress of science has halted. We continue to suffer from incurable diseases as we do today. Earthquakes and tsunamis continue to afflict us. We still do not have the means to sustain a population of seven billion.</p>
              <p>-----------------</p>
              <p>So here's the dilemma:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>The first group of scientists have built up no positive karma for themselves.</li>
              <li>However, through their efforts, the world has become substantially better to live in.</li>
              <li>Assuming rebirth, how then is it possible that these billion 
                  people are living better lives a 100 years later, given that there was 
                  no net increase in positive karma?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Conversely:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>The second group of Buddhists have built up positive karma for future lives.</li>
              <li>However, the world has not become appreciably better to live in.</li>
              <li>Assuming rebirth, how then is it possible to suddenly have 
                  billions of people living better a 100 years later, given that 
                  technology has not improved?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>To show that karma and rebirth is true, you have to demonstrate a reasonable way in which the second group will lead much better and more comfortable lives than the first group. Feel free to poke holes in my scenarios, if I've grossly misunderstood some of the concepts.</p>
              <p>But let's try not to appeal to the mysterious, and say that these are just things we don't understand. Look at this scenario logically, and tell me how we can explain the contradictions.</p>
              <p>This is also not a far-fetched scenario. Science has made our lives substantially better. The Internet, for example, has brought knowledge and empowerment to us in the developed countries, but also people in poor ones. The genetic engineering of crops has enabled us to feed billions of people, many of whom would otherwise starve.</p>
              <p>Then coming back to the first question: <strong>If you were the supreme ruler, and assuming you only had two options, would you recommend science or Buddhism?</strong></p>

              <p>1. You're saying that science has to work harder to catch up
              with Buddhism in understanding the natural facts of our world?
              Don't just assert. Prove it.</p>
              <p>What <strong>new natural knowledge</strong> is Buddhism bringing
              to the table? How many dimensions does our world have? Eleven, as
              M-theory suggests? Or 10, as earlier theories did? Or four, or
              three? How was the first self-replicable cell formed? Is the RNA
              world hypothesis correct?</p>
              <p>What about <strong>applications</strong> from knowledge in
              Buddhism? Has anyone made any discoveries, built any cutting-edge
              technology based on their insights from Buddhism?</p>
              <p>What does Buddhism tell you about all of these questions? And
              don't talk in riddles. Explain in clear terms that we can predict
              and test, rather than reactroactively fit into science.</p>
              <p>It is one thing to claim that Buddhism offers a spiritual truth
              that cannot be tested by science. It is quite another to claim that
              Buddhism offers insights into our natural world that science has
              yet to discover.</p>
              <p>2. You are eager to put Buddhism in the same framework as
              science, but energy in science is impersonal -- it is used and
              converted constantly, both (a) from one form of energy to another
              and (b) from mass to energy and back.</p>
              <p>It is therefore a massive leap to go from the energy of science
              into rebirth, where the "energy" of an individual is retained in
              its entirety from one life to another.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, I can't see how the Buddhist formulations of
              non-self and "energy" are consistent with the concept of rebirth.
              If you keep talking about non-self, then why is there even
              retribution on the self? How is it that the "energy" of an
              individual remains intact even after death, only to be transported
              into another sentient being?</p>
              <p>The idea of "energy" in Buddhism is hence very different from
              that of science in significant ways. There is no scientific
              evidence for what you are claiming. Furthermore, given the way you
              explain it, I'm not even sure it is consistent with itself.</p>

              <p>i do not think intuition is itself wrong, but at times it can be proven right and on the dot...intuition is an integral part of human experience and to do away with it, do away with imagination and precursors of all knowledge and facts....as with our creative evolution of the mind and not just empirical knowledge...human inquiry would then be reduced to matters of material reality...</p>
              <p>the discussion leads to quite a serious and even dangerous situation of excessive scientism...that excludes other fields of knowledge and human experiences...in turn this would lead to epistemological distortions and abuse of public policy in favour of only what is measurable i.e. eugenics...</p>

              <p>------------------</p>
              <p>Depending on your choice, I suggest these will be your
              outcomes:</p>
              <p><strong>(a) Five billion scientists</strong></p>
              <p>These five billion scientists make wonderful progress in
              science, bringing about new methods of countering natural
              disasters. Cancer has been cured, while genetic engineering means
              that birth defects and diseases have been completely eradicated. We
              have new, sustainable ways of using our resources, ensuring the
              future survival of our planet.</p>
              <p>On average, life is substantially better for everyone. There is
              less poverty and hunger, fewer diseases, and so on.</p>
              <p><strong>(b) Five billion earnest, devout Buddhists</strong></p>
              <p>These five billion Buddhists build up a great deal of positive
              karma. A few of them actually achieve enlightenment, while the
              majority of others are able to build up good karma for future
              lives.</p>
              <p>However, the progress of science has halted. We continue to
              suffer from incurable diseases as we do today. Earthquakes and
              tsunamis continue to afflict us. We still do not have the means to
              sustain a population of seven billion.</p>
              <p>-----------------</p>
              <p>So here's the dilemma:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>The first group of scientists have built up no positive karma
              for themselves.</li>
              <li>However, through their efforts, the world has become
              substantially better to live in.</li>
              <li>Assuming rebirth, how then is it possible that these billion
              people are living better lives a 100 years later, given that there
              was no net increase in positive karma?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Conversely:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>The second group of Buddhists have built up positive karma for
              future lives.</li>
              <li>However, the world has not become appreciably better to live
              in.</li>
              <li>Assuming rebirth, how then is it possible to suddenly have
              billions of people living better a 100 years later, given that
              technology has not improved?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>To show that karma and rebirth is true, you have to demonstrate
              a reasonable way in which the second group will lead much better
              and more comfortable lives than the first group. Feel free to poke
              holes in my scenarios, if I've grossly misunderstood some of the
              concepts.</p>
              <p>But let's try not to appeal to the mysterious, and say that
              these are just things we don't understand. Look at this scenario
              logically, and tell me how we can explain the contradictions.</p>
              <p>This is also not a far-fetched scenario. Science has made our
              lives substantially better. The Internet, for example, has brought
              knowledge and empowerment to us in the developed countries, but
              also people in poor ones. The genetic engineering of crops has
              enabled us to feed billions of people, many of whom would otherwise
              starve.</p>
              <p>Then coming back to the first question: <strong>If you were the
              supreme ruler, and assuming you only had two options, would you
              recommend science or Buddhism?</strong></p>

              <p>actually that's not true. u are just making subjective illusive assumtion. the percentage that u think tested is not enough to make it work. our old Master Chin Kung did a similar experiment on a village in china and the lifes of that particular village became better.  it was shown to the World Conference on Religion and Peace. it WILL work if the whole world do it together not just potion by potion. </p>
              <p>in Buddhsim, spiritual power cannot defeat karma. science would not defect karma too. new type of dying illness or cancer will still emerge. science cannot stop natural disasters, but if all the world people turn good, it'll stop natural disasters. but it's imposible to proof it now. lol.  </p>
