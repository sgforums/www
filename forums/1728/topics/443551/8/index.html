              <p>The scenario is not a choose-and-justify question. It's framed
                  as a dilemma.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Is substantial increased well-being through positive karma be
                  possible <strong>without science</strong>? Think of a world where
                  influenza still wipes out millions; countless others die in
                  childbirth; etc.<br></li>
              <li>Why is it that the world can enjoy substantially improved
                  well-being today through science, given that <strong>no substantial
                  increase in positive karma</strong>?</li>
              <li>Given these dilemmas, isn't it more reasonable to think that
                  improved well-being comes from science, much more than it comes
                  from karma?<br></li>
              </ol></div>

              <p>I don't think it is mutually exclusive.</p>
              <p>Question is how do you know that there is no increase in positive karma? Karma to me means cause and effect. For example, there are many scientists who are compassionate, whose goal is to benefit humanity through their hard work and discoveries. Due to this "cause", they work hard and discover ways to cure diseases. When they discover a cure, this is the end "effect". So you see there is the working of karma in scientific discoveries too!</p>
              <p>The cause being the compassionate thought, and the effect being the cure. So I argue that there is increase in positive karma. This is what is meant by karma.</p>

              <p>No doubt humans have defeated many deadly diseases but there are always new deadly diseases coming up. I believe this will be on going. In the past, humans had defeated deadly diseases like tuberculosis, small pox etc. but there are new deadly diseases like cancer, AIDS etc. we have not found  a total cure yet. I believe after humans have found a cure for cancer and AIDS, there will be more new deadly diseases appear. Why leh?</p>

              <p>"The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should 
              transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the 
              natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense 
              arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a 
              meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any 
              religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be 
              Buddhism."</p>

              <p>Hi i only read through the past two pages so hope I'm not too out of topic.</p>
              <p>For everyone's benefit i'd like to pin down that the karma being used here is the same as that explained by the Buddha(or close to). Here is an extract explaining it from the site buddhisma2z.com:</p>
              <p><span>"The doctrine of kamma is probably the 
              most misunderstood of all the Buddha’s teachings. The four most common 
              misunderstandings are these. </span></p>
              <p><span>(1) Everything which happens to us is the 
              result of our past kamma. In actual fact, Buddhism recognized at least 
              four other broad causes of why things happen, including because of the 
              operation of natural laws (<em>dhamm niyÄ�ma</em>), biological laws (<em>bÄ«j niyÄ�ma</em>), physical laws (<em>utuniyÄ�ma</em>) and psychological laws (<em>cittaniyÄ�ma</em>,As.854;
               A.III,62).</span></p>
              <p><span>(2) We can never escape from the consequences of our past 
              actions. If this were true then we would be completely determined by our
               past and be unable to change and attain <a href="http://buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=124"><strong>enlightenment</strong></a> (A.I,249). What Buddhism does teach is that several strong intentional 
              good actions may very well modify or even cancel out a bad action and 
              vice versa (Dhp.173). Thus it is correct to say that we are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conditioned</span> by our kamma rather than determined by it. </span></p>
              <p><span>(3) Our experiences in the 
              present life are due to what we did in our last life and what we do now 
              will have an effect in the future life. In reality, many of our actions 
              have a result immediately or soon after we have done them, i.e. in the 
              present life (4). The fourth common misunderstanding is what might be 
              called ‘kammic naivety,’ i.e. if you kick a monk in this life you will 
              be reborn with a club foot in your next life, if you swear in this life 
              you will have bad <a href="http://buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=53"><strong>breath</strong></a> in the next life, if you are generous in this life, you will be rich in
               your next life. </span></p>
              <p><span>This, of course, is rather silly. Because kamma is 
              primarily psychological (i.e. intention), its manifestation is primarily
               psychological. It only affects our physical form and circumstances to 
              the degree that the <a href="http://buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=264"><strong>mind</strong></a> can have an influence on the physical, as, for example, when prolonged 
              worry can cause or aggravate physical illness. The main effect kamma has
               upon us is how we feel (happy, neutral or unhappy) and which realm we 
              will be reborn into."</span></p>

              <p>I'm not confused about Buddhism's stance on determinism at all. All religions require some level of free will, because it is only right to demand retribution of an individual who freely makes a choice.</p>
              <p>Many atheists and scientists, however, believe that <strong>100%</strong> of our decisions and actions are governed by prior causes, such as our genetics and environment.</p>

              <p>I don't think it is mutually exclusive.</p>
              <p>Question is how do you know that there is no increase in
                  positive karma? Karma to me means cause and effect. For example,
                  there are many scientists who are compassionate, whose goal is to
                  benefit humanity through their hard work and discoveries. Due to
                  this "cause", they work hard and discover ways to cure diseases.
                  When they discover a cure, this is the end "effect". So you see
                  there is the working of karma in scientific discoveries too!</p>
              <p>The cause being the compassionate thought, and the effect being
                  the cure. So I argue that there is increase in positive karma. This
                  is what is meant by karma.</p>

              <p>1. It was Dharmadhatu was wrote earlier to me in this thread: "Buddhism is not about good works. You do not understand the
                                          first thing about Buddhism." While scientists can do "good works", these actions pale significantly in comparison to efforts to find enlightenment. Therefore, studying Buddhism should theoretically yield much more greater karma than scientific progress, but the whole point of the dilemmas is that this doesn't seem possible without science.</p>
              <p>2. Some scientists may be motivated by the desire to do something good for humanity, but I suspect the moral issues are very much secondary. When Einstein came up with his theories as a patent clerk, I don't think he was thinking of benefiting mankind, and indeed relativity has been used to both destroy and create. Positive karma doesn't apply here.</p>
              <p>3. Karma as I understand it only applies to yourself and your afterlives. There is debate on whether it applies to a community and your children. Therefore, the discovery of, say, a cure for cancer that benefits the whole world can only be ascribed to science, not to karma.</p>
              <p>4. I think it is questionable logic when someone ascribes a positive outcome (of good works) to karma, and then says nothing about negative outcomes. What about the countless scientists who wanted to benefit mankind but failed to make any meaningful discoveries? Be careful of the fallacies of confirmation bias and non-falsifiability.</p>

              <p>Karma is continually ripening, but it is also continually being
                                      generated by present actions, therefore it is possible to exercise
                                      free will to shape future karma. P.A. Payutto writes, "the Buddha

                                      the ethical value of these various teachings on

              <p>1. It was Dharmadhatu was wrote earlier to me in this thread: "Buddhism is not about good works. You do not understand the first thing about Buddhism." While scientists can do "good works", these actions pale significantly in comparison to efforts to find enlightenment. Therefore, studying Buddhism should theoretically yield much more greater karma than scientific progress, but the whole point of the dilemmas is that this doesn't seem possible without science.</p>
              <p>2. Some scientists may be motivated by the desire to do something good for humanity, but I suspect the moral issues are very much secondary. When Einstein came up with his theories as a patent clerk, I don't think he was thinking of benefiting mankind, and indeed relativity has been used to both destroy and create. Positive karma doesn't apply here.</p>
              <p>3. Karma as I understand it only applies to yourself and your afterlives. There is debate on whether it applies to a community and your children. Therefore, the discovery of, say, a cure for cancer that benefits the whole world can only be ascribed to science, not to karma.</p>
              <p>4. I think it is questionable logic when someone ascribes a positive outcome (of good works) to karma, and then says nothing about negative outcomes. What about the countless scientists who wanted to benefit mankind but failed to make any meaningful discoveries? Be careful of the fallacies of confirmation bias and non-falsifiability.</p>

              <p>There are many things in this world which cannot be explained scientifically. For example why some are born in the poor families, some are born in the  rich families, some are born smart even though their parents are not so smart etc. If you observe more things around, you will realise that there are many things that Science can't explain. There will definitely be new deadly diseases after scientists find a cure for cancer.</p>

              <p>No doubt humans have defeated many deadly diseases but there are
              always new deadly diseases coming up. I believe this will be on
              going. In the past, humans had defeated deadly diseases like
              tuberculosis, small pox etc. but there are new deadly diseases like
              cancer, AIDS etc. we have not found  a total cure yet. I
              believe after humans have found a cure for cancer and AIDS, there
              will be more new deadly diseases appear. Why leh?</p>

              <p>1. There are "new" diseases because viruses can mutate and replicate.</p>
              <p>2. Some old diseases, such as cancer, are more prominent today because people are living longer (hence more time for affliction) and better detection methods</p>
              <p>3. It is however no doubt that our ability to fight and contain new diseases has improved over the years. The likelihood of seeing the kind of casualties we saw in the Black Death and even the Spanish Flu is extremely low.</p>
              <p>You talk about AIDS. 30 million people have died of AIDS-related causes in the 20 years since the start of the epidemic. Do you know how many people died in the Black Death? Almost half of Europe was wiped out in a four-year period, and up to 200 million died in total.</p>

              <p>Hi i only read through the past two pages so hope I'm not too
              out of topic.</p>
              <p>For everyone's benefit i'd like to pin down that the karma being
              used here is the same as that explained by the Buddha(or close to).
              Here is an extract explaining it from the site buddhisma2z.com:</p>
              <p><span>"The doctrine of kamma is probably the most misunderstood
              of all the Buddha’s teachings. The four most common
              misunderstandings are these.</span></p>
              <p><span>(1) Everything which happens to us is the result of our
              past kamma. In actual fact, Buddhism recognized at least four other
              broad causes of why things happen, including because of the
              operation of natural laws (<em>dhamm niyÄ�ma</em>), biological laws
              (<em>bÄ«j niyÄ�ma</em>), physical laws (<em>utuniyÄ�ma</em>) and
              psychological laws (<em>cittaniyÄ�ma</em>,As.854;
              A.III,62).</span></p>
              <p><span>(2) We can never escape from the consequences of our past
              actions. If this were true then we would be completely determined
              by our past and be unable to change and attain <a rel="nofollow" href="http://buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=124"><strong>enlightenment</strong></a> (A.I,249). What
              Buddhism does teach is that several strong intentional good actions
              may very well modify or even cancel out a bad action and vice versa
              (Dhp.173). Thus it is correct to say that we are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conditioned</span> by our kamma
              rather than determined by it.</span></p>
              <p><span>(3) Our experiences in the present life are due to what we
              did in our last life and what we do now will have an effect in the
              future life. In reality, many of our actions have a result
              immediately or soon after we have done them, i.e. in the present
              life (4). The fourth common misunderstanding is what might be
              called ‘kammic naivety,’ i.e. if you kick a monk in this life you
              will be reborn with a club foot in your next life, if you swear in
              this life you will have bad <a rel="nofollow" href="http://buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=53"><strong>breath</strong></a> in the next life, if you are
              generous in this life, you will be rich in your next
              life.</span></p>
              <p><span>This, of course, is rather silly. Because kamma is
              primarily psychological (i.e. intention), its manifestation is
              primarily psychological. It only affects our physical form and
              circumstances to the degree that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=264"><strong>mind</strong></a> can have an influence on the
              physical, as, for example, when prolonged worry can cause or
              aggravate physical illness. The main effect kamma has upon us is
              how we feel (happy, neutral or unhappy) and which realm we will be
              reborn into."</span></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>That's clear to me, except for the fourth point. If karma only affects the mind, does it mean that born physical impairments are not caused by karma?</p>
