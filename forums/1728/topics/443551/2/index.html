              <p>First of all, it strikes me that Buddhism has many diverse interpretations. I read a little of the çŽ°ä»£å› æžœå®žå½• in the link posted by <strong>sinweiy</strong>, and I was surprised at the discussion of ghosts, which <strong>Amitayus48</strong> also mentions. I wonder if all the knowledgeable posters here agree with the supernatural aspects of Buddhism.</p>
              <p><strong>simpo_</strong> and <strong>Dawnfirstlight</strong>: The discussion about karma as a law of nature is common, and in effect, I think you are agreeing with me. In Christianity, the system of reward/punishment is administered by a supreme being, like a judge would. In Buddhism, the system of reward/punishment is a law of nature, and no one is able to transcend it.</p>
              <p>In both of these cases, it appears that (2) of my original thesis holds: Karma <strong>is</strong> the mechanism of reward/punishment in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>What exactly is karmic retribution though? It is again extremely diverse from the little I've read of it. Some say it is visited upon children, or that natural disaster can happen to a society of many evil-doers as karmic retribution. Is that the conventional idea?</p>
              <p>For now, I will accept the assumption that the karmic process is able to precisely identify the impact of free will (assuming there is such a thing). But I still have two main philosophical problems with the concept of karma:</p>
              <p>1. It is non-falsifiable.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>When bad things happen to evil people, we say that it is karma at work.<br></li>
              <li>When bad things happen to good people, we say that they are paying for transgressions in their past lives.<br></li>
              <li>If good things happen to evil people, we say the timing is not yet right.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>In other words, there is no way of proving or disproving karma, because there is an explanation for every scenario. Something that is non-falsifiable may still be correct, but the simpler explanation then is that it does not exist.</p>
              <p>2. It is non-specific.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Why do I care that karmic retribution will be visited upon my next life, given that I have no awareness of it at all? In other words, all suffering is endured in the next life, and not by my present consciousness.</li>
              <li>Is it fair that a child may have to bear the karmic retribution of a parent's wrongdoings? If my father decided to be a mass murderer, how am I morally responsible for it?<br></li>
              <li>If a natural disaster hits Singapore as karmic retribution to the evil-doings of some or most of its inhabitants, is it fair that the remaining good people also have to suffer?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The non-specificity of the idea of karma adds to its general vagueness and non-falsifiability. More than that, I think that non-specificty is inefficient and potentially unfair.</p>

              <p>Hi... well maybe it's hard for you to believe in karma. Try contemplating the <a title="4 immeasurables?" href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s15.htm">4 immeasurable minds</a>? See what you can do to improve your social environment.</p>

              <p>The fact that a "good" child is born to a good family really shouldn't be a mystery. Your family influences who you are, both in terms of genetics and cultural/educational upbringing. Again, there really is no need to postulate for karma.</p>
              <p>I find it hard to accept that natural disasters are due to collective karma. Japan has been the site of numerous earthquakes for thousands of years, even before World War II. I also find it unfair that, say, a child has to die today in an earthquake because of a war that his grandparent fought.</p>
              <p>Karma may be more interesting than the idea of a God, but I don't see evidence for either. Why is a country hit by earthquakes? You could say it's because of karma, but the scientific -- and, I would argue, better -- answer is that there is a build-up of energy beneath the earth's crust, culminating in a catastrophic release. Why does a person win the roulette? You could say it's karma, but it's really because of the speed of rotation of the roulette wheel, the direction of the throw, etc.</p>

              <p>Yeah, it is true that there's an explanation on why natural disasters strike  certain places. However, can you explain why some people are born in places where disasters strike and why some people are not? Just like a person who was born disable, the person may ask "Why Me?"  There are many natural disasters which strike the place for the 1st time in our modern time. One good example is Myanmar, which happened a few years ago.</p>

              <p>Buddhism teaches that all things, both material and immaterial, are entirely subject to the direction of causes and are interdependent. This natural course of things is called in common terms "the law of nature," and in the Pali language <em>niyama</em>, literally meaning "certainty" or "fixed way," referring to the fact that specific determinants inevitably lead to corresponding results.</p>
              <p>The laws of nature, although uniformly based on the principle of causal dependence, can nevertheless be sorted into different modes of relationship. The Buddhist commentaries describe five categories of natural law, or niyama. They are:</p>
              <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong><em>Utuniyama:</em></strong> the natural law pertaining to physical objects and changes in the natural environment, such as the weather; the way flowers bloom in the day and fold up at night; the way soil, water and nutrients help a tree to grow; and the way things disintegrate and decompose. This perspective emphasizes the changes brought about by heat or temperature.</p>
              <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong><em>Bijaniyama:</em></strong> the natural law pertaining to heredity, which is best described in the adage, "as the seed, so the fruit."</p>
              <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong><em>Cittaniyama:</em></strong> the natural law pertaining to the workings of the mind, the process of cognition of sense objects and the mental reactions to them.</p>
              <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong><em>Kammaniyama:</em></strong> the natural law pertaining to human behavior, the process of the generation of action and its results. In essence, this is summarized in the words, "good deeds bring good results, bad deeds bring bad results."</p>
              <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong><em>Dhammaniyama:</em></strong> the natural law governing the relationship and interdependence of all things: the way all things arise, exist and then cease. All conditions are subject to change, are in a state of affliction and are not self: this is the Norm.</p>
              <p>The first four niyama are contained within, or based on, the fifth one, <em>Dhammaniyama</em>, the Law of Dhamma, or the Law of Nature. It may be questioned why Dhammaniyama, being as it were the totality, is also included within the subdivisions. This is because this fourfold categorization does not cover the entire extent of Dhammaniyama.</p>

              <p>i also think you are taking Buddhism to be some kind of philosophical subject which it is not.  It is meant to be lived and practised in our ordinary daily life.</p>
              <p>Although karmic law is incontrovertible in our ordinary sense of reality. But ultimately Buddha teaches that we should go beyond both positive or negative karma, as both are links that still trap us in samsara.  In the ultimate truth, karma lacks independent existence too.</p>

              wisdom realising emptiness, just practising these four samadhis and eight
              concentrations, is also unable to let one be liberated, it is still the cause

               Form and formless realms are a part of  the heavenly devas/gods

              <p>This I think is a fundamental issue. Because human beings have self-awareness and empathy, we are able to imagine ourselves in the shoes of other people. We then ask: "Why do good things happen to him, and bad things happen to me?"</p>
              <p>However, the fact that we can ask a question does not automatically make it a valid one. There may <strong>not</strong> be a deeper reason for things -- good and bad -- that happen to us.</p>
              <p>As human beings, we seek meaning behind the things that happen to us, whether it be a thunder-wielding Zeus, the fallen angel Lucifer, or just karma. But so far, I've yet to see anyone in this topic demonstrate why karma is a verifiable concept. It seems to boil down to faith.</p>
              <p>Think about this for a moment.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>If karma is true, then philosophically we deserve all the good and the bad that happens to us.<br></li>
              <li>If karma (or any similar religious principle) is false, then we do not deserve the good or the bad that happens to us. <br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>Warren Buffet, an atheist, is pledging away the vast majority of his wealth. Read this excerpt, and you'll have a sense of why non-belief in karma can lead to greater empathy and humanity:<br></p>
              <div class="quote"><span class="byline"> <strong>Buffett</strong> wrote: </span> <blockquote> "My wealth has come from a combination of living in America, some 
              lucky genes, and compound interest. Both my children and I won what I 
              call the ovarian lottery. (For starters, the odds against my 1930 birth 
              taking place in the U.S. were at least 30 to 1. My being male and white 
              also removed huge obstacles that a majority of Americans then faced.) My
               luck was accentuated by my living in a market system that sometimes

              I've worked in an economy that rewards someone who saves the lives of 
              others on a battlefield with a medal, rewards a great teacher with 
              thank-you notes from parents, but rewards those who can detect the 
              mispricing of securities with sums reaching into the billions. In short,
               fate's distribution of long straws is wildly capricious." </blockquote></div>

              <h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Kamma as a</span> <a id="law" rel="nofollow" name="law"><span style="color: #000080;">law</span></a> <span style="color: #000080;">of
              nature</span></strong></h3>
              <p>Buddhism teaches that all things, both material and immaterial,
              are entirely subject to the direction of causes and are
              interdependent. This natural course of things is called in common
              terms "the law of nature," and in the Pali language
              <em>niyama</em>, literally meaning "certainty" or "fixed way,"
              referring to the fact that specific determinants inevitably lead to
              corresponding results.</p>
              <p>The laws of nature, although uniformly based on the principle of
              causal dependence, can nevertheless be sorted into different modes
              of relationship. The Buddhist commentaries describe five categories
              of natural law, or niyama. They are:</p>
              <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong><em>Utuniyama:</em></strong> the
              natural law pertaining to physical objects and changes in the
              natural environment, such as the weather; the way flowers bloom in
              the day and fold up at night; the way soil, water and nutrients
              help a tree to grow; and the way things disintegrate and decompose.
              This perspective emphasizes the changes brought about by heat or
              temperature.</p>
              <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong><em>Bijaniyama:</em></strong> the
              natural law pertaining to heredity, which is best described in the
              adage, "as the seed, so the fruit."</p>
              <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong><em>Cittaniyama:</em></strong> the
              natural law pertaining to the workings of the mind, the process of
              cognition of sense objects and the mental reactions to them.</p>
              <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong><em>Kammaniyama:</em></strong> the
              natural law pertaining to human behavior, the process of the
              generation of action and its results. In essence, this is
              summarized in the words, "good deeds bring good results, bad deeds
              bring bad results."</p>
              <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong><em>Dhammaniyama:</em></strong> the
              natural law governing the relationship and interdependence of all
              things: the way all things arise, exist and then cease. All
              conditions are subject to change, are in a state of affliction and
              are not self: this is the Norm.</p>
              <p>The first four niyama are contained within, or based on, the
              fifth one, <em>Dhammaniyama</em>, the Law of Dhamma, or the Law of
              Nature. It may be questioned why Dhammaniyama, being as it were the
              totality, is also included within the subdivisions. This is because
              this fourfold categorization does not cover the entire extent of
              Dhammaniyama.</p>

              <p>Let me extend the earlier analogy to illustrate. I argue that the concept of karma is similar to the  invisible, incorporeal dragon in my garage (see earlier link). It is non-falsifiable, so there is no way of testing whether it is true. Therefore, if you take away faith, the simpler answer is that karma -- just like my garage dragon -- does not exist.</p>
              <p>The fact that my dragon is beautiful and strong does not add any substance to my claim that it is real. In the same vein, the fact that karma is an elegant and wonderful concept, with lots of intricate details, does not make it any more valid.</p>

              <p>Yes. We may not be able to prove or disprove karma. But the burden of proof is different depending on the claim. The individual who is claiming the existence of, say, an invisible, incorporeal pink unicorn has to prove it, because I could never disprove it.</p>
              <p>If the proof of existence does not come, then at some point, you have to ask whether it is wishful thinking to continue believing in it.</p>

              <p>That is why we cannot do without faith at least in the beginning. Faith is important in Buddhism so that at least we have some conviction in the teacher and the method and follow his teaching to experience what the teacher himself has seen.</p>
              <p>But there is a difference between bad faith (faith in things that can never be verified such as unicorns) and good faith (faith in things that can be verified in direct experience). Many may not realize that they actually put a lot of faith in science - though it can be argued that science is good faith since they are verifiable.</p>
              <p>Buddhism, all the truths taught by Buddha has been from his own experience in his three knowledges he gained in awakening - the truth of rebirth, karma, and four noble truths that ends suffering. Those are not theories or concepts he came up with, but what he has seen to be true. He simply offered others his own experience.</p>
              <p>By following the methods of Buddhism, we too can verify them for ourselves, as many have done so. Buddhism is also a form of science - though different from the conventional modern day materialistic science. Buddhism is a science that deals mainly with mind, consciousness, and suffering.</p>
              <p>Buddha does not demand blind faith or worship, but some amount of faith in him as a teacher, and his teaching can go a long way for our own practice and path.</p>

              <p>it would if i see the working of karma happen to my own family and ownself. just like one who personally saw the "garage dragon"( for example) would believe that it exist <strong>to</strong> him. no matter how people say it's not true will not change his "believe" in the 'truth' he experienced. it's true to him per se. as it has gone from mere believe to real believe/faith.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mahayana advocated vegan but its not a commandment that  you must be a vegan. it is totally voluntary. as for theradava, Buddha never implemented vegetarianism. he even rejected it when a renegade disciple, his cousin, asked the Buddha to implement vegan, but he did not accepted it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>sinweiy:blue text from the POV of theravada, not mahayana. </em></span><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">vegan</span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> is stricter than vegetarism is not advocated by Mahayana. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Buddha</span></em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em> in the end did sort of advocate it skillfully</em>. </span></p>

              <p>2. Going back to my original Point (2), if I am born with a
                                                      serious physical deformity, the concept of karma will strike me as
                                                      grossly unfair. Why should I be made to suffer for the works of my
                                                      previous lives -- over which I have no control at all?</p>
              <p>3. If Buddhists don't eat animals because of these reasons, is
                                                      eating oysters allowed? From what I've read, people can only be
                                                      reincarnated into sentient creatures, and lots of shellfish are
                                                      believed to be non-sentient.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>2. Does it make sense for someone in jail to say, 'why should I be made to suffer for my burglary last year?' He may even say 'I'm a different person now! I am no longer the same person as last year. I'm changed. I am a good man now.' But the fact is the causality has ripened and yes, he has no control over them.</p>
              <p>3. Vegetarianism is not compulsory for Buddhists, however if you eat meat, the Buddha tells us to avoid eating meat that we have personally killed, ordered others to kill, or witnessed the killing (as an example: frozen meat is allowed as it meets these three criterias of not being killed, etc). Why? Karmic deeds are by intention - if we have no intention to kill the meat we eat, the negative karma is not formed. Karmic deeds are of three kinds: mental, speech, and bodily, but they must be intentional and volitional - and such volition may be wholesome, unwholesome, or pure. Even though it may be logically said that we are indirectly supporting the business of killing, nonetheless no direct karmic link is involved. That is why Buddha told us to eat meat only when meeting those three conditions. If you are into Mahayana Buddhism and wish to cultivate great compassion, then vegetarianism is highly recommended.</p>
              <p>But to answer your question: oysters are sentient animals and so we should avoid eating those that are cooked alive. Likewise, try to avoid eating seafood that are ordered fresh since it means you have ordered them to be killed.</p>

              supporting the business of killing, nonetheless no direct karmic
              link is involved. That is why Buddha told us to eat meat only when
              meeting those three conditions. If you are into Mahayana Buddhism
              and wish to cultivate great compassion, then vegetarianism is
              highly recommended.</p>
              <p>But to answer your question: oysters are sentient animals and so
              we should avoid eating those that are cooked alive. Likewise, try
              to avoid eating seafood that are ordered fresh since it means you
              have ordered them to be killed.</p>

              <p>This comment about someone being put in jail for a past crime, and the earlier thought experiment about amnesia are both very good arguments, I think.</p>
              <p>I'll answer them in two ways:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Neither of these examples are sufficently similar to rebirth. Even if someone has completely changed, his environment has not. The victim would still demand that the punishment be meted out. In rebirth, it is completely different -- someone born with a disability is serving a punishment for a crime that "he" did not commit. At the same time, the victims of the crime have no awareness, and can take no comfort from the knowledge that justice is being served. What then is the point in visiting karma on a new life?</li>
              <li>That said, fundamentally, my position is that retributive justice is unnecessary. Given our current knowledge of the human mind, punishments should be meted out for deterrence (of self and others) and for rehabilitation, but not for retribution. So in your example, if we can confirm beyond doubt that a burglar or murderer has turned over a new leaf, then prima facie we <strong>should</strong> let him out. It is better that he serves society as a free person than for him to waste his life in prison.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Finally, on your last point, why do you say that oysters have sentience if they have no brain and no nervous system?</p>
