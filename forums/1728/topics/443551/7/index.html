              <p>Actually there is no argument that technology improves standard
              of living and promotes well being (people rather be living well
              than starving or dying). However, that doesn't change the fact that
              none of these have anything to do with awakening and permanent
              liberation from suffering and mental afflictions, and the

              How is one to ever get ''answers'' lah, when it is premised on logic, on concepts - it is being a squirrel in a cage. 
              Eg Buddha's 8-fold..... was a consequence of his being empty not the other way around.

              <p>If humans go against nature, nature will go against us. This is the law of nature (karma). Though today's technology is very advance but humans have gone against nature in many ways to achieve high technology. The end result is natural disasters which are happening every now and then.</p>
              <p>Listen to this nice &amp; meaningful rap song below. "We are nothing å››å¤§çš†ç©º". This song is trying to tell us that humans claim that we can do wonders with today's technologies but when natural disasters strike us, we then realise we are nothing at all, we are at the mercy of the unknown which is karma.</p>

              <p><br>don't quite understand the point in the question, hence no one answer. previously as in previous life? karma is more complicated than simple <strong>linear</strong> approach. previous good deed can still reapen <strong>first,</strong> when given the right conditions, to someone that's bad and vise verse.</p>
              <p>seeds  + <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conditons</span> of sunlight, soil, water = reapen.</p>

              <p>(a) Recommend that they become scientists.</p>
              <p>(b) Recommend that they pursue the truths of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Let's say that, whichever your choice, these five billion people
              excel at their given roles.</p>
              <p>A hundred years pass.</p>
              <p>------------------</p>
              <p>Depending on your choice, I suggest these will be your
              outcomes:</p>
              <p><strong>(a) Five billion scientists</strong></p>
              <p>These five billion scientists make wonderful progress in
              science, bringing about new methods of countering natural
              disasters. Cancer has been cured, while genetic engineering means
              that birth defects and diseases have been completely eradicated. We
              have new, sustainable ways of using our resources, ensuring the
              future survival of our planet.</p>
              <p>On average, life is substantially better for everyone. There is
              less poverty and hunger, fewer diseases, and so on.</p>
              <p><strong>(b) Five billion earnest, devout Buddhists</strong></p>
              <p>These five billion Buddhists build up a great deal of positive
              karma. A few of them actually achieve enlightenment, while the
              majority of others are able to build up good karma for future
              lives.</p>
              <p>However, the progress of science has halted. We continue to
              suffer from incurable diseases as we do today. Earthquakes and
              tsunamis continue to afflict us. We still do not have the means to
              sustain a population of seven billion.</p>
              <p>-----------------</p>
              <p>So here's the dilemma:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>The first group of scientists have built up no positive karma
              for themselves.</li>
              <li>However, through their efforts, the world has become
              substantially better to live in.</li>
              <li>Assuming rebirth, how then is it possible that these billion
              people are living better lives a 100 years later, given that there
              was no net increase in positive karma?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Conversely:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>The second group of Buddhists have built up positive karma for
              future lives.</li>
              <li>However, the world has not become appreciably better to live
              in.</li>
              <li>Assuming rebirth, how then is it possible to suddenly have
              billions of people living better a 100 years later, given that
              technology has not improved?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>To show that karma and rebirth is true, you have to demonstrate
              a reasonable way in which the second group will lead much better
              and more comfortable lives than the first group. Feel free to poke
              holes in my scenarios, if I've grossly misunderstood some of the
              concepts.</p>
              <p>But let's try not to appeal to the mysterious, and say that
              these are just things we don't understand. Look at this scenario
              logically, and tell me how we can explain the contradictions.</p>
              <p>This is also not a far-fetched scenario. Science has made our
              lives substantially better. The Internet, for example, has brought
              knowledge and empowerment to us in the developed countries, but
              also people in poor ones. The genetic engineering of crops has
              enabled us to feed billions of people, many of whom would otherwise
              starve.</p>
              <p>Then coming back to the first question: <strong>If you were the
              supreme ruler, and assuming you only had two options, would you
              recommend science or Buddhism?</strong></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Recommend Buddhism first and then Science.</p>
              <p>Science is a double edged sword. After 100 years, there might be proliferation of nuclear arms, outbreak of new viruses created synthetically by rogue scientists/funded by rogue nations etc.</p>
              <p>If Buddhism is properly practiced, all 5 billion people's collective karma would improve - there would be less hotspots in the world, no nuclear arms race. Science would be put to good use, not destructive use.</p>

              <p>You keep arguing that karma will also lead to increased
                  well-being, but you cannot explain the tangible ways in which
                  well-being will improve in the absence of technology.</p>
              <p>The best you can do, I think, is to suggest that natural
                  disasters will simply stop happening, and that illnesses will abate
                  if everyone devotes themselves to Buddhism. In other words, you
                  have to insist on an active role for karma in manipulating and
                  modifying other natural laws. That will lead to a whole host of
                  other problems.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, without technology, there is simply no mechanism for
                  well-being to improve to any significant level, even if everyone
                  starts devoting themselves to Buddhism. This alone should suggest
                  that karma's contribution to well-being is extremely limited, if at
                  all present.</p>

              high technology. The end result is natural disasters which are

              <p>Listen to this nice &amp; meaningful rap song below. "We

              <p>I've listed several examples and indicators of how technology has improved lives. The dramatic increase in life expectancy already says a lot.</p>
              <p>Now, we may or may not be able to prevent natural disasters in future, but it is clear that we can better predict and protect against them. Here's an article from MIT's Technology Review which talks about the impact of technology is preventing the loss of life during the recent earthquakes:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The earthquake that struck Japan early this morning was the worst seen 
              in that country for over 300 years (with a local magnitude of 8.9). 
              Hundreds have been killed and injured so far, <strong>but the loss of life was 
              likely limited by two vital early warning technologies: a new earthquake
               alert system, and ocean-based tsunami warning system</strong>.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>(Emphasis mine.)<br>http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/26505/</p>
              <p>We are <strong>not</strong> just at the mercy of life's elements. The reality is that we have been able to defeat the vast majority of the world's diseases. We have been able to bring millions of people out of abject poverty with the help of technology. If karma is indeed present in killer viruses, in city fires, in malnutrition, we have been able to defeat it again and again with technology.</p>

              The fallacy of organized religion cannot be cancelled out - some years ago there was a Iranian (twin baby or conjoined ....) and came here for surgery. 
              All got together to pray for the success of the surgery, sadly, the surgery was a failure - then again all got together to pray for .... 
              An intelligent one would know that this is downrite stupidity!
              Prayer in any form to any ... is only prayer if it is of gratitude, however, that seems not to be the predicament of many - it is begging for ... a prayer of supplication.
              There is no dignity and it is ....
              
              wars, famine, poverty hunger disease ... preceded one's being born here and when one kicks the bucket -  it will still go on. 
              
              It is has been always the way it is and the only thing that can be attributed (in some instances ) is the abuse and misuse of resources by human beings cos of greed , eg logging or.
              Hence this adage that the madness of one is insanity and that of the masses is religion that is organized around certain beliefs.
              
              Ps - Yes, it is good to have beleifs but it is only good when one is dealing with dead things. The human dimension or the experince of existence (aka existential relevance) necessitates having UNlimiting beliefs!

              than simple <strong>linear</strong> approach. previous good deed
              can still reapen <strong>first,</strong> when given the right
              conditions, to someone that's bad and vise verse.</p>
              <p>seeds  + <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conditons</span> of sunlight, soil,
              water = reapen.</p>
              <p>no conditions = no reapen.</p>
              <p>it's not for us now to worry about the seeds we planted
              previously. more important is now, don't plant it for the future
              and stop the conditions of greed, hatred and folly.</p>
              <p>we have our more effective way of teaching unconditional
              compassion/loving kindness toward others.</p>

This is a highly simplistic view of karma and ultimately not very accurate, for as we know, bad things happen to good people, and vice versa.
