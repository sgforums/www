              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><strong>Here's a thought experiment that I just developed, which I want to pose to all of you.</strong></p>
              <p>Let's assume that you've become the supreme leader of the world, and you have to make recommendations for the lives of five billion people. Say you have only two choices:</p>
              <p>(a) Recommend that they become scientists.</p>
              <p>(b) Recommend that they pursue the truths of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Let's say that, whichever your choice, these five billion people excel at their given roles.</p>
              <p>A hundred years pass.</p>
              <p>------------------</p>
              <p>Depending on your choice, I suggest these will be your outcomes:</p>
              <p><strong>(a) Five billion scientists</strong></p>
              <p>These five billion scientists make wonderful progress in science, bringing about new methods of countering natural disasters. Cancer has been cured, while genetic engineering means that birth defects and diseases have been completely eradicated. We have new, sustainable ways of using our resources, ensuring the future survival of our planet.</p>
              <p>On average, life is substantially better for everyone. There is less poverty and hunger, fewer diseases, and so on.</p>
              <p><strong>(b) Five billion earnest, devout Buddhists</strong></p>
              <p>These five billion Buddhists build up a great deal of positive karma. A few of them actually achieve enlightenment, while the majority of others are able to build up good karma for future lives.</p>
              <p>However, the progress of science has halted. We continue to suffer from incurable diseases as we do today. Earthquakes and tsunamis continue to afflict us. We still do not have the means to sustain a population of seven billion.</p>
              <p>-----------------</p>
              <p>So here's the dilemma:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>The first group of scientists have built up no positive karma for themselves.</li>
              <li>However, through their efforts, the world has become substantially better to live in.</li>
              <li>Assuming rebirth, how then is it possible that these billion people are living better lives a 100 years later, given that there was no net increase in positive karma?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Conversely:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>The second group of Buddhists have built up positive karma for future lives.</li>
              <li>However, the world has not become appreciably better to live in.</li>
              <li>Assuming rebirth, how then is it possible to suddenly have billions of people living better a 100 years later, given that technology has not improved?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>To show that karma and rebirth is true, you have to demonstrate a reasonable way in which the second group will lead much better and more comfortable lives than the first group. Feel free to poke holes in my scenarios, if I've grossly misunderstood some of the concepts.</p>
              <p>But let's try not to appeal to the mysterious, and say that these are just things we don't understand. Look at this scenario logically, and tell me how we can explain the contradictions.</p>
              <p>This is also not a far-fetched scenario. Science has made our lives substantially better. The Internet, for example, has brought knowledge and empowerment to us in the developed countries, but also people in poor ones. The genetic engineering of crops has enabled us to feed billions of people, many of whom would otherwise starve.</p>
              <p>Then coming back to the first question: <strong>If you were the supreme ruler, and assuming you only had two options, would you recommend science or Buddhism?</strong></p>

              <p>It is impossible for everyone to dedicate to science, and everyone to dedicate to Buddhism.</p>
              <p>But if I can only choose between two, I will choose Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you... thousands of years of science can never cure suffering. Buddhism can end all sufferings and lead to the attainment of highest permanent bliss.</p>
              <p>Not that science is unimportant - it is damn important and without science, diseases can't be cured, and we won't have this Buddhist forum now.</p>
              <p>However, on the scheme of things, I prefer to end all suffering now... that is my top priority in life.</p>

              <p>actually that's not true. u are just making subjective illusive
              assumtion. the percentage that u think tested is not enough to make
              it work. our old Master Chin Kung did a similar experiment on a
              village in china and the lifes of that particular village became
              better.  it was shown to the World Conference on Religion and
              Peace. it WILL work if the whole world do it together not just
              potion by potion. </p>
              <p>in Buddhsim, spiritual power cannot defeat karma. science would
              not defect karma too. new type of dying illness or cancer will
              still emerge. science cannot stop natural disasters, but if all the
              world people turn good, it'll stop natural disasters. but it's
              imposible to proof it now. lol.  </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>1. I would be interested to see that experiment, but I highly doubt Chin Kung will be able to draw a direct causation between Buddhist beliefs and well-being. At the very best, he will be able to find a correlation, given the multiple confounding factors in a real-world situation.</p>
              <p>Also, without any advancements in science, how can collective well-being improve? Through what mechanism? Sure -- people will become nicer to each other. But do earthquakes suddenly stop happening? Does H1N1 just decide not to propagate?</p>
              <p>2. The reality is that advances in medicine means that the average life expectancy has increased tremendously over the past 2,000 years. The advances in technology means that most of us do not have to engage in dangerous, unfulfilling work, but can instead pursue idle pleasures like such debates.</p>
              <p>Do you know that the bubonic plague of the 14th century alone killed as many as 200 million people globally, wiping out perhaps half of Europe? Today, a devastation of that magnitude is unlikely to happen, partly because we have gotten better at finding cures, but also because we have better knowledge of disease prevention.</p>
              <p>There is therefore no question that science has made our collective well-being significantly better. It is the discovery and application of science, not because there are more Buddhists practioners building up better karma for themselves and their afterlives.</p>

              reasonable.atheist,
              Whatever u seem to be uttering has n may have validity within the realm of scientific researh and objectivity lah.
              However, the spiritual realm is subjective and no matter what, what cannot use the logic of the mind to pinpoint or say this is ......
              
              I suggest (not advice) experiment on this -  when u dont park ur mind (aka thoughts) on anything outside of u - watch the transforming ... . If u are earnest, u might have glimpses of what Buddha is , what ''God'' is, what Mohd is or ... whatever one labels it. 
              Notice that I have left out after these phrase ""watch the transforming"" Reason being that no conceptualisation suffices and it will be just the mind playing games!

              <p>1. I deliberately chose not to have all 7 billion people work as scientists, because I wanted to counter arguments such as yours. You can still have two billion people for other functions, such as growing food, running companies and so on.</p>
              <p>2. In any case, 5 billion is merely a hypothetical number. We can do 1 billion scientists versus 1 billion devouts Buddhists, if you prefer. The question remains: If you could choose 1 billion scientists or 1 billion Buddhists, which choice will bring about greater well-being to the world?</p>

Both my children and I won what I call the ovarian lottery. (For starters, the odds against my 1930 birth taking place in the U.S. were at least 30 to 1. My being male and white also removed huge obstacles that a majority of Americans then faced.) My luck was accentuated by my living in a market system that sometimes produces distorted results, though overall it serves our country well. I've worked in an economy that rewards someone who saves the lives of others on a battlefield with a medal, rewards a great teacher with thank-you notes from parents, but rewards those who can detect the mispricing of securities with sums reaching into the billions. In short, fate's distribution of long straws is wildly capricious."</span></div>

              <p>1. I would be interested to see that experiment, but I highly
              doubt Chin Kung will be able to draw a direct causation between
              Buddhist beliefs and well-being. At the very best, he will be able
              to find a correlation, given the multiple confounding factors in a
              real-world situation.</p>
              <p>Also, without any advancements in science, how can collective
              well-being improve? Through what mechanism? Sure -- people will
              become nicer to each other. But do earthquakes suddenly stop
              happening? Does H1N1 just decide not to propagate?</p>
              <p>2. The reality is that advances in medicine means that the
              average life expectancy has increased tremendously over the past
              2,000 years. The advances in technology means that most of us do
              not have to engage in dangerous, unfulfilling work, but can instead
              pursue idle pleasures like such debates.</p>
              <p>Do you know that the bubonic plague of the 14th century alone
              killed as many as 200 million people globally, wiping out perhaps
              half of Europe? Today, a devastation of that magnitude is unlikely
              to happen, partly because we have gotten better at finding cures,
              but also because we have better knowledge of disease
              prevention.</p>
              <p>There is therefore no question that science has made our
              collective well-being significantly better. It is the discovery and
              application of science, not because there are more Buddhists
              practioners building up better karma for themselves and their
              afterlives.</p>

              <p>That's incorrect. Bhutan is known for using a Gross National Happiness as a national goal and index. This does not mean that Bhutan is the happiest country in the world.</p>
              <p>In fact, the UN's happiness index has Bhutan at a lowly 141. Norway is ranked first, and is incidentally one of the most atheistic countries in the world.</p>

              <p>Even in terms of self-reported happiness (aka "subjective well-being"), Nordic and European countries appear to dominate.</p>
              <p>In addition, I suspect Bhutan will be ranked even lower if it did not have access to modern medicine and technology. So even here, it is not clear that Buddhism plays a larger role than science in driving well-being.</p>

              <p>That's incorrect. Bhutan is known for using a Gross National
              Happiness as a national goal and index. This does not mean that
              Bhutan is the happiest country in the world.</p>
              <p>In fact, the UN's happiness index has Bhutan at a lowly 141.
              Norway is ranked first, and is incidentally one of the most
              atheistic countries in the world.</p>

              <p>Even in terms of self-reported happiness (aka "subjective
              well-being"), Nordic and European countries appear to dominate.</p>
              <p>In addition, I suspect Bhutan will be ranked even lower if it
              did not have access to modern medicine and technology. So even
              here, it is not clear that Buddhism plays a larger role than
              science in driving well-being.</p>

              <p>2. Instead, the point I make is that non-belief in karma actually allows greater compassion, all else being equal. When you succeed in life, you don't have a sense of entitlement; you know that you were merely more fortunate than some others.</p>

              <p>Actually there is no argument that technology improves standard of living and promotes well being (people rather be living well than starving or dying). However, that doesn't change the fact that none of these have anything to do with awakening and permanent liberation from suffering and mental afflictions, and the attainment of the highest bliss of nirvana, which are all achievable in this life.</p>
              <p>In other words both are important to men's well-being, but only dharma leads to the ultimate well-being, freedom, and happiness.</p>

              A religious belief is n never (was) a statement about Reality (relative to what is or not is), but a mere hinting, a mere clue about something that is a mystery, which is beyond the grasp of the human mind. To put it another way, a religious belief can be likened to a finger pointing to a moon n some religious ones never get beyond or transcend this  ''studying'' of the finger. Some are engaged in â€™â€™suckingâ€™â€™ on it. Others worse still use the finger to gouge their â€™â€™eyesâ€™â€™ out. The latter can be likened to be bigots whom (organized) religion has blinded seeing. Eyes are a faculty, seeing is n art! The rare ones are indeed religionists who sufficiently detach from the finger to see what it is indicating(what is manfesting from the unmanifest_ â€” these are thoseâ€¦; having gone beyond belief, who are ''evolving'' 
              
              Till something becomes a reality (existential) in oneâ€™s living, oneâ€™s mere talking about, it amounts to lying. It is merely constipating with concepts and knowledge. Knowing is transformaing â€¦. a river flowing, knowledge is a pond â€“ stagnant and turning smelly. Teh latter may avail oneself to confuse psychological or social relevancy with/equate it as existential relevancy.
