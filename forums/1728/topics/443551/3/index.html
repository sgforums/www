              <p>Reaction to stimulus is not necessarily a sign of sentience. The mimosa pudica and the Venus Flytrap can both react to touch, and the latter is actually carnivorous. Are these plants also sentient?</p>
              <p>To be sure, I have argued <strong>for</strong> vegetarianism, but my rationale is clear -- the avoidance of suffering. In other words, creatures that cannot feel pain (e.g. shellfish) can be eaten under that guideline.</p>
              <p>In any case, the issue of vegetarianism is a diversion, so we don't have to continue this line of debate.</p>

              <p>The conditions behind the formation of a human being are extremely complex. Genetics, the quality of the sperm and egg, the nutrition to the foetus, the environment of the mother, etc. all impact the future condition of the child. Furthermore, genetic variability itself allows animals to better evolve and adapt to their environment, so mutations (both good and bad) may be relatively common in human beings.</p>
              <p>Given that the inputs are never exactly the same, is it surprising that different members of a family have different intelligence levels, different looks, and also potentially different genetic diseases?</p>
              <p>Again, karma is not required to answer your question.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Translator's note:</strong> Some people have interpreted this sutta as 
                  stating that there are many experiences that cannot be explained by the 
                  principle of kamma. A casual glance of the alternative factors here — 
                  drawn from the various causes for pain that were recognized in the 
                  medical treatises of his time — would seem to support this conclusion. 
                  However, if we compare this list with his definition of old kamma in <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.145.than.html">SN 35.145</a>,
                   we see that many of the alternative causes are actually the result of 
                  past actions. Those that aren't are the result of new kamma. For 
                  instance, <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.101.than.html">MN 101</a> counts asceticism — which produces pain in the immediate present — 
                  under the factor harsh treatment. The point here is that old and new 
                  kamma do not override other causal factors operating in the universe — 
                  such as those recognized by the physical sciences — but instead find 
                  their expression within those factors. A second point is that some of 
                  the influences of past kamma can be mitigated in the present — a disease
                   caused by bile, for instance, can be cured by medicine that brings the 
                  bile back to normal. Similarly with the mind: suffering caused by 
                  physical pain can be ended by understanding and abandoning the 
                  attachment that led to that suffering. In this way, the Buddha's 
                  teaching on kamma avoids determinism and opens the way for a path of 
                  practice focused on eliminating the causes of suffering in the here and 
                  now.</em></p>

              <p>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling near <a id="rajagaha" name="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> in the Bamboo Grove Monastery, the Squirrel's Feeding Place. There <a id="moliyasivaka" name="moliyasivaka">Moliyasivaka</a> the wanderer went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged 
                  courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings 
                  &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said 
                  to the Blessed One, "Master Gotama, there are some priests &amp; 
                  contemplatives who are of this doctrine, this view: Whatever an 
                  individual feels — pleasure, pain, neither-pleasure-nor-pain — is 
                  entirely caused by what was done before. Now what does Master Gotama say
                   to that?"</p>
              <p>[The Buddha:] "There are cases where some feelings arise based on bile.<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag " name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.021.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> You yourself should know how some feelings arise based on bile. Even 
                  the world is agreed on how some feelings arise based on bile. So any 
                  priests &amp; contemplatives who are of the doctrine &amp; view that 
                  whatever an individual feels — pleasure, pain, neither-pleasure-nor-pain
                   — is entirely caused by what was done before — slip past what they 
                  themselves know, slip past what is agreed on by the world. Therefore I 
                  say that those priests &amp; contemplatives are wrong."</p>
              <p>"There are cases where some feelings arise based on phlegm... based 
                  on internal winds... based on a combination of bodily humors... from the
                   change of the seasons... from uneven<a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag " name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.021.than.html#fn-2">[2]</a> care of the body... from harsh treatment... from the result of kamma. 
                  You yourself should know how some feelings arise from the result of 
                  kamma. Even the world is agreed on how some feelings arise from the 
                  result of kamma. So any priests &amp; contemplatives who are of the 
                  doctrine &amp; view that whatever an individual feels — pleasure, pain, 
                  neither pleasure-nor-pain — is entirely caused by what was done before —
                   slip past what they themselves know, slip past what is agreed on by the
                   world. Therefore I say that those priests &amp; contemplatives are 
                  wrong."</p>
              <p>When this was said, Moliyasivaka the wanderer said to the Blessed One: "<a id="magnif" name="magnif">Magnificent</a>,
                   lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was 
                  overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to point out the way to one who 
                  was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could
                   see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One — through many lines of 
                  reasoning — made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, 
                  to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. May the Blessed One 
                  remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day 
                  forward, for life."</p>

              <p>reasonable.atheist: like I said, you cannot prove karma scientifically, at least not now</p>
              <p>You can only find it out from meditation.</p>
              <p>But if you haven't done meditation, the only thing you can do is get acquinted with buddhism, learn the teachings of Buddha, and then decide yourself whether it is reasonable to have faith in that guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me it is reasonable because Buddha is like a scientist - whatever he teaches, he does not demand blind faith (but some reasonable faith to actually practice what he taught) and teaches us systematically how to experience everything he experienced. Of course, that, plus I have personally experienced stuff he taught in my life including the apparently but not actually elusive 'awakening' (not saying I'm a Buddha yet though)</p>

              <p>The conditions behind the formation of a human being are extremely complex. Genetics, the quality of the sperm and egg, the nutrition to the foetus, the environment of the mother, etc. all impact the future condition of the child. Furthermore, genetic variability itself allows animals to better evolve and adapt to their environment, so mutations (both good and bad) may be relatively common in human beings.</p>
              <p>Given that the inputs are never exactly the same, is it surprising that different members of a family have different intelligence levels, different looks, and also potentially different genetic diseases?</p>
              <p>Again, karma is not required to answer your question.</p>

              <p>May be it is more difficult to prove karma but rebirth is already scientifically proven. However, many people like you refuse to accept the fact. Dr. Ian Stevenson had done many research on rebirth to prove it. If rebirth is scientifically proven, karma can also said that it is scientifically proven.</p>
              <p>You may search "Dr. Ian Stevenson" at yahoo. Besides him, there are other scientists doing the same research till today. There's a book written by a Christian doctor about reincarnation. The book was based on  true cases which he came across when he was treating his patients.</p>

              <p>Before questioning whether shellfish can feel pain, have you attempted to run some quick Internet research?</p>
              <p>I've done my fair share of that, and the consensus seems to be some of the "simpler" animals cannot feel pain. Here's a quote:</p>
              <p><em><strong>Nociceptive nerves</strong>, which preferentially detect injury-causing 
                          stimuli, have been identified in a variety of animals, including invertebrates. 
                          Indeed, the <strong>leech</strong> and <strong>sea slug</strong> are classic model systems 
                          for studying nociception. However, it is believed that invertebrates are 
                          <strong>capable only of stimulus-response reactions</strong> and lack the necessary 
                          brain system that vertebrates have to process pain. </em></p>

              <li>When you say that a creature can feel pain, you are <strong>inferring</strong> based on the reaction you see. The human being's desire to anthropomorphize and find meaning can be extremely misleading. It is always good to question some of our own "common sense" assumptions.</li>

              <p>I've done my fair share of that, and the consensus seems to be some of the "simpler" animals cannot feel pain. Here's a quote:</p>
              <p><em><strong>Nociceptive nerves</strong>, which preferentially detect injury-causing stimuli, have been identified in a variety of animals, including invertebrates. Indeed, the <strong>leech</strong> and <strong>sea slug</strong> are classic model systems for studying nociception. However, it is believed that invertebrates are <strong>capable only of stimulus-response reactions</strong> and lack the necessary brain system that vertebrates have to process pain.</em></p>

              <p>I'll make two bigger points:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>When you say that a creature can feel pain, you are <strong>inferring</strong> based on the reaction you see. The human being's desire to anthropomorphize and find meaning can be extremely misleading. It is always good to question some of our own "common sense" assumptions.</li>
              <li>Let's say we agree that shellfish cannot feel pain. Would <strong>you</strong> then advocate that all Buddhists be allowed to eat them? Are you willing to deviate from dogma if the underlying assumptions are wrong?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Intentions are irrelevant here, I think. I have no bad intentions towards anything I eat, be it meat or vegetable. It's not personal -- I'm only concerned about satisfying my taste and hunger.</p>

              <p>Intentions are important... even science can prove shellfish feel no pain, we shouldn't eat them just to satisfy our craving. Compassion is heavily emphasized in Buddhism. That's why intentions cannot be neglected or ignored.</p>
              <p>If this topic is just purely about science, then it must not be linked or tied together with Buddhism to make it sound irrelevant/dogmatic whatsoever. Buddhism is more than that.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Translator's note:</strong> Some people have
              interpreted this sutta as stating that there are many experiences
              that cannot be explained by the principle of kamma. A casual glance
              of the alternative factors here — drawn from the various causes for
              pain that were recognized in the medical treatises of his time —
              would seem to support this conclusion. However, if we compare this
              list with his definition of old kamma in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.145.than.html">SN 35.145</a>, we see that many of the alternative
              causes are actually the result of past actions. Those that aren't
              are the result of new kamma. For instance, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.101.than.html">MN 101</a> counts asceticism — which produces pain in
              the immediate present — under the factor harsh treatment. The point
              here is that old and new kamma do not override other causal factors
              operating in the universe — such as those recognized by the
              physical sciences — but instead find their expression within those
              factors. A second point is that some of the influences of past
              kamma can be mitigated in the present — a disease caused by bile,
              for instance, can be cured by medicine that brings the bile back to
              normal. Similarly with the mind: suffering caused by physical pain
              can be ended by understanding and abandoning the attachment that
              led to that suffering. In this way, the Buddha's teaching on kamma
              avoids determinism and opens the way for a path of practice focused
              on eliminating the causes of suffering in the here and
              now.</em></p>

              <p>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling near <a id="rajagaha" rel="nofollow" name="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> in the Bamboo
              Grove Monastery, the Squirrel's Feeding Place. There <a id="moliyasivaka" rel="nofollow" name="moliyasivaka">Moliyasivaka</a> the wanderer went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged
              courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly
              greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting
              there, he said to the Blessed One, "Master Gotama, there are some
              priests &amp; contemplatives who are of this doctrine, this view:
              Whatever an individual feels — pleasure, pain,
              neither-pleasure-nor-pain — is entirely caused by what was done
              before. Now what does Master Gotama say to that?"</p>
              <p>[The Buddha:] "There are cases where some feelings arise based
              on bile.<a id="fnt-1" rel="nofollow" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.021.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> You yourself should know

              individual feels — pleasure, pain, neither-pleasure-nor-pain — is
              entirely caused by what was done before — slip past what they
              themselves know, slip past what is agreed on by the world.
              Therefore I say that those priests &amp; contemplatives are
              wrong."</p>
              <p>"There are cases where some feelings arise based on phlegm...
              based on internal winds... based on a combination of bodily
              humors... from the change of the seasons... from uneven<a id="fnt-2" rel="nofollow" name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.021.than.html#fn-2">[2]</a> care of the body... from

              contemplatives are wrong."</p>
              <p>When this was said, Moliyasivaka the wanderer said to the
              Blessed One: "<a id="magnif" rel="nofollow" name="magnif">Magnificent</a>, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to
              place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to
              point out the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the
              dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has
              the Blessed One — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma
              clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to
              the community of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay
              follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for
              life."</p>

              <p>Sorry for the hiatus. Let's get down to some responses, shall we?</p>
              <p>*Takes a deep breath*</p>
              <p>1.<strong>Karma or bile?</strong><br>In Christian counter-apologetics, there is an argument called the "God of the Gaps", which is used to explain how the concept of God is used to explain fewer and fewer phenomena, as the realm of science expanded over time. For example, ancients thought that lighting and thunder were caused by a God, until we understood the science. Now Christians move on to other yet-unexplained phenomenon, hoping to fill those gaps with God.</p>
              <p>Likewise, your anecdote of "karma or bile" is an example of this fallacy. In the past, probably many kinds of ailments were deemed to be caused by karma. These days, more of it is being understood within the realms of medical science, so the role of karma gets reduced even more. As we progress into a world of genetic engineering and terraforming, you begin to wonder: How small will the role of karma become?</p>
              <p>2. <strong>"Walk with me for a bit, and you'll understand </strong><strong>in time</strong><strong>."<br></strong>Virtually all religions will make the same request you did: You may not believe it at first, but listen/meditate with an open heart, and you'll eventually see the light.</p>
              <p>I have two problems with this. First, it is a win-win situation for you. If I do walk with you and eventually dismiss the idea of Buddhism/Christianity/Islam, the evangelist will simply say that I was not sincere enough. That places all the responsibility of accepting the faith on me, and none of your beliefs are put to the test.</p>
              <p>Second, as Caesar put it: <em>Fere libenter homines id quod volunt credunt. </em>Men<em> </em>will generally believe what they want to believe.</p>
              <p>"Faith" can be immensely powerful, which is why there are Buddhists and Christians and Muslims. But the fact that many believe in something does not make it any truer. If our objective is to find the truth, and not merely what is comfortable, then there must be other standards we aspire to. I submit that reason and evidence-based inquiry remain the only methods we know of uncovering the truth. And we seem to agree, the evidence for karma is extremely limited at this point.</p>

              <p>May be it is more difficult to prove karma but rebirth is
              already scientifically proven. However, many people like you
              refuse to accept the fact. Dr. Ian Stevenson had done many research
              on rebirth to prove it. If rebirth is scientifically proven, karma
              can also said that it is scientifically proven.</p>
              <p>You may search "Dr. Ian Stevenson" at yahoo. Besides him, there
              are other scientists doing the same research till today. There's a
              book written by a Christian doctor about reincarnation. The book
              was based on  true cases which he came across when he was
              treating his patients.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Rebirth is very far from being scientifically "proven".</p>
              <p>I haven't had the opportunity to read Dr. Stevenson's books, but I've seen excerpts and abstracts of his writings, digested similar papers from others (many of which are from the division he headed), and read critiques of his work. Here's a summary of three of major problems.</p>
              <p>1. <strong>Lack of rigor. </strong>While interviews and observations can be a valid scientific method, there is a lack of scientific rigor in Stevenson's work. For example, because he often worked with translators, he was not in a position actually evaluate the quality of the accounts. One of his books was originally rejected by the publisher because Stevenson's interpreter was found to have been dishonest. There were also other problems, such as the possibly of contamination. e.g. a girl who was able to sing in a foreign language might have heard and learnt the song over the radio.</p>
              <p>2. <strong>Non-falsifiability and confirmation bias.</strong>  When an account is found to coincide with actual events, Stevenson regards it as being a confirmation of rebirth. But when the account is found to be wrong, it may be regarded as a fantasy, and is not found to count <strong>against</strong> the idea of rebirth. This is related to the problem of a confirmation bias, where the scientist is eager to find examples that confirm his hypothesis. Here's an example:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">'He was fond of cases that seemed to beg for a paranormal explanation. For 
                  example, one case involved an Idaho girl who at age 2 would point to photographs 
                  of her sister, dead from a car accident three years before she was born, and 
                  say "that was me." The believer thinks the two-year-old meant: "I 
                  was my sister in a previous life." The skeptic thinks she meant: "That's a 
                  picture of me." The skeptic see the two-year-old as making a mistake. The 
                  believer sees her as trying to communicate a message about reincarnation.'</span></p>
              <p>http://www.skepdic.com/stevenson.html</p>
              <p>3. <strong>Inconsistency with the Buddhist concept of reincarnation. </strong></p>
              <p>Stevenson (1983) published a paper entitled "American Children Who Claim to Remember Previous Lives". The abstract states that American children who claim previous lives usually "speak about the lives of deceased members of their own families". Indian children, on other hand, talk about memories of a previous life in a different family or community.</p>
              <p>http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/1983/12000/American_Children_Who_Claim_to_Remember_Previous.6.aspx</p>
              <p>If we assume for one moment that Stevenson's concept of rebirth is true, how does it gel with the Buddhist concept of reincarnation? Not very well, I think. Why would Americans get reborn more as Americans, while Indians are reborn more from other communities? You may appeal to mystery, and say that the workings of karma are unknowable. But I have a better answer: The study suggests that the accounts of karma are a cultural construct. It differs depending on the norms of each society. And if it is a cultural construct, it cannot be a natural law.</p>
              <p>I know this is a long reply, and you may not read it all. But my takeaway point is this: Stevenson's work is disputed, and -- as far as I can see -- not taken seriously by most other scientists. Reincarnation is <strong>very far</strong> from being scientifically proven.</p>
