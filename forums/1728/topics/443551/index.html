              <p>First of all, many thanks to those who gave very detailed replies to my questions on karma in the other thread. I've still wrapping my head around all of the jargon, but I do want to make a couple of observations about Buddhism based on a high level view.</p>
              <p>Based on my very limited knowledge of religion as an academic topic, the "theology" of most religions comprise two components:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>A statement of what is objectively Right and, conversely, what is Wrong. Some examples would be the ten commandments of the Bible, or the dictum to reduce suffering in Buddhism.<br></li>
              <li>A system of rewards and punishments. In many religions, this is the concept of heaven and hell, while karma in Buddhism possibly falls into this category.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Neither of these works on its own. If you know what is Wrong, but there are no repercussions to committing a Wrong, then you might continue to do wrong. Alternatively, if you have no idea what is Right/Wrong, then there would be no way you can avoid punishment or move towards reward.</p>
              <p>Now, there are philosophical problems with each of these, and I might go into them later. But for now, I would like to understand, does (2) exist in Buddhism? Does the system of karma function as a reward/punishment mechanism, or is Buddhism mainly about (1)?</p>

              <p>You study physics before? Do you know what is Van Der Waal principle / forces.</p>
              <p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/waal.html">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/waal.html</a></p>
              <p>If it is labelled under science, will you label such principle as moralistic or reward/punishment?</p>
              <p>What if the principle of karma is a principle similar to Van Der Waal forces. Similar polarisation somehow clums together. What if the various realm like hell, heaven are like similar inclination Beings clumming together. If similar attracts similar, does it still constitute a punishment / reward system? Just an analogy, though.</p>

              <p>Unlike other religions which believe there's a God, they believe their God judges who are supposed to go to heaven and who are supposed to be condemned to hell. In Buddhism, karma is a "no man operation", karma is law of nature, no one has control or can overrule it, not even God or Buddha. Buddha is the enlightened one who understands how karma works.</p>

              <p>First of all, it strikes me that Buddhism has many diverse interpretations.

I wonder if all the knowledgeable posters here agree with the supernatural aspects of Buddhism.</p>
              <p><strong>simpo_</strong> and <strong>Dawnfirstlight</strong>: The discussion about karma as a law of nature is common, and in effect, I think you are agreeing with me. In Christianity, the system of reward/punishment is administered by a supreme being, like a judge would. In Buddhism, the system of reward/punishment is a law of nature, and no one is able to transcend it.</p>
              <p>In both of these cases, it appears that (2) of my original thesis holds: Karma <strong>is</strong> the mechanism of reward/punishment in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>What exactly is karmic retribution though? It is again extremely diverse from the little I've read of it. Some say it is visited upon children, or that natural disaster can happen to a society of many evil-doers as karmic retribution. Is that the conventional idea?</p>
              <p>For now, I will accept the assumption that the karmic process is able to precisely identify the impact of free will (assuming there is such a thing). But I still have two main philosophical problems with the concept of karma:</p>
              <p>1. It is non-falsifiable.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>When bad things happen to evil people, we say that it is karma at work. <br></li>
              <li>When bad things happen to good people, we say that they are paying for transgressions in their past lives. <br></li>
              <li>If good things happen to evil people, we say the timing is not yet right. <br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>In other words, there is no way of proving or disproving karma, because there is an explanation for every scenario. Something that is non-falsifiable may still be correct, but the simpler explanation then is that it does not exist.</p>
              <p>2. It is non-specific.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Why do I care that karmic retribution will be visited upon my next life, given that I have no awareness of it at all? In other words, all suffering is endured in the next life, and not by my present consciousness.</li>
              <li>Is it fair that a child may have to bear the karmic retribution of a parent's wrongdoings? If my father decided to be a mass murderer, how am I morally responsible for it?<br></li>
              <li>If a natural disaster hits Singapore as karmic retribution to the evil-doings of some or most of its inhabitants, is it fair that the remaining good people also have to suffer?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The non-specificity of the idea of karma adds to its general vagueness and non-falsifiability. More than that, I think that non-specificty is inefficient and potentially unfair.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you have arrived at the conclusion that karma does not exist, then I can safely said your conclusion is a fallacy. When a thing does not exist it can only live in our imagination. It is a construction of our intellect. We can place imagination into 2 categories, one which is based on actual perception and where the judgment of it, is arrived at through negation. The other is called a problematic judgment as the knowledge of it does not lead to any purposive action. It is something beyond sensory experience. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you think karma does not exists, try punching the guy next to you, I believe the working of Karma can be immediately felt. The problem of believing in the existence of karma is the difficulty in the proof of the link between the cause and its effect. Time here is the biggest factor and so is its effect, which may not be so concrete and tangible for one to experience with our senses. Some actions take longer than others for its effects to be felt. That can certainly be proven in our daily lives experience itself. <span> </span></span></p>

              <ul>
              <li>When bad things happen to evil people, we say that it is karma at work.<br></li>
              <li>When bad things happen to good people, we say that they are paying for transgressions in their past lives.<br></li>
              <li>If good things happen to evil people, we say the timing is not yet right.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>In other words, there is no way of proving or disproving karma, because there is an explanation for every scenario. Something that is non-falsifiable may still be correct, but the simpler explanation then is that it does not exist.</p>
              <p>2. It is non-specific.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Why do I care that karmic retribution will be visited upon my next life, given that I have no awareness of it at all? In other words, all suffering is endured in the next life, and not by my present consciousness.</li>
              <li>Is it fair that a child may have to bear the karmic retribution of a parent's wrongdoings? If my father decided to be a mass murderer, how am I morally responsible for it?<br></li>
              <li>If a natural disaster hits Singapore as karmic retribution to the evil-doings of some or most of its inhabitants, is it fair that the remaining good people also have to suffer?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The non-specificity of the idea of karma adds to its general vagueness and non-falsifiability. More than that, I think that non-specificty is inefficient and potentially unfair.</p>

              <p>Karma is not as simple as 1+1=2. I think only Buddha or enlightened ones are able to discern it. There are individual karma and collective karma. Why a child is being born in this family and not other family? This is due to their collective karma. Meaning the child has the same karma as the family. Good karma family will attract child with good karma and bad karma family will attract child with bad karma. Thus, what the parents have done have nothing to do with the child.</p>
              <p>Natural disasters are also due to collective karma. Example of collective karma is a group of people burning the forest. This group of people are committing the same sin. Burning of forest kills many animals and other living things which is considered a bad deed in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Many people have mistaken that karma only happen in next life which is not true. There are some deeds which karma will ripen in this life. For instance, ill treating parents, slandering or killing sangha etc.</p>
              <p>Don't you think the explanation of karma is more logical and sensible than saying it is Higher Being's will or due to individual's luck?</p>

              at the conclusion that karma does not exist, then I can safely said
              your conclusion is a fallacy. When a thing does not exist it can
              only live in our imagination. It is a construction of our
              intellect. We can place imagination into 2 categories, one which is
              based on actual perception and where the judgment of it, is arrived
              at through negation. The other is called a problematic judgment as
              the knowledge of it does not lead to any purposive action. It is
              something beyond sensory experience.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you think karma
              does not exists, try punching the guy next to you, I believe the
              working of Karma can be immediately felt. The problem of believing
              in the existence of karma is the difficulty in the proof of the
              link between the cause and its effect. Time here is the biggest
              factor and so is its effect, which may not be so concrete and
              tangible for one to experience with our senses. Some actions take
              longer than others for its effects to be felt. That can certainly
              be proven in our daily lives experience itself. <span> </span></span></p>

              <p>I don't need karma to explain why I get punched, if I decide to hit someone with no reason. I can explain it with human nature.</p>
              <p>The ä¸�æ˜¯ä¸�æŠ¥ï¼Œæ—¶è¾°æœªåˆ° principle is precisely what makes it non-falsifiable. If I get hit back, it's because of karma. If I don't get hit, it's because karma will strike later. Either way, there's no way of knowing whether karma is really present.</p>

              <p>yes, in theory, you will never be able to prove karma as a science.  This is because of the limitations of your sensory perceptions, time and space.  As Buddhists, we go ahead and practice, then through practice, we will come to see the workings of karma more and more.  </p>
              <p>child can bear karmic consequences of parents because when child is born into that family, he is also drawn by his karmic forces to lock into the outcome that will ripen his karma.  This is still fair.</p>
              <p>mass group karma is also fair.  there are many people who also escape from the mass disaster and these people do not have that karma to suffer in this disaster, that's why they escaped.  Doesn't mean that the number of people who suffer is many therefore, it is not due to karma.  Karma still working.</p>
              <p>next life you and present life you is same stream of consciousness. There will still be suffering.  You are suffering now from your past life karma, are you aware and care about it?</p>

              <p>The fact that a "good" child is born to a good family really shouldn't be a mystery. Your family influences who you are, both in terms of genetics and cultural/educational upbringing. Again, there really is no need to postulate for karma.</p>
              <p>I find it hard to accept that natural disasters are due to collective karma. Japan has been the site of numerous earthquakes for thousands of years, even before World War II. I also find it unfair that, say, a child has to die today in an earthquake because of a war that his grandparent fought.</p>
              <p>Karma may be more interesting than the idea of a God, but I don't see evidence for either. Why is a country hit by earthquakes? You could say it's because of karma, but the scientific -- and, I would argue, better -- answer is that there is a build-up of energy beneath the earth's crust, culminating in a catastrophic release. Why does a person win the roulette? You could say it's karma, but it's really because of the speed of rotation of the roulette wheel, the direction of the throw, etc.</p>

              <p>The fact that a "good" child is born to a good family really
              shouldn't be a mystery. Your family influences who you are, both in

              really is no need to postulate for karma.</p>
              <p>I find it hard to accept that natural disasters are due to
              collective karma. Japan has been the site of numerous earthquakes
              for thousands of years, even before World War II. I also find it
              unfair that, say, a child has to die today in an earthquake because

              <p>Karma may be more interesting than the idea of a God, but I
              don't see evidence for either. Why is a country hit by earthquakes?
              You could say it's because of karma, but the scientific -- and, I
              would argue, better -- answer is that there is a build-up of energy
              beneath the earth's crust, culminating in a catastrophic release.
              Why does a person win the roulette? You could say it's karma, but
              it's really because of the speed of rotation of the roulette wheel,
              the direction of the throw, etc.</p>

              <p>As we dive into ever-deepening questions of "why", there could indeed be a time when our science can no longer hold the answers. But that still doesn't mean that karma would be the answer. I actually prefer An Eternal Now's point about being "born" in a disaster area due to karma, although that's still not falsifiable.</p>
              <p>Science is falsifiable. Countless past scientific theories have been debunked. Even today, the possible presence of a faster-than-light neutrino gives us some difficulties.</p>
              <p>Science is predictive. Using physical laws, I can predict predict when the next solar eclipses are for the next 1000 years.</p>

                      <p>...<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">It was this 
                                        important text, which states the belief that all physical circumstances 
                                        and mental attitudes spring solely from past Karma that Buddha contradicted. 
                                        If the present life is totally conditioned or wholly controlled 
                                        by our past actions, then certainly Karma is tantamount to fatalism 
                                        or determinism or predestination. If this were true, free will would 
                                        be an absurdity. Life would be purely mechanistic, not much different 
                                        from a machine. Being created by an Almighty God who controls our 
                                        destinies and predetermines our future, or being produced by an 
                                        irresistible Karma that completely determines our fate and controls 
                                        our life’s course, independent of any free action on our part, 
                                        is essentially the same. The only difference lies in the two words 
                                        God and Karma. One could easily be substituted for the other, because 
                                        the ultimate operation of both forces would be identical. </span></p>

It is a constructed imagination of our intellect that cannot product any form of purposive action. It is not a valid knowledge. But as a Buddhist, to me, there are also imagination that are based on reality through indirect sensuous perception that are considered right knowledge as it can lead one to taking purposive actions. One of these beliefs is in the existence of kamma. </span></span></p>
