So I will put some hints... We are blinded by our senses when we invest in concepts.. For it is only in concepts that we differentiate states and realms... Are we different from a dog? Only in concepts, in essence just emptiness and conditioned arising (which is emptiness). All and whatever realm it is, it is formless, attributeless and emptiness.. arising and ceasing with luminous-emptiness as its nature. Without personality and without self. The 'reality', the realness, the observed, heard, the nature is emptiness. The 'reality' has no reality apart from the conditions of arising.<br><br>If we are blinded by pragmatism, we will not see that the essence of emptiness is also not just in daily engaging of activities. We must know and see both the importance.<br><br>Lastly, if you haven't notice, the Buddha and all the great enlightened practitioners (and I mean very high levels of enlightenment) all practice sitting.<br><br>Here's something that Thusness told me some days back,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sit and when getting involved in daily activities, be total in action (non-action). It is of different dimension. Both are equally important. They serve different purposes, just like eyes and ears organs serving different purposes, but luminosity are present. A person getting very involved in activities may not be able to just sit and similarly a person that is only involved in sitting does not know how to deal with the world.<br><br>However once non-action is complete, one should be able to sit and also involve in worldly affairs. When a person has no contraction, he sits without discomfort for his mind is clear and stable.</span><br><br>BTW regarding ants, Longchen said something some months back:<br><br><strong>...Ants are all busy with their daily activities, doing what they are programmed to do... oblivious to all the other things that goes on around them. A single rainfall, will kill them in an instance and their myopic obsession and plans will come to a meaningless grinding halt.<br><br>Likewise, all the activities of the world rolls on with blind ignorance and stupidity... seeking meaning in the meaningless.<br><br>This is the world for you and me. Doing things that will eventually come to a rude and grinding death. All the fame, glory of the world come to such eventual dissapointment and end.</strong></div>

If we can't how can we make big claims when we can't even sit? How many can drop off body mind in meditation and just sit? If one can't, one should just "sit down and shut up" instead of babbling about being able to meditate equally in daily lives. Sitting and living serves different purposes, both are needed. But our Buddha Nature, luminous-emptiness/the inseparability of appearance and emptiness, is everpresent.<br><br>My Taiwanese teacher (as I mentioned he sits up to 6 hours a day), makes his students sit 1~2 hours with him every time. Those who receive dharma transmission from him are told to practice sitting regularly.<br><br>Thusness, our experienced forummer, who has a very busy life and also often talks about the importance of non-dual in daily activities, would be retiring in 2 years time, where he will be around 42 years old. After that he will spend many months overseas in deep meditative retreat, and also, he wants to spend (in Singapore) at least 4 hours everyday to do sitting.<br><br>In the sutras, it is stated that Bodhisattvas too will have to spend certain lifetimes hidden in the jungles and caves, dedicating their lives totally to self cultivation and meditation.<br><br>(10:42 PM) Thusness: although experiencing dharma in daily activities is important, know the importance of sitting.<br>(10:44 PM) Thusness: Your master chen once made comments about the theravada** on the aspect of sitting because they skewed towards sitting but he himself sat for 6 hours and tell only disciple that can sit more than half an hour can recieve direct teaching from him.  Why is this so?<br>(10:45 PM) Thusness: he wanted to stressed the over-emphasis of 'sitting' in the Theravada tradition and neglecting engagement and seeing dharma in daily activities.<br>(10:46 PM) Thusness: But that is because one fail to 'see' the importance of practice dharma in the daily activities.<br>(10:47 PM) Thusness: It is not to say 'sitting' is not important.  It is in fact very very important.<br>(10:48 PM) Thusness: But the truth of dharma should be seen in all moments.<br>(10:49 PM) Thusness: Equal emphasis of 'sitting' have been stressed in all traditions, in the past till now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>(10:50 PM) Thusness: Do not mistake that 'dong zhong xiu' is 'higher' than 'qing zhong xiu'.<br>(10:58 PM) AEN: oic..<br>(10:58 PM) AEN: ya true<br>(11:01 PM) Thusness: u were reminded of the importance in seeing dharma by engaging in daily activities by ur masters...in fact many of the threads u have stated that.  There is no doubt about it.<br>(11:02 PM) Thusness: But that should not be 'over-emphasized' either.<br>(11:02 PM) Thusness: <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>** just a note: my teacher wasn't pointing at the Theravada tradition but generally any 'xiao cheng' practitioners who focus mainly on sitting all day alone to train up their practice and samadhi and attain private liberation. certainly not all theravada teachings overemphasize sitting over daily practice.</div>

They are actually on the same 'level', though it appears that one is in front of another. Furthermore, you will only perceive the legs moving in a single direction, though it is equally 'valid' of both directions.

The Three Characteristics</a><br><br>As I wrote previously that Nirvana is Samsara rightly seen, and,<br><br><blockquote>As Nagarjuna said, "That which, taken as causal or dependent, is the process of being born and passing on, is, taken noncausally and beyond all dependence, declared to be nirvana." And as David Loy said so nicely in <a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm" rel="nofollow">The Difference between Samsara and Nirvana</a>: There is only one reality -- this world, right here -- but this world may be experienced in two different ways. Samsara is the "relative" world as usually experienced, in which "I" dualistically perceive "it" as a collection of objects which interact causally in space and time. Nirvana is the world as it is in itself, nondualistic in that it incorporates both subject and object into a whole which, Madhyamika insists, cannot be characterized (Chandrakirti: "Nirvana or Reality is that which is absolved of all thought-construction" ), but which Yogacara nevertheless sometimes calls "Mind" or "Buddhanature" and so forth.</blockquote>As for what are we to be aware? There is no fixed objects, even though in meditation one's mindfulness may be concentrated in one's breathing. But it is not a fixed object but a whole conditioned-arising-luminous-empty-process, and mindfulness does not require any particular objects. We can be mindful all the time.<br><br>When we are mindful, we will be aware of our thoughts, and not be lost in our thinking. Necessary thoughts can arise but we are conscious of them. Not only are we mindful in our thinking, we are also attentive of everything -- even a speck dust that passes by, one who is mindful and alert will be able to know it. For a Buddha -- a flower that blossoms in another universe, he will know it as if it is in the palm of his hands.<br><br>And the nature of all phenomena will be witnessed moment to moment.<br><br>All these are already elaborated previously.</div>
