The dog is only going to see black and white. Why? Because the nature of the flower is Empty -- there is no graspable 'Essence of Flower' or the 'Flowerness of the Flower' -- Flower is empty of any inherent existence, being only conditioned arising, merely the aggregation of causes and conditions, and having no reality apart from it!<br></strong><br></blockquote>This is refining the non-dual experience with the emptiness nature of our awareness from a Buddhist perspective.  It will reduce the Â‘gaspingÂ’ of self significantly if experienced intuitively.  That said, we should also bear in mind that the purpose of expounding the emptiness nature of any arising is to realize that the Â‘transientsÂ’ are really our very Buddha nature.  Ultimately Â‘emptinessÂ’ is still a Â‘raftÂ’ that must be discarded.  Practice must enable us to experience the Â‘<strong>the most real</strong> of the appearancesÂ’ -- the full vivid aliveness yet empty at that moment.  This is the luminous aspect of practice.<br><br>Just to illustrate a little on the example of 'flowerness':<br><br>There is no Â‘the flowernessÂ’ seen by a dog, an insect or us. Â‘The flowernessÂ’ is an illusion that does not stay even for a moment, merely an aggregate of causes and conditions.  Analogous to the example of Â‘flowernessÂ’, there is no Â‘selfnessÂ’ serving as a background witnessing either -- pristine awareness is not the witnessing background.  Rather, the entire whole of the moment of manifestation is our pristine awareness; lucidly clear, yet empty of inherent existence.  This the way of Â‘seeingÂ’ the one as many, the observer and the observed are one and the same.

A mind that is dualistic is quick to objectify Â‘formlessness and atribute-lessÂ’ into an empty-invisible-void entity observing transients manifestation.  It Â‘dualifiesÂ’ form from formlessness and attempts to separate from itself.  This is not Â‘IÂ’, Â‘IÂ’ am the changeless and perfect stillness behind the transients appearances.  Therefore Â‘impersonalityÂ’ appears cold and lifeless.  But this is not the case for a non-dual practitioner in Buddhism.  For him/her, the Â‘formlessness and attribute-lessÂ’ is vividly alive, full of colors and sounds.  Â‘FormlessnessÂ’ is not understood apart from  Â‘FormsÂ’ Â– the Â‘form of formlessnessÂ’, the texture and fabric of awareness. They are one and the same.</div>

There is no question of effort; the only effort comes from the sense of Â‘selfÂ’.  When Â‘non-dual and emptyÂ’ is fully experienced in our cells and flow in our blood like how dualistic-propensities have so deeply tainted the 5 aggregates, action becomes effortless.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br>Practice is about losing oneself and all merely happens as if 'you' never existed. One must eventually undergo a complete psychological death, and be completely dead in the living. As the saying goes -- die before you die. At that moment, deep dreamless sleep where the self completely subsides, is no longer different from conscious state. There is no more attachment, no more unwillingness and grasping to the need to 'exist' consciously. One requires fearlessness to dissolve this habit of 'self-preservation'... and when that is done, samatha and insight becomes one.<br></strong><br></blockquote>What will this give rise? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Because if it is an experiential insight, one also realises the intrinsic luminosity of appearances.<br><br>As I wrote, (because all is empty), <span style="font-style: italic;">Whatever arises is the whole universe manifesting as that moment. Know that the universe is giving its very best for this moment to arise. All conditions and causes are just right for the birth a moment of manifestation. When this is understood, the 'conditioned arising' is really unconditioned, all spontaneously arise.</span><br><br>The focus here is on the 'spontaneous arising'.<br><br>I further wrote:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">And all conditioned arising is an expression of the unconditioned Buddha Nature. All that is arising is the Buddha. They are all your pristine awareness at that moment with its nature empty -- never the same and never remain (having no existence and reality apart from conditioned arising), <strong>nothing apart from the crystal clear manifestation of appearances. Completely and fully real and gone.</strong></span><br><br>Thusness adds:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Thusness:</div><div class="quote_body">An extra point:<br><br>Here the highlight must not only be the empty nature of Â‘soundÂ’ alone, that luminosity as Â‘soundÂ’ must similarly be emphasized.  When we stripped-off the symbolic representation of Â‘birdÂ’, Â‘chirpingÂ’, Â‘outsideÂ’, Â‘eyes-organÂ’, Â‘ears-organsÂ’, Â‘senate realityÂ’ and merely experience in bare, this is the meditative state of intuitively knowing that quality of being  luminous in oneness.  Oneness as there is nothing to divide when devoid of these symbolic layering.  The depth of the crystal clarity of that pure experience Â– Â‘chirpingÂ’ is not what language can convey.  The point here is not to bring about a scientific study on the topic of qualia but to have a direct feel of the full absorption in the delight of that clear-luminosity of Â‘soundÂ’.  It is the Â‘depth and degreeÂ’ of absorptive-clarity yet non-staying that is most important; not the symbolic understand of meanings.<br><br>It may be a good prompt at this juncture to ask "Is remaining Â‘in the mode that is free of symbolsÂ’ the only way to experience non-duality?"<br><br></div></blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by Thusness:<br><br>This is refining the non-dual experience with the emptiness nature of our awareness from a Buddhist perspective.  It will reduce the Â‘gaspingÂ’ of self significantly if experienced intuitively.  That said, we should also bear in mind that the purpose of expounding the emptiness nature of any arising is to realize that the Â‘transientsÂ’ are really our very Buddha nature.  Ultimately Â‘emptinessÂ’ is still a Â‘raftÂ’ that must be discarded.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practice must enable us to experience the Â‘<strong>the most real</strong> of the appearancesÂ’ -- the full vivid aliveness yet empty at that moment.</span>  This is the luminous aspect of practice.<br><br>Just to illustrate a little on the example of 'flowerness':<br><br>There is no Â‘the flowernessÂ’ seen by a dog, an insect or us. Â‘The flowernessÂ’ is an illusion that does not stay even for a moment, merely an aggregate of causes and conditions.  Analogous to the example of Â‘flowernessÂ’, there is no Â‘selfnessÂ’ serving as a background witnessing either -- pristine awareness is not the witnessing background.  Rather, the entire whole of the moment of manifestation is our pristine awareness; lucidly clear, yet empty of inherent existence.  This the way of Â‘seeingÂ’ the one as many, the observer and the observed are one and the same.  This is also the meaning of formlessness and attribute-less of our nature.<br><br>How does a dualistic mind see it?<br>A dualistic mind understands differently.  A mind that is dualistic is quick to objectify Â‘formlessness and atribute-lessÂ’ into an empty-invisible-void entity observing transients manifestation.  It Â‘dualifiesÂ’ form from formlessness and attempts to separate from itself.  This is not Â‘IÂ’, Â‘IÂ’ am the changeless and perfect stillness behind the transients appearances.  Therefore Â‘impersonalityÂ’ appears cold and lifeless.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But this is not the case for a non-dual practitioner in Buddhism.  For him/her, the Â‘formlessness and attribute-lessÂ’ is vividly alive, full of colors and sounds.  Â‘FormlessnessÂ’ is not understood apart from  Â‘FormsÂ’ Â– the Â‘form of formlessnessÂ’, the texture and fabric of awareness. They are one and the same.</span></strong></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The development of this vision is said to spread like a forest fire, until the sense of a subject subsides of its own accord. One experiences the primordial wisdom in which as soon as an object appears, one recognizes its emptiness as being the same as the voidness of one's own state. The inseparability of emptiness and vision, and the presence of the state and emptiness are all experienced together. <strong>Then everything can be said 'of one single taste', which is the emptiness of both subject and object.</strong> Dualism is completely overcome. Although there is, on the one hand, still the manifestation of the play of energy which, in the dualistic state, we take for objects, and, on the other hand, the cognitive capacity that in the dualistic state we take for a separate subjective self, because of the uninterrupted presence of contemplation we no longer experience the illusion of a dualism between one and the other. This is the state pointed to in the last of the Six Vajra Verses:<br><br>Seeing that everything is self-perfected from the very beginning,<br>the disease of striving for any achievement<br>comes to an end of its own accord,<br>and just remaining in the natural state as it is,<br>the presence of non-dual contemplation<br>continuously, spontaneously arises.<br><br>~ Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche<br>---------------------<br><br>When 'one taste' is realised, there is no external 'form', 'objects', nor a cognitive subject/self, but just One whole non-differentiated experience of vibration... Which means, there is no body, nor pillow nor sound nor the door... just that pure experience of vibration.<br><br>Everything becomes 'deconstructed' and disintegrates into the basic pure experience of 'One Taste'. As ChNNR said, <span style="font-style: italic;">'Although there is, on the one hand, still the manifestation of the play of energy which, in the dualistic state, we take for objects, and, on the other hand, the cognitive capacity that in the dualistic state we take for a separate subjective self, because of the uninterrupted presence of contemplation we no longer experience the illusion of a dualism between one and the other.'</span><br><br><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/different-degrees-of-non-duality.html" rel="nofollow">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/different-degrees-of-non-duality.html</a><br><br>Thsuness says: "4.

Everything that is a shape and color is included in the source of consciousness (Sanskrit: ayatana) that is called form. The shapes and colors that appear to the eyes are found in all of the aspects of the environment in which we live, as well as in all of the sentient beings who inhabit this environment. What is the true nature of the appearances of shapes and colors of the environment and sentient beings? It is that they are dependently arisen mere appearances, which do not exist in essence. The forms that appear do not truly exist. In the abiding nature of reality, their nature is emptiness. They appear while being empty; while empty, they appear. They are appearance-emptiness like rainbows, water-moons, and reflections. All of the objects that appear to the eyes are appearance-emptiness undifferentiable...<br><br>...In our waking life, even though the environment and sentient beings appear to us, the supplication says "let them rest where no self's found." The environment and sentient beings appear, but let them rest without clinging to them as truly existent. Let them rest in their natural state of appearance-emptiness without fixating on them as being real. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When we let the appearances rest without fixating on them as being real, all of the thoughts of there being an actual object out there to perceive and an actual distinct subject perceiving it just dissolve. The thoughts that take the duality of perceived object and perceiving subject to be real dissolve. They are purified.<br><br>When that happens, everything shines as luminous emptiness, clarity-emptiness.</span> At this point, you are ready to meditate on the deity, because the deity's enlightened body is also appearance-emptiness. It appears while it is empty; it is empty while it appearsÂ—it is like a rainbow. When you meditate on the deity, everything appears as the body of the deityÂ—appearance-emptiness....</span></strong></div>
