There he addressed the monks: "Monks, suppose that a large glob of foam were floating down this Ganges River, and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe it, &amp; appropriately examine it. To him Â— seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it Â— it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in a glob of foam?
