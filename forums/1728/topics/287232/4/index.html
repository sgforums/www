A person can sit and just doze off, no awareness, or enter an absorption where 5 senses shut off but produces no insights or wisdom.

We need to be able to rest in naked awareness beyond symbols and concepts. In our daily lives we are too 'used' to the symbolic world that we become 'in control' of it, our minds are no longer able to rest without symbols and this will prevent further insights.<br><br>From <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=262408" rel="nofollow">Transcript of the Lankavatara Sutra sharing by Thusness</a>:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Ok, now back to Lankavatara Sutra. When we say about... uh, a symbol. Name. Can a mind function without a name, or a symbol? This is something that is very important. I remember during my university days, a professor took out a book and said, tell me what is this. Then he took out something that weÂ’ve never seen before. You just observe only, what is that? You just see only, very attentive, you just look at it. There is no symbol for it, because we cannot identify it. But does that mean that you are enlightened? So we must know that seeing things beyond symbols is still not enough. It is still not sufficient.<br><br>So what they meant that to come to a stage of knowing your own reality, there are many conditions. One of them is the capacity to see beyond symbols. But it does not mean that to see beyond symbols, you are enlightened, you can see reality. The second conditions is the experience of Presence. That is the I AMness. That is also very important. This, and the capacity to see in raw, and, the ability to feel every moment as arising and ceasing and passing away, this three conditions must be present. Means that if you do not experience the luminous clarity even just a glimpse, the condition is not there.<br><br>Uh, somebody sent a.... ok, the issue of other power. IÂ’ll read about that later. Now I want to talk about the conditions to want to see clarity, to see that all is One Mind. There must be the condition of experiencing Presence. That is a moment of luminosity. There must also be the condition that one is able to see things in raw, means bare attention for a prolong period of time. Means at least half an hour, 20 to 30 minutes, continuously. One must be able to continuously see, touch, and feel in raw. That is beyond symbols.<br><br>The third thing is to know about the power of the momentum. Now, the momentum will seem to react very fast only when your mind is really not focused, when your mind is chattering, when your mind is very busy. Your momentum will seem to be very fast. But when you are able to settle your thoughts and see in raw, the momentum seems to be very slow. They arise slowly, and then you can see that they subside. This means that the speed of arising and subsiding becomes very slow. Ok, only when you are able to see this momentum, you'll know what "oh, I made this decision and this way of perception because this momentum is reacting". Then, the condition is present for you to see what reality is all about. Otherwise, reality will always be mistaken as perception, or as an objective world, or as an Eternal Witness. Do you all get what I mean?<br><br>{End of Part 1}</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Spell of Karmic Propensities</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The following article is a summary (by me) of some of the conversations Thusness had with me on the topic of Karmic Propensities/Karmic Momentum/Deep Conditionings and how it blinds us and completely affects the way we see phenomena.</span><br><br>Karmic Propensities is what blinded us from seeing the ultimate reality. Our entire mind is affected by karmic propensities such that our entire system of enquiry, even when we want to inquire on reality, we cannot know beyond "Who", "When", "What", "Where". Our mind is always thinking dualistically, in terms of subject and object (an I and a Not-I/an Observer apart from the Object of Observation, which cannot be found in reality). It is a momentum that cannot be located, yet it can be directly felt and experienced, and the momentum arises every moment and affect the entire way we see things. When we are affected by momentum the mind cannot know the ultimate reality (Emptiness).<br><br>Because our momentum is at work, we will always assume a subject-object duality. That is, there is a Self, an Agent, and observer, doer, thinker of thoughts. A self that persists in time in a connected way... experiencing things... It blinds us into seeing self and objective world as 'entities', as 'things' with inherent existence, as a separate and permanent 'me'.<br><br>So when momentum is in action, we cannot help but react with our karmic patterns. If we were to ask, "If you lost your shoe, are you still you?" or "If u lost ur hands, do u still exist?". It almost seems certain to say "Yes, of course I am still I." because we always assumed there is a truly existing "Self" experiencing changes. This momentum can continue even after experiences of transcendental Presence, and distorting the experience. Dharma Dan calls this the "fundamental knot of perception". (See: The Non-Duality Models of Enlightenment by Dharma Dan)<br><br>Because it is our habit energy that made us think that way, we are so used to thinking in terms of subject object duality that it has become so deeply part of us, deeply imprinted into our consciousness.<br><br>If we were to eliminate this bond, then we can begin to realise, there is no "Self". In reality, there is only Self1, Self2, Self3, moment to moment our mental and karmic factors arise spontaneously but not in a connected way. We are not a permanent self, we are momentary selves and nothing stays, everything is ever flowing.<br><br>Without seeing things as 'entities', we can begin to realise the nature of Dependent Co-Arising, Conditionality, Interdependence, etc, i.e Emptiness. The nature is always so, but our karmic propensities obscure us from seeing the truth, distorting the way we see things, enquire things, and perceive things. It is this bond that bonds us life after life in Samsara.<br><br>To eliminate the bond we have to feel it, feel the power of the bond, experience it. To eliminate the bond is a matter of insights, the insight into our true nature, the insight into self-liberation, etc. Not only must we eliminate the bond, we must be able to see how "Propensities" blinds us, and that is through naked awareness.<br><br>How can naked awareness lead to the insight of our "Propensities"?<br><br>Space, time, life, death, in and out are all Â‘deeply heldÂ’ impressions. We are seldom aware of the Â“deeply heldÂ” until we are able to rest adequately in naked awareness. The nakedness creates the big contrast that provides us the condition for the arising of the insight of the 'deeply held'. The insight into the full power of our Â‘propensitiesÂ’ and resting in naked awareness are both equally crucial in our understanding of our non-dual (no subject-object duality, no separate permanently existing self) and non-local (emptiness of locality) nature.<br><br>To consciousness 'propensities' (deep conditioning or imprints) are all that matters. It is the only 'force' that blinds, bonds and prevents a liberating experience. Once formed it remains latent and only surface when conditions are riped for fruition. We are unable to get rid of it by will. Therefore to know consciousness, it is also to know the impact of deep conditioning, how it is formed and how it subsides. There is really no 'why', it is just how consciousness works.<br><br>If we drop our body, we experience astral body.<br>If we drop our thoughts, we experience Â“I AMÂ”.<br>If we drop Â‘IÂ’, we experience non-duality.<br><br>Every major dropping results in a totally new experiential reality. Perhaps that is why Lao Tze teaches us to eliminate until none to experience Tao.<br>To drop the bondage/deep conditionings, the mind MUST realise that another way of 'knowing' is possible; an effortless, total sensing and experience of wholeness. Next the experiences of the joy, bliss and clarity of wholeness. Without the insight into the possiblity and the experience of the positive factors, the mind will not release itself from holding.<br><br>Even open pure and innocent inquiry is a deep conditioning. Makes the mind chatters incessantly. Every what, when, where and why by itself is a distancing from start. Freeing itself from such mode of inquiry aka 'knowing', the mind rests. The joy of this resting must be experienced for the 'willingness' to arise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>P.S. there are different types of meditative bliss/joy/rapture.<br><br>Like samatha meditation, each jhana state represents a stage of bliss associated with certain level of concentration; the bliss experienced from insight into our nature differs.<br><br>The happiness and pleasure experience by a dualistic mind is different from that experienced by a practitioner. Â“I AMnessÂ” is a higher form of happiness as compared to a dualistic mind that continuously chatters. It is a level of bliss associated with a state of Â‘transcendenceÂ’ Â– a state of bliss resulting from the experience of Â“formlessness, odorless, colorless, attributeless and thoughtlessnessÂ’.<br><br>No-self or non-dual is higher form of bliss resulted from the direct experience of Oneness and no-separation. It is related to the dropping of the Â‘IÂ’. When non-dual is free from perceptions, that bliss is a form transcendence-oneness. It is what Thusness called transparency of non-duality.</div>

But when we are tired, we let go and rest naturally.  Tiredness and let go if viewed correctly are one.  So when Buddha said "Life is suffering", it is a great wisdom -- nothing pessimistic or negative.   Our mind filter very quickly and we may missed the 'great condition'  for letting go to arise.
