              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“‘What
              is not given is lost.’ These words were spoken by Father Ceyrac, a French
              Jesuit missionary who has devoted himself to the wellbeing of children in South
              India for over sixty years. A similar thought is found in Buddhist teaching:
              ‘What is not done for the benefit of others is not worth doing.’ Seeking
              happiness just for yourself is the best way there is to make yourself, and
              everyone else, unhappy.”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Whenever
              you think about generosity, one of its opposites appears along with it—greed,
              or stinginess or acquisitiveness. A well-known Thai abbot, Achaan Jumnien,
              invented a long-running spiritual practice organized around these opposing
              themes. Perhaps ten years ago, he had a canvas harness made for
              himself—something like a fisherman’s vest. Whenever anyone gave him anything—a
              watch, money, a bottle of water, a radio, a cup, healing medicines, an amulet
              or two—he would fix it on the harness. He bristled with objects; it was the
              kind of thing that would have made him a career in the art world. He
              accumulated things and from time to time passed them on, but first he wore
              them. He said the whole apparatus weighed about sixty pounds. He took it off to
              sleep, but otherwise he walked around in it, carrying the burden of everything
              he received.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              had come to Spirit Rock, in Northern California, where we talked together
              through translators. In one of those conversations, he mentioned a friend of his
              who was an even more successful abbot than he, and very wealthy. That wealth
              was good, Achaan Jumnien said, because it allowed his friend to help people.
              “Perhaps,” he said, amused, “he is wealthy because he is more generous than
              me.” But the abbot with the harness was also generous in many ways—with his
              teaching, with his smile, with his unsolicited advice, and with his homemade
              healing medicines. He was generous with appreciation, too. When Jack Kornfield
              introduced us, he explained that I, too, was an abbot, which was a generous
              estimate of my importance. Achaan Jumnien immediately commiserated, saying what
              a rotten job it was. He was so enthusiastic about how dreadful it was that I
              took the message that it was an excellent rotten job and not to be given up.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Achaan
              Jumnien had his own origin myth about how he took up the Buddha way, and it
              went like this: as a child he once sat in meditation all day without moving,
              just to prove that he could. He fell into a deep inward place, and after that
              his mind changed completely. He did seem to have a tremendous feel for the
              emptiness shining inside things.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              I saw him a year later, he had ended the experiment with objects and taken off
              the harness. His performance left me with an image of someone exploring the
              theater of ownership, gifts, and generosity—how we love to receive things and
              how they begin to own us, and also how we can be free of them and in some way
              step into emptiness by passing them on. It was an example of the way art can be
              more instructive than a sermon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              discovery of emptiness is a kind of falling in love. There is a vertigo in it:
              we step off the cliff of what we know and are certain about. During a retreat,
              for example, when I’m doing interviews, someone will bring in a common
              object—an oak leaf, a rusty pipe wrench found on a path—and put it on the
              altar. That objects then becomes the thing that contains all the trees and the
              stars and belongs with the Buddha statues and other representations of
              eternity. We can allow objects to act on us so profoundly that afterward we are
              not the selves we thought we were.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              I first started to notice emptiness, it went like this: “Oh, I thought I was a
              man, but actually I’m like that branch,” or “Oh, I’m like the checkout girl
              with the nose piercings and the graffiti tattoo around her bicep. I’m not one
              tiny bit different from her.” This is an appreciation of the varied ways of
              life—that the dog has buddhanature and so do I. Next the understanding of
              emptiness becomes “Oh, I’m not like that tree; I am that tree. I’m not like
              that girl; I am that girl.” The erotic falling-in-love quality comes from
              noticing that I’m not outside the world any more, watching—instead I am the
              world unfolding—the eager dog, the drought in Australia, the homeless person in
              Santa Monica who offers me some excellent chocolate cake. Vertigo is a natural
              reaction: “I thought I knew who I was, but I’m not sure anymore.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              earth is generous, giving me tomatoes and basil and lemon verbena and marjoram
              and chardonnay grapes, all now withering in the autumn. And the generosity
              comes out of a relationship: I planted the tomatoes in spring, gambling on
              whether or not there would be another frost. The fact that there might be a
              frost that would ruin all the work is part of the game.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              Heart Sutra” records the discovery of emptiness, and I like to imagine that the
              template for this discovery is a naked meeting with the world. The lover takes
              off her clothes, and stretches alongside you, and you both become lost. It’s
              not so hard to see that the lover becomes you. This is such a fundamental act
              that perhaps it is the model for all giving.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Suffering
              might be the absence of such a meeting. Suffering is what happens when we are
              lonely and forget that we participate in the world. People often complain about
              love, or at least about its consequences, but welcoming the consequences is
              part of the game of generosity too. The earth gives a Yes without regard to
              what is given back, and being a human is also a gift, not a purchase. Even the
              No’s we get are gates to the generosity of the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Those
              gifts that are precious to the giver are especially interesting. A friend told
              me a story on this theme: “When I was in kindergarten, a little boy had a White
              Stag jacket. He took off the zipper pull, which had a little deer on it, and
              gave it to me. It was a lovely thing to him, and I still remember it.” When
              someone gives you something precious it means that, beyond the usefulness of
              the gift, you are precious. The gift marks a moment when you are welcomed into
              the other person’s heart.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Inside
              the teaching of Zen there is an understanding that gifts are like that zipper
              pull: They drag us into a world in which dogs and deer and even we have
              buddhanature. Generosity trusts the emptiness that runs through things, even
              ungenerous or ungainly things—it links to the clarity that underlies all our
              madness. Whenever my thoughts turn toward greed, acquisitiveness, or
              stinginess, my shoulders tense up, and it feels as if I’m holding my breath. To
              find a remedy, I don’t have to improve my thoughts, though—just be generous
              with them. Then freedom seems to appear automatically.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the end, generosity doesn’t have reasons. Generosity might be strategically
              effective or virtuous, but that’s not important. The point is that there is no
              good reason to love life or each other, yet we do. Generosity keeps faith with
              our appreciation of each other, it stems from a natural empathy with everything
              that, like us, has the courage to take a shape in the world.</span></p>
