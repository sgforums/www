It is not just a sweetener along a practitioner spiritual quest.  However more often than not, due to our egoic patterns, such abilities will disturb our blissfulness nature.   But with the strength of wisdom, it  can help in breaking certain karmic propensities that latent deep in us and speed up our spiritual progress tremendously.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

My Shi Fu actually once looked into a building and all the visions and images of the entire building's past, who build it, when was it built etc spontaneously manifested to him. He asked those around him to look and it will reveal, but even Missionary Chen could not understand him at that time. In another instance, in one of his dharma talks, he said that 'there is something very strange and amazing' - that we can all access the past in a few hundred years time (advanced technology?) and everything that is said in this talk will be seen (not by audio and video but literally like "accessing the past")</blockquote>My master too had 'perceived into the very distant past' and seen the 'celestial type light beings' and taught that all these can be verified through one's practise.<br><br>Interested people can see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=185514" rel="nofollow">Nu Wah</a><br><br>The fifth post, on 'The Earth People: Genesis in Buddhism'<br><br>Regarding this, although similar texts can be found in the Buddhist canon, it is not commonly mentioned until my master began to promote this idea as he felt that it should be better known. Some people in the past criticise my master for making unfounded claims, until Master Hui Lu or someone else? Who was known to have read the Tripitaka/all the sutras 3 times over confirmed that this is indeed taught by the Buddha.<br><br>The dharma centers of my buddhist organisation has even started publishing English books on that (for free distribution) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> with a slightly edited/clearer translation.<br><br>Anyway it just proves that everything that Buddha said can be verified through one's cultivation and practise... and interestingly what the Buddha taught about cosmology, etc, are completely in sync with the understanding of modern science.</div>

It appears that you believe certain parts were add-ons, or apart from the essence of the teaching. Are there any parts in particular? And why?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Dan<br><br>Answer: The New Testament contains deep spiritual truth as well as distortions.  Those distortions are of two kinds.  Some are due to a misunderstanding of JesusÂ’ teaching, others arose because people had an agenda (wanting to fit Jesus into their preconceived notions, wanting to make converts etc.).  At some point, if there is another book, I may write about this in more detail.  But you can find all this out for yourself.  When you are present, you access your inner knowing and you will sense what is true and what was added on or distorted.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.inner-growth.info/power_of_now_tolle/eckhart_tolle_interview_parker.htm#3" rel="nofollow">http://www.inner-growth.info/power_of_now_tolle/eckhart_tolle_interview_parker.htm#3</a><br><br>....The texts I came in contact withÂ—first I picked up a copy of the New Testament almost by accident, maybe half a year, a year after it happened, and reading the words of Jesus and feeling the essence and power behind those words. And I immediately understood at a deeper level the meaning of those words. I knew intuitively with absolute certainty that certain statements attributed to Jesus were added later, because they did not "emanate" from that place, that state of consciousness, because I knew that place, I know that place. But when a statement emanates from that place, there is recognition. And when it does not, no matter how clever or intelligent it may sound it lacks that essence and it does not have that power. In other words, it does not emanate from the stillness. So that was an incredible realization, just reading and understanding "beyond mind" the deeper meaning of those words....</blockquote><blockquote>From: The Arising of New SPIRITUALITY in All Religions<br><br>.....And yetÂ…. And yetÂ… in spite of all the insane deeds perpetrated in the name of religion, the Truth to which they point still shines at their core. It still shines, however dimly, through layers upon layers of distortion and misinterpretation. It is unlikely; however, that you will be able to perceive it there unless you have at least already had glimpses of that Truth within yourself...</blockquote></div>

I mentioned this this in the other topic too. Thusness too mentioned this is the greatest problem... this caused Christianity to be in a pitiful state.<br><br>This is one of the reasons why gnosticism (I'm not supporting or not supporting gnosticism because I know too little about it) in Christianity has arisen, it is to go against the monopoly of the Church over control. There can be no monopoly over Truth.</div>

We are <strong>NOT</strong> trying to question your faith in Jesus. We are trying to question the man-made, "mind dominated" religion created around Jesus that claims to be representative of him. And it's not the religion that is the issue, it is the people, those mind dominated institutions that work just like an Ego which tries to monopolize Truth and control people - those <span style="font-style: italic;">institutionalised hierarchies felt threatened by them (true spirituality) and often tried to suppress them</span>. They are very political.. 'God' has been abused.<br><br>Now, we know why there are so many divisions in Christianity. It is because these institutions are mind dominated, egocentric. Church politics are very common and bad. Each church teaches that it is right and others are wrong, so which is right? Know that the truth shines at the core beyond all the layers of mind made misinterpretation and distortions. There can only be unity if Christians truly realise the Truth of what Jesus taught first hand, not saying that bible is unreliable but one must develope an intuitive understanding of what Jesus was trying to teach, one will then recognise the jewels of the words of Jesus and also not fall prey to the attempts to control the minds of those who are unaware.<br><br>And then we hear of fanatics, even Christian terrorists who are using the name of God for violence. Certainly you will think that they are misguided ones.. yes, they are misguided. Similarly there are many others who are misguided by the the distortions of what is supposedly to be from Jesus, or distorted by the churches' interpretation of things.<br><br>The world has undergone several evolutions in consciousness, from the world of mythology (i.e Old Testament period) to religion, philosophy to science and so on. How is one able to go beyond all these influences and conditionings and distortions and politics, to touch the transcendental? This is the question. In Buddhism, it is through the teachings of no-self and emptiness. In Christianity it is a little different; it is by faith, the grace of God, and surrender/submission to the divine will. Therefore I am not trying to promote Buddhism to you (only unless you are open to it, otherwise, Buddhist don't practise evangelical conversions). Christianity is essentially a relationship with God. For this matter, to truly touch the transcendental, I would suggest you read up on the contemplative literature of Christianity, i.e those by Father Thomas Keating, Bernadette Roberts, Meister Eckhart, St John of the Cross or the book 'The Cloud of Unknowing', etc. Eckhart Tolle (a modern teacher who is <span style="font-style: italic;">not aligned with any particular religion or tradition, but excludes none</span>) is also a good read.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Luke 17:20-21, "Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, 'The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, nor will people say, "Here it is," or "There it is," because the kingdom of God is within you.'"<br><br><a href="http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm" rel="nofollow">Gospel of Thomas</a> (my favourite gospel): 1 And he said, "Whoever discovers the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death."<br><br>2 Jesus said, "Those who seek should not stop seeking until they find. When they find, they will be disturbed. When they are disturbed, they will marvel, and will reign over all. [And after they have reigned they will rest.]"<br><br>3 Jesus said, "If your leaders say to you, 'Look, the (Father's) kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is within you and it is outside you.<br><br>When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty."[/quote]<br><br>The Kingdom of God that Jesus taught isn't just some imaginary places in the sky, it is a spiritual kingdom. It is beyond what our ordinary minds can even conceive or imagine.. it is transcendental. It is not far away and has to be experienced... therefore Jesus taught that one must be truly 'Born Again'.<br><br>From <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=196664" rel="nofollow">Is God A Thing?</a><br>[quote]Originally posted by casino_king:</div><div class="quote_body">GOD is Spirit according to the Bible. What is spirit, you might say? I can only speak based on my own relationship with God and I tell you that I have no wish to define God for you or anybody because as far as I am concern, GOD is beyond's any man's comprehension and you only communicate and have a relationship / be aware of God in your own life.<br><br>How a man ends up being aware and have a relationship with God is by being "born of the spirit." I certainly know that I was born again. When you are born again, "angels" and "heaven" and your whole being rejoices.<br><br>It is not much different then when a baby is born, except that this is personal. You are the one that rejoices with the "heavenly beings."<br><br>I put them all in " " because you might have a different understanding of those words in " " that I used.<br><br>Many Christians here cannot accept what I say, even though it was Jesus who said, "You must be Born Again" and "You must be born of the Spirit" and insists that it is simply "believe, have faith" and not a "new birth" in you (the other school hope that as long as you believe you then assume you have new birth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) As if you need to hope and not know something so obvious as a new birth in yourself.<br><br>I believe that Enlightenment has the same effect. If you are Enlightened please tell me what it is like.</div></blockquote>But again, if one is too dogmatic tightly hold on what he presumed is ultimate and is afraid to look deeper into truth itself, then it will impede one's spiritual progress... due to clinging to untruth.<br><br>That's all I have to say about Christianity, because too much of it is said in a Buddhist forum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>As for teachings: there are priests and popular preachers who are given to ritual and ceremony and who are skilled in the various incantations and in the art of eloquence; they should not be honored nor reverently attended upon, for what one gains from them is emotional excitement and worldly enjoyment; it is not the Dharma. Such preachers, by their clever manipulation of words and phrases and various reasoningÂ’s and incantations, being the mere prattle of a child, as far as one can make out and not at all in accordance with truth nor in unison with meaning, only serves to awaken sentient and emotion, while it stupefies the mind. As he himself does not understand the meaning of all things, he only confuses the minds of his hearers with his dualistic views.</blockquote>- The Lankavatara Sutra</div>
