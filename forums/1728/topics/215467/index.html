Unconditional love not only destroys aversion, it can dissolve the seperate-self sense. Fear, just like any sentient thoughts are ripples on the surface of our universal mind which is beyond time and space, the alaya vijnana. Waves cannot be afraid that other waves will devour them up unless they mistake that one wave is seperate from another. You cannot be afraid of other beings if all beings are you, are one.</div>

Other than our six consciousness which in buddhism is our five sense consciousness plus the mind consciousness, what some mahayana schools call the seventh consciousness is refering to the illusory sense of self. In buddhism the self is an illusion. What we perceive to be self is actually the five skhandas, which is actually forms and mental processes but are all conditioned arisings empty of inherent existence/self. If you still don understand can consult neutral onliner or check out some of his related topics <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The eighth consciousness, also used only in mahayana traditions is refering to our universal mind. But due to our habit energies and grasping, we plant karmic seeds on the eighth consciousness. All our experiences are also recorded as memories in the universal mind, and thus it has a name called the storehouse consciousness. Its nature is pure, but due to sentient beings like us, there are ripples, movements on the surface.</div>

Even before reaching the final stage... a practitioner's states of consciousness is distinctively different from the non-practitioners. My awareness does have a certain vividness... but it is not totally purified.<br><br>Talking about stages...the first teacher who first taught me how to interpret dream...and set me on a serious and rather tough path, she (to me) is omniscient with the abilty to know things.  For example...she has percieved into the very distant past when humans where still celestial type light beings. She saw how these pre-indivduated 'beings' becomes our current human type...

(stage one)<br><br>A seed of your fearful experiences or memories or somehow tricked in the into believing that lizards and cockroaches are scary or harmful arises from your 8th consciousness, and thus you recognised what you saw as 'cockroach' or 'lizard'. (stage two).<br><br>Due to ignorance and habitual energies the seventh consciousness (self-sense) starts fearing for himself, fears that he will get hurt, aversion arise, disgust, etc due to activities of the discriminating mind. (stage three) You kill the cockroach or lizard, creating karma (stage four).<br><br>Based on teacher chen's analogy, different story. You just have to stop seeking to avoid whatever you are experiencing at that moment. Even if you experience fear (stage three), experience the fear directly as it is and make no more mental reactions to it. Then stage 3 ceases.<br><br>We have to be completely vulnerable and willing to experience directly what we usually perceive as hurtful, not only cockroach but also death, loss, etc. It can only be possible when your entire self (seventh consciousness) is completely annihilated/let go, you become 'mr transparent' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>This is well written!<br><br>Do know the relationship between name, labels and self.

Just this flow of sensation, impression and perception.  When without any extra layer of symbols being superimposed upon them,  it will unlock all mysteries of life.   It is that simple.
