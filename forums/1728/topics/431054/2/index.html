                      Hi buddhisthub, did u try to prepare å¤§æ‚²å’’æ°´ for your mum? You can try do it for seven consecutive days or maybe long term. Everyday try to target to chant up to one hour for å¤§æ‚²å’’æ°´ with sincerity n faith. Longer the better.
                      In Tibet, the monks always prepare ç”˜éœ²ä¸¸ in temple. This is the size of Bo zhai Yun pill. ç”˜éœ²ä¸¸is consists of rare minerals  that can only found in Tibet. These rare minerals and monk relics and herbs are grind into powered form and make into pill form. During cooking period, these lama would chant in front of it for seven consecutive day non stop, either å¤§æ‚²å’’, om mani padme hum or amituofu. These pills are known to have strong healing powers n benefit those sick ppl but only ppl with ç¼˜ can get it from these lama. Of cos, there may be fake one ard oso. 
                      So since it's difficult to get such pills, so maybe can try out the å¤§æ‚²å’’æ°´. No harm trying de. Ur normal routine of amituofo chanting still can carry on as per normal de. Tsfer merit to her n her karmic debtors. Best if she can chanting herself.  Heaven and Guan Yin will be moved by your filial actions.

              <p>Yeah, there are special herbs or special recipe for health in Tibet. I heard from my friend that his friend's father had cancer and doctor in Singapore told him there was no hope. He was very sad and the doctor asked him to bring his father to Tibet as there might be some hope.</p>
              <p>I'm surprised that doctors in hospital also believed in Tibetian medicine because usually western doctors don't believe in eastern medicine or herbs. I do not know whether his father was cured or not. I understand that the doctor ever witnessed some people in Singapore went to Tibet and were cured, that was why he advised them to go Tibet to seek treatment.</p>
              <p>I also wonder these cancer paitents seek  treatments from Tibetian lamas or from the hospital in Tibet.</p>
