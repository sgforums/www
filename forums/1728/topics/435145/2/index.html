              Of course It's not so easy to get dengue fever but  rather kill all mosquitoes I see rather than to get it.
              
              Cockcroaches can spread diseases hor. See dowan kill is dumb. Rats also.

              I spare insects like butterflies,beetles,ants,lady bird though. They post no threat.
              
              I kill pests to save people from possible harm not with evil intentions. 
              
              Lizards can help to eat mosquitoes in my house. They are welcomed to stay in my house.
              
              Like got pig pandemic also got to kill pigs right to save our country. Lastime in the past pandemic outbreak also got to sacrifice the people in the villages.

              Dengue is another problem. It's hard to know if the mosquitoes is aedes or not so must try to kill when spotted.
              
              I at night also wake up to kill mosquitoes if they bite me.
              
              I do not spare pests when I see them. I don't think I am doing anything wrong. 
              
              I also put cockcroaches traps in my house and caught some cockcroaches.

              <p>the way to prevent cockroaches in the house is to clean all drainage and not keep leftover food or uncovered food all over. for mosquitoes, the prevention is removing all stagnant water. it is Always the lack of prevention that breeds pests.</p>
              <p>if already there is someone in the house who's stricken with dengue, then an exhume may be required. but this doesn't mean we disrespect life forms. all forms of life deserve respect, and we must accept that killing will reap one day.</p>

              <p><em>Hello, my master Ven. Shen Kai offered a solution to Ants and
                                      Cockroaches. He also mentioned about mosquitoes (but I can't
                                      remember well for that one). I will summarise a few points
                                      below.<br><br><strong>Ants</strong></em> <em> - put some Mei2 You2 near their home, they
                                      dislike the Mei2 You2 and will definitely move away from their home
                                      to somewhere else. To give the ants a sense of direction where to
                                      go you may put some food nearby, and they will go and live there.
                                      But don't put the food too far as it may be difficult for them to
                                      travel that far distance.<br><br><strong>Cockroach</strong></em> <em> - get some empty Wu3 Jia1 Pi2 Jiu3 (a
                                      type of Chinese traditional beer?). Cockroaches love to have a beer
                                      and will all go inside. Then you can throw the cans into a dirty
                                      place i.e trash can and let them live in their paradise. I don't
                                      know about other beers, you all could experiment yourself.<br><br><strong>Mosquitoes</strong></em> <em> - I can remember only he mentioned two
                                      ways - burning that mosquito 'incense', or using some kind of
                                      electronic device that could make them sterilised and not be able
                                      to reproduce babies.<br><br> So we do not necessarily need to kill them to get rid of the pests.
                                      Wisdom will be of good use.</em></p>
              <p><em>My Master taught - to develope Great Compassion one must start
                                      by not harming, and protecting animals no matter how tiny they
                                      are.<br><br> Even though these animals may be tiny - if you can kill small
                                      animals, one day you might kill bigger animals, then killing humans
                                      no longer seem a difficult task to do.</em></p>

              <p>there's a method by å…ƒéŸ³è€�äººYuanyin i heard before, which i believe, but it can be quite misleading and advance. sort of like instead of letting the ant reborn back as ant again and again, isn't it better to help them reborn in higher realm when they die etc.</p>
              <p>there are many stories as below in the pali SUTTAs mentioning on this.
              </p><p>we can learn some of this.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>ANIMALS GO TO HEAVEN<br style="max-width: none;"><br style="max-width: none;">The Buddha teaching is unique amongst the world religions: it is not only for humans and gods; it is also for animals. There are numerous stories that relate how animals who associate with good humans or are well treated, go to heaven after they die.<br style="max-width: none;"><br style="max-width: none;">The first example is that of the Bodhisattva’s HORSE Kanthaka. The Introduction to the Jataka Commentary (which is one of the earliest records we have of the Buddha’s early life) tells us how when the Bodhisattva Siddhattha renounces the world, his horse Kanthaka is so deeply saddened that he dies broken-hearted, but obviously with a wholesome last thought-moment. He is reborn as the deva Kanthaka in the heaven of the Thirty-three Gods (Sakra’s heaven).<br style="max-width: none;"><br style="max-width: none;">The next famous animal story is found in the story of the Buddha’s solitary retreat in the Parileyya. The Vinaya (V 1:337-357) records how in the 10th year of the ministry, when a dispute arises amongst the monks of Kosambi who even tell the Buddha off when he tries to counsel them. After trying hard to reconcile them and failing, he quietly leaves for a solitary retreat in the Parileyya forest where he is attended by a like-minded ELEPHANT (he leaves his own tribe for the joy of solitude). Watching how the Buddha prepares warm water every morning the elephant Parileyyaka himself prepares it for the Buddha. He also offers the Buddha wild fruits and takes care of his robe and bowl.<br style="max-width: none;"><br style="max-width: none;">A MONKEY, watching the elephant, offers the Buddha a honeycomb. Later, however, in his excitement, the monkey falls on a sharp stump, immediately dies and is reborn in the heaven of the Thirty-three Gods. So too the elephant, who becomes the deva Parileyyaka. This full story is given in the Dhammapada Commentary (see “Buddhist Legends,” book 1 story 5).<br style="max-width: none;"><br style="max-width: none;">Then there is the well known story of the FROG deva in the Vimana Vatthu (Vv 852-88). It is said that once a frog sits listening to the Buddha teaching. Although not knowing human language, it is captivated by the Buddha’s soothing voice. As he listens entranced, a farmer, leaning on his pole, immediately pierces him to death. The frog is reborn in the heaven of the Thirty-three as Manduka Deva (the frog deity). He appears before the Buddha in all his glory to sing his praises. (The full story is given in the Vimana Vatthu Commentary: see “The Minor Anthologies” vol 4 pages 102 f.)<br style="max-width: none;"><br style="max-width: none;">One of the longest stories in world literature, that is, the Udena cycle, found in the Dhammapada Commentary (book 2 story 1). It is actually a cycle of nested stories spanning many lives leading to the Buddha’s time. In one of the stories, during a plague, a poor luckless wandering man named Kotuhalaka reaches a herdsman house and is given some food. The herdsman feeds his DOG with the same food. Kotuhalaka looks with envy at the dog. That night, Kotuhalaka dies from over-eating, and his thinking about the dog leads him to be reborn as the bitch’s puppy.<br style="max-width: none;"><br style="max-width: none;">Now, a pratyeka Buddha (a solitary fully self-awakened Buddha who does not establish his teaching) regularly comes to the house for alms, and the dog (Kotuhalaka) takes a liking to him. When the pratyeka-buddha finally leaves, the dog is saddened and dies. The commentators remarks that dogs, unlike humans, are straightforward and lack deceit. So upon dying, he is reborn in the heaven of the Thirty-three as a deva.<br style="max-width: none;"><br style="max-width: none;">One of the most famous animal stories is that of the Abhidhamma bats. The Dhammapada story (book 14 story 2) tells us in an interesting aside, that 500 youths, witnessing the Buddha perform the twin wonder (a miracle of fire and water radiating from his body), decide to go forth under Sâriputta. It is said that in Kassapa Buddha’s time, they were BATS living in a cave where two monks were reciting the Abhidhamma. So enthralled were they by their sound, although not knowing its meaning, they pass away into the heavens, and are reborn in Sâvatthî. (See “Buddhist Legends” 3:51 f)<br style="max-width: none;"></p>
