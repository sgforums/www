              <p><a href="http://www.existentialbuddhist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_3954.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-292" title="IMG_3954" src="http://www.existentialbuddhist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_3954-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853"></a>The Second Buddhist Precept states simply:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I undertake the training rule to abstain from taking what is not given.</p>
              <p>AdinnÄ�dÄ�nÄ� veramaá¹‡Ä« sikkhÄ�padaá¹ƒ samÄ�diyÄ�mi.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This means abstaining from taking what belongs to others — in other 
              words, stealing. Unlike the Judeo-Christian Eighth Commandment, it’s not
               a divine edict.  It’s training in the practice of non-greed for the 
              good of one’s character and for the happiness of oneself and others.</p>
              <p>Most of us don’t go around breaking and entering, mugging, or 
              shoplifting, so it would seem that abstaining from stealing should be a 
              relatively easy matter — but it’s not. There are more subtle forms of 
              theft — downloading and uploading copyrighted material without 
              permission, underreporting cash income on one’s taxes, using ideas 
              without attribution, bringing paper clips home from the office, 
              inflating damage estimates for insurance reimbursement.  The temptation 
              to petty larceny runs deep within the crooked human heart, and aspiring 
              to impeccability requires some heavy lifting.</p>
              <p>Corporations can also violate the Second Precept.  Ethical businesses
               obtain raw materials and labor at a fair price and create something of 
              value which they sell at a fair price.  Ethical businesses also abstain 
              from passing hidden costs along to stakeholders.  Companies that 
              purchase raw materials from developing nations at unfair prices, exploit
               workers through unfair wages and working conditions, expose consumers 
              to risk through unsafe products, and pollute the environment are 
              engaging in a form of theft.  So are industries that systematically 
              mislead others about the real costs of their products, for example, the 
              health costs of tobacco and soft-drink consumption, or the health and 
              environmental costs of mining and burning coal, deep sea drilling for 
              oil, hydrofracking for gas, or storing “spent” nuclear fuel in cooling 
              ponds.</p>
              <p>Governments can violate the Second Precept through unjust 
              confiscatory taxation.  Zen Master Hakuin (1686-1769) railed against the
               typical Japanese Daimyo (feudal lord) of his day who lived:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“a life of the greatest luxury… with never a thought of 
              the difficulties of the common people under him. From the blood and 
              sweat he wrings from them he is able to fill his tables with fine sake….
                As there is never enough money to satisfy such appetites, he ends up 
              dispatching merciless ministers….  Not only do officials reckon the tax 
              rate yearly, they also raise the rate two or three times during the same
               year.” <em><sup>[<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><a id="to-the-second-precept-n-1" class="footnoted" style="white-space: normal;" href="http://www.existentialbuddhist.com/2011/06/the-second-precept/#the-second-precept-n-1">1</a><a style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: 0.3em;" href="http://www.existentialbuddhist.com/2011/06/the-second-precept/#the-second-precept-n-1"></a></span>]</sup></em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Closer to our own time, the American revolution was fought over 
              taxation without representation, and some present day third-world 
              countries are governed by oligarchies so corrupt they can only be called
               “kleptocracies.”</p>
              <p>Political conservatives sometimes claim taxation levels in the United
               States are confiscatory.  In fact, personal U.S. taxation levels are 
              considerably lower than most Western European democracies.  
              Additionally, federal tax revenues currently constitute a smaller 
              percentage of our gross domestic product than they did during the decade
               of the nineteen-fifties.</p>
              <p>The Bush era tax cuts have, however, contributed to a massive 
              transfer of wealth from the poor and middle class to the wealthiest 
              Americans. This transfer is also a function of exponential increases in 
              executive compensation while the hourly wages of American workers have 
              declined.  Fortune 500 CEOs enjoyed a <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/corporatewatch/paywatch/#_ftn1%29">23% </a>increase
               in compensation in 2010 alone.  The wealthiest one percent of the 
              country now owns 38% of all privately held stock, 60% of all financial 
              assets, and 62% of all business equity, returning concentration of 
              wealth to levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties and the Gilded Age.
               <sup>[<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><a id="to-the-second-precept-n-2" class="footnoted" style="white-space: normal;" href="http://www.existentialbuddhist.com/2011/06/the-second-precept/#the-second-precept-n-2">2</a><a style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: 0.3em;" href="http://www.existentialbuddhist.com/2011/06/the-second-precept/#the-second-precept-n-2"></a></span>]</sup>  Current tax policy benefits the richest at the expense of improvements in infrastructure, education, and health care for all.</p>
              <p>No doubt, the reasons for the increasing disparity in wealth are 
              multiple and complex, including the globalization of the world economy, 
              the loss of manufacturing jobs overseas, the decline of labor unions, 
              the deregulation of the banking industry, the rising cost of energy, the
               failures of our educational system, and the Bush era tax cuts for the 
              wealthy.  The simple, unbridled exercise of human greed fits somewhere 
              into the mix as well.  Not unexpectedly, the wealthy continue to 
              vigorously advocate for a variety of policies (subsidies, incentives, 
              tax write-offs, deregulation, union busting, shredding the social safety
               net, shifting medical risk from insurers to patients, ending the estate
               tax, hobbling Medicare’s bargaining power, etc.) that further 
              accelerate the ongoing transfer of wealth.  We might also note that the 
              Supreme Court’s “Citizen’s United” decision gives the wealthy even more 
              of an advantage in shifting the political playing field to their 
              advantage.</p>
              <p>The Second Precept applies to more than just the theft of property 
              and wealth, however.  It can also apply to the giving and receiving of 
              affection, attention, and caring in personal relationships and the 
              sharing of tasks and responsibilities within them.  Most imbalances 
              within relationships are not regulated by law and some are reinforced by
               prevailing customs, making it easier to fail to recognize them when 
              they occur, and allowing their justification since “everyone does it.”  
              Focusing on the needs of our partners and dependents more than our own 
              is an important part of Buddhist practice.  We might consider replacing 
              the Golden Rule of “Do unto others as we would have them do unto us” 
              with the Platinum Rule: “Do unto others as they would wish to be 
              treated.”  This isn’t to suggest one should neglect one’s own needs — 
              self-compassion is important too.  As Rabbi Hillel said, “If I am not 
              for myself, who will be?  If I am not for others, what am I?”  It’s just
               that most of us are so self-focused that a little overcompensation in 
              the other direction couldn’t hurt!   Is it possible to give more of 
              ourselves emotionally — to be more generous than we are at present — 
              without resentment — without fearing we might give more than we get in 
              return?  Can we make that our ongoing practice?</p>
              <p>The beauty of the Precepts is that they turn all our interactions 
              into fields of practice in a way solitary sitting never can.  They allow
               us to explore the degree to which we express integrity, generosity, and
               compassion in our daily lives.  In following the Second Precept we 
              aspire to more than mere equity, the fair giving of tit-for-tat, but to 
              being open-hearted, caring, and mindful of the needs of others.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.plumvillage.org/mindfulness-trainings/3-the-five-mindfulness-trainings.html">Thich Nhat Hanh</a> has rewritten and expanded the Second Precept to make its intention clearer:</p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Aware of the suffering caused by exploitation, social 
              injustice, stealing, and oppression, I am committed to practicing 
              generosity in my thinking, speaking, and acting. I am determined not to 
              steal and not to possess anything that should belong to others; and I 
              will share my time, energy, and material resources with those who are in
               need. I will practice looking deeply to see that the happiness and 
              suffering of others are not separate from my own happiness and 
              suffering; that true happiness is not possible without understanding and
               compassion; and that running after wealth, fame, power and sensual 
              pleasures can bring much suffering and despair. I am aware that 
              happiness depends on my mental attitude and not on external conditions, 
              and that I can live happily in the present moment simply by remembering 
              that I already have more than enough conditions to be happy. I am 
              committed to practicing Right Livelihood so that I can help reduce the 
              suffering of living beings on Earth and reverse the process of global 
              warming.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>The beauty of Thay’s reformulation is that it turns a negative — 
              abstaining from stealing and avoiding greed  — into a positive — the 
              practice of generosity along with genuine activity to reduce individual 
              and systemic suffering.</p>
              <p>In discussing his reformulation in depth, Thay <a href="http://dharma.ncf.ca/introduction/precepts/precept-2.html">adds</a>:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“When you practice one precept deeply, you will discover 
              that you are practicing all five. The First Precept is about taking 
              life, which is a form of stealing — stealing the most precious thing 
              someone has, his or her life. When we meditate on the Second Precept, we
               see that stealing, in the forms of exploitation, social injustice, and 
              oppression, are acts of killing — killing slowly by exploitation, by 
              maintaining social injustice, and by political and economic oppression. 
              Therefore, the Second Precept has much to do with the precept of not 
              killing. We see the “interbeing” nature of the first two precepts. This 
              is true of all Five Precepts.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Buddhist practice is truly holographic — every part of the practice 
              contains and reflects every other part of the practice.  If all we do is
               practice the Second Precept, we are decreasing self-aggrandizement, 
              increasing generosity, increasing mindful awareness of our greed, 
              grasping, and self-justification, and increasing awareness of how we 
              depend on and influence the interconnected web of existence.</p>
              <p>Not a bad payoff for one simple precept.</p>

              <p>Yes. I posted this because five precepts are subtle and has vast implications... we better take it seriously.</p>
              <p>Recently I just noticed how I have not been living up to the five precepts in many small or big ways and how it has been harmful and decided to take it more seriously... I told Thusness and he too agrees and made the same observation for himself (that he should be careful about the consequences of his actions, etc).</p>

              <p>AEN, can I hear your view about this?</p>
              <p>I am more interested on topics related to music, so I gonna ask music-related stuffs.</p>
              <p>(Just to let you know, I am an avid downloader and uploader of musics, so this is harmful)</p>
              <p>How about Youtube?  I have been thinking about this, you see, there are lots of videos posted by others (let's say copyrighted anime), and we, the users of Youtube, watches the Animes for free, without paying, so is this considered breaking the 2nd precept?</p>
              <p>Cos the difference in between downloading of the mp3 music is the "owning", but what if it is "watching" anime off Youtube, without owning anything of its physical properties?  (&gt;&gt; can apply my question to tons of music videos off Youtube also)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And let's say a second-hand dealer buys a used CD from me (quite nearly brand new state), at 1/3 original price (let's say he bought at $7 from me which I bought at $20), and decided to sell it to another person back at $20, is it considered breaking of 2nd precept that the new buyer doesn't know?</p>

              <p>Suddenly want to add on something related</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The library usually states no photocopying of more than 10% of book.   This led me to think, what if in more than 1 circumstances, I photocopied more than 10% in total ?   But intention-wise, it is to use the material to educate someone (good intention), is it considered as stealing if I don't use money to buy the book instead?   And I wonder why there is library in the first place if it doesn't encourage people to buy original books?</p>

              <p>What expediency of alcohol? I think one has to be careful about alcohol... From my experience (well I admit I used to binge drink quite often - I am a naughty dharma boy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">), alcohol is very harmful to mindstate and behaviour... that is why Buddha said those who always drink alcohol will go lower realms or be reborn as a mad person. This totally make sense if one experiences what alcohol does! Total abstainance is best. If you have to do business, just drink a few sips. If it is just friends, can reject them. Like my Master say, a Buddhist should be optimist when it comes to doing good (ç§¯æž�), but when it comes to negative things like asking you to go clubbing, drinking, or whatever... one should be a pessimist (æ¶ˆæž�)</p>
              <p>Lets not follow Zen masters unless we are enlightened. Buy fish for liberation is good... but still best to use your own money! Anyway many masters (Zen or Vajrayana alike) themselves break precepts, drink, womanize, etc....  sometimes to their death. I do not think it is a good example. They call it crazy wisdom, but Dalai Lama thinks they're weird! Me too. In other words, just 'crazy', not necessarily 'wisdom'. Some call it spontaneous wisdom, I call it spontaneous ignorance. Even enlightened people can have flaws and faults. Don't put teachers on pedestial just because they appear to be authorities!</p>
              <p>'Expediency' is more often than not 'misused and abused'.</p>

              <p>Nowadays I am trying to stop killing mosquitoes. I just let them go. It takes some awareness to stop the instinctual habit to slap them.</p>
              <p>I often bring to mind how zen monks in Japan actually have some 'mosquito sacrificing session' - they actually intentionally sit in the open to feed the mosquitoes!</p>
              <p>As I go outfield very often where swarms of mosquitoes come and attack me, I have a lot of chance to practice non-killing.</p>
              <p>I am not as good as them... I don't feed mosquitoes, but at least I just let them fly away.</p>
              <p>Dalai Lama said something very good... in fact I was reading this when outfield... that you should treat all sentient beings more precious than the jewel fulfilling gems, because they let you accomplish your practice.</p>
              <p>Like how can you practice non-killing, non-violence, compassion, without the other sentient beings? So even mosquitoes are trying to let you accomplish Buddhahood. They are your benefactors.</p>

              <p>Ah, the precept that can cause so many people to look at you strangely. Thanks to the internet the value of intellectual property has taken a nosedive and people's opinion of what constitutes stealing... is really weird now.</p>
              <p>Just thought I'd share some personal experience and strategies in trying to uphold this precept on the non-downloading aspect. Downloading of copyrighted stuff for entertainment like games, movies, music, comics, general software is for me a no no. I'll only make exceptions if I've exhausted my efforts in trying to procure them the legit way i.e. can't find locally, can't buy online. When that happens though, I notice that I'm pretty much being a bit too desperate for trying to find some loophole over something so trivial, then it's off to look at my thoughts and examine the item I'm crazy over. Usually works at diminishing my desire to get them.</p>
              <p>On a side note, oh how I wish all music could be easily purchasable online without regional restrictions.</p>
              <p>I do have certain exceptions though. Professional software that I use at home for training/honing my craft. They cost upwards of $4-6k and unless I'm actually going to do freelance work and directly profiting through using them at home, I'm unlikely to ever buy them. If I do have that kind of money to spare on something I use only from time to time, I figured they'd be better off donated to people who really need it. Still, this gnaws on me and I'm looking to see if I can do without having them on my home PC completely, eventually.</p>
              <p>One great side effect from observing this precept: No more piles of re/writable DVDs, and no need to get TB HDDs! People are also genuinely curious about the buddhist precepts when they discover someone not doing something everyone's practically doing, so it's an excellent chance to talk about your faith. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>i share your sentiments too... wanted to buy music only but I can't find any online source. Just because I like one particular song doesn't mean I have to buy the entire album... lol</p>

              There's nothing wrong with killing pests.
              
              AEN is funny. If you do not kill mosquitoes in oufield a dengue or malaria mosquito might bite your mates.
              
              The town council just hired a pest terminator to kill cockcroaches in my flat.
              
              Tonnes of cockroaches are found lying on the floor and the blangah sweeper sweep it away.
              
              Even government do this like spray pesticides in those Private housing areas. 
              
              Pests should be killed. I see pests the pests sure die.
