              <p>There is no discrimination in Buddhism in view of its attainment beyond senses and consciousness. But for the gradual levels of Stillness towards Supreme, Theravada &amp; Mahayana are identified for purpose of understanding and dharma lectures to laypersons. </p>
              <p>Theravada or arhat is Stillness. When a being has attained the highest level of Theravada (arhat), the consciousness transformed into Stillness but lack of Wisdom. It means this Stillness has "in &amp; out". This Stillness may be in hibernation for several hundred kalpa or as and when out of Stillness, basically for purpose of liberating beings. Unlike Theravada, Mahayana's Stillness has no "in &amp; out", is in omniscience, known as Wisdom, supreme enlightenment, Ultimate bliss, or Bodhicitta, the quintessence nature of all sentience and Buddhas. Thus, Theravada does not realise Bodhicitta, whereas Mahayana realised and/or actualised Bodhicitta. You may acknowledge or call yourself a Mahayanist, but in fact it depends whether you are truly realised Bodhicitta. Similar to Theravada :)</p>

              <p>Do not conflate Theravada with hinayana. One is a tradition handed down by Buddha Shakyamuni ( handful of leaves, so to speak), whilst the other is a mindset.</p>
              <p>There is much to learn if one's mind is not closed towards them. For some, they are sufficient, in others not. </p>

I started with mucus and saliva and went on through my body, the nature of water was identical. I saw that the water in my body was not at all different from that in the world outside-even that in royal lands of floating banners with all their seas of fragrant waters.<br>"At that time, when I first succeeded in the contemplation of water, I could see only water. I still had not gotten beyond my physical body.<br>"I was a Bhikshu then, and once when I was in Dhyana repose in my room, a disciple of mine peeked in the window and saw only pure water there, which filled the entire room. He saw nothing else.<br>"The lad was young, and not knowing any better, he picked up a tile and tossed it and into the water. It hit the water with a 'plunk.' He gazed around and then left. When I came out of concentration, I was suddenly aware of a pain in my heart, and I felt like Shariputra must have felt when he met that cruel ghost.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><br>"I thought of myself, 'I am already an Arhat and have long since abandoned conditions that bring on illness. Why is it that today I suddenly have a pain in my heart? Am I about to lose the position of non-retreat?'</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><br>"Just then, the young lad came promptly to me and related what had happened. I quickly said to him, 'When you see the water again, you may open the door, wade into the water, and remove the tile.' The child was obedient, so that when I re-entered Samadhi, he again saw the water and the tile as well. He opened the door and took it out. When I came out of concentration, my body was as it had been before.<br>"I encountered limitless Buddhas and cultivated in this way until the coming of the Thus Come One, King of Masterful Penetrations of Mountains and Seas. Then I finally had no body. My nature and the seas of fragrant waters throughout the ten directions were identical with true emptiness, without any duality or difference. Now I am with the Thus Come One and am known as a Pure Youth, and I have joined the assembly of Bodhisattvas.</strong></p>

The World Honored One taught Kaushthila and me to contemplate the white spot at the tip of our noses.<br>"From the first, I contemplated intently. After three weeks, I saw that the breath in my nostrils looked like smoke when I inhaled and exhaled. My body and mind became bright inside, and I perfectly understood the external world, to the point that everything became empty and pure, like crystal. The smoky appearance gradually disappeared, and the breath in my nostrils became white. <br>"My mind opened and any outflows were extinguished. Every inhalation and exhalation of breath was transformed into light which illumined the ten directions, and I attained Arhatship. The World Honored One predicted that in the future I would obtain Bodhi.<br>"The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. I did it by means of the disappearance of the breath, until eventually the breath emitted light and the light completely extinguished my outflows.</strong></p></div>
