              <p>No they do not. Only Buddhism produces Aryas (enlightened beings in the Buddhist definition) that realise the twofold emptiness. Other religions lead their practitioners to certain experience but fall short of this realisation, and therefore do not produce Aryas. This may sound very sectarian, but it is a fact that only Buddhism teaches no-self, emptiness and dependent origination. The realisation of this is what makes one attain the progressive Arya realisations (like the stages to Arhatship, and the different bhumi stages of a Bodhisattva to Buddhahood).</p>
              <p>Anyway only Buddhist practitioners have Shariras.</p>

                                      pardon the poor translations) from Fa Yu Bing Fen (Book 1), Jen

                                      Shen-Kai</span><br> <br> <img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-relics-head_02.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> The Sharira is truly a very amazing and miraculous object. Though
                                      it is a material substance, it can also be said to be immaterial.
                                      However, only the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, great Masters, saints and
                                      Bhikshus would have shariras. Some lay Buddhists who are great
                                      practitioners, both males and females, may also have shariras.
                                      Typically, after the practitioner passes away and is cremated,
                                      numerous colourful bead-like objects, known as shariras, would be
                                      retrieved from the ashes. It does not melt under high temperature,
                                      does not dissolve with high humidity, does not spoil under high
                                      pressure, and does not get destroyed over kalpas. Interestingly,
                                      not every Buddhist has shariras. Buddhists who do not practice,
                                      just as other people who do not believe in Buddhism, would not have
                                      shariras. There are plentiful religions in the world. Why is it
                                      that the religious leader, missionaries and believers do not have
                                      shariras? There are also practitioners from religions other than
                                      Buddhism, yet only people who practice the Dharma have shariras.
                                      Besides, one could also tell the level of practice through the
                                      number of shariras produced. Those with deeper level of practice
                                      would have more shariras, while those with a shallow level of
                                      practice would have fewer shariras. If one has practiced for
                                      countless lifetimes, the number of shariras one would have the
                                      beauty of its colour and luster and other miraculous occurrences
                                      would be even more incredible.<br> <br> <img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-relics-head-blood_01.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> According to the records of the life story of Buddha, when
                                      Shakyamuni Buddha entered Nirvana, Â“At this moment, the golden
                                      coffin ascended to the height of seven Â“duo luoÂ” trees, moved
                                      around in space, dissolved into the fire of Samadhi,
                                      instantaneously producing ashes and shariras appeared, like
                                      multi-coloured beads, bright and firmÂ”. According to the
                                      explanations, there are as many as 84 Â“dou3Â” shariras. At that
                                      time, the shariras were divided amongst the 8 great Kings and other
                                      BuddhaÂ’s disciples. They built stupas to venerate the shariras.
                                      While the majority of the shariras were left in the human realm,
                                      some were kept in the Naga realm or Heaven realm. There was also
                                      BuddhaÂ’s great disciple, Venerable Ananda. When he entered Nirvana,
                                      his physical body levitated to the space, dissolved into fire and
                                      self-cremated. His shariras rained down from the sky upon the banks
                                      of the Ganges river. All these did not only happen in the ancient
                                      times. Even as recent as the great Buddhist leader Â– Master
                                      Tai-Hsu, when he passed away, there were more than 400 shariras.
                                      The Pure Land master Â– Venerable Yin Kwang, also produced a few
                                      hundred shariras when he passed away. There are also other
                                      innumerable great Masters and Teachers who had shariras. There was
                                      especially a Zhang Jia Rinpoche who passed away in Tai Pei in 1957;
                                      he had as many as 7000 to 8000 shariras. He even had the most
                                      precious Vajra gem and six-syllable mantra. The shariras could be
                                      as large as beans and as tiny as seeds. They were very colourful,
                                      but the white ones were especially remarkable. Other than these,
                                      there are also uncountable accounts of Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, lay
                                      male and female Buddhists who passed away with shariras.<br> <br> <img src="http://www.maitreyaproject.org/images/rel-shakya-head.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> Actually, one need not to have shariras only upon oneÂ’s Nirvana.
                                      For example, one of the greatest disciples of the Buddha Â–
                                      Mahakashyapa, his indestructible body sharira is presently
                                      concealed in the Â“ling2 jiu1 shan1Â”. He would await for the descent
                                      of the Maitreya Buddha, when he would appear in the Dharma
                                      assembly, benefit sentient beings and then enter into Nirvana.
                                      Other examples include the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva of the Jiu Hua
                                      Mountain in An Hui; Tang Dynasty 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng of Cao
                                      Xi; the Ming dynasty Great Master Han Shan; ChinaÂ’s Wu Jin Zang
                                      Bhikshuni etc, their body sharira are being venerated at Guang Dong
                                      in the Â‘Nan HuaÂ’ monastery. There is also a Venerable in Thailand
                                      who entered Nirvana in his middle age, but his body did not decay,
                                      it is situated at Â‘Cheng NiangÂ’ and the Thais venerate his Body
                                      Relic; it is also known that his hair is grew 5 times longer than
                                      when he was alive. In Taiwan Si Zhi Maitreya Monastery, the Ci Hang
                                      Bodhisattva non-decayed Body Relic was a breaking news, people from
                                      local and abroad pay homage to it; in Nan Hai Pu Tuo Mountain Â‘Gu
                                      Fuo DongÂ’, there are many body relics of old monks who passed away
                                      for plenty of years. Regarding body relics/shariras, there are
                                      plenty of cases in different places and mountains in China. Those
                                      who follow and practice (xiu1 chi2) according to the Buddhadharma,
                                      not only bone marrows, even nails, blood, flesh and teeth, the
                                      entire body can become relics, just like there are lights and
                                      colours on [??]Â’s head. Venerable Jiu Mo LuoÂ’s tongue did not burn
                                      in cremation, these are Sharira Gems.<br> <br> <img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-relics-blood_01.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> Sharira can also be obtained through Gan3 Ying4
                                      (induction/invocation), in our country (Taiwan) during the era of
                                      Dong Wu Sun Quan, after hearing that Venerable Fan Zeng Kang Zeng
                                      Kai said the merits of paying homage to shariras, thought of
                                      wanting to pay homage to shariras, therefore requested that
                                      Venerable to sincerely pray. After 49 days, he suddenly heard
                                      sounds coming from the empty bottle, and discovered
                                      Â‘Gong-De-She-LiÂ’ (merits sharira). After trying to hit it with a
                                      hammer on a metal zhuan, the sharira remains undamaged. During the
                                      Song dynasty, lay disciple Wang Ri Xi was carving a Pure Land
                                      scripture on the wooden plank and a sharira was carved out. Again
                                      in Song Dynasty, there was a lady who always recited Amitabha
                                      Sutra, in the sutra suddenly a lot of shariras appeared. During Xi
                                      Pu era, there was a monk called Hui Da, in [??], bowed and
                                      sincerely prayed for BuddhaÂ’s relic, suddenly the relic rolled out
                                      from the ground, it is now venerated at Ning Bo Ah Yu Wang
                                      monastery, is known to be the relic that Venerable Hui Da prayed
                                      for. Recently there is a General, once he was at Xi-An Xi-Jiao
                                      Monastery [??] stupa, he sincerely prayed and a huge brick fell out
                                      from the top of the stupa, and realized that two shariras are on
                                      top of it, therefore he renovated the stupa. In Hong Kong,
                                      Venerable Lan Mo went to India for Buddhist pilgrimage, in BuddhaÂ’s
                                      pre-enlightenment Bodhigaya; he met an old practitioner, called
                                      Guang Qing Shi. He was at Jia ? Great Stupa venerating BuddhaÂ’s
                                      relics for 3 years already, once he witnessed sharira dropping by
                                      itself from the top of the stupa, and it even gave him and another
                                      lay disciple 2 shariras; it was very colourful and lovely. During
                                      Ming Guo, Zheng Jue Sheng old lay disciple once venerated two of
                                      Living Buddha Ban ChanÂ’s shariras; it automatically multiplied to 7
                                      of them. When Mr Qu Lao passed away, his wife took 2 shariras and
                                      put onto his mouth. When his funeral was over, it was found that
                                      that 7 shariras remain at home. Later it was given to Li Zi Kuan
                                      old lay disciple who is at Taipei Shan Dao monastery for offering,
                                      but realized the sharira has multiplied to 10. In Tibetan Vajrayana
                                      Yellow Hat sect leader Lama Tsongkapa dropped a tooth in his latter
                                      years, his disciples treated it as a sharira and venerated it,
                                      shariras grew out from the toothÂ’s root canal. It was distributed
                                      among masses for veneration, after distributing it grew again,
                                      after growing it was distributed again. It was known that there is
                                      a Living Buddha, in the early years at China Mainland before his
                                      passing away, often there are disciples praying/requesting his
                                      sharira, he could at any time drop 2 shariras from his nostrils and
                                      gave them for veneration. It was also heard that there is a
                                      merchant, Da Pu Tuo and Bo Li Jia brothers, they used a jade box
                                      and carried back eight of BuddhaÂ’s hair strands (also BuddhaÂ’s
                                      sharira).</p>

                                      obtained light-flower sharira, at that time liked it a lot,
                                      therefore wished him when he pass away surely have sharira, and it
                                      turned out that a few years ago Zhang Lao in Taipei, fore-knew his
                                      death time, died/liberated without sickness during meditation.
                                      After cremation there are plenty of big and small shariras, there
                                      are sharira-tree and sharira-flower. Once also, visited
                                      Gao-Xiong-Shou mountain monastery Lamp-Burning puja, saw a lot of
                                      lamp-flower sharira. Once more than 10 years ago at Xi Yi, visited
                                      various Venerables recently arrived back from India who brought
                                      back many Buddha Shariras for veneration. They are shaped like
                                      small peanut-grains, I witnessed the colour was white, it was heard
                                      that white was good, some people saw golden-yellow or pale-yellow,
                                      some people saw sky-blue or green colour, some saw red or purple

                                      repentance, vowing to be virtuous, the sharira colour turned good;
                                      witnesses found it very mysterious. For example locally in the
                                      present generation, there is a Fa Xue Jia, Mr. Luo Jia Jie,
                                      believed in Buddhism, once he was at Ningbo Ah Yu Wang monastery,
                                      prayed and venerated BuddhaÂ’s shariras, at first it was black
                                      colour, and knew that he had heavy karmic obstructions, therefore
                                      he stayed at the monastery for 7 days 7 nights and kept praying and
                                      repenting. At the 7th day, he visited the sharira again; it turned
                                      totally into white colour, and was satisfied and left. Sharira in
                                      Buddhist disciplesÂ’ minds, it is a great power without pens or ink
                                      or words, yet is able to invoke people to avoid evil and lead them
                                      towards the virtuous path and seek the truth.<br> <br> <img src="http://www.maitreyaproject.org/images/rel-kashyapa.jpg" alt="image"><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Above: sharira of the Buddha
                                      prior to Shakyamuni Buddha, Kassapa Buddha</span><br> <br> Sharira is formed due to the practitionerÂ’s life merits, due to
                                      love, compassion, joy and equanimity (the 4 immeasurable); wisdom;
                                      benefiting others and the worldÂ’s immense merits. It is difficult
                                      to obtain and rare, therefore it is said that shariras are
                                      immaterial, it is beyond-material. The Golden Light Sutra states
                                      Â“Sharira is cultivated out of Precepts, Samadhi, Wisdom merits, it
                                      is difficult to obtain and is the highest blessing field." And
                                      also, Â“Persons of shariras, is due to the results of immense
                                      cultivation of Six ParamitasÂ” Prajna sutra also says Â“BuddhaÂ’s body
                                      and She Li Luo (She-Li-Zhi/shariras) is obtained through practice
                                      of Prajna-paramita immense merits, it is venerated, revered,
                                      praised and respected by all Devas and Men.Â” Therefore people of
                                      the world should inspire the heart of veneration towards Buddha and
                                      BodhisattvaÂ’s shariras; it will result in various blessings which
                                      are difficult to comprehend.<br> <br> <img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-flesh-relics_01.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> Due to the various ways of concrete proof, shariras are not
                                      necessarily made of hair, blood, or marrow, the colours are not of
                                      white, black or 3 types, if the Chinese translate it as Â“body

              <p>No they do not. Only Buddhism produces Aryas (enlightened beings in the Buddhist definition) that realise the twofold emptiness. Other religions lead their practitioners to certain experience but fall short of this realisation, and therefore do not produce Aryas. This may sound very sectarian, but it is a fact that only Buddhism teaches no-self, emptiness and dependent origination. The realisation of this is what makes one attain the progressive Arya realisations (like the stages to Arhatship, and the different bhumi stages of a Bodhisattva to Buddhahood).</p>
              <p>Anyway only Buddhist practitioners have Shariras.</p>
              <p><br>..............</p>
              <p><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A translated article (by me, so pardon the poor translations) from Fa Yu Bing Fen (Book 1), Jen Chen Buddhist Book Publisher</span><br><br><strong>Â“Discussing about SharirasÂ”</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By Venerable Shen-Kai</span><br><br><img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-relics-head_02.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>The Sharira is truly a very amazing and miraculous object. Though it is a material substance, it can also be said to be immaterial. However, only the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, great Masters, saints and Bhikshus would have shariras. Some lay Buddhists who are great practitioners, both males and females, may also have shariras. Typically, after the practitioner passes away and is cremated, numerous colourful bead-like objects, known as shariras, would be retrieved from the ashes. It does not melt under high temperature, does not dissolve with high humidity, does not spoil under high pressure, and does not get destroyed over kalpas. Interestingly, not every Buddhist has shariras. Buddhists who do not practice, just as other people who do not believe in Buddhism, would not have shariras. There are plentiful religions in the world. Why is it that the religious leader, missionaries and believers do not have shariras? There are also practitioners from religions other than Buddhism, yet only people who practice the Dharma have shariras. Besides, one could also tell the level of practice through the number of shariras produced. Those with deeper level of practice would have more shariras, while those with a shallow level of practice would have fewer shariras. If one has practiced for countless lifetimes, the number of shariras one would have the beauty of its colour and luster and other miraculous occurrences would be even more incredible.<br><br><img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-relics-head-blood_01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>According to the records of the life story of Buddha, when Shakyamuni Buddha entered Nirvana, Â“At this moment, the golden coffin ascended to the height of seven Â“duo luoÂ” trees, moved around in space, dissolved into the fire of Samadhi, instantaneously producing ashes and shariras appeared, like multi-coloured beads, bright and firmÂ”. According to the explanations, there are as many as 84 Â“dou3Â” shariras. At that time, the shariras were divided amongst the 8 great Kings and other BuddhaÂ’s disciples. They built stupas to venerate the shariras. While the majority of the shariras were left in the human realm, some were kept in the Naga realm or Heaven realm. There was also BuddhaÂ’s great disciple, Venerable Ananda. When he entered Nirvana, his physical body levitated to the space, dissolved into fire and self-cremated. His shariras rained down from the sky upon the banks of the Ganges river. All these did not only happen in the ancient times. Even as recent as the great Buddhist leader Â– Master Tai-Hsu, when he passed away, there were more than 400 shariras. The Pure Land master Â– Venerable Yin Kwang, also produced a few hundred shariras when he passed away. There are also other innumerable great Masters and Teachers who had shariras. There was especially a Zhang Jia Rinpoche who passed away in Tai Pei in 1957; he had as many as 7000 to 8000 shariras. He even had the most precious Vajra gem and six-syllable mantra. The shariras could be as large as beans and as tiny as seeds. They were very colourful, but the white ones were especially remarkable. Other than these, there are also uncountable accounts of Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, lay male and female Buddhists who passed away with shariras.<br><br><img src="http://www.maitreyaproject.org/images/rel-shakya-head.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>Actually, one need not to have shariras only upon oneÂ’s Nirvana. For example, one of the greatest disciples of the Buddha Â– Mahakashyapa, his indestructible body sharira is presently concealed in the Â“ling2 jiu1 shan1Â”. He would await for the descent of the Maitreya Buddha, when he would appear in the Dharma assembly, benefit sentient beings and then enter into Nirvana. Other examples include the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva of the Jiu Hua Mountain in An Hui; Tang Dynasty 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng of Cao Xi; the Ming dynasty Great Master Han Shan; ChinaÂ’s Wu Jin Zang Bhikshuni etc, their body sharira are being venerated at Guang Dong in the Â‘Nan HuaÂ’ monastery. There is also a Venerable in Thailand who entered Nirvana in his middle age, but his body did not decay, it is situated at Â‘Cheng NiangÂ’ and the Thais venerate his Body Relic; it is also known that his hair is grew 5 times longer than when he was alive. In Taiwan Si Zhi Maitreya Monastery, the Ci Hang Bodhisattva non-decayed Body Relic was a breaking news, people from local and abroad pay homage to it; in Nan Hai Pu Tuo Mountain Â‘Gu Fuo DongÂ’, there are many body relics of old monks who passed away for plenty of years. Regarding body relics/shariras, there are plenty of cases in different places and mountains in China. Those who follow and practice (xiu1 chi2) according to the Buddhadharma, not only bone marrows, even nails, blood, flesh and teeth, the entire body can become relics, just like there are lights and colours on [??]Â’s head. Venerable Jiu Mo LuoÂ’s tongue did not burn in cremation, these are Sharira Gems.<br><br><img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-relics-blood_01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>Sharira can also be obtained through Gan3 Ying4 (induction/invocation), in our country (Taiwan) during the era of Dong Wu Sun Quan, after hearing that Venerable Fan Zeng Kang Zeng Kai said the merits of paying homage to shariras, thought of wanting to pay homage to shariras, therefore requested that Venerable to sincerely pray. After 49 days, he suddenly heard sounds coming from the empty bottle, and discovered Â‘Gong-De-She-LiÂ’ (merits sharira). After trying to hit it with a hammer on a metal zhuan, the sharira remains undamaged. During the Song dynasty, lay disciple Wang Ri Xi was carving a Pure Land scripture on the wooden plank and a sharira was carved out. Again in Song Dynasty, there was a lady who always recited Amitabha Sutra, in the sutra suddenly a lot of shariras appeared. During Xi Pu era, there was a monk called Hui Da, in [??], bowed and sincerely prayed for BuddhaÂ’s relic, suddenly the relic rolled out from the ground, it is now venerated at Ning Bo Ah Yu Wang monastery, is known to be the relic that Venerable Hui Da prayed for. Recently there is a General, once he was at Xi-An Xi-Jiao Monastery [??] stupa, he sincerely prayed and a huge brick fell out from the top of the stupa, and realized that two shariras are on top of it, therefore he renovated the stupa. In Hong Kong, Venerable Lan Mo went to India for Buddhist pilgrimage, in BuddhaÂ’s pre-enlightenment Bodhigaya; he met an old practitioner, called Guang Qing Shi. He was at Jia ? Great Stupa venerating BuddhaÂ’s relics for 3 years already, once he witnessed sharira dropping by itself from the top of the stupa, and it even gave him and another lay disciple 2 shariras; it was very colourful and lovely. During Ming Guo, Zheng Jue Sheng old lay disciple once venerated two of Living Buddha Ban ChanÂ’s shariras; it automatically multiplied to 7 of them. When Mr Qu Lao passed away, his wife took 2 shariras and put onto his mouth. When his funeral was over, it was found that that 7 shariras remain at home. Later it was given to Li Zi Kuan old lay disciple who is at Taipei Shan Dao monastery for offering, but realized the sharira has multiplied to 10. In Tibetan Vajrayana Yellow Hat sect leader Lama Tsongkapa dropped a tooth in his latter years, his disciples treated it as a sharira and venerated it, shariras grew out from the toothÂ’s root canal. It was distributed among masses for veneration, after distributing it grew again, after growing it was distributed again. It was known that there is a Living Buddha, in the early years at China Mainland before his passing away, often there are disciples praying/requesting his sharira, he could at any time drop 2 shariras from his nostrils and gave them for veneration. It was also heard that there is a merchant, Da Pu Tuo and Bo Li Jia brothers, they used a jade box and carried back eight of BuddhaÂ’s hair strands (also BuddhaÂ’s sharira).</p>

              <p>They were robbed twice on their way by robbers, altogether they lost 4 strains. When they arrived back in Myanmar they asked the king to build a stupa for the veneration of the shariras, and when they opened the box, they found 8 strains like it originally was. There are many cases of multiplication of shariras among those who venerate the shariras; and because whenever there are hosting of Buddhism activity, often there are light-flower sharira.<br><br><img src="http://www.maitreyaproject.org/images/rel-ltk.jpg" alt="image"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Above: one of the relics of Lama Tsongkapa</span><br><br>The author has been to different places in Taiwan, visited and venerated Buddha, Bodhisattvas, Saints, high monks and old practitioners of their shariras, at Jia Yi Seng saw Zang Ji Hua old lay disciple, because of his sincere praying and chanting Buddha, obtained light-flower sharira, at that time liked it a lot, therefore wished him when he pass away surely have sharira, and it turned out that a few years ago Zhang Lao in Taipei, fore-knew his death time, died/liberated without sickness during meditation. After cremation there are plenty of big and small shariras, there are sharira-tree and sharira-flower. Once also, visited Gao-Xiong-Shou mountain monastery Lamp-Burning puja, saw a lot of lamp-flower sharira. Once more than 10 years ago at Xi Yi, visited various Venerables recently arrived back from India who brought back many Buddha Shariras for veneration. They are shaped like small peanut-grains, I witnessed the colour was white, it was heard that white was good, some people saw golden-yellow or pale-yellow, some people saw sky-blue or green colour, some saw red or purple colour, some saw pearl colour, some saw jade colour, or coral; ???? colour, or if karma is heavy, some saw it as grey or black, or because of sudden sincere ?, or because of prostrations and sincere repentance, vowing to be virtuous, the sharira colour turned good; witnesses found it very mysterious. For example locally in the present generation, there is a Fa Xue Jia, Mr. Luo Jia Jie, believed in Buddhism, once he was at Ningbo Ah Yu Wang monastery, prayed and venerated BuddhaÂ’s shariras, at first it was black colour, and knew that he had heavy karmic obstructions, therefore he stayed at the monastery for 7 days 7 nights and kept praying and repenting. At the 7th day, he visited the sharira again; it turned totally into white colour, and was satisfied and left. Sharira in Buddhist disciplesÂ’ minds, it is a great power without pens or ink or words, yet is able to invoke people to avoid evil and lead them towards the virtuous path and seek the truth.<br><br><img src="http://www.maitreyaproject.org/images/rel-kashyapa.jpg" alt="image"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Above: sharira of the Buddha prior to Shakyamuni Buddha, Kassapa Buddha</span><br><br>Sharira is formed due to the practitionerÂ’s life merits, due to love, compassion, joy and equanimity (the 4 immeasurable); wisdom; benefiting others and the worldÂ’s immense merits. It is difficult to obtain and rare, therefore it is said that shariras are immaterial, it is beyond-material. The Golden Light Sutra states Â“Sharira is cultivated out of Precepts, Samadhi, Wisdom merits, it is difficult to obtain and is the highest blessing field." And also, Â“Persons of shariras, is due to the results of immense cultivation of Six ParamitasÂ” Prajna sutra also says Â“BuddhaÂ’s body and She Li Luo (She-Li-Zhi/shariras) is obtained through practice of Prajna-paramita immense merits, it is venerated, revered, praised and respected by all Devas and Men.Â” Therefore people of the world should inspire the heart of veneration towards Buddha and BodhisattvaÂ’s shariras; it will result in various blessings which are difficult to comprehend.<br><br><img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-flesh-relics_01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>Due to the various ways of concrete proof, shariras are not necessarily made of hair, blood, or marrow, the colours are not of white, black or 3 types, if the Chinese translate it as Â“body bonesÂ” or or Â“ling2 bonesÂ”, Â“? bonesÂ”, it is unable to cover the shariraÂ’s true essence and meaning.<br><br>----<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://xs.to/">Free Image Hosting</a> [xs.to]</p>

              <p>Many people share this sentiment, and it sounds nice but unfortunately it is wrong. Enlightenment is more subtle than one might think. And though the Buddha did say realisation can come anywhere the 8 fold path is taught, he also taught that his is the only teaching that leads to the end of samsara. Buddha's teaching is the only path that teaches the 8 fold path in other words, the only path that teaches the right view of dependent origination, no-self, the 3 seals, and the method to realise this. (see the next post for scriptural support) Nagarjuna also said "Only the path shown by Shakyamuni is complete while other paths only lead to the edge of Samsara."</p>
              <p>A lot of non-Buddhist practitioners are supposedly enlightened, but their enlightenment and Buddhism's enlightenment is not the same. Buddhism's enlightenment requires one to realise the truth of dependent origination, and requires learning the right view through the Buddha's teachings.</p>
              <p>Other religions' enlightenment has to do with realising their atman-Brahman (the Self that is God) true self, that experience of I AMness. (Thusness Stage 1) The first transcendental experience for many (whether non-Buddhist or Buddhists) is that experience of I AMness where that person has feels with certainty that he has touched the deepest core of his being, without any intermediary or thoughts -- just a naked presence and sense of existence that is infinite and not bounded by the mind or body. It feels utterly real and he knows he's not a machine, not a body, and not his mind.  Awareness is seen as an Eternal Witness/Watcher at this phase, there
                                                                                  is still duality between subject/object, perceiver/perceived. IT simply observes everything passively. It is totally outside the stream of time, movements, and is unborn and
                                                                                  undying. Consciousness feels constant and different from transient
                                                                                  phenomenon, which simply appears to arise and subside from and within a constant background of witnessing consciousness. At this phase the practitioner will not understand what Zen Master Dogen meant by "Impermanence is Buddha-Nature" (this will only be realised at Thusness Stage 5, or the Buddhist understanding of No-Self). Instead, Consciousness is seen as separate from transience, and is eternal. That is why most non-Buddhist practitioners are categorised as eternalists.</p>
              <p>Or further still they may have non-dual experiences (without subject/object, seer-seen, witness/witnessed divisions) or realisations, but it is still not the realisation of no-self and emptiness/dependent origination, and there is still a strong attachment to an unchaging ontological essence, Brahman, God, etc, even though they do not experience any separation with the world. Even though there is no subject/object division, it is still Brahman rather than Shunyata (emptiness) -- here the I AMness is experienced in everything. This is Thusness's Stage 4. Practitioners up till this point are not considered as having attained the Buddhist ranks of aryas (Sotapanna to Arhatship, or the 1st Bhumi Bodhisattva stage onwards) or the Buddhist enlightenment, even though they did have a series of spiritual realisations.</p>
              <p>I am not being biased here because I myself like to study other religions and would fully agree with any teachings if they teach the right view and right path. The eight-fold path begins with Right View, that is the first of the eight fold path. And that means the understanding of dependent origination.</p>
              <p>But unfortunately I can tell you from my experience of having read many books by Hindu Advaitist and some Christian mystics books that they do not have the understanding of Dependent Origination/Emptiness which is taught in Buddhism alone. This is a peculiar teaching of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Longchen, our forum moderator who also has experiential insights on the two emptinesses speak from experience (who had transcendental experiences of the I AM since about 23 years ago when he was 15 and having been taught by Christian mystics for many years before knowing Thusness a few years ago) says: <em>Buddhism is the only religion that talks about

              <p>As Longchen said here, emptiness in Buddhism is not refering to a formless all-pervading presence but rather is referring to the teaching on dependent origination and the non-substantiality of appearances.</p>
              <p>Our moderator Thusness too speaks from experience with other religions, having transcendental insights since a young age like Longchen (beginning with the I AMness 25 years ago when he was 17), and having gone from Buddhism to Hinduism to Taoism and finally back to Buddhism again.</p>

                  [Ñanamoli Thera and Bhikkhu Bodhi, trans.]. The Buddha declares that
                  only through practicing in accord with the Dhamma can Awakening be
                  realized. His teaching is distinguished from those of other religions

              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p>1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at <a name="savatthi">Savatthi</a> in Jeta's Grove, <a name="anatha">Anathapindika</a>'s Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." -- "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. "Bhikkhus, only here is there a recluse, only here a second recluse,
              only here a third recluse, only here a fourth recluse. The doctrines of
              others are devoid[<a href="http://www.cambodianbuddhist.org/english/website/canon/sutta/majjhima/mn011.html#*">*p.64</a>] of recluses: that is how you should rightly roar your lion's roar.[<a name="1" href="http://www.cambodianbuddhist.org/english/website/canon/sutta/majjhima/mn011.html#n1">1</a>] </strong></span></p>
              <p>3. "It is possible, bhikkhus, that wanderers of other sects might ask:
                  'But on the strength of what (argument) or with the support of what
                  (authority) do the venerable ones say thus?' Wanderers of other sects
                  who ask thus may be answered in this way: 'Friends, four things have
                  been declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished
                  and fully enlightened; on seeing these in ourselves we say thus: "Only
                  here is there a recluse, only here a second recluse, only here a third
                  recluse, only here a fourth recluse. The doctrines of others are devoid
                  of recluses." What are the four? We have confidence in the Teacher, we
                  have confidence in the Dhamma, we have fulfilled the precepts, and our
                  companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us whether they are
                  layfolk or those gone forth. These are the four things declared to us
                  by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully
                  enlightened, on seeing which in ourselves we say as we do.'</p>

                  realisation of the I AM is not the same as the realisation of Non-Dual
                  (Thusness's Stage 4), and the realisation of non-dual is not the same
                  as the realisation of No-Self (Thusness's Stage 5), and the realisation
                  of No-Self is not the same as the realisation of Emptiness/Dependent
                  Origination (Thusness's Stage 6). (See: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Experience on Spiritual Enlightenment</a>)
                  As Thusness/PasserBy says, the tendency to grasp on an inherent
                  ontological essence is surprisingly strong even after non-dual
                  realisation.<br><br>It is easy to misunderstand any phase of insight as final and complete, as Adyashanti <a href="http://www.adyashanti.org/listen.php?filetodownload=Beyond%20the%20Experience%20of%20Emptiness_lrg.mp3&amp;avfile=Audio&amp;type=high">puts it</a>, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Emptiness
                  is not the totality of what you are. Emptiness is a profound aspect of
                  what you are, it's a profound taste of your true nature, it's not the
                  totality of what you are any than getting up in the morning and feeling
                  good is the totality of what you are, or feeling bad is a totality of
                  what you are... ...Whenever you touch upon a deep truth, suchness of
                  reality, your true nature, each aspect feels like it's total and
                  complete and all-inclusive at that moment. So that's why teachers have
                  a very hard time getting through to people when they have an initial
                  experience of anything because if it's an initial experience of reality
                  it feels totally complete and there is a certain innate confidence that
                  arises within you. Not an egoic confidence but a confidence that comes
                  from reality."</span> (Note: 'Emptiness' used by Adyashanti here is
                  referring to the initial experience of I AMness, it is not referring to
                  the insight of dependent origination that Thusness or Greg Goode is
                  talking about)<br><br>Over the past month I have engaged in long discussions at  <a href="http://www.thetaobums.com/">The Tao Bums</a> to clarify the different aspects to insight in hopes that people do not
                  become confused and overlook/misunderstand the profound truths of
                  no-self and emptiness by mixing up the different insights together.<br><br>As Greg Goode have said in <a href="http://www.heartofnow.com/files/emptiness.html">http://www.heartofnow.com/files/emptiness.html</a>:<br><br><em>For
                  those who encounter emptiness teachings after they've become familiar
                  with awareness teachings, it's very tempting to misread the emptiness
                  teachings by substituting terms. That is, it's very easy to misread the
                  emptiness teachings by seeing "emptiness" on the page and thinking to
                  yourself, "awareness, consciousness, I know what they're talking about."<br><br>Early
                  in my own study I began with this substitution in mind. With this
                  misreading, I found a lot in the emptiness teachings to be quite
                  INcomprehensible! So I started again, laying aside the notion that
                  "emptiness" and "awareness" were equivalent. I tried to let the
                  emptiness teachings speak for themselves. I came to find that they have
                  a subtle beauty and power, a flavor quite different from the awareness
                  teachings. Emptiness teachings do not speak of emptiness as a true
                  nature that underlies or supports things. Rather, it speaks of selves
                  and things as essenceless and free.</em><br><br>In other words, as Bernadette Roberts said:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"That
                  everyone has different experiences and perspectives is not a problem;
                  rather, the problem is that when we interpret an experience outside its
                  own paradigm, context, and stated definitions, that experience becomes
                  lost altogether. It becomes lost because we have redefined the terms
                  according to a totally different paradigm or perspective and thereby
                  made it over into an experience it never was in the first place. When
                  we force an experience into an alien paradigm, that experience becomes
                  subsumed, interpreted away, unrecognizable, confused, or made totally
                  indistinguishable. Thus when we impose alien definitions on the
                  original terms of an experience, that experience becomes lost to the
                  journey, and eventually it becomes lost to the literature as well. To
                  keep this from happening it is necessary to draw clear lines and to
                  make sharp, exacting distinctions. The purpose of doing so is not to
                  criticize other paradigms, but to allow a different paradigm or
                  perspective to stand in its own right, to have its own space in order
                  to contribute what it can to our knowledge of man and his journey to
                  the divine.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Distinguishing
                  what is true or false, essential or superficial in our experience is
                  not a matter to be taken lightly. We cannot simply define our terms and
                  then sit back and expect perfect agreement across the board. Our
                  spiritual-psychological journey does not work this way. We are not
                  uniform robots with the same experiences, same definitions, same
                  perspectives, or same anything."</span><br><br><br>By clearly
                  understanding the phases of insights, we can avoid misinterpreting them
                  and let each teaching and insight speak for themselves, instead of
                  interpreting them with a different lens and paradigm. We can then allow
                  them to <span style="font-style: italic;">"contribute what it can to our knowledge of man and his journey to the divine"</span> -- however I should also emphasize that, even though one is clear about the different phases of insights one must still <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/05/are-insight-stages-strictly-linear.html">see them as without hierarchy</a>.<br><br>The
                  following post is a recent one I made at The Tao Bums, which Thusness
                  thinks serves as a good summary. I was replying to a post made by
                  'Dwai' containing the article <a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/26715.htm">Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta</a> by David Loy.<br><br><blockquote>Dr.
                  David Loy is an enlightened and authorized Zen teacher from an
                  authentic Zen lineage (Sanbo Kyodan lineage) having completed his koan
                  training, so he is not without personal experience, he is not just an
                  academic. Thusness did recommend his book 'Nonduality' to me before a
                  few years back, and it is very well written on the aspect of
                  non-duality. I have his book, bought it a few years ago, and would
                  recommend others to get it. However not much is spoken about dependent
                  origination and emptiness in that book.<br><br>But take note that
                  'Nonduality' was the first book (his Ph.D thesis) and was written in
                  the early 1980s and published in 1988, paperback edition 1997. However
                  he did write articles on dependent origination and emptiness in the
                  latter years, like in 1993 he published <a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew25326.htm">Indra's Postmodern Net</a> which I think is pretty good also.<br><br>Regarding
                  the articles in 'Nonduality' which Dwai quoted one above, it is part of
                  his Ph.D thesis on comparative religion and his emphasis was on the
                  similarities between Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta and other systems
                  including Taoism and more. That is why it is written with a bias
                  towards seeing the similarities.<br><br>Actually there are similarities
                  between Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism. And that is clearly described in
                  David Loy's essay -- it is the non-divison of subject and object.
                  However, in Buddhism it is not only this insight that is important.<br><br>That
                  is David Loy clearly stated that Non-duality is either No Self or All
                  Self, and permits no duality between a 'true self' and 'not self',
                  observer and observed. Which is true. So he is right that both Buddhism
                  and Advaita is non-dual teaching, but it is not the whole story.<br><br>What
                  is overlooked/not mentioned here is that though non-duality may be
                  experienced as an All-Self and hence subject and object are not
                  divided, one can still extrapolate all phenomena as being extensions of
                  a universal substratum (i.e. reifying Brahman as an Absolute/Universal
                  Consciousness) -- and hence seeing reality as an inherent ontological
                  essence, which is not in accord with the principles of Shunyata.
                  Non-duality here is seen as the union/inseparability of objects with
                  Subject, but the insight of No-Subject has not arisen.<br><br>In Stage
                  5, there is only vivid reflection and manifestation without
                  mirror/Subject, there is no mirror (Ultimate Subject) reflecting or
                  being in union with the manifestations. 'Everything' is a process,
                  event, manifestation and phenomenon, nothing ontological or having an
                  essence. Stage 5 is quite thorough in being no one and Thusness calls
                  this anatta in all 3 aspects -- no subject/object division, no
                  doer-ship and absence of agent. There is no agent, not just no
                  subject/object division. This is Buddhism's No-Self.<br><br>So the
                  difference between Advaita's non-dualism of brahman and world and
                  Buddhism's No-Self is the difference between Thusness's Stage 4 and 5
                  which he explained in his comments: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/200...experience.html</a><br><br>And
                  also as I said earlier, Dependent Origination and Emptiness (Stage 6)
                  is overlooked -- since the thesis is focused on the similarities on the
                  Non-Dual aspect (Stage 4).<br><br>In my opinion, we should read both David Loy's book on Nonduality, and then read the article by <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/02/madhyamika-buddhism-vis-vis-hindu.html">Acharya Mahayogi Shridhar Rana Rinpoche on Madhyamika Buddhism Vis-a-vis Hindu Vedanta</a>,
                  to have a balanced view of the similarities and differences. To know
                  only the difference is not enough, we must also be able to see the
                  non-dual aspect which is also an important insight and experience.
                  Likewise to see the similarities is not enough, we have to see
                  Dependent Origination and Emptiness and the paradigm difference due to
                  this.</blockquote></div>

              <p>Actually not all of Thusness's 7 stages are about emptiness. Particularly, only 5 and 6 talks about emptiness.</p>
              <p>As explained earlier the meaning of 'emptiness' in other religions are very different from Buddhism's meaning of emptiness. Other religions do not teach about the Buddhist emptiness even though they may use that term. Emptiness in Buddhism is not refering to 'The Void' or a formless, shapeless all-pervading presence, rather it is talking about the two emptinesses:</p>
              <p>1) Emptiness of Self, i.e. Anatta, No-Self (Thusness Stage 5) -- this however must be clearly distinguished from teachings found in other religions that talk about 'letting go of the ego' yet teaching a true self distinct from phenomena, something <em>behind</em> and <em>watching</em> everything including thoughts and personality. Emptiness of self does not mean a state of no-ego. It does not mean let go of your attachment to your conceptual image of yourself -- even though this is important, this is not what the Buddhist teaching of No-Self means. Also, it is not talking about a state (whether a state of no-personality-attachment, or a state where duality falls away) but is talking about something that has to be realised -- as always being the case.</p>
              <p>No-self means that a self/agent, a doer, a thinker, a watcher, etc, cannot be found
                                              apart from the moment to moment flow of manifestation or as its
                                              commonly expressed as ‘the observer is the observed’; there is no self
                                              apart from arising and passing. There is just  a process, event, manifestation and phenomenon (the five skandhas), nothing ontological or having an essence, empty of any atman or soul, and the knowingness/awareness is simply this flow of phenomenality that 'knows' by itself without a separate observer.</p>
              <p>A very important point here is that
                                              Anatta/No-Self is a Dharma Seal, it is the nature of Reality all the
                                              time -- and not merely as a state free from personality, ego or the
                                              ‘small self’ or a stage to attain. This means that it does not depend on the level of achievement of a practitioner to experience anatta but <strong>Reality has always been Anatta</strong> and what is important here is the intuitive insight into it as the nature, characteristic, of phenomenon (dharma seal).</p>
              <p>To put further emphasis on the importance of this point, I would like to borrow from the Bahiya Sutta (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.irel.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.irel.html</a>)
                                          that ‘in the seeing, there is just the seen, no seer’, ‘in the hearing,
                                          there is just the heard, no hearer’ as an illustration. When a person
                                          says that I have gone beyond the experiences from ‘I hear sound’ to a
                                          stage of ‘becoming sound’, he is mistaken. When it is taken to be a
                                          stage, it is illusory. For in actual case, there is and always is only
                                          sound when hearing; never was there a hearer to begin with. Nothing
                                          attained for it is always so. This is the seal of no-self. Therefore to
                                          a non dualist, the practice is in understanding the illusionary views
                                          of the sense of self and the split.</p>
              <p>Before the awakening of prajna wisdom, there will always be an
                                          unknowing attempt to maintain a purest state of 'presence'. This purest
                                          presence is the 'how' of a dualistic mind -- its dualistic attempt to
                                          provide a solution due to its lack of clarity of the spontaneous nature
                                          of the unconditioned. It is critical to note here that both the
                                          doubts/confusions/searches and the solutions that are created for these
                                          doubts/confusions/searches actually derive from the same cause -- our
                                          karmic propensities of ever seeing things dualistically.</p>

                          any dharma implies no-self in a person, but the latter is separated out
                          in the first category. Realization of the emptiness of self in a person
                          will lead to attainment of Arhatship or Pratyekabuddhahood.

              <p>The closest to Buddhism however in my understanding would be Lao Tzu, whom my Buddhist master, and many others including Thusness, and many other Chinese and Tibetan masters considers as enlightened or a pratyekabuddha. He was born in a time before Shakyamuni Buddha and his teachings, and his wisdom in the 81 lines of Tao Te Ching (the only teaching he left behind before retreating into wilderness) is deeply profound and does not deviate from the dharma. However after him, it doesn't seem his students grasped the essence. Even Chuang Tzu is not there... as Thusness said, Chuang Tzu only stress on "non-doing until luminosity becomes clear". Thusness have said, in Taoism only that 81 lines is truly profound. He also stated that Buddhism is much more precise in the path and teachings to lead the practitioner to enlightenment, it is almost like a science.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I appreciate all contemplative spiritual traditions in the world and understands that they all lead their practitioners to true, authentic spiritual experience. However, I do not agree that Buddhism's enlightenment and understanding is the same as theirs, because of the crucial paradigm difference well elucidated by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/02/madhyamika-buddhism-vis-vis-hindu.html">Acharya Mahayogi Shridhar Rana Rinpoche on

              <p> </p>
              <p>And as <a href="http://www.skepticfiles.org/mys5/shorter.htm">this article's commentary</a> rightly states:</p>
              <pre><span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">The "doctrines of <br>  others" (//parappavada//), the Buddha says, are devoid of true <br>  recluses, of those who stand on these elevated planes. In order to <br>  understand this statement properly, it is important to distinguish <br>  exactly what the words imply and what they do not imply. The words do <br>  not mean that other religions are destitute of persons of saintly <br>  stature. Such religions may well engender individuals who have <br>  attained to a high degree of spiritual purity -- beings of noble <br>  character, lofty virtue, deep contemplative experience, and rich <br>  endowment with love and compassion. These religions, however, would <br>  not be capable of giving rise to //ariyan// individuals, those <br>  equipped with the penetrative wisdom that can cut through the bonds <br>  that fetter living beings to samsara, the round of repeated birth and <br>  death. For such wisdom can only be engendered on a basis of right view <br>  -- the view of the three characteristics of all conditioned phenomena, <br>  of dependent arising, and of the Four Noble Truths -- and that view is <br>  promulgated exclusively in the fold of the Buddha's Dispensation. <br></span></span></pre>

              <p>Dear AEN,</p>
              <p>Hmm... in my humble opinion, what the Buddha is said to
              propound here cannot be confirmed as true by any means that I know as
              we do not have knowledge of all the religions in this world.</p>
              <p>For
              example, let us say a bodhisattva is in training. This bodhisattva is
              training to be a Samyak Sam Buddha, a fully enlightened one. He trains
              by himself and at times, does not join the congregation of the Buddha
              although a Buddha might be present (this does happens at times).
              Slowly, his wisdom and conduct attracts a group of friends or
              followers. He calls his group XXX religion. From his paramis (previous
              cultivation), he easily attains the jnanas (knowledges) through his own
              meditation. As such, his teachings will be based on these knowledges.
              These knowledges will not be in opposition with the Buddha's teachings.
              As so, can we say that XXX religion does not contain an Arya? I do not
              think so..</p>
              <p>Anyhow, I feel such speculations are ultimately not
              useful to the our goal of enlightenment. I believe, to judge whether
              another religion is on the path or not, firstly, we should have
              attained the knowledges and insightsfor ourselves . Next, we should not
              use a religion's writings to judge a religion. As said by many masters,
              words are insufficient to describe the knowledges or insights or the
              Truth. Even within our own religion of Buddhism, there has been a long
              drawn battle between the Madyamika views of 2 schools of Madyamika
              Thought in Tibetan Buddhism. How are we to say that one is right and
              one is wrong? It is only the idea that I get from his words are
              different from my idea of my experience. It might be a huge
              misunderstanding in the end.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, that's why I feel,
              we cannot as a sweeping statement comment on other religions or their
              spiritual expereince as spiritual experiences are really beyond words.
              If one really wants to know what is the other person's
              insight/experience, one really has to sit down and discuss face to
              face. If one has the ability to meditate to the level such that he is
              able to perceive another's mind or the other's heart base, then it can
              also be achieved.</p>
              <p>On a lighter note, it might also be due to my
              scholarlastic training that I am always very critical of anyone making
              sweeping statements! Even the Buddha! Haha!</p>

              <p>If the Bodhisattva realised the exact same things as Buddhism, then it would make no sense to start a religion, especially given the availability of modern technologies where Buddhist teachings are basically available everywhere. In fact throughout history, there is no other teaching like that of Buddhism, that teaches about dependent origination. If that Bodhisattva realised the same things, he/she will not claim to realise a new truth that is not already realised by countless others with well-documented teachings. To do so would be sheer arrogance/ignorance.</p>
              <p>The only reasonable reason to start a new religion is when there is a crucial paradigm difference, that is why in Buddhism there are different traditions, but to be considered a true Buddhist school you cannot deviate from some of the main core teachings, like dependent origination, the three seals, emptiness, etc. You do not talk about eternalism, ontological essence, atman-brahman, etc. We teach that non-dual consciousness is the transience and individual mindstream itself, we do not teach about consciousness as a cosmic entity or unchanging background reality. Similarly if there were not crucial paradigm differences, it would not account for the need for Buddha to start a new religion which he clearly distinguished from other vedic traditions. He would not have taught if it was merely just something that could already be found in the vedic religion or the upanishads.</p>
              <p>This is a good article I would recommend: <a class="Normal" href="http://www.byomakusuma.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=76&amp;tabid=76&amp;mid=418">Madhyamika Buddhism Vis-a-vis Hindu Vedanta</a></p>
              <p>Having read this, you will then abe able to see why Buddhism's difference with other religions is certainly not just mere semantics, but the difference is in terms of very coarse, crude, views that make up a paradigm difference, and if lets say a Hindu is unable to understand the Buddhist paradigm they will only be able to use their own paradigm to perceive Buddhist teachings on a very superficial level and not grasp its essence.</p>

              <p>Nevertheless they can be described, and people with different realisations will describe them differently. The I AMness is by no means the final realisation and experience. And there are different levels, kinds, and types of experiences. One must never confuse one experience with another. An experience/realisation of I AMness is not the same as the experience/realisation of non-duality, the experience/realisation of non-duality is not the experience/realisation of No-Self, the experience/realisation of No-Self is not the same as the experience/realisation of Emptiness. This is what we should understand.</p>

                                  of the bell (stage 4 - nondual experience), these experiences concerns the vivid

                                  luminosity and emptiness which the great masters and scriptures teach, is what Buddha-nature is.
                                  Unable to see its emptiness, and because Awareness feels so real and we're unable to perceive the relation between interdependent origination and awareness, we will grasp onto Awareness as an unchanging, independent,
                                  ontological essence and thus misunderstand the true nature of mind...
                                  rather than seeing impermanence, interdependency, and emptiness. There would have been no need for Buddha to teach if he were merely to talk about Self and Luminosity, this has been covered indepth in the Upanishads and all other contemplative texts in different religions.</p>
              <p>With this understanding in mind, one will be able to understand why Dr. Greg Goode, who had deep experience of the Non Dual Absolute before humbling himself and further penetrates the profundity of 'Emptiness', said:<br> <br> <em>For those who encounter emptiness teachings after they've

                                      it's very easy to misread the emptiness teachings by seeing
                                      "emptiness" on the page and thinking to yourself, "awareness,
                                      consciousness, I know what they're talking about."<br> <br> Early in my own study I began with this substitution in mind. With
                                      this misreading, I found a lot in the emptiness teachings to be
                                      quite INcomprehensible! So I started again, laying aside the notion
                                      that "emptiness" and "awareness" were equivalent. I tried to let
                                      the emptiness teachings speak for themselves. I came to find that
                                      they have a subtle beauty and power, a flavor quite different from
                                      the awareness teachings. Emptiness teachings do not speak of
                                      emptiness as a true nature that underlies or supports things.
                                      Rather, it speaks of selves and things as essenceless and
                                      free.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We must also establish the right views (no-self, emptiness), otherwise no matter how hard our practice, our transcendental experience will be distorted and we will get stuck in the Advaita Vedanta/Hindu sort of experience "forever" (unless one is able to look into Buddhism sincerely without filters of his ego).</p>

              <p>Sadly over the years I have gone through debates with practitioners of the other religions (e.g. Advaita Vedanta, Kashmir Shaivism, etc), and it is so clear that there is a clear paradigm difference and not understanding this paradigm difference, they will never understand why Buddhism is not like their religions. They will only be able to interprete the teachings of the Buddha through (and be limited by)  their own lens, experience, paradigm, and fail to see the essence.</p>
              <p>If we are a Buddhist, we must have some level of faith in the Buddha, otherwise when certain experience comes there will be a limit.</p>

              <p>Hellos,</p>
              <p>Well, it can be quite surprising, even with the current technologies, some people on earth may not have heard of Buddhism before. At these places, can we say that those people are living in an era where the Buddha's Teachings are lost? Subjectively, to these people, it is true because, where they are, there are no Buddhas or Buddhism. Objectively, it is false because somewhere else, there is the Buddha's teachings. So is that a different era from ours or is it the same? Things in this world aren't that straight forward.</p>
              <p>The reason why some bodhisattvas avoid joining the dispensation of the Buddha is that they have no intention of entering even Stream-enterer.If they do, they would only have 7 lifetimes left and that would not be enough time for them to perfect their perfections.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>We should have clear discernment of our own teachings, and
                                      having clear discernment of our teachings we will also have clear
                                      discernment of the differences between our teachings and the
                                      teachings of other religions.</p>
              <p>If you do not have Right View strongly established, you will not
                                      even be able to tell the difference between Buddhism and Hinduism
                                      and other religions. And Right View is the start, the first, of the
                                      Noble Eight-fold Path. This is very important.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What you say is true, knowing another and knowing oneself is important.<br>However, having a clear discernemnt of ourselves and the true nature of things in this world is more important. I believe that Right View can only be established through practice and insights gained. Words only point the way...most of the time, they miss the point!</p>
              <p>Once, a Zen master visited the 5 Patriarch's temple. On a wall in the temple were the famous inscriptions of his poem "Bodhi is not a tree..." The Master told the abbot that there is a mistake in the poem and asked the abbot what was it. What do you think the problem is?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>If we are a Buddhist, we must have some level of faith in the
                                      Buddha, otherwise when certain experience comes there will be a
                                      limit.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>True, faith is important. The teachings are the markers on the path and we are the walkers. Without faith, we would not even take the route as indicated by the markers. But how can there be a limit? If there is such a limit, then the Kalama Sutta would not have been declared. Nevertheless, if one were to have complete faith in the words of the Buddha, it is also commendable too! Afterall, while there are the Wisdom and Effort Bodhisattvas, there are also the Faith Bodhisattvas.</p>

              <p>Actually, no. Without learning the Buddha's teachings on the right view of no-self and dependent origination, one can never hope to gain right view no matter how hard one practices. One will end up in the Advaita Vedanta sort of experience. There will be a desync of view and experience. And any transcendental experience will only end up strengthening the karmic propensity and bond of a Self.</p>
              <p>Right View is meant to be established through learning the teachings. I will post something on that in the next post.</p>
              <p>BTW, the day before Buddha attained enlightenment, he remembered a 'long forgotten truth' from his past lives. What is it? Dependent origination. Contemplating thus, he attained awakening.</p>

              <p>He's trying to purify his mind rather than understand the nature of mind. It is more important to realise the nature of mind. Nothing can stain the nature of mind or leave any traces, so one should be introduced to it and abide as it</p>
              <p>BTW, even the 6th Patriarch poem (bodhi is no tree...) at that time still does not show great awakening, even though there was some realisation. This is not what I said, this is what the sutra said, what my dharma teacher said, what Thusness said, and many other masters I've read have said that. It is still not the insight of non-duality, which he gained after being taught by 5th Patriarch at night.</p>
              <p>Regarding 'purifying the mind', of course, in the beginning to have an initial glimpse of pure
                              awareness it's still important to quiet the mind, go pre-thought and
                              have a direct touch of the luminous presence. But it is only for the
                              initial glimpse, at later stages we integrate that presence with
                              thoughts and perceptions by realising its non-duality. One must not go polishing the mirror indefinitely but realise that the dust is the mirror.</p>

              <p>Kalama Sutta is taught for a group of non-Buddhist to have discernment and choose the correct teaching. If upon analysis and reflection, that teaching is blameless, leads to something good, is praised by the wise, etc, then one should accept it and live up to it. It is not saying not to have faith, but have faith only after analysis and reflection, etc.</p>
              <p>Once you picked Buddhism as your path, then to have full faith in the triple gem's ability to lead one to enlightenment is important, and having full faith in Buddha, we will need to practice and experience it ourselves. Then, faith turns into conviction born of direct experience. However without first having faith and taking Buddha's words seriously, we will never be able to experience what the Buddha taught.</p>

                      View is indispensible in Buddhism, it is the 1st of the 8 fold path.
                      And that view essentially, is Emptiness/Dependent Origination.<br><br>In
                      Buddhism, the path (naked awareness of everything as it is) alone
                      cannot lead to fruition (liberation), having right view (Emptiness) is
                      necessary and crucial. That is, only through having the right view with
                      the right practices (path) then fruition of liberation can arise.<br><br>Even
                      after the arising of non-dual insight, there is a period of desync
                      between what is experienced and the existing paradigm we used to
                      orientate the world. It is a de-synchronization between views and
                      meditative experience. That is, a practitioner will find great
                      difficulties when trying to express the experience based on a
                      subject/object dichotomy. It can be quite frustrating and the
                      practitioner may get himself confused during the process.<br><br>In
                      Buddhism there is a complete system of thought to orientate ourselves
                      non-dually, that is, the viewless-view of Emptiness. It is a raft but
                      it is the antidote for the conventional mind to orientate itself in a
                      non-dual and non-local context. It also led to the amazing insight that
                      ‘duality’ is really the result of seeing and taking things ‘inherently’.<br><br>In the practice of non-conceptuality, the firm establishment of right view is not a problem.<br>In the practice of thoughtlessness, thought is not a problem.<br>In the practice of selflessness, self is not a problem.<br><br>Experiences
                      of our non-dual nature can still surface intermittently even when the
                      tendency to see things dualistically is still strong. At times when the
                      layer that divides is temporary suspended, non-dual is most vivid and
                      clear and practitioners may wrongly conclude that ‘concepts’ are the
                      problem because the presence of ‘concepts’ divides and prevent the
                      non-dual experience. This seems logical and reasonable only to a mind
                      that is deeply root in a subject/object dichotomy. Very quickly
                      ‘non-conceptuality’ becomes an object of practice. The process of
                      objectification is the result of the tendency in action perpetually
                      repeating itself taking different forms like an endless loop. This can
                      continue to the extent that a practitioner can even ‘fear’ to establish
                      concepts without knowing it. On the other hand, the continuous enquiry
                      can also lead an inquirer into a situation of utter confusion to the
                      extent that he/she doubts even his/her own existence.<br><br>It is not
                      uncommon to find practitioners totally giving up this attempt to
                      synchronize "views" and experience and conclude that it is an absolute
                      futile endeavor to do that. They prefer to rest fully in naked
                      awareness.<br><br>By doing so, the practitioner will miss something valuable -- the insight of the importance of "non inherent existence".</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 100%;">In
                      fact, dualistic view is merely a subset of seeing things 'inherently'.
                      Further understanding will also reveal that the bad habit of
                      'searching' is the result of seeing things 'inherently'. Our inability
                      to sustain a non-dual experience is also the result of it. The
                      formation of a 'center' that we are so unwilling to give up is merely a
                      natural phenomenon of our deeply held 'inherent' views.</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br><br>Like
                      a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right in front of an observer,
                      the “redness” only appears to “belong” to the flower, it is in
                      actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal species
                      (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an attribute of the
                      mind... and in Buddhism we recognise that there are other realms'
                      beings who can see something completely different. If given a “quantum
                      eyesight” to look into the atomic structure, there is similarly no
                      attribute “redness” anywhere found, only almost complete space/void
                      with no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever appearances are
                      dependently arisen, and hence is empty of any inherent existence or
                      fixed attributes, shapes, form, or “redness” -- merely luminous yet
                      empty, mere Appearances without inherent/objective existence. What
                      gives rise to the differences of colours and experiences in each of us?
                      Dependent arising... hence empty of inherent existence. This is the
                      nature of all phenomena. They are empty of any inherent objective
                      existence in a 'really-out-there' kind of way.<br><br>As you've seen,
                      there is no ‘The Flowerness’ seen by a dog, an insect or us, or beings
                      from other realms (which really may have a completely different mode of
                      perception). ‘'The Flowerness' is an illusion that does not stay even
                      for a moment, merely an aggregate of causes and conditions. Analogous
                      to the example of ‘flowerness’, there is no ‘selfness’ serving as a
                      background witnessing either -- pristine awareness is not the
                      witnessing background. Rather, the entire whole of the moment of
                      manifestation is our pristine awareness; lucidly clear, yet empty of
                      inherent existence. This is the way of ‘seeing’ the one as many, the
                      observer and the observed are one and the same. This is also the
                      meaning of formlessness and attributelessness of our nature. But this
                      does not mean that awareness is void or nothing, it is full of forms,
                      full of colours, as Emptiness is Form... just empty of 'inherent
                      existence'. So Emptiness, in Buddhism, strictly means Dependent Arising.</span></p>

                      rests on the idea that ultimate nature is somewhere else, than the
                      realm in which we live. Utterly removed from, and different from, the
                      realm of experience, ultimacy can then only be accessed through a step
                      by step process which disengages me from this realm in which I dwell.
                      In other words, apophaticism and mysticism are dualistic, creating a
                      division in existence, minimally between the conceptual and ultimacy,
                      and in extreme cases between ultimacy and everything which I experience.<br><br>My
                      understanding of the Dharma does not regard the realm in which I dwell
                      as removed from the ultimate nature of Interdependent Transformation.
                      Ultimacy does not exist somewhere else. It is not a matter of
                      contacting some other domain in order to access ultimacy. Rather it is
                      a matter of shifting our attention so that I can perceive and
                      comprehend the actuality of things. From this perspective, my
                      understanding of existence is misconstrued and my perception of things
                      is askew. The purpose of Dharma study and practice is to correct these
                      misunderstandings, both conceptually and perceptually, to overcome
                      ignorance and the habits that give rise to this ignorance. When that is
                      done, the ultimate nature of all existing things and existence itself,
                      stands forth as the Interdependent Transformation nature which
                      permeates all of existence, unlocated, ever present, never far.<br><br>I
                      realize that this way of comprehending the Dharma sets me at odds with
                      those traditions which regard the ultimate nature of existence, Buddha
                      Nature, Nirvana, as something which can not be accessed through study
                      and thinking. I can only say that at one time I agreed with this view,
                      but that my undersanding has now moved to a view which encompasses
                      thought, conceptuality, study, and thinking within the domain of
                      ultimacy without ejecting anything else from that domain. To set
                      thought aside, from the perspective of Interdependent Transformation,
                      makes no more sense than asking someone to set aside hearing, or to set
                      aside seeing. Just as all visual phenomena have the nature of
                      Interdependent Transformation, just as all sonic phenomena have the
                      nature of Interdependent Transformation, so also all thoughts, all
                      concepts, also have the nature of Interdependent Transformation. For
                      this reason rejecting thoughts and concepts means limiting the extent
                      of the play of ultimate nature. But Buddha Nautre as Interdependent
                      Transformation marks all existing things. Marking all existing things,
                      this nature marks all thoughts. Marking all thoughts and concepts,
                      thoughts and concepts, when comprehended in their totality, and as
                      Interdependent Transformations, graciously display the true nature of
                      all existing things. Words also have a luminously clear nature.
                      Thoughts also sparkle with elemental transformative energy. Concepts
                      also shimmer with the ever flowing and present energy of all things.
                      Rejecting nothing, the words of the Dharma compassionately guide me to
                      ultimate realization...</span></p>

                      experienced from moment to moment, the holding of ‘right view’ will
                      naturally dissolve in its own accord as it is fully authenticated in
                      real time from moment to moment.</span></p>

              <p>Something Thusness wrote last year:</p>
              <p><br> Of all teachings, no teaching is more important then a direct
                                      ‘touch’ of our Buddha essence; but of all dangers, none is more
                                      dangerous than misinterpreting our essence after the ‘touch’.
                                      The ‘touch’ of the pure sense of existence is often wrongly
                                      understood due to our karmic tendencies.  Use the doctrine of
                                      Anatta and Emptiness as antidote.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A post by Thusness from October 2006:</p>
              <p>In Buddhism what that is most important is the no-mirror
                                          reflecting (stage 5). That is entry towards pathless and
                                          effortless. Without it, all rest is the bond at work and continual
                                          creation of wholesome actions to counter unwholesome action.<br> <br> Many non-dual fail to realize the deep latent propensities in our
                                          consciousness. Not knowing that the progressive stages that one
                                          undergone are nothing but mere working of these tendencies. This is
                                          a pity. Failure to realize this, one fails to see how consciousness
                                          works.<br> <br> Constant identification itself <strong>will create</strong> this
                                          pattern that sinks deep into consciousness. Take note. No one can
                                          escape, not even the Blessed One. There always has been no-self,
                                          there is only One Reality but the propensities over countless
                                          lifetimes will continue to take place through mere momentum. This
                                          is what we are all facing.<br> <br> Knowing this, right and firm establishment of view of the dharma
                                          seals is most crucial. Through diligent practice of mindfulness and
                                          together with the right views from start will help to prevent
                                          unnecessary pitfalls. Any transcendental experiences and insights
                                          that occurred during our journey will then be correctly understood.
                                          The experiences will in turn re-enforce our understanding instead
                                          of misleading us into the sense of 'Self' and further strengthen
                                          the bond.</p>
