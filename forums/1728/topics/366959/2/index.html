              <p>Once you picked Buddhism as your path, then to have full faith in the triple gem's ability to lead one to enlightenment is important, and having full faith in Buddha, we will need to practice and experience it ourselves. Then, faith turns into conviction born of direct experience. However without first having faith and taking Buddha's words seriously, we will never be able to experience what the Buddha taught.</p>

              <p>The pratyekaBuddha had perfect their paramitas over many lifetime and could be Buddhist in their many past lives. However, In there very lifetime, they are awakened to the truth despite there is no existing buddhism in there very lifetime.Now how do they have the right view then since in there lifetime there is no Buddha's teaching? </p>
              <p>I think nature of reality can be penetrated when you have the right cause and condition. </p>
              <p>It is very very rare to have relics from other religion. Most of the religion which i know of does not taught such a systematic ways like the noble eightfold path, 5 factors of awakening etc. You also need to cultivate... have sila, samadhi and wisdom etc. right?</p>

              <p>Actually, no. Without learning the Buddha's teachings on the right view of no-self and dependent origination, one can never hope to gain right view no matter how hard one practices. One will end up in the Advaita Vedanta sort of experience. There will be a desync of view and experience. And any transcendental experience will only end up strengthening the karmic propensity and bond of a Self.</p>
              <p>Right View is meant to be established through learning the teachings. I will post something on that in the next post.</p>
              <p>BTW, the day before Buddha attained enlightenment, he remembered a 'long forgotten truth' from his past lives. What is it? Dependent origination. Contemplating thus, he attained awakening.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think both of you have a common ground. The Dharma teaching serves as pointer, only if one really knows how to read their heart / insight from meditation truly understand the dharma.</p>

              <p>In this issue of the newsletter we
              have combined the feature essay with the "Sutta Study" column as we
              take a fresh look at an often quoted discourse of the Buddha, the <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html">Kalama Sutta</a>. The discourse — found in translation in <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html">Wheel No. 8</a> — has been described as "the Buddha's Charter of Free Inquiry," and
              though the discourse certainly does counter the decrees of dogmatism
              and blind faith with a vigorous call for free investigation, it is
              problematic whether the sutta can support all the positions that have
              been ascribed to it. On the basis of a single passage, quoted out of
              context, the Buddha has been made out to be a pragmatic empiricist who
              dismisses all doctrine and faith, and whose Dhamma is simply a
              freethinker's kit to truth which invites each one to accept and reject
              whatever he likes.</p>
              <p>But does the Kalama Sutta really justify
              such views? Or do we meet in these claims just another set of
              variations on that egregious old tendency to interpret the Dhamma
              according to whatever notions are congenial to oneself — or to those to
              whom one is preaching? Let us take as careful a look at the Kalama
              Sutta as the limited space allotted to this essay will allow,
              remembering that in order to understand the Buddha's utterances
              correctly it is essential to take account of his own intentions in
              making them.</p>
              <p>The passage that has been cited so often runs
              as follows: "Come, Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired by
              repeated hearing, nor upon tradition, nor upon rumor, nor upon
              scripture, nor upon surmise, nor upon axiom, nor upon specious
              reasoning, nor upon bias toward a notion pondered over, nor upon
              another's seeming ability, nor upon the consideration 'The monk is our
              teacher.' When you yourselves know: 'These things are bad, blamable,
              censured by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to
              harm and ill,' abandon them... When you yourselves know: 'These things
              are good, blameless, praised by the wise; undertaken and observed,
              these things lead to benefit and happiness,' enter on and abide in
              them."</p>
              <p>Now this passage, like everything else spoken by the
              Buddha, has been stated in a specific context — with a particular
              audience and situation in view — and thus must be understood in
              relation to that context. The Kalamas, citizens of the town of
              Kesaputta, had been visited by religious teachers of divergent views,
              each of whom would propound his own doctrines and tear down the
              doctrines of his predecessors. This left the Kalamas perplexed, and
              thus when "the recluse Gotama," reputed to be an Awakened One, arrived
              in their township, they approached him in the hope that he might be
              able to dispel their confusion. From the subsequent development of the
              sutta, it is clear that the issues that perplexed them were the reality
              of rebirth and kammic retribution for good and evil deeds.</p>
              <p>The
              Buddha begins by assuring the Kalamas that under such circumstances it
              is proper for them to doubt, an assurance which encourages free
              inquiry. He next speaks the passage quoted above, advising the Kalamas
              to abandon those things they know for themselves to be bad and to
              undertake those things they know for themselves to be good. This advice
              can be dangerous if given to those whose ethical sense is undeveloped,
              and we can thus assume that the Buddha regarded the Kalamas as people
              of refined moral sensitivity. In any case he did not leave them wholly
              to their own resources, but by questioning them led them to see that
              greed, hate and delusion, being conducive to harm and suffering for
              oneself and others, are to be abandoned, and their opposites, being
              beneficial to all, are to be developed.</p>
              <p>The Buddha next
              explains that a "noble disciple, devoid of covetousness and ill will,
              undeluded" dwells pervading the world with boundless loving-kindness,
              compassion, appreciative joy and equanimity. Thus purified of hate and
              malice, he enjoys here and now four "solaces": If there is an afterlife
              and kammic result, then he will undergo a pleasant rebirth, while if
              there is none he still lives happily here and now; if evil results
              befall an evil-doer, then no evil will befall him, and if evil results
              do not befall an evil-doer, then he is purified anyway. With this the
              Kalamas express their appreciation of the Buddha's discourse and go for
              refuge to the Triple Gem.</p>
              <p>Now does the Kalama Sutta
              suggest, as is often held, that a follower of the Buddhist path can
              dispense with all faith and doctrine, that he should make his own
              personal experience the criterion for judging the Buddha's utterances
              and for rejecting what cannot be squared with it? It is true the Buddha
              does not ask the Kalamas to accept anything he says out of confidence
              in himself, but let us note one important point: the Kalamas, at the
              start of the discourse, were not the Buddha's disciples. They
              approached him merely as a counselor who might help dispel their
              doubts, but they did not come to him as the Tathagata, the
              Truth-finder, who might show them the way to spiritual progress and to
              final liberation.</p>
              <p>Thus, because the Kalamas had not yet
              come to accept the Buddha in terms of his unique mission, as the
              discloser of the liberating truth, it would not have been in place for
              him to expound to them the Dhamma unique to his own Dispensation: such
              teachings as the Four Noble Truths, the three characteristics, and the
              methods of contemplation based upon them. These teachings are
              specifically intended for those who have accepted the Buddha as their
              guide to deliverance, and in the suttas he expounds them only to those
              who "have gained faith in the Tathagata" and who possess the
              perspective necessary to grasp them and apply them. The Kalamas,
              however, at the start of the discourse are not yet fertile soil for him
              to sow the seeds of his liberating message. Still confused by the
              conflicting claims to which they have been exposed, they are not yet
              clear even about the groundwork of morality.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless,
              after advising the Kalamas not to rely upon established tradition,
              abstract reasoning, and charismatic gurus, the Buddha proposes to them
              a teaching that is immediately verifiable and capable of laying a firm
              foundation for a life of moral discipline and mental purification. He
              shows that whether or not there be another life after death, a life of
              moral restraint and of love and compassion for all beings brings its
              own intrinsic rewards here and now, a happiness and sense of inward
              security far superior to the fragile pleasures that can be won by
              violating moral principles and indulging the mind's desires. For those
              who are not concerned to look further, who are not prepared to adopt
              any convictions about a future life and worlds beyond the present one,
              such a teaching will ensure their present welfare and their safe
              passage to a pleasant rebirth — provided they do not fall into the
              wrong view of denying an afterlife and kammic causation.</p>
              <p>However,
              for those whose vision is capable of widening to encompass the broader
              horizons of our existence, this teaching given to the Kalamas points
              beyond its immediate implications to the very core of the Dhamma. For
              the three states brought forth for examination by the Buddha — greed,
              hate and delusion — are not merely grounds of wrong conduct or moral
              stains upon the mind. Within his teaching's own framework they are the
              root defilements — the primary causes of all bondage and suffering —
              and the entire practice of the Dhamma can be viewed as the task of
              eradicating these evil roots by developing to perfection their
              antidotes — dispassion, kindness and wisdom.</p>
              <p>Thus the
              discourse to the Kalamas offers an acid test for gaining confidence in
              the Dhamma as a viable doctrine of deliverance. We begin with an
              immediately verifiable teaching whose validity can be attested by
              anyone with the moral integrity to follow it through to its
              conclusions, namely, that the defilements cause harm and suffering both
              personal and social, that their removal brings peace and happiness, and
              that the practices taught by the Buddha are effective means for
              achieving their removal. By putting this teaching to a personal test,
              with only a provisional trust in the Buddha as one's collateral, one
              eventually arrives at a firmer, experientially grounded confidence in
              the liberating and purifying power of the Dhamma. This increased
              confidence in the teaching brings along a deepened faith in the Buddha
              as teacher, and thus disposes one to accept on trust those principles
              he enunciates that are relevant to the quest for awakening, even when
              they lie beyond one's own capacity for verification. This, in fact,
              marks the acquisition of right view, in its preliminary role as the
              forerunner of the entire Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
              <p>Partly in
              reaction to dogmatic religion, partly in subservience to the reigning
              paradigm of objective scientific knowledge, it has become fashionable
              to hold, by appeal to the Kalama Sutta, that the Buddha's teaching
              dispenses with faith and formulated doctrine and asks us to accept only
              what we can personally verify. This interpretation of the sutta,
              however, forgets that the advice the Buddha gave the Kalamas was
              contingent upon the understanding that they were not yet prepared to
              place faith in him and his doctrine; it also forgets that the sutta
              omits, for that very reason, all mention of right view and of the
              entire perspective that opens up when right view is acquired. It offers
              instead the most reasonable counsel on wholesome living possible when
              the issue of ultimate beliefs has been put into brackets.</p>
              <p>What
              can be justly maintained is that those aspects of the Buddha's teaching
              that come within the purview of our ordinary experience can be
              personally confirmed within experience, and that this confirmation
              provides a sound basis for placing faith in those aspects of the
              teaching that necessarily transcend ordinary experience. Faith in the
              Buddha's teaching is never regarded as an end in itself nor as a
              sufficient guarantee of liberation, but only as the starting point for
              an evolving process of inner transformation that comes to fulfillment
              in personal insight. But in order for this insight to exercise a truly
              liberative function, it must unfold in the context of an accurate grasp
              of the essential truths concerning our situation in the world and the
              domain where deliverance is to be sought. These truths have been
              imparted to us by the Buddha out of his own profound comprehension of
              the human condition. To accept them in trust after careful
              consideration is to set foot on a journey which transforms faith into
              wisdom, confidence into certainty, and culminates in liberation from
              suffering.</p>

                              you mean by Right View. Correct me if I am wrong, what you mean is that a
                              person should have an idea of what the right view is before cultivation. If not
                              he may be misled and never finally get the realizations of Right View. From
                              where I come from, ideas are de-emphasized as they make something out of
                              nothing. Or rather, they are not the thing itself, so when I talk of Right
                              View, I always mean the realization of Right View. I would not call a person who
                              has only a theoretical idea of the Right View as having the Right View. </span></p>

                              emptiness etc, they easily gain back these knowledges. For example, the re-incarnated Lamas or Tulkus. I do not know if
                              they correspond to the 8<sup>th</sup> Bhumi Bodhisattvas or not. But being enlightened
                              by birth is unheard of. Even the high incarnations like the Dalai Lamas do not

                              As said by our friend Isis, I think there are many kinds of faiths. I think we

                              needed. As what you said, I also think constant reflection on the teaching is
                              necessary. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You know, sometimes with the Kalama Sutta,
                              many religions can be established as correct because they all have a believable
                              complete explanation or story of this world. Like many Christians who feel the
                              presence of God, that is an undeniable experience. Some speak tongues. Without
                              the meditative ability to see the heart bases and minds of oneself, other people and
                              other kinds of beings, we can’t say for sure too what these speaking in tongues is all about. That’s why I always think it
                              is very important to engage in meditation, cultivate concentration and see for
                              ourselves, then wisdom, conviction ias you say, is gained. I feel that should be the way to
                              understand the Buddha’s teachings. When you see clearly by yourself in meditation,
                              how can that be false? If your concentration is good enough, you can even see everyone
                              of your own 'thought moments', the smallest particles on this earth, their
                              properties etc. That is what I really mean by investigation. <br></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Bhikkhu Bodhi’s article, he is
                              clarifying that one should not take the article to mean that faith is not
                              needed for the practice of Buddhism, which I agree, some faith is necessary, if
                              not one would not start on the path in the first place. However, he also points
                              out that the sutra has to be contextualized, this I agree too, ina a way. However, from
                              reasons mentioned above, I still believe that one should not just fully believe
                              everything wholesale. Fully believing should only come with investigation, so one
                              must first cultivate the tools for investigation. Then investigate thoroughly. Some people proclaim things to be false, even before they have the right investigation tools. Some others do not investigate thoroughly enough. With
                              regards to the things which are said that cannot be verified, most of the time,
                              they are not important to the ultimate goal. So whether we believe it or not

              <p>If one were to just practice naked awareness without
                                                                                                                              being mindful of the 3 seals, it will be insufficient to dissolve the
                                                                                                                              bond of inherency. If we are not taught the right view, the three dharma seals, no-self, emptiness, the teaching of dependent origination, we will not even begin looking into that direction. Instead, one will be content with the unchanging non-dual Self or Brahman. Non Dual Awareness feels absolute and the practitioner will not look further, because you feel nothing wrong, and non-dual awareness appears final. You will not even realise that grasping onto an essence is a wrong view. The wrong view of inherency is subtle and strong, and it is a tendency that will keep on surfacing and distorting our experience. Without the Right View as an antidote, there will be no cure. Right View is also like a compass, without it no matter how hard you peddle the boat (i.e. practice) you'll never be able to reach the other shore -- because you're not even going the correct direction.</p>
              <p>Also, as Buddha stated in the earlier quote:</p>
              <h4>�One makes an effort to abandon wrong view and to enter upon right
                                                      view: this is one right effort. Mindfully one abandons wrong view,
                                                      mindfully one enters upon and abides in right view: this is one's right
                                                      mindfulness. Thus these three states run and circle around right view,
                                                      that is right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This means that right view, right effort, right mindfulness is interrelated: without right view there cannot be right mindfulness.</p>
              <p>And this is what Vipassana practice is all about: experiencing the 3 characteristics in direct naked awareness in order to give rise to insights.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that mindfulness practice in Vipassana has two aspects: bare attention, and reminding oneself of the 3 dharma seals. Experiencing bare attention, witnessing awareness, or even nondual awareness does not mean we are mindful of the 3 seals, and the latter is very important to give rise to insight of anatta and emptiness:</p>

Right View of D.O. leads to the wisdom of all phenomena as mere illusion-like appearances, like mirage, sky flowers, water paintinings, vivid <em>appearance</em> yet not 'there'/inherent/existing. Free from all extremes. Just like the analogy of the red flower and the dog in the first page, there's nothing inherent to the vivid appearance of red flower. It is not exactly a view that we cling to, rather it is a wisdom that flows into all our experience and enables us to see the illusion-like nature of appearances. It is also the antidote that dissolves Every false view we cherish (eternalistic, nihilistic, or self/things as existing, non-existence, both existing and non-existence, neither existing nor non existing, etc etc), and leaving nothing in the end. Not even a 'view of Emptiness' is held. It is just a raft, an antidote.</p>

                                          existents because of understanding dependent origination, one's mind is
                                          freed from proliferation, and one can acheive liberation. <br><br>...<br><br>At

                                          Bodhicittavivarana:<br><br>"Form is similar to a foam,<br>Feeling is like water bubbles,<br>Ideation is equivalent with a mirage,<br>Formations are similar with a banana tree,<br>Consciousness is like an illusion."</em></p>
              <p><em>...</em></p>
              <p><em>"In other words, right view is the beginning of the noble path. It is certainly
                                                              the case that dependent origination is "correct view"; when one

                                                      existence and non-existence. But when one sees the world's origin as it actually is with
                                                      right understanding, there is for him none of (what is called) non-existence in the world;
                                                      and when he sees the world's cessation as it actually is with right understanding, there
                                                      is for him none of (what is called) existence in the world.</span></p>

                                                      of clinging, and instead of deciding about 'my self,' with such bias, such clinging, and

                                                      uncertainty that what arises is only arising suffering, and what ceases is only ceasing
                                                      suffering, and in this his knowledge is independent of others. That is what 'right view'
                                                      refers to. '(An) all exists' is one extreme; '(an) all does not exist' is the other

                                                      middle way: 'It is with ignorance as condition that formations come to be; with formations
                                                      as condition, consciousness; with consciousness ...' (And so on with both arising and

              <p>However this does not mean a conceptual understanding of it in the beginning is not important. It is actually very important. That is why the Buddha taught the Noble 8 Fold Path and not just 'naked awareness' alone, there are many aspects to the path that is all equally important. Not to skew to just a single aspect of it. Having the View without practicing mindful awareness diligently won't result in insight, practicing naked awareness without right view won't result in insights into the twofold emptiness, hence both are equally important.</p>
              <p>As Thanissaro Bhikkhu explains:</p>
              <p><em>One has to hold onto the raft properly in order to cross the river.
                                                          Only when one has reached the safety of the further shore can one let
                                                          go.</em></p>
              <p>As explained in the previous post, practice of non-conceptual naked awareness will be insufficient to get rid of the tendency to view things inherently if one does not have the right view and were not mindful of the 3 seals, no-self, dependent origination.</p>

                                                                                          no coming or going, can never be lost.</p>
              <p>However, at the earlier phase of experience, it will
                                                                                          not be clear how all transient phenomenon are 'not moving' -- at

                                                                                          but the foreground of transient phenomenon comes and goes from/in

                                      AMness is here for eternity, is never born and never dies. It is the
                                      only constant factor in your experience, or rather, it is YOU. A poetic term for this unchanging presence-awareness is "The Still Point in a Turning World". No matter what happens, I AM still that I AM. However, as explained in the article <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html">The Spell of Karmic Propensities</a>, the sense that I AM is eternal behind change is still due to the influence of karmic propensities of seeing dualistically and inherently. I have to say that I have not overcome this propensities because I still have the strong sense of a constant image of I AM and Eternal Witness with only passing glimpses of non-dual experience.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p># View with taints: this view is mundane. Having this type of view will bring merit and will support the favourable existence of the sentient being in the realm of samsara.<br># View without taints: this view is supramundane. It is a factor of the path and will lead the holder of this view toward self-awakening and liberation from the realm of samsara.<br># The bond of Subject-Object duality: This bond prevents us from the direct experience of anything. It is the sense of a separate self, that is "in here" experiencing something "out there". When hearing the music, it feels that I am an inner experiencer and the music is outside. When non-dual reality is realised, there is no inner-outer division, no me in here and music out there. Just the ISness of the music. You don't hear the music, the music hears. You don't see the scenery, the scenery sees. This is the beginning of seeing through the sense of a separate  self, yet there can still be strong grasping on an ultimate unchanging non-dual Self/Absolute.<br># The bond of Inherency: There are two levels to the bond of inherency: the bond of seeing self as inherent, and the bond of seeing dharmas as inherent. Insight into anatta/no-self removes the self-bond, insight into dependent origination of all dharmas removes the bond of seeing dharmas as inherent. To remove the bond of non-inherency, apart from practicing naked awareness we need to establish right views.</p>

              <p><br>The Classifications are nice. I like them :) I din know such things existed! Haha!<br>What I do know is that the method(of having View with taints and progress to without taints) you describe here will definitely work if one is not attached to the words. Where I come from, the method is to simply doubt our enlightenment until it is clearly without doubt.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>When a practitioner is unable to see through the bond of inherency, no matter how hard he practices to experience awareness nakedly, he will be unknowingly and subtly reinforcing the bond by sinking back to a Source, a background, a Self. Without the right view of Anatta and Emptiness, non-dual luminosity can be experienced clearly but there will be a tendency to reify that experience. One will still be unable to see fully that 'Manifestation is the Source' and there is nothing to choose, no Source to fall back on, only the transience itself is Buddha-Nature (Dogen: Impermanence is Buddha-Nature).</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Yes, a common mistake.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>The further insight into dependent origination will make you realise that awareness isn't inherent, it's dependently originated, yet uncaused and unconditioned. This may sound contradictory but it is not.<br><br>As Zen teacher David Loy explained:<br><br>*...we find ourselves in a universe of sunya-events, none of which can be said to occur for the sake of any other. Each nondual event -- every leaf-flutter, wandering thought, and piece of litter -- is whole and complete in itself,<br>because although conditioned by everything else in the universe and thus a manifestation of it, for precisely that reason it is not subordinated to anything else but becomes an unconditioned end-in-itself...</p>

              <p><br><br>Haha, these are all very dangerous words. I would warn all to becareful not to be sucked into any concepts of these. They are but the pointer. It is not how we imagine it to be. Much 'thinking' or 'reflecting' on it can sometimes cause solid ideas and concepts to be formed which seems much like the truth but actually clouds the truth.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>Buddha said:<br><br>"Now suppose that in the last month of the hot season a mirage were shimmering, and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe it, &amp; appropriately examine it. To him — seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in a mirage? In the same way, a monk sees, observes, &amp; appropriately examines any perception that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near. To him — seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in perception?"</p>

              <p><br>Now since this is the case, when we say the Bodhisattvas are delaying enlightenment to save beings, don't these Bodhisattvas still have a bit of ignorance, if I might say, since they are delaying Buddhahood to save 'mirages'?<br></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>When the second case is experienced, you can say that is true non-abiding abidance. No Source to sink back to, only transience yet transience is felt without movement. Non-dual vivid awareness without 'staying'.<br><br>As Thusness said before:<br><br>‘Impermanence’ is never what it seems to be, never what that is understood in conceptual thoughts. ‘Impermanence’ is not what the mind has conceptualized it to be. In non-dual experience, the true face of impermanence nature is experienced as happening without movement, change without going anywhere. This is the “what is” of impermanence. It is just so.</p>
              <p><br>    Hmm…you mean to say that the 6 Patriarch’s poem lacks non-duality? Yes it seems that’s true. However, it was a response to Shen Xiu’s poem. Nevertheless, there is still a fundamental problem with what the 6th Patriarch poem. Try to find it!<br><br>When one leans towards formlessness, and create a 'formless' 'odorless' 'thoughtless' image of awareness, one separates it from all phenomenon and thus is unable to see the 'form' of awareness. This is the initial I AM level of experience. But even if you realise non-duality, that is not yet full enlightenment, as explained.</p>

              <p><br>Hmmm...you know, I'll have to warn that the more one tries to explain these insights, the more such explanations become complicated with paradoxical words like 'non-abiding abidence', which is totally un-understandable to the normal human mind as we usually understand words in duality and form ideas. If you can understand the insights by reading the words, then you either already have very good cultivation from the past, having gained such insights before in your past lives or you are cheating yourselves, creating ideas out of these words. They are hard to tell at times, unless one has a certain level or concentration and thus penetrability.<br><br>Anyhow, I am very impressed by your Buddhist knowledge and faith (and resourcefulness to bring together so many references). It is really quite impressive for someone at your age. I have been in touch with Buddhism all my life, and I do not have the Buddhist knowledge that you have nor met anyone at your age like you. Knowing all the markers on the path, the only thing left to do is to practice to clarify them. Then your work is done. Next help people. A scholar or an accomplished practitioner is not rare, but a scholar with realisations to boot is rare in this world. It has been nice chatting with you :)</p>

              <p>I am always using doubt since it is an important part of self inquiry. However 'no more doubts' doesn't mean full enlightenment. The problem is, at certain point one will have full conviction without any more doubts, and think of it as some sort of finality. Often it is the I AM or non-dual experience of realisation.</p>

              <p>Too often there's an overemphasis on non-conceptuality. This is no good and this is what I mean by skewing towards certain aspects in practice, i.e. skewing towards naked awareness. Establishing right views is equally necessary and a part of practice. Reading dharma books and understanding it is also a part of practice. Many people even those who experience non-duality skew towards it and miss further insights.</p>
              <p>My understanding is to use concepts to study the teachings to establish the right views, then when practicing do bare attention and mindfulness practice. Of course the point in reading it is not to form a theory about it (about emptiness, anatta, etc), but we should still understand them even conceptually.</p>

              <p><br> Now since this is the case, when we say the Bodhisattvas are
                                          delaying enlightenment to save beings, don't these Bodhisattvas
                                          still have a bit of ignorance, if I might say, since they are
                                          delaying Buddhahood to save 'mirages'?</p>

              <p>Emptiness in no way impedes compassion, but when it is seen there is no separate self or a separate person, then compassion flows more freely in response to whatever situations.</p>
              <p>Also, "mirages" does not mean non-existing or completely an illusion: it means that even though suffering is vividly appearing, in reality they cannot be found or located as something inherently existing. However the analogy of 'illusion' or 'mirage' isn't exactly perfect. Because our experiences are not an illusion, they cannot vanish. They are not something that vanishes when some other reality (Brahman, or Nirvana, or whatever) shines forth. Rather, samsara rightly seen, is itself nirvana. The nature of reality lies right in the unreality of phenomena itself.</p>
              <p>After realising emptiness, pain is still pain and fully vivid, but you don't objectify pain as something inherent, where 'you' as a separate experiencer attempts to push it out of existence, and due to the aversion and attachment it results in mental suffering. There is no such experiencer being tormented, there is just that sensation in itself. There's a nice koan regarding pain and suffering: <em>"The whole universe is on fire. Through what kind of samadhi can you escape being burned?"</em> But experiencing and realising this does not mean you do nothing to stop it, spontaneous wisdom and compassion causes you to find some medicine, seek a doctor, etc. But in the meantime you do not create suffering for yourself.</p>
              <p>So samsara is <em>like</em> an illusion but not an illusion, and this is a crucial difference. It does not mean other sentient beings and their sufferings and our experiences are merely an illusion, but that they are dependently arisen appearances and does not have intrinsic reality. Conventionally we speak of 'red flowers', 'sentient beings', this and that, but there is nothing truly existing upon observation. Buddhists do not deny the world, we only try to rectify the wrong vision of the world.</p>
              <p>A Bodhisattva's compassion is different since he does not perceive himself as 'someone' going to 'save' other 'sentient beings'. As Diamond Sutra states, a Bodhisattva does not hold such inherent and separative views. Yet nevertheless spontaneous wisdom and compassion shines forth in response to suffering, without dualistic intention and effort.</p>

              <p><br> Hmmm...you know, I'll have to warn that the more one tries to
                                          explain these insights, the more such explanations become
                                          complicated with paradoxical words like 'non-abiding abidence',
                                          which is totally un-understandable to the normal human mind as we
                                          usually understand words in duality and form ideas. If you can
                                          understand the insights by reading the words, then you either
                                          already have very good cultivation from the past, having gained
                                          such insights before in your past lives or you are cheating
                                          yourselves, creating ideas out of these words. They are hard to
                                          tell at times, unless one has a certain level or concentration and
                                          thus penetrability.</p>

              <p>Actually what is spoken here is not abstract theory. When you experience it you'll realise, "Oh, so it's exactly as described!"</p>
              <p>When there is no one abiding and no point of abidance, what is left is only This, and This, and This, each This is a complete, whole, disjoint and unmoving manifestation abides in itself and of itself. The sensation of movement arises when a sense of an observer looking back arises. When I first experienced that, I understood what my teacher meant by "When you walk you don't feel like you're walking" which before the experience I was still pondering what it meant. I have glimpses of this but it requires one to be very present and non-dual with the activity. When there is non-dual insight, non-dual experience becomes effortless because it's seen 'how' there never was a separation in the first place. I do not have non-dual insights yet, only very strong experiences/glimpses of non-duality and ego-death (feels like the sense of self 'dies' and only the universe is left) that comes and goes.</p>

                                                              see an action movie about a good man and a bad man--lots of

                                                              place. Everything is always moving very quickly. Our daily 
                                                              lives have this quality: everything is constantly moving,

                                                              But this movie is really only a very long strip of film. In 
                                                              one second, there are something like fourteen frames. Each 
                                                              frame is a separate piece of action. But in each frame, nothing 
                                                              is moving. Everything is completely still. Each frame, one

                                                              stillness. The film projector moves the frames very quickly, 
                                                              and all of these frames run past the lens very fast, so the

                                                    We call that moment-mind. If you attain that mind, then

                                                    Stop. Stop. Like the film, you perceive every frame--<em>this</em> moment--which is infinitely still and complete. In the frame, 
                                                    nothing is moving. There is no time, and nothing appears 
                                                    or disappears in that box. But this movie projector--your 
                                                    <em>thinking</em> mind--is always moving, around and around

              <blockquote>
              <p><br> Regarding the 'stopping of mind'...you cannot stop the mind. The 'I' ,
                              'me' or the 'sense of self' simply got no power over the arising of
                              thoughts. You can give this a try. Try to stop yourself from thinking
                              or feeling. You will get frustrated because you cannot stop these
                              thoughts and feelings. This becomes more obvious when your are feeling
                              sad and you tell yourself to stop feeling so.<br> <strong><br> Do you know how present moment feels like? It feels that everything is
                              not moving. This is because awareness is fully aligned with changes at
                              the precise present moment. It is not because the mind has being
                              stopped.</strong><br> <br> The Present moment is the vastness that i am talking about. In the
                              present moment/Now, there is no sense of 'I'. When walking, there is
                              just the sensation of feet again the ground. When hearing, there is no
                              'I' that hears... it is directly hearing the sound. And so on so forth.
                              Inner and outer merge as One. There is no 'I' that is in between the
                              sensations. The expereince is direct and you realise that all there is
                              is consciousness. And consciousness cannot be harmed or destroyed.<br> <br> Also in Present Moment awareness, there is a lightness of Being.
                              Perception takes on a luminous quality. If the perceptions are also
                              deconstructed/dissolved, pure light and energy will be experienced.
                              Here we will directly realise that the Universe or Source is Light and
                              Raw Energy. The 'downstepping' creates the impression of solidity or

              <p><strong>"Precisely thus, Manjusri, does a bodhisattva who realizes the ultimate 
                    selflessness consider all beings."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri then asked further, "Noble sir, if a bodhisattva considers 
                    all living beings in such a way, how does he generate the great love toward 
                    them?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti replied, "Manjusri, when a bodhisattva considers all living 
                    beings in this way, he thinks: 'Just as I have realized the Dharma, so should 
                    I teach it to living beings.' Thereby, he generates the love that is truly a 
                    refuge for all living beings; the love that is peaceful because free of grasping; 
                    the love that is not feverish, because free of passions; the love that accords 
                    with reality because it is equanimous in all three times; the love that is without 
                    conflict because free of the violence of the passions; the love that is nondual 
                    because it is involved neither with the external nor with the internal; the 
                    love that is imperturbable because totally ultimate.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"Thereby he generates the love that is firm, its high resolve unbreakable, 
                    like a diamond; the love that is pure, purified in its intrinsic nature; the 
                    love that is even, its aspirations being equal; the saint's love that has eliminated 
                    its enemy; the bodhisattva's love that continuously develops living beings; 
                    The Tathagata's love that understands reality; the Buddha's love that causes 
                    living beings to awaken from their sleep; the love that is spontaneous because 
                    it is fully enlightened spontaneously; the love that is enlightenment because 
                    it is unity of experience; the love that has no presumption because it has eliminated 
                    attachment and aversion; the love that is great compassion because it infuses 
                    the Mahayana with radiance; the love that is never exhausted because it acknowledges 
                    voidness and selflessness; the love that is giving because it bestows the gift 
                    of Dharma free of the tight fist of a bad teacher; the love that is morality 
                    because it improves immoral living beings; the love that is tolerance because 
                    it protects both self and others; the love that is effort because it takes responsibility 
                    for all living beings; the love that is contemplation because it refrains from 
                    indulgence in tastes; the love that is wisdom because it causes attainment at 
                    the proper time; the love that is liberative technique because it shows the 
                    way everywhere; the love that is without formality because it is pure in motivation; 
                    the love that is without deviation because it acts from decisive motivation; 
                    the love that is high resolve because it is without passions; the love that 
                    is without deceit because it is not artificial; the love that is happiness because 
                    it introduces living beings to the happiness of the Buddha. Such, Manjusri, 
                    is the great love of a bodhisattva." </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What is the great compassion of a bodhisattva?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: It is the giving of all accumulated roots of virtue to all 
                    living beings.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What is the great joy of the bodhisattva?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: It is to be joyful and without regret in giving.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What is the equanimity of the bodhisattva?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: It is what benefits both self and others.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: To what should one resort when terrified by fear of life?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: Manjusri, a bodhisattva who is terrified by fear of life should 
                    resort to the magnanimity of the Buddha.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: Where should he who wishes to resort to the magnanimity of the

              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: He should stand in equanimity toward all living beings.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: Where should he who wishes to stand in equanimity toward all living

              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: He should live for the liberation of all living beings.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What should he who wishes to liberate all living beings do?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: He should liberate them from their passions.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: How should he who wishes to eliminate passions apply himself?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: He should apply himself appropriately.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: How should he apply himself, to "apply himself appropriately"?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: He should apply himself to productionlessness and to destructionlessness.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What is not produced? And what is not destroyed?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: Evil is not produced and good is not destroyed.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What is the root of good and evil?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: Materiality is the root of good and evil.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What is the root of materiality?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: Desire is the root of materiality.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What is the root of desire and attachment?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: Unreal construction is the root of desire.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What is the root of unreal construction?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: The false concept is its root.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What is the root of the false concept?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: Baselessness.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri: What it the root of baselessness?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti: Manjusri, when something is baseless, how can it have any root? 
                    Therefore, all things stand on the root which is baseless. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Thereupon, a certain goddess who lived in that house, having heard this 
                    teaching of the Dharma of the great heroic bodhisattvas, and being delighted, 
                    pleased, and overjoyed, manifested herself in a material body and showered the 
                    great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas, and the great disciples with heavenly 
                    flowers. When the flowers fell on the bodies of the bodhisattvas, they fell 
                    off on the floor, but when they fell on the bodies of the great disciples, they 
                    stuck to them and did not fall. The great disciples shook the flowers and even 
                    tried to use their magical powers, but still the flowers would not shake off. 
                    Then, the goddess said to the venerable Sariputra, "Reverend Sariputra, 
                    why do you shake these flowers?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra replied, "Goddess, these flowers are not proper for religious 
                    persons and so we are trying to shake them off."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The goddess said, "Do not say that, reverend Sariputra. Why? These 
                    flowers are proper indeed! Why? Such flowers have neither constructual thought 
                    nor discrimination. But the elder Sariputra has both constructual thought and 
                    discrimination.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"Reverend Sariputra, impropriety for one who has renounced the world 
                    for the discipline of the rightly taught Dharma consists of constructual thought 
                    and discrimination, yet the elders are full of such thoughts. One who is without 
                    such thoughts is always proper.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"Reverend Sariputra, see how these flowers do not stick to the bodies 
                    of these great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas! This is because they have 
                    eliminated constructual thoughts and discriminations.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"For example, evil spirits have power over fearful men but cannot disturb 
                    the fearless. Likewise, those intimidated by fear of the world are in the power 
                    of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures, which do not disturb those who 
                    are free from fear of the passions inherent in the constructive world. Thus, 
                    these flowers stick to the bodies of those who have not eliminated their instincts 
                    for the passions and do not stick to the bodies of those who have eliminated 
                    their instincts. Therefore, the flowers do not stick to the bodies of these 
                    bodhisattvas, who have abandoned all instincts."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Then the venerable Sariputra said to the goddess, "Goddess, how long 
                    have you been in this house?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The goddess replied, "I have been here as long as the elder has been 
                    in liberation."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra said, "Then, have you been in this house for quite some time?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The goddess said, "Has the elder been in liberation for quite some 
                    time?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>At that, the elder Sariputra fell silent.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The goddess continued, "Elder, you are 'foremost of the wise!' Why 
                    do you not speak? Now, when it is your turn, you do not answer the question." </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: Since liberation is inexpressible, goddess, I do not know what 
                    to say.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the nature of liberation. 
                    Why? Liberation is neither internal nor external, nor can it be apprehended 
                    apart from them. Likewise, syllables are neither internal nor external, nor 
                    can they be apprehended anywhere else. Therefore, reverend Sariputra, do not 
                    point to liberation by abandoning speech! Why? The holy liberation is the equality 
                    of all things!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: Goddess, is not liberation the freedom from desire, hatred, and 
                    folly?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: "Liberation is freedom from desire, hatred, and folly" 
                    that is the teaching of the excessively proud. But those free of pride are taught 
                    that the very nature of desire, hatred, and folly is itself liberation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: Excellent! Excellent, goddess! Pray, what have you attained, 
                    what have you realized, that you have such eloquence?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: I have attained nothing, reverend Sariputra. I have no realization. 
                    Therefore I have such eloquence. Whoever thinks, "I have attained! I have 
                    realized!" is overly proud in the discipline of the well-taught Dharma.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: Goddess, do you belong to the disciple-vehicle, to the solitary-vehicle, 
                    or to the great vehicle?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: I belong to the disciple-vehicle when I teach it to those who need 
                    it. I belong to the solitary-vehicle when I teach the twelve links of dependent 
                    origination to those who need them. And, since I never abandon the great compassion, 
                    I belong to the great vehicle, as all need that teaching to attain ultimate 
                    liberation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nevertheless, reverend Sariputra, just as one cannot smell the castor plant 
                    in a magnolia wood, but only the magnolia flowers, so, reverend Sariputra, living 
                    in this house, which is redolent with the perfume of the virtues of the Buddha-qualities, 
                    one does not smell the perfume of the disciples and the solitary sages. Reverend

                    gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kimnaras, and mahoragas who live in this house 
                    hear the Dharma from the mouth of this holy man and, enticed by the perfume 
                    of the virtues of the Buddha-qualities, proceed to conceive the spirit of enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Reverend Sariputra, I have been in this house for twelve years, and I have 
                    heard no discourses concerning the disciples and solitary sages but have heard 
                    only those concerning the great love, the great compassion, and the inconceivable 
                    qualities of the Buddha.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Reverend Sariputra, eight strange and wonderful things manifest themselves 
                    constantly in this house. What are these eight?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>A light of golden hue shines here constantly, so bright that it is hard 
                    to distinguish day and night; and neither the moon nor the sun shines here distinctly. 
                    That is the first wonder of this house.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, whoever enters this house is no longer 
                    troubled by his passions from the moment he is within. That is the second strange 
                    and wonderful thing.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, this house is never forsaken by Sakra, 
                    Brahma, the Lokapalas, and the bodhisattvas from all the other buddha-fields. 
                    That is the third strange and wonderful thing.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, this house is never empty of the sounds 
                    of the Dharma, the discourse on the six transcendences, and the discourses of 
                    the irreversible wheel of the Dharma. That is the fourth strange and wonderful 
                    thing.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, in this house one always hears the rhythms, 
                    songs, and music of gods and men, and from this music constantly resounds the 
                    sound of the infinite Dharma of the Buddha. That is the fifth strange and wonderful 
                    thing.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, in this house there are always four inexhaustible 
                    treasures, replete with all kinds of jewels, which never decrease, although 
                    all the poor and wretched may partake to their satisfaction. That is the sixth 
                    strange and wonderful thing.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, at the wish of this good man, to this house 
                    come the innumerable Tathagatas of the ten directions, such as the Tathagatas 
                    Sakyamuni, Amitabha, Aksobhya, Ratnasri, Ratnarcis, Ratnacandra, Ratnavyuha, 
                    Dusprasaha, Sarvarthasiddha, Ratnabahula, Simhakirti, Simhasvara, and so forth; 
                    and when they come they teach the door of Dharma called the "Secrets of 
                    the Tathagatas" and then depart. That is the seventh strange and wonderful 
                    thing.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, all the splendors of the abodes of the 
                    gods and all the splendors of the fields of the Buddhas shine forth in this 
                    house. That is the eighth strange and wonderful thing.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Reverend Sariputra, these eight strange and wonderful things are seen in 
                    this house. Who then, seeing such inconceivable things, would believe the teaching 
                    of the disciples?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of 
                    your female state?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: Although I have sought my "female state" for these twelve 
                    years, I have not yet found it. Reverend Sariputra, if a magician were to incarnate 
                    a woman by magic, would you ask her, "What prevents you from transforming 
                    yourself out of your female state?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there 
                    be to transform?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: Just so, reverend Sariputra, all things do not really exist. Now, 
                    would you think, "What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation 
                    from transforming herself out of her female state?" </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Thereupon, the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Sariputra 
                    to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form. Then the goddess, 
                    transformed into Sariputra, said to Sariputra, transformed into a goddess, "Reverend 
                    Sariputra, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And Sariputra, transformed into the goddess, replied, "I no longer 
                    appear in the form of a male! My body has changed into the body of a woman! 
                    I do not know what to transform!"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The goddess continued, "If the elder could again change out of the 
                    female state, then all women could also change out of their female states. All 
                    women appear in the form of women in just the same way</strong></p>
              <p><strong>as the elder appears in the form of a woman. While they are not women in 
                    reality, they appear in the form of women. With this in mind, the Buddha said, 
                    'In all things, there is neither male nor female.'"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Then, the goddess released her magical power and each returned to his ordinary 
                    form. She then said to him, "Reverend Sariputra, what have you done with 
                    your female form?" </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: I neither made it nor did I change it.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: Just so, all things are neither made nor changed, and that they 
                    are not made and not changed, that is the teaching of the Buddha.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: Goddess, where will you be born when you transmigrate after death?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: I will be born where all the magical incarnations of the Tathagata 
                    are born.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: But the emanated incarnations of the Tathagata do not transmigrate 
                    nor are they born.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: All things and living beings are just the same; they do not transmigrate 
                    nor are they born!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: Goddess, how soon will you attain the perfect enlightenment of 
                    Buddhahood?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: At such time as you, elder, become endowed once more with the qualities 
                    of an ordinary individual, then will I attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: Goddess, it is impossible that I should become endowed once more 
                    with the qualities of an ordinary individual.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: Just so, reverend Sariputra, it is impossible that I should attain 
                    the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood! Why? Because perfect enlightenment 
                    stands upon the impossible. Because it is impossible, no one attains the perfect 
                    enlightenment of Buddhahood.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: But the Tathagata has declared: "The Tathagatas, who are 
                    as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, have attained perfect Buddhahood, are 
                    attaining perfect Buddhahood, and will go on attaining perfect Buddhahood."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: Reverend Sariputra, the expression, "the Buddhas of the past, 
                    present and future," is a conventional expression made up of a certain 
                    number of syllables. The Buddhas are neither past, nor present, nor future. 
                    Their enlightenment transcends the three times! But tell me, elder, have you 
                    attained sainthood?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sariputra: It is attained, because there is no attainment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goddess: Just so, there is perfect enlightenment because there is no attainment 
                    of perfect enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Then the Licchavi Vimalakirti said to the venerable elder Sariputra, "Reverend 
                    Sariputra, this goddess has already served ninety-two million billion Buddhas. 
                    She plays with the superknowledges. She has truly succeeded in all her vows. 
                    She has gained the tolerance of the birthlessness of things. She has actually 
                    attained irreversibility. She can live wherever she wishes on the strength of 
                    her vow to develop living beings."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>8. The Family of the Tathagatas </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Then, the crown prince Manjusri said to the Licchavi Vimalakirti, "Noble 
                    sir, how does the bodhisattva follow the way to attain the qualities of the 
                    Buddha?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti replied, "Manjusri, when the bodhisattva follows the wrong 
                    way, he follows the way to attain the qualities of the Buddha."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri continued, "How does the bodhisattva follow the wrong way?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Vimalakirti replied, "Even should he enact the five deadly sins, he 
                    feels no malice, violence, or hate. Even should he go into the hells, he remains 
                    free of all taint of passions. Even should he go into the states of the animals, 
                    he remains free of darkness and ignorance. When he goes into the states of the 
                    asuras, he remains free of pride, conceit, and arrogance. When he goes into 
                    the realm of the lord of death, he accumulates the stores of merit and wisdom. 
                    When he goes into the states of motionlessness and immateriality, he does not 
                    dissolve therein.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"He may follow the ways of desire, yet he stays free of attachment 
                    to the enjoyments of desire. He may follow the ways of hatred, yet he feels 
                    no anger to any living being. He may follow the ways of folly, yet he is ever 
                    conscious with the wisdom of firm understanding.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"He may follow the ways of avarice, yet he gives away all internal 
                    and external things without regard even for his own life. He may follow the 
                    ways of immorality, yet, seeing the horror of even the slightest transgressions, 
                    he lives by the ascetic practices and austerities. He may follow the ways of 
                    wickedness and anger, yet he remains utterly free of malice and lives by love. 
                    He may follow the ways of laziness, yet his efforts are uninterrupted as he 
                    strives in the cultivation of roots of virtue. He may follow the ways of sensuous 
                    distraction, yet, naturally concentrated, his contemplation is not dissipated. 
                    He may follow the ways of false wisdom, yet, having reached the transcendence 
                    of wisdom, he is expert in all mundane and transcendental sciences.</strong></p>

              <p>You see, you're still skewing to the other side of the equation i.e. nonconceptuality. A counter-argument to the statement that concepts cannot lead to liberation is that, while true, equally true is the other side of the equation: without conceptual understanding of right views, there cannot be liberation as well.</p>
              <p>I didn't say conceptual understanding alone can lead to liberation. I did not skew towards conceptuality. I am not advocating that at all, I am advocating balance and completeness of the path that Buddha preached.</p>
              <p>I also said, conceptual right view is part of the path that leads to liberation, but there are other conditions including mindfulness of the right view and bare attention/naked awareness.</p>
              <p>However, I have also warned that naked awareness alone cannot lead to liberation, and even though without establishing right views one can still give rise to the direct non-conceptual realisation of the pure I AMness, Eternal Witness, or even Non-Dual Awareness -- and YET is unable to penetrate the insights into Anatta and Emptiness. Many people even those outside of Buddhism whether from other religions or non-religious have experienced I AMness and Non-Duality, yet they have not realised Emptiness, and I've never seen any non-Buddhist that had, unfortunately. But this is not just a problem of non-Buddhist -- even more unfortunately, most Buddhists still do not see the importance of right views and the insight of non-inherency and factor that into their path. Also, you don't have to be a scholar or academic to have right view. As Loppon Namdrol once said, I can't remember the exact words: you don't have to be a scholar, but you have to have the rght understanding of emptiness.</p>
              <p>I must say that Tibetan Buddhism is more balanced -- not that I am a biased Tibetan Buddhist, I am still more towards Chinese Mahayana. It is not that they are more academic, but they do not miss out the importance of the empty aspect and the right views, and at the same time they also emphasize the importance of meditative training. This is just a generalisation of course -- because there are also Tibetan Buddhist particularly the Shentongpas who skew towards eternalism and luminosity and misunderstood the truth of emptiness, and also there are Zen masters who emphasize the insight of emptiness and dependent origination.</p>
              <p>Anyway back to topic. So you see, non-conceptual experience or insights does not necessarily mean enlightenment in the Buddhist sense. Having a direct non-conceptual experience and realisation with <strong>utter conviction without doubts</strong> of some non-conceptual reality like the experience of I AM or Non-Duality is not the same as realising emptiness. These insights concerns the luminous, cognitive aspect of Awareness but not its emptiness. Those experiences are very important, and if you still remember I have dedicated a few threads recently to just this aspect alone. Yet it is still not yet the type of realisation that is required to raise to the ranks of the Aryas. To realise emptiness, you need to have right views as a pre-condition. Having realised both luminosity and emptiness, one realises the inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. Both are insights important and must be seen as inseparable.</p>
              <p>Without right view, the path cannot be complete, therefore you must factor that conceptual understanding into the path as well, that's why it's the noble 8 fold path, and not 7 or 6 or 5. If you think right practice is possible without right view, then it is no longer in accord with Buddhadharma and Buddha who saw it as necessary and inseparable. What I'm saying is, the 8 fold path must be seen as a Whole without leaving out any parts.</p>
              <p>Also:</p>
              <p><em>With regards to conceptuality leading to non-conceptuality, there needs not to be understanding of the teachings conceptually first. This is because naturally the ignorant person understands his world conceptually. As such, any concepts he has(which are numerous) can be used in the realisation of nonconceptuality.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You said "can be used in the realisation of nonconceptuality", do you mean "can" or "cannot" and why?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, first of all, sentient being's views is definitely different from the Buddhist's right view. They are considered wrong views. Why? Because most people have all sorts of wrong views: eternalistic views, Self-view, or nihilistic views, views of 'this exists', 'this does not exists', etc. You can never gain liberation with wrong views.</p>
              <p>Only Buddha's view is Right View and only by learning his Right View can it become an antidote to our problems. Buddha's Right View is the view that sees not a self, that sees not an inherent Dharma: it is the Middle Way beyond all extremes. So we must at least understand this conceptually, as it will become an antidote and raft for us to overcome our wrong views. It will become a condition to give rise to the insight of 'Non-Inherency'. When we realise that all 'selves' and 'dharmas' are not inherent, our concepts are naturally dissolve. <strong>We cannot dissolve these concepts by remaining naked in awareness alone. We have to give rise to the insight of non-inherency and one of the conditions to give rise to this insight is to establish the right view conceptually. </strong> That is why Thusness said: <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">That is to 'transform' a limited view to a boundless views lies not in doing away totally with concepts but simply seeing 'non-inherently'.  'Non-conceptuality' and naked awareness will arise eventually with the stability of this important condition.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Of course as I mentioned, having right view of no-self, emptiness, depndent origination is not enough, though the conceptual understanding is important because without it (right view) one cannot practice right mindfulness, as the Buddha put it. But right mindfulness of the right view in real-time direct experence is equally important.</p>

              <p></p>
              <div class="entry">Quite few articles you <span style="font-style: italic;">(AEN)</span> have there about Dependent Origination. :-)<br><br>After
                      reading these articles, something came to my mind. I just want to say
                      something about the importance of direct experience. If we only
                      understand in terms of concepts and theories, we will not be able to
                      appreciate the beauty of Dependent Origination. Frankly, stressing Self
                      as permanent, unchanging and independent does not make it ultimate;
                      instead we merely cage what that is seamless, free, connected without
                      boundaries into something limited and dualistic. These “permanent,
                      unchanging and independent” characteristics merely appear appealing due
                      to our inherent and dualistic tendencies of seeing things, in practice,
                      holding to these characteristics will only present itself as a
                      hindrance than help. In actual experience it is ‘Emptiness nature’ that
                      is liberating.<br><br>I have always stressed the importance of direct
                      realization and experience of this ‘vividly present’ yet completely
                      un-locatable nature of Pristine Awareness. It is very important not to
                      infer, think or conceptualize but feel with our entire being this
                      ‘ungraspability’ and 'unlocatability' (see <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection</a>).
                      Are we able to feel, this moment vividly and clearly yet unmistakably
                      see how this moment of manifestation is free from any ‘now’, ‘here’ and
                      ‘self’? ‘Here, now and Self’ are convenient references, nothing
                      ultimate. Similarly when we say sensations, are we having direct
                      experience of what sensations are? If for a moment we are able to give
                      up all arbitrary thoughts/definitions and vividly experience in bare
                      all these arising and passing sensations, we will realize that they are
                      nothing but just luminous happening. We will realize that the
                      transience is Awareness itself. This is vipassana; this will bring the
                      “background consciousness” into the foreground. Still this ‘foreground’
                      though free from all labelings must be further emptied. Therefore after
                      anatta (non-dual), Dependent Origination are further taught.<br><br>The
                      purpose of Dependent Origination is to free us from the limitation of
                      our subject/object dichotomy and see phenomena and our nature in new
                      light. The mind will continue its attempt to sort, categorize and frame
                      seamless experience into its dualistic schema. Experience maybe
                      non-dual but insight can still not arise; even if non-dual realization
                      arises, it still needs time to mature and stabilize. Before we can
                      liberate ourselves sufficiently from the dualistic framework and
                      correctly understand our nature that is beyond words, non-dual
                      experience will still be understood dualistically in a very subtle
                      manner without us even noticing it, not to underestimate it. We have
                      been so affected by inherent and dualistic views that we fail to
                      realize that how views and imprints influence us.<br><br>It is
                      therefore advisable to replace our existing inherent and dualistic
                      framework with Dependent Origination. If Dependent Origination simply
                      remains as a form of knowledge, then it defeats the purpose. It must
                      pervade our entire being so that we can feel, experience and understand
                      deeply how Dependent Origination is not limited or constraint by space,
                      time, self, any centricity or point of references. That said it must
                      not be another view to attach to; simply another skillful mean to lead
                      us go beyond the simplistic view of “permanent, unchanging and
                      independent” characteristics of our pristine nature. Ultimately our
                      nature is free from any sort of views and no expression can adequately
                      express it. Dependent Origination is too a raft; it is like the stick
                      that stirs the fire and is eventually consumed by fire without leaving
                      any trace. <br><br>Lastly if practitioners that have direct
                      realization of the ‘Self’ can have similar sort of intensity in both
                      realization and experience of their ‘Emptiness’ nature (as they have in
                      ‘Self’), they will appreciate the beauty and find delight in seeing our
                      nature as dependently originated. For what that dependently originates
                      is empty, unborn, does not come, does not go, does not arise and does
                      not cease.</div>

              <p>Hi all</p>
              <p>have been reading this forum for very long and would like to share some experience, but first must thank all who have shared all the articles that have helped put meaning to the experiences.</p>
              <p>im not one who's well versed in the sutras but have been practicing meditation, and feels that maintaining the right view is important in our journey. when one in their practice manages to realize the subtle processes that reinforces the sense of 'self' and at the same time be able to identify the process of thoughts arising due to conditions, one can be mistakenly led to 'feel' as if awareness is a permanent 'always here' essence. as a result one may be confused and may actually just reverse the object-subject view which in this case awareness becomes the object and 'self' the subject.</p>
              <p>even as one manages to 'see thru' this, it still doesnt mean anything at all... in our everyday lives almost every encounter serves to reinforce the feeling of the 'self' and its utmost important that we maintain vigilant in our practice by means of the eight-fold path so that gradually the influence thins down. the journey is never ending, and most of us will still need to fulfill our obligations and work which would constantly bring back the old 'selfs'. which is why effort is still required even as one has experiences of no-self and dependent origination until the tendencies to fall back diminishes completely if ever.</p>
              <p>as for conceptually understanding and non-conceptual understanding, probably a person without some experience will not be able to understand the clumsy words that are used to describe the processes. its thru some form of practice, then using the readings or teachings as a guide, manages to get some conceptual understanding then subsequently progress in one's practice until there is thorough understanding that's directly from experience. and such experience usually its tough to put into words. at the non conceptual stage probably only the skilled teachers will be able to explain using words, but then again without some experience the words take a totally different meaning.</p>

              <p>Hi, welcome to the forum.</p>
              <p>Yes, non-dual awareness can be misinterpreted due to our karmic propensities distorting the experence into an unchanging essence by constant referencing. Not so much that we treat Awareness as an object and self as subject. Rather Awareness becomes misunderstood as the Pure Subject that cannot be the object of observation but nevertheless observes everything -- like the eye that sees everything but can't be seen. So at the I AM/Eternal Witness phase, you experence yourself as the True Self behind the world, including the 'small self' or ego consisting of conceptual images of your identity in the world (name, personality, status etc) and your identity in relation to others (as friend, spouse, relative, etc). That means the I AM is seen as not all of these, but rather something that is behind and Witnessing all of these thoughts. These thoughts fade in and out of awareness but Awareness can never be lost -- it is what is continuing to witness these thoughts, and phenomena, coming and going. You can never lose awareness otherwise you will not be aware of anything. It is not something to be sustained but something that has always been the case, as your unchanging nature of you/your mind. However whether we notice it, is another matter. Although it has been our nature all along for countless lifetimes, most have not yet recognised it. So it is simply a matter of recognising, abiding, and then realising (which is even more advanced than recognition -- in realisation of that I AM you have full conviction in your luminous nature, but even this is not yet Buddhist enlightenment). This is an important realisation and you will gain complete conviction of your luminous cognitive nature of consciousness.</p>
              <p>However, this initial experience will also create a contrast and separation between "Relative world" and "Absolute source". In reality we cannot separate the "knowingness" apart from phenomenality, this separation is purely due to abstraction but it is subtle to see it. Yes, it is true that awareness can never be lost no matter what you are experiencing, but the abstraction/separation of awareness from transiency is purely fabricated. In truth transiency experienced in full is not something that comes in and out of awareness, because it is itself the transiently unmoving awareness. In other words one cannot speak of a transient phenomena apart from awareness in order to come in and out of awareness, because the transience itself is awareness and there is no other awareness than that. Whatever manifests, IS it. There is no denying of the presenc-ing and witnessing, but its seen that all manifestations is it. There is non-dual witnessing which is not separate from the wholeness of the universe, witnessing is going on but no separate witness is found. There is no light behind the eyes seeing everything but rather, the light and the 'everything' is one and the same.</p>
              <p>Even the I AMness is a non-dual experience of pure beingness, where there is just that pure sense of existence without any feeling of separation, a separate self or observer, i.e. you are not aware as a separate someone or experiencer of the awareness, rather you become or rather you ARE that awareness/presence/beingness.</p>
              <p>But the mind later creates a constant image of that I AMness and separates it from all other phenomena and becomes the blueprint in which we experience consciousness, an image that causes us to keep shunting the transience and sink into a background Source or Witness. IT becomes the Eternal Witness of experience, the Pure Subject that cannot be the object of observation but nevertheless observes everything undiscriminately. When there is Non-Dual experience, it's realised that the I AM experience is just an aspect of awareness but not the totality of it: even in the scenery, the sound, even that is no different than the Pure I AMness. But non-dual experience does not mean giving rise to non-dual insights, and without that one will still keep sinking back to a Source.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>You have to understand that there is a difference between a passing non-dual experience and truly "seeing through this".</p>
              <p>That is, the experience of non-duality no matter how intense is still different from the insight into how reality has always by nature been non-dual and there never was any separation from the beginning... that is there never was a self, a separate experiencer, doer, seer, witness, apart from transient self-manifesting self-knowing processes.</p>
              <p>The tendency to sink back into separation can continue as long as non-dual insight has not arisen. However once it has arisen, one will be able to effortless perceive (not as a separate perceiver) non-dual awareness in real time, even in daily activities and interactions one is able to experience no-self. Because it is realised that no-self is not a stage to be get at, but rather a 'self' has never and can never be found in direct experience which is non-dual. If a person says he has gone from a stage of "I hear sound" to "I become sound", then it is still not permanent non-dual insight but just a temporary non-dual experience. Rather, in seeing there is Always just scenery, never was there a seer from the beginning, it is always so. In hearing just sound, etc, always so -- no hearer. The 'self' is like a santa claus that once you realised it never was real, was fictitious, it is seen through and cannot be believed in again.</p>
              <p>At the coarser level of non-dual insight, the insight of non-duality pervades one's conscious experience so during the whole of waking life one is able to experience non-duality except during very tremendous stressful circumstances, then it is possible to lose non-dual experience for a while because old dualistic propensities are reacting, resulting in a sense of contraction in which a sense of self and experiencer-experience split arises causing suffering, aversion, fear, etc which are all only possible from the viewpoint of a separate self. And the arising of this is the evidence of the immaturity of non-dual insight, which means it hasn't pervaded all levels/the entirety of our consciousness. However whatever non-dual insight gained is permanent, but not necessarily the experience.</p>
              <p>At the medium and higher level of non-dual, the insight has penetrated deeper into our subconscious and one no longer even experiences a moment of thought of losing and regaining mindfulness of non-dual. No effort at all necessary, and also the experience of non-duality penetrates deeply into the subconscious such that one is able to experience non-dual in the dreaming and deep sleep. This must not be misunderstood as maintaining a sense of witnessing awareness in dreams and deep sleep, which is still dualistic as there is a separate perceiver watching phenomena.</p>
              <p>So whatever the phase of insight, it is the Insight that is important and how far the insight has penetrated into the entirety of our consciousness and replaced all bonds and propensities. It is not really about attempting to repeat a non-dual experience through concentration or letting go (however I'm not underestimating its importance especially for a beginner's phase but as one gains insight, practice becomes spontaneous and effortless) but rather a deepening of non-dual insight, and the ability to sustain non-dual experience into subtler (subconscious) states of consciousness becomes possible effortlessly as a result of these insights/realisations of what is Always So.</p>
              <p>Anyway the three levels of non-dual is based on the Mahamudra's classification of non-dual insights, as the lower, medium, and higher levels of One Taste. However it should be noted that in the Mahamudra classification of One Taste, it includes insight into emptiness also, so it is the inseparability of luminosity and emptiness as well as the inseparability of subject and object, awareness and phenomena. This is then corresponded to the various Bodhisattva bhumi stages (there are stages prior and after one taste, however).</p>
              <p>I should also mention that even though consciousness may be realised to have been non-dual from the beginning without subject/object division, it can still remain as Thusness's Stage 4 Brahman type of realisation, it is more like the ultimate Subject has never been separate from phenomena, and all phenomena are just manifestations of the Subject but there is still an unchanging Subject, ontological essence, Brahman. IT/Subject/Brahman is in union with all manifestation. This must be seen as different from the insight into Anatta where there is no Subject/agent to begin with that could be in union with manifestations, rather there is just the process, just manifestation, no Subject.</p>

              <p>You're right. Actually daily life by itself is not a hindrance to non-dual experience. In fact after non-dual insights, especially in the beginning phase, one will be able to find it easier to experience non-dual in daily activities than in sitting meditation. In daily activities it is seen there is action and activities but no doer. Seeing, but no seer. Only when there are very extreme conditions and stress then non-duality might become 'dull' or not obvious, possibly when interacting with (undesirable, etc) people and other conditions, because of arising propensities.</p>
              <p>Having some non-dual experiences can still become intermittent and stage like, then in this case one has not gained any non-dual insights but has had some non-dual experiences resulting out of concentration, absorption, and dropping. When one realises non-dual (not the same as experienced nondual), it's seen that there's no uniting of subject/object - can't unite that which is already Not-Two. Then it becomes effortless.</p>

              <p>It just means, some people experience non-dual awareness intermittently, but its stage-like but not an insight.</p>
              <p>It's experiencing "becoming sounds, sights, etc". It's not realising "in seeing always only just scenery, never was there a seer. In hearing only always just sounds, never was there a hearer." There is no subject-object merging because there is no such divisions to begin with, no effort to bridge the gap is necessary when its realised theres no gap.</p>

              <p>the strings that tie the 'self' to experience are yet to be broken, and the knots need to be loosen. once untied, then there's no more perceived gaps, sight sees, sounds hear, thoughts think.</p>
              <p>while untying the strings, every phenomena still 'rings a thought' and sometimes is still conceptual in nature. then the subject (awareness) observes and catches the object in the act of creating the illusion of a gap. a split second and subtle process. and again and again.</p>
              <p>the strings untied whats left is just awareness. no subject, no objects, no gaps. just resting in knowing knowing and knowing unknowing.</p>

              <p>You see, you're still skewing to the other side of the equation
              i.e. nonconceptuality. A counter-argument to the statement that
              concepts cannot lead to liberation is that, while true, equally
              true is the other side of the equation: without conceptual
              understanding of right views, there cannot be liberation as
              well.</p>
              <p>I didn't say conceptual understanding alone can lead to
              liberation. I did not skew towards conceptuality. I am not
              advocating that at all, I am advocating balance and completeness of
              the path that Buddha preached.</p>
              <p>I also said, conceptual right view is part of the path that
              leads to liberation, but there are other conditions including
              mindfulness of the right view and bare attention/naked
              awareness.</p>
              <p>However, I have also warned that naked awareness alone cannot
              lead to liberation, and even though without establishing right
              views one can still give rise to the direct non-conceptual
              realisation of the pure I AMness, Eternal Witness, or even Non-Dual
              Awareness -- and YET is unable to penetrate the insights into
              Anatta and Emptiness. Many people even those outside of Buddhism
              whether from other religions or non-religious have experienced I
              AMness and Non-Duality, yet they have not realised Emptiness, and
              I've never seen any non-Buddhist that had, unfortunately. But this
              is not just a problem of non-Buddhist -- even more unfortunately,
              most Buddhists still do not see the importance of right views and
              the insight of non-inherency and factor that into their path. Also,
              you don't have to be a scholar or academic to have right view. As
              Loppon Namdrol once said, I can't remember the exact words: you
              don't have to be a scholar, but you have to have the rght
              understanding of emptiness.</p>
              <p>I must say that Tibetan Buddhism is more balanced -- not that I
              am a biased Tibetan Buddhist, I am still more towards Chinese
              Mahayana. It is not that they are more academic, but they do not
              miss out the importance of the empty aspect and the right views,
              and at the same time they also emphasize the importance of
              meditative training. This is just a generalisation of course --
              because there are also Tibetan Buddhist particularly the
              Shentongpas who skew towards eternalism and luminosity and
              misunderstood the truth of emptiness, and also there are Zen
              masters who emphasize the insight of emptiness and dependent
              origination.</p>
              <p>Anyway back to topic. So you see, non-conceptual experience or
              insights does not necessarily mean enlightenment in the Buddhist
              sense. Having a direct non-conceptual experience and realisation
              with <strong>utter conviction without doubts</strong> of some
              non-conceptual reality like the experience of I AM or Non-Duality
              is not the same as realising emptiness. These insights concerns the
              luminous, cognitive aspect of Awareness but not its emptiness.
              Those experiences are very important, and if you still remember I
              have dedicated a few threads recently to just this aspect alone.
              Yet it is still not yet the type of realisation that is required to
              raise to the ranks of the Aryas. To realise emptiness, you need to
              have right views as a pre-condition. Having realised both
              luminosity and emptiness, one realises the inseparability of
              luminosity and emptiness. Both are insights important and must be
              seen as inseparable.</p>
              <p>Without right view, the path cannot be complete, therefore you
              must factor that conceptual understanding into the path as well,
              that's why it's the noble 8 fold path, and not 7 or 6 or 5. If you
              think right practice is possible without right view, then it is no
              longer in accord with Buddhadharma and Buddha who saw it as
              necessary and inseparable. What I'm saying is, the 8 fold path must
              be seen as a Whole without leaving out any parts.</p>
              <p>Also:</p>
              <p><em>With regards to conceptuality leading to non-conceptuality,
              there needs not to be understanding of the teachings conceptually
              first. This is because naturally the ignorant person understands
              his world conceptually. As such, any concepts he has(which are
              numerous) can be used in the realisation of
              nonconceptuality.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You said "can be used in the realisation of nonconceptuality",
              do you mean "can" or "cannot" and why?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, first of all, sentient being's views is definitely
              different from the Buddhist's right view. They are considered wrong
              views. Why? Because most people have all sorts of wrong views:
              eternalistic views, Self-view, or nihilistic views, views of 'this
              exists', 'this does not exists', etc. You can never gain liberation
              with wrong views.</p>
              <p>Only Buddha's view is Right View and only by learning his Right
              View can it become an antidote to our problems. Buddha's Right View
              is the view that sees not a self, that sees not an inherent Dharma:
              it is the Middle Way beyond all extremes. So we must at least
              understand this conceptually, as it will become an antidote and
              raft for us to overcome our wrong views. It will become a condition
              to give rise to the insight of 'Non-Inherency'. When we realise
              that all 'selves' and 'dharmas' are not inherent, our concepts are
              naturally dissolve. <strong>We cannot dissolve these concepts by
              remaining naked in awareness alone. We have to give rise to the
              insight of non-inherency and one of the conditions to give rise to
              this insight is to establish the right view
              conceptually. </strong> That is why Thusness said:
              <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">That is to 'transform' a
              limited view to a boundless views lies not in doing away totally
              with concepts but simply seeing 'non-inherently'. 
              'Non-conceptuality' and naked awareness will arise eventually with
              the stability of this important condition.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Dear Bro AEN,</p>
              <p>Hmmm....it seems we have an irresolvable misunderstanding..So i'll not comment further on the Right View concepts leading to enlightenment issue. Anyhow, I am not against the method that you described. It gives people a clear direction of what to expect in practice. However, just be careful not to confuse a conceptual understanding for a true insight. It can really be quite hard to differentiate without good concentration or a good teacher.</p>
              <p>As for why <em>any concepts he (a person) has(which are
              numerous) CAN be used in the realisation of
              nonconceptuality.</em></p>
              <p>In my tradition, the Zen master would on many occasions test the students on his understanding. These occasions may be in interviews, talks, during Q&amp;A sessions and even in the car or over a meal. What they test is attachment to concepts or ideas. Concepts and ideas are fine, there is actually no problem with it. But attachment to them is not fine. When there is attachment to them, the Truth is not seen. As such, the master would use any concepts the student seems to have and is attached to as a teaching tool. That's where all the Koans and Dharma Combats come from. That is what I mean.</p>
              <p>Dear Geis,</p>
              <p>From my experience, a  teacher is important. Do look for a teacher whom you can connect to and whom you feel can teach you something and you are comfortable with. Without a teacher, it is mostly a walk in the dark. Though you might eventually find your way out, it takes a super long time and many many many mistakes.</p>
              <p>Hmm....sorry, if I may comment, "sight sees, sounds hear, thoughts
                                      think"  is actually not so good...sight and see is already separation. Please try to just see, or just hear. Then try to eliminate seeing and hearing, just experience. This is because seeing and hearing is also differentiation. Then beyond that, it gets delicate, so please try to find a teacher.</p>

              <p>actually i understand (but maybe just conceptually) what u mean in ur comments. problem is maybe im too used to using the normal grammar structure of noun and verbs. i dun actually mean 'sight' as a noun or subject when i wrote 'sight sees'.</p>
