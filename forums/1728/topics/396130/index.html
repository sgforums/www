              <p> <strong>Miracles of the Karmapa's Black Crown</strong>, by Zhanag Dzogpa Tenzin 
              Namgyal</p>
              <p>Until 1981 I was the personal secretary of His Holiness the XVIth Gyalwa
               Karmapa. For the last thirty years of my life, I was next to the 
              Karmapa most of the time and wrote down almost every word that he said, 
              teaching that he gave, and letter that he wrote, including the 
              recognition letters of the various tulkus. I have wanted to write an 
              official biography of the Gyalwa Karmapa and to speak about another side
               of the Karmapa, which I will do now.<br> <br>The subject of my talk is 
              about the activities of the Buddha Karmapa, the ocean of unlimited 
              activities of the Karmapa’s three secrets of body, speech, and mind. It 
              is something really indescribable. No one would really be ale to 
              describe it, but the Karmapa appeared in this world as a human being, 
              and I had the good fortune of being his attendant for thirty years. So, 
              what I will describe is what I witnessed. In fact, it is impossible to 
              convey everything, so all I can do is share the main things I 
              experienced with you by presenting a brief account.</p>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB">Many eons ago, during the time of the Buddha called 
                  Driamkyi Gyalpo, there was a king called Yulpo Kyong (“Protector of 
              the Surrounding
               Land”). The king 
              had a younger son called 
                  Chökyi Lodro (“Wisdom of Dharma”). Chökyi Lodro went into the 
              mountains and 
                  meditated <em>vipassana</em> (“insight meditation”). He remained in <em>samadhi</em> for hundreds of thousands of years and became known as Rishi 
              Gompa-kye (“Sage 
                  Who Gave Rise to Realization”). The <em>dakinis</em> had great faith 
              in him 
                  and assembled before him; each <span class="SpellE">dakini</span> pulled a strand 
                  of hair from their head and offered it to him. He accepted their 
              present and 
                  made a crown out of their hair. They all had black hair, so the 
              crown became 
                  known as “The Black Crown.” It is a manifestation of self-arisen 
              wisdom, because 
                  all dakinis who offered their hair were wisdom dakinis; therefore 
              this crown 
                  is a manifestation of ultimate wisdom. They crowned the Sage and 
              Saint with 
                  this very crown of empowerment that is adorned with symbols of the 
              sun and 
                  moon.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;" lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
              <div class="Section1"></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"></span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB">In his next life, Rishi Gompa-kye was known as 
                  Pö Senge; in his next life he was Drupon Sinam (“Overcoming all Maras”). In his 
              next life 
                  he was Drimed Karpo (“Stainless White One”). His next life was Pema 
              Namdol 
                  (“The Play of Lotuses”). His next life was Lu-yang <span class="SpellE">Ningpo</span> (“Essence Melody of the Nagas”). Then he was Karma Wanu (“Cow”). 
              Then he was 
                  the great Brahmin Saraha. After his life as the great tantric master
               Saraha, 
                  he was reborn in Tibet
               
                  as Düsum Khyenpa, the First Glorious Karmapa.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></div>
              <div class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-GB">The Black Crown was worn 
              throughout 
                  all their lifetimes by the Karmapas; it was ever-present as the 
              spontaneous 
                  manifestation of ultimate wisdom and was not something that could be
               obtained. 
                  The <span class="SpellE">Karmapas</span> have had the Black Crown 
              from the First 
                  Karmapa and through all successive lives. Having realization of 
              ultimate wisdom, 
                  this crown is naturally present. Therefore, all Karmapas have had 
              the crown 
                  continuously, up to the XVIth Gyalwa Karmapa. If someone has clear 
              awareness 
                  and very pure karma, they can see it, which is the spontaneous 
              manifestation 
                  of wisdom. I have heard accounts of people having seen it.</span></div>
              <p><br><br>The tradition
               says that it is necessary for the Karmapa to visit and pay respect to 
              the Dalai Lama. All Karmapas would go to see him; they would take off 
              their hat and prostrate to him. When the XVIth Karmapa was in his 8th 
              year, together with his father, he went to the Dalai Lama, the XIIIth at
               that time. The Dalai Lama and his minister entered the audience room 
              and the Karmapa performed the prostrations. The Dalai Lama and his 
              minister noticed that the Karmapa was wearing a hat, so the minister 
              said, “Why are you prostrating with your hat on? That will not do!” He 
              asked the father, “Where do you come from, a remote valley? Don’t you 
              know that it is not allowed to wear a hat when you prostrate? That is a 
              big mistake.” The father responded, “He is not wearing a hat. He hasn’t 
              even brought a hat along. The Karmapas always have a wisdom hat on, so 
              probably this is the hat that you see him wearing.” Having heard this, 
              the Dalai Lama and his minister were amazed and felt great faith in the 
              Karmapa. Then the Dalai Lama wrote a long-life prayer for him. This was 
              the first occasion on which the secret hat was seen in the life of the 
              XVIth Karmapa, so it is a quite extraordinary incident.<br> <br>Later, 
              when the Karmapa was staying at Palpung Monastery to receive teachings 
              from the previous Tai Situ Rinpoche, he travelled to a monastery in 
              Litang. On the way he and his escorts passed Dsongsar Monastery, the 
              monastery of Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche. The first and previous Jamyang 
              Khyentse Rinpoche was there. At that time, Jamyang Khyentse saw the 
              Karmapa as Düsum Khyenpa, the First Karmapa, and saw the Black Crown 
              floating in space above his head while he was prostrating to him. So, he
               saw this and they heard Jamyang Khyentse describe what he had seen.<br> <br>In 1944, when the Karmapa was going on pilgrimage through the south
               of Tibet, the IInd King of Bhutan, Jigme Wangchug, invited him to 
              Bhutan. When the king met the Karmapa, he saw the Karmapa’s crown and 
              felt very great devotion for him from the depths of his heart.<br>When 
              the Karmapa left, the king cried like a little child – he cried because 
              of his great devotion and perfect faith after having met the Gyalwa 
              Karmapa.<br> <br>In 1967, the Karmapa was invited to Ladakh. At that 
              time a girl from Kashmir without any faith came to see him. As the 
              Karmapa performed the Black Crown Ceremony, the girl saw the inner 
              wisdom hat inseparably on his head; when he placed the fabricated outer 
              crown on his head, she saw the inner one inside the outer crown. This 
              happened in Ladakh at that time.<br> <br>Tashi Lada, who was responsible
               for looking after the college in Rumtek, once lived near Tsurphu. When 
              he was 11 years old, he escorted his father to pay respects to the 
              Karmapa. Next to the Karmapa’s seat in his room was a statue of the 
              Karmapa. When Tashi Lada entered the room he saw two statues and saw one
               moving about. He told his father, “There are two statues of the 
              Karmapa. One is motionless and the other one is moving about. Which is 
              the real one?” He had seen the statue with the Black Crown and he could 
              see the real Karmapa with the inner crown; they were identical, while 
              one was moving about. He was very young when this happened and did not 
              know anything about the Black Crown at that time. There are many other 
              accounts about people actually seeing the inner Black Crown.<br><br> <br>When the Karmapa was 12 years old and travelling from 
              Tsurphu to Kham in East Tibet, he came to a village called Drome that is
               situated in an area called Tsumbu. At that time the river was frozen 
              and he went to play on the ice. Later when the ice melted his footprints
               could be seen on the water and they remained there. Apart from 
              Padmasambhava, the Karmapa is the only great master known to have left 
              his footprints on water.<br> <br>When the Karmapa was travelling in 
              Kham, he reached a place called Chang Tang, the location of the 
              monastery of Dechen Rinpoche. The Karmapa had a young antelope that had 
              been given to him and also had his tiny pet puppy, called Yidrug, along 
              with him. When they arrived at the monastery with his dog and antelope, 
              both animals left footprints on a stone, which can still be seen.<br> <br>When
               the Karmapa went to a nunnery to bless the site, he threw kernels of 
              grain into the room; they usually do not roll under objects. But when 
              the Karmapa threw the grains there, they rolled underneath all the 
              objects in the room  they rolled under the feet of the statues and many
               lay in the hands of the statues. Half of some and the whole of other 
              kernels transformed into ringsel (“precious white relics”). Some have 
              been preserved from that consecration and are now in Rumtek.<br> <br>One
               time the Karmapa went to Phayul Monastery. The abbot there was a famous
               and great siddha. When the Karmapa arrived, he tied the sword he had 
              into a knot. He gave it to the siddha and told him, “I am a siddha, 
              too.” When the Karmapa went to a Bonpo Monastery in Nitang with 
              Tai Situ Rinpoche, they both left footprints in the stone; their horses 
              did too.</p>
