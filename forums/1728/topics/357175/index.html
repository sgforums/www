              One of the first stumbling blocks that Westerners often encounter when they
              learn about Buddhism is the teaching on anatta, often translated as no-self.
              This teaching is a stumbling block for two reasons. First, the idea of there
              being no self doesn't fit well with other Buddhist teachings, such as the
              doctrine of kamma and rebirth: If there's no self, what experiences the
              results of kamma and takes rebirth? Second, it doesn't fit well with our own
              Judeo-Christian background, which assumes the existence of an eternal soul
              or self as a basic presupposition: If there's no self, what's the purpose of
              a spiritual life? Many books try to answer these questions, but if you look
              at the Pali Canon -- the earliest extant record of the Buddha's teachings --
              you won't find them addressed at all. In fact, the one place where the
              Buddha was asked point-blank whether or not there was a self, he refused to
              answer. When later asked why, he said that to hold either that there is a
              self or that there is no self is to fall into extreme forms of wrong view
              that make the path of Buddhist practice impossible. Thus the question should
              be put aside. To understand what his silence on this question says about the
              meaning of anatta, we first have to look at his teachings on how questions
              should be asked and answered, and how to interpret his answers.
                 
              The Buddha divided all questions into four classes: those that deserve a
              categorical (straight yes or no) answer; those that deserve an analytical
              answer, defining and qualifying the terms of the question; those that
              deserve a counter-question, putting the ball back in the questioner's court;
              and those that deserve to be put aside. The last class of question consists
              of those that don't lead to the end of suffering and stress. The first duty
              of a teacher, when asked a question, is to figure out which class the
              question belongs to, and then to respond in the appropriate way. You don't,
              for example, say yes or no to a question that should be put aside. If you
              are the person asking the question and you get an answer, you should then
              determine how far the answer should be interpreted. The Buddha said that
              there are two types of people who misrepresent him: those who draw
              inferences from statements that shouldn't have inferences drawn from them,
              and those who don't draw inferences from those that should.
                 
              These are the basic ground rules for interpreting the Buddha's teachings,
              but if we look at the way most writers treat the anatta doctrine, we find
              these ground rules ignored. Some writers try to qualify the no-self
              interpretation by saying that the Buddha denied the existence of an eternal
              self or a separate self, but this is to give an analytical answer to a
              question that the Buddha showed should be put aside. Others try to draw
              inferences from the few statements in the discourse that seem to imply that
              there is no self, but it seems safe to assume that if one forces those
              statements to give an answer to a question that should be put aside, one is
              drawing inferences where they shouldn't be drawn.
                 
              So, instead of answering "no" to the question of whether or not there is a
              self -- interconnected or separate, eternal or not -- the Buddha felt that
              the question was misguided to begin with. Why? No matter how you define the
              line between "self" and "other," the notion of self involves an element of
              self-identification and clinging, and thus suffering and stress. This holds
              as much for an interconnected self, which recognizes no "other," as it does
              for a separate self. If one identifies with all of nature, one is pained by
              every felled tree. It also holds for an entirely "other" universe, in which
              the sense of alienation and futility would become so debilitating as to make
              the quest for happiness -- one's own or that of others -- impossible. For
              these reasons, the Buddha advised paying no attention to such questions as
              "Do I exist?" or "Don't I exist?" for however you answer them, they lead to
              suffering and stress.
                 
              To avoid the suffering implicit in questions of "self" and "other," he
              offered an alternative way of dividing up experience: the four Noble Truths
              of stress, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation. Rather
              than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other, he said, one
              should recognize them simply for what they are, in and of themselves, as
              they are directly experienced, and then perform the duty appropriate to
              each. Stress should be comprehended, its cause abandoned, its cessation
              realized, and the path to its cessation developed. These duties form the
              context in which the anatta doctrine is best understood. If you develop the
              path of virtue, concentration, and discernment to a state of calm well-being
              and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths,
              the questions that occur to the mind are not "Is there a self? What is my
              self?" but rather "Am I suffering stress because I'm holding onto this
              particular phenomenon? Is it really me, myself, or mine? If it's stressful
              but not really me or mine, why hold on?" These last questions merit
              straightforward answers, as they then help you to comprehend stress and to
              chip away at the attachment and clinging -- the residual sense of
              self-identification -- that cause it, until ultimately all traces of
              self-identification are gone and all that's left is limitless freedom.
                 
              In this sense, the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of no-self, but a
              not-self strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause, leading
              to the highest, undying happiness. At that point, questions of self,
              no-self, and not-self fall aside. Once there's the experience of such total
              freedom, where would there be any concern about what's experiencing it, or
              whether or not it's a self?

              <p>again this is useless for me. why? let me giv example</p>
              <p>u try telling a suffering person "mere suffering is, not any sufferer is found". what no sufferer?! to that person isnt this rubbish? the person is clearly suffering, im clearly suffering and to me the suffering is real. thats what i meant. if we could really see that our suffering is not real, or that there isnt really any sufferer,  then we are enlightenment already.</p>
              <p>i may be wrong, but i suspect that even if people can understand those phrases, it is only at the concept-wise level only. when faced with real situations due to their karma, they'll just be as clueless and lost.</p>

              <p>Note that it didn't say suffering and pain is not real</p>
              <p>It says the sufferer is not real.</p>
              <p>When you feel pain, there is just pain that's all. The notion of a sufferer is imagination. The pain is what is real.</p>
              <p>Of course ultimately even pain is empty in the sense that its conditioned, impermanent, etc. But it's vivid. Like a mirage, it's without substance, but still 'appears real'. But the vividness of the sensation is just as important as its emptiness.</p>

              but pain or suffering is not forever. This is impermanent, and whatever impermanent is empty.
              
              whatever sufferings we suffered in untold lifetimes, isnt it feel like a dream to you even if you can recall your previous lifetimes.
