              <p>Some of the nagas can be a wisdom-holder. There are also deva who have gained stream-entry ( or above ) during the Buddha's time and have vowed to protect the Buddha's relics, Dharma and Sangha. In other words, they are one of the contributing factors in sustaining the triple gems dispensation till this day. Therefore we also pay veneration to them. Some of them are also Bodhisattva. They protect, assist and help us to clear our karmic obstacles. For every precepts that we take, we are protected by one Dharma-protector. Therefore, it also by our own power that these dharma protector protect us.</p>
              <p>As a buddhist, we take refuge in the Triple Gems. It not advisable to anyhow seek refuge in the deva and naga as some of them not enlightened. They are still samsaric beings who are subjected to anger, jealousy, pride, greed and delusion.</p>

              <p>Immeasurable love, Immeasurable compassionate, immeasurable sympathetic joy and  immeasurable equanimity which does not distinguish friends, enemies or sentient beings, but regard every sentient beings as equal.</p>
              <p>Just to add on..</p>
              <p>To become a buddha, one have to thoroughly cultivated these four immeasurable qualities. However by simply cultivating these four immeasurable qualities is not enough, one has to practise insight meditation to realise wisdom. we can sometime suppress or purified those gross defilement from arising by attaining jhana ( metta-jhana for instance ) but we can't get rid the latent defilement in our mind-stream.</p>

              <p>Agama sutta is the mahayana term given to the Pali Cannon which Theravada tradition is based. As you know, there are 2 main tradition of buddhism today - Theravada and Mahayana. Tibetan buddhism is a subset of mahayana.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pali Cannon is also known as Tipitaka. It contains 3 'baskets' of books passed down , namely ;</p>
              <p>1. Sutta Pitaka (Buddha's discourses on various issues regarding the doctrine, his day-to-day conversation as remembered and recorded by Ven Ananda, his attendant. There are also some discourses from Ven Sariputta and Ven Mogallana, his 2 chief disciples).</p>
              <p>2. Vinaya - Rules of Monasteric life . This contains the explaination of the origination of the rules, and under what circumstance buddha made the regulations to be observed by the Sangha</p>
              <p>3. Ahbidhamma - the higher Dhamma dealing with Ultimate realities, or 'Buddhist metaphysics'. It explains in detail the various constituents of consciousness, mind, matter, etc. It is said that the Buddha taught the Ahbidhamma to the devas in the Travatimsa (heaven of 33) for the period of 3 months in the human world (because devas possess the sharp mind to penetrate the Doctrine). However, it was made known to the humans by the effort of Ven Sariputta, who took the effort to ask the Buddha what he had taught in the heaven. The Buddha repeated his teaching to Ven Sariputta.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ahbidhamma's position varies in different school of buddhism. Ven Sariputta is very venerated in Theravada tradition, so this teaching of Ahbidhamma is credited to his effort during his Recitation of Ahbidhamma months before he passed into nibbana.(he passed away before Buddha did, so any error in the Ahbidhamma would have been corrected by the Buddha).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The earlier mahayana sutras (which is in sanskrit ) have similarities to Pali Cannon, so Pali Cannon was regarded as the core of buddhists teaching , therefore given the name Agama Sutra.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mahayana tradition has additional sutras, which are not found in the Pali Cannon.</p>

              I think we can say that Agama Sutra or Pali Cannon is the 'Old testament' of the Buddhist Bible.
              
              Mahayana has 'New Testament' but they accept the 'Old Testament' too.

              <p> </p>
              <p>Get Witch / Black Magician to Open the Third eye for you, for a fee of course, sometime this fee does not incude money. It may sometime be a curse on you.</p>
              <p>Alterative you can try to collect Cow Tears / Horse Tears and rub then onto your eyes, thus obtaining the Third eye.</p>
              <p>Somewhere  I read Dogs / Cats Tears work as well.</p>
              <p>Try at your own risk.</p>

              <p>Ananda reached an understanding of the limits of perception itself,
              and so he asked the Buddha how he would be able to know his true
              nature. The Buddha replied: "Ananda, though you have not yet reached
              the state beyond the stream of transmigration, you may now use the
              Buddha's transcendent power to behold the first dhyana heaven without
              obstruction, like Anirudha who sees this world as clearly as fruit held
              in his own hand. Bodhisattvas can see hundreds and thousands of worlds.
              Buddhas in the ten directions can see all the Pure Lands as countless
              as the dust. As to living beings, their range of sight is (sometimes)
              limited to inches."</p>
              <p>The Buddha explains to Ananda that beings on different levels,
              although they may look at the same thing, will really see it according
              to their own perspective. The Buddha then continues to talk about
              different levels of vision. The Buddha sees all things as equal,
              undifferentiated, but he can also see things as ordinary beings see
              them. The Buddha explains how things are perceived from five different
              levels. They are:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The eye of ordinary sentient beings<br> The heavenly eye<br> The eye of an arhat<br> The eye of a bodhisattva<br> The eye of the Buddha</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The first level, which is also called the "fleshy eye," includes
              animals and all beings in the realm of desire. This eye can see
              material things, but it can also be blocked. If a piece of paper is put
              in front of your eyes, vision is blocked. If the paper is removed, you
              can see. This eye is quite limited. You can't see things that are too
              big, too small, too far, too close. The fleshy eye is so weak that it
              is almost useless.</p>
              <p>There are two kinds of heavenly eyes. First, there is the eye which
              is achieved only through the practice of meditation by those who have
              cultivated samadhi and reached the first level of dhyana. Second, there
              is the eye which is achieved on the basis of accumulated good merit.</p>
              <p>An ordinary human being can achieve the heavenly eye through
              meditation and the achievement of the first level of dhyana, or he can
              achieve it through the grace of buddhas, bodhisattvas, or heavenly
              beings. An ordinary human being could not attain the heavenly eye
              through accumulated merit. One who had enough accumulated merit would
              already be born in the heavenly realm, not in the human realm.</p>
              <p>The arhat eye, also known as the "wisdom eye," is the third level of
              attainment. It is called the wisdom eye because the arhat has attained
              wisdom and eliminated all vexations. Those with the fleshy eye or the
              heavenly eye still have vexations. The sutra says that when an arhat
              observes this world, he sees it the same way an ordinary being sees a
              mango in his hand, and he sees it with complete clarity. He can not
              only see this world, but he can see a great chilocosm of worlds. Why is
              his vision so vast? He no longer has a sense of self, therefore the
              chilocosm is there before him, unobstructed by his own perceptions or
              interests.</p>
              <p>The next kind of eye, the bodhisattva eye, is also called the dharma
              eye. Why is this eye, and not that of the arhat, called the dharma eye?
              Even though the arhat has liberated himself from self, or ego, there is
              still a sense of discrimination between the realms of birth and death.
              But for the bodhisattva there is neither birth nor death, samsara nor
              nirvana. He has no attachment to the Dharma, and thus he has the dharma
              eye.</p>
              <p>The arhat can see one great chilocosm, but the bodhisattva can view
              100,000 great chilocosms. There is no comparison between the arhat eye
              and the bodhisattva eye.</p>
              <p>The Buddha's vision is the greatest. The Buddha eye can see all the
              Buddha lands in the ten directions. The Buddha's eye is the most
              perfect. The way Buddha sees has nothing in common with our ideas of
              far and near, large and small.</p>
              <p>These are the five kinds of eyes. Now we can return to the sutra and
              ask what kind of problem Ananda was having. He was not an arhat, and he
              didn't have psychic power or the heavenly eye; he only had a normal
              human eye. The Buddha appeared in the world not just for bodhisattvas
              and arhats, but for ordinary sentient beings as well. He explains the
              Buddha eye to ordinary sentient beings because they tend to believe
              that what they see is all there is, and that that is right and correct.
              According to the Buddha's view, there is nothing that is right, nothing
              that is wrong. If the Buddha and an ordinary sentient being look at the
              same thing, they both see it, but they each see it differently. When
              the Buddha looks at something, he sees into its empty nature, its
              original nature. Common people look at the material nature of things -
              shape, color, and quality. The Buddha looks at true nature.</p>
              <p>In early Chinese literature there was a Taoist philosopher named
              Chuang-tzu. One day he was talking to another philosopher, Hui Shih,
              and they were both standing on a bridge overlooking a river. Chuang-tzu
              said, "Look at the fish, see how happy they are." Hui Shih replied,
              "You're not a fish -- how do you know how happy they are?" Chuang-tzu
              countered, "You're not me, how do you know that I don't know how happy
              the fish are?"</p>
              <p>These two men had very different perspectives. Chuang-tzu is at one
              with the fish, and really knows what they are feeling. Hui Shih still
              discriminates between himself and the fish, so he has no idea how they
              feel.</p>
              <p>There's a Ch'an story concerning two partriarchs, Ma-tzu and
              Pai-chang. These two masters were walking, when a flock of geese flew
              over them. The elder patriarch asked Pai-chang, "What was that?"
              Pai-chang replied, "Those are wild geese." Ma-tzu then asked, "What
              about now?" And Pai-chang said, "They've flown away." Ma-tzu grabbed
              Pai-chang's nose, squeezed very hard, and demanded, "They flew away?"
              Pai-chang's nose really hurt, and he started to cry, but then he
              started to laugh uproariously. People thought he went crazy.</p>
              <p>At the beginning of their walk, when the geese first flew over them,
              what they saw was different. But at the end of the story they were both
              seeing the same thing. When Ma-tzu saw the geese, he saw them, as we
              say in Ch'an, with "no coming, no going, no dying, no being born" --
              how then could he say that the geese flew away? When Pai-chang first
              saw the geese, he had the mind of discrimination. When the geese flew
              away, his mind flew away with them. But when Ma-tzu grabbed Pai-chang's
              nose, Ma-tzu brought Pai-chang's mind back. When the pain was great
              enough, Pai-chang was right there again. He saw for himself that he was
              unmoving, that the geese were unmoving. His tears and his laughter were
              both expressions of his joy. In the beginning they had different eyes,
              but in the end their eyes were the same.</p>
              <p>The experience of these patriarchs is different from the story of
              Chang-tzu and Hui Shih. Chang-tzu was at one with nature, but he was
              still moving with nature. Ma-tzu was also at one with nature, but his
              mind was not moving, therefore, nature was not moving for him.</p>
              <p>In Ch'an we only consider it important to deal with two of the five
              eyes, the ordinary eye and the Buddha eye. There is no need to bother
              with the heavenly eye, the wisdom eye, or the Dharma eye. In the
              gradual school of practice all five eyes would be included. But the
              sudden school of practice begins with the worldly eye and moves
              directly to the Buddha eye. This is what Pai-chang did. He moved
              immediately from the material view to the point where he could see the
              empty, unmoving nature of all things.</p>
              <p>In this sutra the Buddha is trying to help Ananda take the step
              directly from the fleshy eye to a realization of the Buddha eye. He
              does not talk about the three stages in between. But since we have some
              time, I will go more deeply into the differences between the worldly
              eye, the heavenly eye, and a sub-level called the deva, or ghost eye.</p>
              <p>Have you ever seen a ghost or a god? Normally people can't see
              things that are too far, near, big, or small. But some people borrow
              the power of a ghost or other spiritual being, and gain spiritual
              vision. There are also cases of heavenly beings who are born into the
              human realm, who still retain some ability to see ghosts and spirits in
              the realms below. They can no longer see into the heavenly realm, nor
              can they see ghosts and spirits in the human realm.</p>
              <p>I had a student who came here for a beginner's class. She claimed to
              have some psychic power. She said that when she was well-concentrated,
              she could see into people's past, but I had my doubts. I asked her if
              she could see into my past. I have heavy karmic obstructions, which
              have their root in past lives, but still she could see nothing of my
              past. Why? People are not always reborn into the human realm. They
              might be born into a distant world, and ordinary psychic power would be
              too limited to see that far. It would be similar to a person who
              commits a crime in Taiwan and moves to New York. The New York police
              would have no record of the crime.</p>
              <p>The ghostly or deva eye stands at a level between the fleshy and
              heavenly eyes. This phenomenon occurs when a spiritual being uses the
              eye of a human being as a medium. People who have experienced this
              believe that they have been endowed with great spiritual powers, but it
              is really the power of the spiritual being at work. There is a book
              about a spirit called Seth who used a woman's body to talk to people in
              this world. He could only talk through her.</p>
              <p>I have a Dharma brother who has such powers. He was once sitting on
              a train, and suddenly he saw all the people sitting around him as pigs
              and dogs and other animals. He could see the changes that these people
              went through in various past lives, but he could see no further. This
              is not really his power, but that of a spiritual being working through
              him. I asked him if he could see such things with his eyes closed, and
              he answered no, but there are people who have such powers.</p>
              <p>In the sutra Buddha talks about a disciple, Anirudha. He is a good
              example of someone who developed the heavenly eye. He practiced very
              hard. He sat for days with his eyes open, and he never slept.
              Eventually, he went blind from keeping his eyes open. The Buddha went
              to visit him and told him not to worry. He said that the fleshy eye is
              of little use anyway, and there are better eyes to acquire. The Buddha
              explained to Anirudha how to practice, and in a short time he had the
              heavenly eye. As he penetrated deeper into dhyana, his vision became
              truly vast.</p>
              <p>Those who are born in the realm of desire with the heavenly eye,
              because of their previous good karma, are always born in heavenly
              realms. Those born as humans in the realm of form, must obtain the
              heavenly eye through meditation. Normally, human beings cannot see
              ghosts, and the ghosts that are here cannot see us. The more powerful
              beings in the heavenly realms can see us, but spiritual beings here
              cannot. They can sense our existence, but they can't tell exactly where
              we are. Only by borrowing an earthly eye can they see more accurately.
              An English psychologist who was able to leave his body reported seeing
              just this sort of thing; he saw ghosts and humans, but they could not
              see each other.</p>
              <p>The heavenly eye can observe all manner of beings in the realm of
              form: animals, humans, ghosts, spirits, heavenly beings. This eye can
              see into the past and future for 500 to 1000 lives. But looking into
              the past and looking into the future are two distinct psychic powers.
              In the six heavenly realms, the lower realms cannot see into the realms
              above them. Why? Because the body becomes more and more subtle as you
              ascend into these realms. A being in the highest heavenly realm can see
              throughout his realm and all the realms below. Such a being can see us
              and know us as if we were specks in the palm of his hand.</p>
              <p>Common people cannot really understand this heavenly eye. It has to
              be experienced. Sometimes someone in Canada might be able to see what's
              going on in the United States, or someone in United States can see
              things in Hong Kong. This is not the heavenly eye at all. It is still
              the ghost, or spiritual eye. The heavenly eye, within its realm, knows
              what is going on in all places at all times.</p>
              <p>I'm not going to speak about the arhat eye or the bodhisattva eye. I
              will speak directly about the Buddha eye. It is really quite simple.
              The Buddha sees everything as emptiness. This does not mean that he
              sees nothing when he looks at something or someone. It means that he
              sees the empty nature of the things he sees. Levels below the Buddha
              can see emptiness also, but emptiness is experienced like air in a box.
              It takes the shape of the container. There is still separateness. For
              the Buddha, according to this analogy, air is everywhere, and it is not
              segmented. Even the bodhisattva, who has the dharma eye, does not see
              in this way. Only when you reach Buddhahood, do you see with
              unobstructed limitlessness.</p>
              <p>The Buddha explains to Ananda that he must see into the true nature
              of things. In this way he will see his own true nature. This is what
              the Ch'an sect calls "seeing into your own true nature." But this can
              be somewhat misleading, because it might sound as if your true nature
              is something separate from yourself. That is not the case. Your true
              nature is your self; it is not apart from it. This is why the
              <em> Surangama Sutra</em> is classified as a sutra of true permanence, because it leads us to our true nature.</p>
