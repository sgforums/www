              I read that one can have the third eye/ ear in ghost story books and newspaper, as ST published in Life on Sunday abt a chap, who is well educated and can see these beings.
              
              How can one have such a gift or rather curse, ie being able to see or hear beings from other realms.
              
              Can one who has these gifts can close the third eye/ear?

              These gifts are the results of cultivation of the mind along the Samatha (concentration) meditation, most likely in his previous life, or he could be a former being from the higher heavens.
              
              You may want to read about the 6 types of psychics powers of the mind, 5 of them attainable by people in any religion, but the 6th one only attained by Buddha/ Arahants - destruction of mental intoxicants.
              
              Generally the psychic powers arises when one attains the 4th Jhana (mental absorption) and above (or 5th Jhana in Ahbidhamma) , when the mind is extremely refine , calm and in the state of equanimity. 
              
              Warning though, attaining such feats without purity of heart, can be a source of danger for greed and delusion to arise.

              <p>There are ways to have access to the so called third eye without entering jhanas, but this is the practice of outer-paths (non-Buddhist paths), and is not without dangers and also to answer the TS, it is very difficult to 'close' when you 'open'. Not recommended.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Third Eye in Buddhism refers to the Wisdom Eye of discerning the true nature of existence, it has nothing to do with the outer-paths psychic powers. This is what we should be seeking.</p>

              I read that Maia Lee, who suddenly had the third eye one day and could see ghosts.
              
              How can one close this so called third-eye? Can monks help by chanting the parimitas?

              what abt magicians like David Copperfield magic and David Blaine for example.
              
              Some of the magic they performed, are like out of this world, but christians said the devil must have given them the power.

              <p><br>WWI and WWII was results of collective karma.</p>
              <p> Dharma protectors are not superman or spiderman or wonderwomen or inuyasha or whatever, that go around to save and protect each and everyone walking on earth, as in cartoons or mangas. </p>
              <p>Karma have to be served out one by one. Time taken and magnitude can be enhanced or reduced nevertheless ,depending on each indivdual's efforts. In collective karma, all is involved as a whole but extend of final results is different  "case by case". </p>
              <p>Well, if u insist on a "answer" for your monks case' example, a simple way of seeing it is this: is it correct that as long as we have bought insurance, we can just cross the road without looking out for oncoming traffic?; or is it fine that as long as we have a bodyguard we can walk into a burning inferno and think that we can come out unscath?. Or if we have a good government, we can just sit around, eat, sleep  and don't need to build a military defence?</p>
              <p>Finally, I think to study and practice the dharma is of uptmost importance to all Buddhists, regardless there are dharma protectors or not. BUT I don't mind there are. To argue their non- existence, pls go to the scentific research insitutions or the relevant wedsites. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p><br>Actually, we shouldn't take hollywood too seriously. Many magics or delusion perfomed on TV are pre-taped or edited. Some audiences or spectators which seemed randomly picked fr the streets may be paid actors. In the past, common tricks were engaging twins in magic shows without audience knowledge. Of cos gadgets were much simpler and cheaper then. Today, with hollywood's technologies and money, almost anything can be faked, right to the policeman on the site.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> </p>
