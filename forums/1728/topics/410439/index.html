              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;' lang="EN-GB">Possessions,
               and the desire for them, are a big part of our suffering. We want what 
              we don’t have and cling to what we do have, either way creating the 
              circumstances for both present and future suffering. Present suffering 
              is created when we live with the desire for something that we do not 
              possess, for we are in a state of want or incompleteness, longing for 
              that object; and the seeds for future suffering are sown because we will
               continue to suffer while we fail to take hold of that which we crave. 
              And, even when we already possess that which we want, we still suffer, 
              both now and in times to come, for we fear the loss of our possessions. 
              In this, it can be seen that rich people are in a worse position than 
              the poor, for they have more to lose, and therefore more possessions to 
              worry about. The 17<sup>th</sup> Century Zen Master Bankei has some interesting insights into desire in his poem ‘The Song of the Mind’:</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt;' lang="EN-GB">“When you've got money</span></strong></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt;' lang="EN-GB"><strong>You despise the poor”</strong></span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt;' lang="EN-GB">Regarding
               the rich, Bankei says that not only do they avoid the poor, but that 
              they actually despise them. Why? Well, if you’re rich, and you wish to 
              retain your wealth, then the poor may be perceived as a threat to your 
              continued prosperity, for they will no doubt desire what you already 
              have. On a subtler level of human psychology, it may well be that whilst
               consciously we may be unaware of the fact, subconsciously we may feel 
              guilty that we have a lot whilst others have very little, and this can 
              result in resentment towards those that trigger such inner conflict. Of 
              course, these are generalisations, and there do exist philanthropists 
              that willingly give to those less fortunate than themselves through a 
              genuine sense of compassion or fellowship. But how many of us have given
               to charity or the poor in the past, but part of us has resented the 
              fact, regretting the loss of part of our wealth? Bankei suggests that we
               reflect upon our life in relation to the poor, rather than merely 
              acting out of subconscious motives:</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><br> </strong></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt;' lang="EN-GB">“But have you forgotten how it was</span></strong></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;' lang="EN-GB"><strong>Back when you were poor yourself?”</strong></span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;' lang="EN-GB">Now,
               again, not all of those who are rich were once poor, for some people 
              are born into wealth. But, for many of us that are well-off to one 
              degree or another, we can recall earlier times in our lives when we 
              weren’t so affluent. Remembering what it was like back then, and how we 
              felt about not having what we wanted, we can then imagine how those 
              poorer than ourselves feel right now. They do not deserve to be despised
               or even disliked for being less fortunate, if anything they are worthy 
              of our empathy. Out of such empathy for the poor can come the motivation
               to help them, and if acted upon, such altruistic behaviour can be the 
              source of much pleasure, counteracting any feelings of guilt referred to
               above. </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt;' lang="EN-GB">“The money you amassed in life</span></strong></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt;' lang="EN-GB">Here,
               Bankei has a perhaps shocking accusation to make, that the accruing of 
              money through our lives is motivated by a “demonic heart.” This is a 
              powerful and challenging assertion; powerful in that it grabs our 
              attention, and challenging in that it demands we look at the mindsets we
               have when pursuing and stockpiling our wealth. To understand Bankei’s 
              use of the word “demonic” it’s crucial to remember that the Buddha 
              taught that desire and clinging are the ultimate causes of our 
              suffering, and therefore that if we live with such feelings in our minds
               we are doing the worst thing possible if our ultimate intent is to 
              attain enlightenment. In this sense, it is “demonic” and must be 
              recognised and let go of if we are to progress along the Buddha’s Way.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><br></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt;' lang="EN-GB">The belief in hungry ghosts is long-established in the Buddhist traditions of Asia, perhaps going back to at least the lifetime of the historical Buddha. In Asia,
               hungry ghosts are usually believed in literally as the spirits of dead 
              people who were greedy during their previous life and therefore now live
               as a ghostly being with a massive belly but a tiny mouth, unable to 
              satiate their enormous hunger. But, Bankei’s reference to hungry ghosts 
              may well mean something less fantastical, as he was renowned for not 
              indulging in the more supernatural and superstitious elements of 
              traditional Buddhist culture. Rather than meaning the ‘leftovers’ of 
              actual dead people, he seems to be using the term “hungry ghosts”  to 
              mean either our own psychological reactions to our greed or other living
               people that grasp after our wealth and associated happiness. Perhaps 
              for modern-minded Buddhists the latter interpretation is more useful, 
              and as the Buddha Dharma consists of skilful means to help us realize 
              Nirvana, it is surely both efficacious and acceptable to view Bankei’s 
              use of the words “hungry ghosts” in this way.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt;' lang="EN-GB">If
               we take “hungry ghosts” to mean either other people’s effects on our 
              riches or our own psychological states regarding our wealth, we have 
              some interesting and productive areas for reflection. Certainly, those 
              who cling to their possessions will react with “horror and alarm” if 
              other people threaten their privileged positions in society. It may be a
               thief or a business rival to name but two kinds of “hungry ghosts” in 
              this interpretation of the term. Or, it may be the fear of being thieved
               or out-manoeuvred in business dealings that create mental turmoil akin 
              to such ghostly beings. Whether physical or psychological, and 
              ultimately such a division is misleading in itself, rich people 
              definitely have “hungry ghosts” haunting them, but this is not the worst
               fate that can befall them, or any of us fir that matter:</span></div>

               verse reveals another, greater, foe to not only the wealthy but every 
              single living creature – death. We are all subject to death, and Bankei 
              states that if we spend our lives in the pursuit of “gold” (or material 
              wealth), from the perspective of the Dharma, we have wasted our time on 
              earth. He creates the image of someone rich dying and finding that all 
              their money is of no use now. What could have benefitted them in 
              preparation for their demise was the practice of Buddhism, but since 
              they neglected thus in favour of amassing as many possessions as they 
              could, they are in quite a predicament, full of fear and confusion as 
              they face their final moments. If only they had walked the Path of the 
              Buddha whilst still healthy, now as death approached, they would have 
              the wisdom to face it with equanimity. </span></div>

               verse reveals the wisdom of Zen Master Bankei, for he gets right to the
               heart of the matter and highlights the central issue here: “clinging, 
              craving and the like.” As the Buddha taught over two-and-a-half 
              millennia ago, when we cling to our desires, whether we already possess 
              them or not, we create our own suffering. As an enlightened master, 
              however, Bankei does not cling to any thoughts or desires that may arise
               in his awareness and therefore he does not suffer. Furthermore, and 
              here we have another indicator of this man’s greatness, he states that 
              “the whole world is truly mine!” Is he a megalomaniac or engulfed in a 
              kind of solipsism? No, he is enlightened, that’s all! </span></div>

               we see the true state of affairs we see that there is no separation 
              between me and that object, between me and you, nor me and the world. In
               reality, ‘I’ am not separate from the things I might desire or cling 
              to, and therefore I need not suffer at the thought that I do not have 
              them or might lose them. You might protest that whilst this sounds great
               in theory, in practice it isn’t so easy to experience, to which I 
              counter, “Poppycock!” All we need to do to set the wheel of Dharma 
              rolling is to actually look at the way things are right now with an open
               mind and heart (which are in fact not two, by the way). If you are 
              willing to do this, please conduct the following exercises in a spirit 
              of inquiry.</span></div>

               at an object. It might be a car, a house, or even the sky. Take time to
               notice its features, those aspects of it that you might consider 
              desirable or at least attractive. Now, gaze at your own face – or lack 
              of, in truth – and note whether there is any gap between ‘you’ here and 
              the object ‘there.’ It is true, on present evidence, that there is no 
              distance separating ‘you’ and ‘it,’ but rather that there is only one 
              seeing here that includes both seer and seen? Congratulations, you’ve 
              just opened your Buddha Eye!</span></em></div>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt;' lang="EN-GB">This
               Buddha Eye that is referred to above is none other than the Unborn 
              which Bankei liked so much to talk about. It is the pure seeing that 
              transcends both seer and seen, leaving awareness intertwined with 
              whatever it is aware of. In this naked knowing, everything already is 
              part of awareness, and therefore is already ‘mine’ as what I really am 
              at centre is this very awareness. Living thus, there is no self from 
              which the desire to have and to hold will arise; instead, everything and
               everyone is seen as an expression of the same awareness, worthy of the 
              wisdom and compassion that flows from this empty heart. Then, all the 
              “hungry ghosts” in the world can come to haunt us and we will be beyond 
              their grasp, as will be every single object in the cosmos.</span></p>
