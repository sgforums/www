            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Herzog_Zwei:</div><div class="quote_body">What has suffering got to do with lighting up?</div></blockquote>Found this from <a href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/true_nature.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/true_nature.htm</a> by 'A.H.Almaas':<br><br><blockquote>    <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">* The first quality of true nature is that it is inseparable from awareness. Our true nature is inherently aware. This is the fact of luminosity, the fact of light, the fact of consciousness. We know this because when we experience any of the essential manifestations, we recognize that Being is (delete in) inseparable from some kind of awareness, sensitivity, in-touchness, or consciousness. Awareness is not something in addition to true nature; it is an inherent and inseparable characteristic of true nature, the way heat is inherent in and inseparable from fire.</span></strong><br><br>* The second characteristic of true reality is that this field of awareness, this field of presence, is pervasive and infinite, and includes everything within it. In fact, it is a oneness, an indivisible unity. This is similar to the Buddhist notion of the Â“wisdom of equality or evenness.Â” The fact that there are patterns within the field does not mean there are discrete objectsÂ… The field is all one consciousness with different patterns in different places. So the entire soul is unitary as well. When we recognize true nature and we lose the sense of boundaries, we recognize that oneness pervades the whole universe. God has one mind.<br><br>* The third characteristic is that true nature is dynamic. Reality is moving and changing all the time. This is obvious when you notice that your perception of your inner experience Â– or of the whole world Â– is not a snapshot; it is a movie. It is inherently in a constant state of change and transformation. It is not a static presence. This is related the Buddhist notion of the Â“all-accomplishing wisdom.Â” Reality is a dynamic presence that is always changing through shifts in the manifest patterns. In fact, the presence of change is implicit in the fact of awareness; without it, there is no awareness.<br><br>* The openness of true nature is its fourth characteristic. Openness means an infinite number of possibilities Â– open to be anything, open to manifest as anything, unlimited in its potential. This is the indeterminacy and inexhaustibility that we discussed in the last chapter. Reality is always changing because its true nature is completely open. This is the space dimension of our Being: when you recognize true nature, you find it to be spacious. In other words spaciousness is inherent in the presence that is true nature. The whole universe is a deep mysterious nothingness, openness, lightness, and complete absence of any heaviness. And this very mysterious, delicate spaciousness has a luminosity inherent in it, a glimmer, a radiance that gives it (delete a) awareness of itself.<br><br>* The fifth major characteristic of true nature is that it is not only awareness, oneness, dynamism, and openness, but also knowingness. This is similar to the Buddhist notion of the Â“wisdom of discrimination,Â” or the discriminating awareness of the Buddha. It is inherent to essential presence that it is not only awareness of presence but simultaneously the discrimination of the particular quality of presence, such as Compassion or Peace. This knowingness is inherent to presence, inherent to the awareness of presence. (Spacecruiser Inquiry, pg 32)</blockquote>Though this is (I feel) quite well written, there are aspects and characteristics of our true nature not mentioned by the author such as the essence of emptiness and non-locality. But that would be another topic.<br><br>But anyway what I'm trying to say is, luminosity is like light. The sun's rays pervades the entire Earth, lighting up everything so we can 'see'. The luminosity of our true Mind is similar, it is the characteristic of inherent awareness, everything we feel and touch and experience is luminosity.<br><br>If suffering is not an expression of luminosity, we cannot even feel suffering. Therefore suffering is also an expression of luminosity.<br><br>Another thing is that our True Mind experientially 'feels' like luminosity, it feels luminous. As Ajahn Brahmavamso said,<br><br>"...It is the mind manifesting, not a light, but for most it appears like a light, it is perceived as a light, because this imperfect description is the best that perception can offer..."<br><br>"....But there does come a time, and this is the Buddha's simile, when the moon is released from the clouds and there in the clear night sky you can see the beautiful full disc of the moon shining brilliantly, and you know that's the moon. The moon is there; the moon is real, and it's not just some sort of side effect of the clouds. This is what happens in meditation when you see the mind. You see clearly that the mind is not some side effect of the brain. You see the mind, and you know the mind. The Buddha said that the mind released is beautiful, is brilliant, is radiant. So not only are these blissful experiences, they're meaningful experiences as well...."<br><br>Longchen describes from his experience, "This brightness is the result of mind's deconstruction which allows for intense penetration into consciousness. The Brightness can be so intense that it is truly stunning."<br><br>Eckhart Tolle said regarding his 'Inner Body' practise (a form of vipassana-like mindfulness practise), "...The more attention you give it, the clearer and stronger this feeling will become. It will feel as if every cell is becoming more alive, and if you have a strong visual sense, you may get an image of your body becoming luminous."<br><br>And this is not just limited to 'every cell of the body', one who experiences non-duality experiences the intrinsic luminosity in every manifestations, obviously including suffering.<br><br>The Buddha said:<br><br>"Luminous is this mind,<br>Brightly shining, but it is<br>Colored by the attachments<br>That visit it.<br>This unlearned people do not<br>Really understand,<br>And so do not cultivate the<br>Mind.<br><br>Luminous is this mind,<br>Brightly shining,<br>And it is free of the<br>Attachments that visit it.<br>This the noble follower<br>Of the way really understands;<br>So for them there is<br>Cultivation of the mind.<br><br>- Anguttara Nikaya"<br><br>All phenomena are ultimately One Mind, luminous-emptiness inseparable, all are expression of Mind's luminosity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>btw I realised I have strayed very much from the topic of karma.<br><br>Karma and karmic effects are very real in the relative sense... Ultimately karma is empty, not void, but empty in the sense that it is conditioned arising. Many people have a false and nihlistic understanding of 'emptiness'... emptiness is not void, it just means that all things are conditioned arising, dependent originated arising.. with no self-subtance. But empty phenomena is also real -- the suffering and pain we feel from our karma is also real, it is conditioned arising and we can feel it... we are aware of it (luminous-emptiness).<br><br>So we must never never think that karma and karmic effects are false.... it is really very real and therefore we must never accumulate any negative karma... keep the 5 precepts and perform the 10 virtuous deeds.<br><br>We must avoid all that is evil, do all that is good, and purify our minds. That is the teachings of the Buddha.<br><br>p.s. Karma is FAR from being just an 'idea'!! It is the law of Cause &amp; Effect, it is about Conditioned Arising. When there is cause and conditions, consequence and effect inevitably arises! This is an eternal law.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is three periods of karma?<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2e.htm</a><br><br>The Three Periods refer to the past, present and future. This is the characteristic of time in this universe. When you understand the principle governing the past, present and future, then you will understand that causes (or actions) created in the past will bear fruit (or consequences) at some point in time. A phrase in Buddhism says, "Planting seeds of melon leads to harvesting melons; planting seeds of bean leads to harvesting beans". Therefore, we harvest sweet melons when we plant seeds of sweet melon. Similarly, we harvest bitter melons when we plant seeds of bitter melon. We cannot expect to harvest sweet fruits when bitter seeds have been planted, unless we alter the conditions in the process. For example, the only way that we can taste sweet apricots after having planted a wild apricot tree is to graft a stem of a sweet apricot tree on to the wild apricot tree.<br><br>It is the same with human beings. If in the past we have created evil causes by committing evil deeds, then in future we are bound to face with evil retributions. If we wish to receive joyful rewards, then we have to change the causes and conditions[1]. In this regard, learning and practising the Buddha's teachings is the best thing to do. Although we have done wrong in the past, we now realise our mistakes, let bygones be bygones, and from this moment on, do all that are good and virtuous. When we learn and practise the Buddha's teachings diligently, repent our wrong doings, and rectify and create virtuous causes and conditions, we will then reap virtuous rewards in the future.</div>

This is the characteristic of time in this universe. When you understand the principle governing the past, present and future, then you will understand that causes (or actions) created in the past will bear fruit (or consequences) at some point in time. A phrase in Buddhism says, "Planting seeds of melon leads to harvesting melons; planting seeds of bean leads to harvesting beans". Therefore, we harvest sweet melons when we plant seeds of sweet melon. Similarly, we harvest bitter melons when we plant seeds of bitter melon. We cannot expect to harvest sweet fruits when bitter seeds have been planted, unless we alter the conditions in the process. For example, the only way that we can taste sweet apricots after having planted a wild apricot tree is to graft a stem of a sweet apricot tree on to the wild apricot tree.<br><br>It is the same with human beings. If in the past we have created evil causes by committing evil deeds, then in future we are bound to face with evil retributions. If we wish to receive joyful rewards, then we have to change the causes and conditions[1]. In this regard, learning and practising the Buddha's teachings is the best thing to do. Although we have done wrong in the past, we now realise our mistakes, let bygones be bygones, and from this moment on, do all that are good and virtuous. When we learn and practise the Buddha's teachings diligently, repent our wrong doings, and rectify and create virtuous causes and conditions, we will then reap virtuous rewards in the future. </div></blockquote>layered fruition<br>as in Nagasena Bhikkhu teaching to King Milinda<br><br>the process is  like that<br><br>delusion -&gt; fruition -&gt; suffering -&gt; delusion ... and the cycles goes on<br><br>sever the delusion , though fruition will still come , but does not create suffering<br><br>so there are two suffering , Physical and Mental suffering .Which one does Buddhist practice eradicates ?<br><br>Mental Suffering<br><br>Physical Suffering is due to our existence in the human Realm<br><br>Note : We still will have blister when we walk long distance , but its the mental suffering Buddha have overcome<br><br>If Buddha can does that ,so do we<br><br></div>

Imagine your brain getting knocked out and you lose your long term memory. Though it is possible to regain it back, it takes time and therapy.<br><br>Though, there are quite many young children who still have some memory and can what they said is proven to be true -- i.e whatever they remember of their past lives, is later found to be true, and he has no prior knowledge in this present lives.<br><br>Such memory is also available deep in our sub conscious in everybody, but requires techniques (such as meditation or other techniques) to retrieve those memories.</div>

Some people even take dreams as being 'past life memories', of course that would not be very accurate because dreams may just be a recalling of recent events.<br><br>IF the past life memories are accessed through deep meditation, there is NO DOUBT at all that it is accurate, and you can actually go and find out.<br><br>Like I said many times -- past life memories recalled through meditation are NOT vague at all, not at all dream-like.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>NO, no assumption, you are mistaken. I was talking about existence of gravity specifically. Gravity exists and there was no need for research, discourse, experiment to prove existence of gravity.</blockquote>But the example of gravity is completely irrelevant to what are are discussing, as I have explained my previous reply.<br><br><blockquote>That we all know but it has nothing to do with my comment on 'real' and 'existence'. The earth wasn't flat - that is real and the earth exists as a sphere. Before Galileo's 'discoveries or observations', there were people who had already ventured beyond the horizon and didn't fall off the earth! Just like gravity, it took Newton to state the obvious ..... so did Galileo. But if people thought the earth was flat, that was the 'illusion' that science dispell later.</blockquote>It is a fact that people in the past believed that the world was flat. Anyway I was saying, even though Galileo stated his observations, what happened was that he was condemned by the church, and many people chose not to believe.<br><br>Similarly when evidences are being brought forth, not everyone will accept or be even interested to look into the matter, because they hold tightly to their own beliefs and do not want their beliefs to be threatened.<br><br>Even if someone like Galileo were to appear to 'state the obvious' it will not be agreed by every single one.<br><br>And also, everyone can prove rebirth for himself. The Buddha himself taught the scientific method to find out spiritual truths -- meditation. If he taught us a scientific method, gave us the 'telescope/microscope' to look into the depths of our own mind/consciousness, we have absolutely no reason not to undertake the experiment and find out for ourselves. If it has already been experienced by countless others through performing the experiment, we have no reason to reject them and cling dogmatically to our own beliefs, but rather should find out for ourselves.<br><br>Like Ajahn Brahmavamso nicely puts it:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Excerpt from <a href="http://www.bswa.org/modules/icontent/index.php?page=105" rel="nofollow">http://www.bswa.org/modules/icontent/index.php?page=105</a><br><br>Come and See for Yourself<br><br>If you had just one person who had been confirmed as medically dead who could describe to the doctors, as soon as they were revived, what had been said, and done during that period of death, wouldn't that be pretty convincing? When I was doing elementary particle physics there was a theory that required for its proof the existence of what was called the 'W' particle. At the cyclotron in Geneva, CERN funded a huge research project, smashing atoms together with an enormous particle accelerator, to try and find one of these 'W' particles. They spent literally hundreds of millions of pounds on this project. They found one, just one 'W' particle. I don't think they have found another since. But once they found one 'W' particle, the researchers involved in that project were given Nobel prizes for physics. They had proved the theory by just finding the one 'W' particle. That's good science. Just one is enough to prove the theory.<br><br>When it comes to things we don't like to believe, they call just one experience, one clear factual undeniable experience, an anomaly. Anomaly is a word in science for disconcerting evidence that we can put in the back of a filing cabinet and not look at again, because it's threatens our worldview. It undermines what we want to believe. It is threatening to our dogma. However, an essential part of the scientific method is that theories have to be abandoned in favour of the evidence, in respect of the facts. The point is that the evidence for a mind independent of the brain is there. But once we admit that evidence, and follow the scientific method, then many cherished theories, what we call 'sacred cows' will have to be abandoned.<br><br>When we see something that challenges any theory, in science or in religion, we should not ignore the evidence. We have to change the theory to fit the facts. That is what we do in Buddhism. All the Dhamma of the Buddha, everything that he taught, if it does not fit the experience, then we should not accept it. We should not accept the Buddha's words in contradiction of experience. That is clearly stated in the Kālāma Sutta. (AN III, 65) The Buddha said do not believe because it is written in the books, or even if I say it. Don't just believe because it is tradition, or because it sounds right, or because it's comforting to you. Make sure it fits your experience. The existence of mind, independent of the brain, fits experience. The facts are there.<br><br>Sometimes, however, we cannot trust the experts. You cannot trust Ajahn Brahm. You cannot trust the scientific journals. Because people are often biased. Buddhism gives you a scientific method for your practice. Buddhism says, do the experiment and find out for your self if what the Buddha said is true or not. Check out your experience. For example, develop the method to test the truth of past lives, rebirth and reincarnation. Don't just believe it with faith, find out for yourself. The Buddha has given a scientific experiment that you can repeat.<br><br>Until you understand the law of kamma, which is part of Buddhism, kamma is just a theory. Do you believe that there is a God 'up there' who decides when you can be happy or unhappy? Or is everything that happens to you just chance? Your happiness and your suffering in life, your joy, your pain and disappointments, are they deserved? Are you responsible or is it someone else's fault? Is it mere chance that we are rich or poor? Is it bad luck when we are sick and die at a young age? Why? You can find the true answer for yourself. You can experience the law of kamma through deep meditation. When the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, the two knowledge's he realized just before his Enlightenment were the knowledge from experience of the truth of rebirth, and the knowledge from experience of the Law of kamma. This was not theory, not just more thinking, not something worked out from discussions around the coffee table this was realization from deep experience of the nature of mind. You too can have that same experience.<br><br>All religions in the world except Buddhism maintain the existence of a soul. They affirm a real 'self', an 'essence of all being', a 'person', a 'me'. Buddhism says there is no self! Who is right? What is this 'ghost in the machine'? Is it a soul, is it a being, or is it a process? What is it? When the Buddha said that there is no one in here, he never meant that to be just believed, he meant that to be experienced. The Buddha said, as a scientific fact, that there is no 'self'. But like any scientific fact, it has to be experienced each one for themselves, paccattam veditabbo viÃ±Ã±ūhī. Many of you chant those Pāli words every day. It is basic scientific Buddhism. You have to keep an open mind. You don't believe there is 'no self', you don't believe there is a 'self' both beliefs are dogmatism. Keep an open mind until you complete the experiment. The experiment is the practice of sila, samādhi and paÃ±Ã±a, (virtue, meditation and insight). The experiment is Buddhist practice. Do the same experimental procedures that the Buddha did under the Bodhi tree. Repeat it and see if you get the same results. The result is called Enlightenment.</span></div>
