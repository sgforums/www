              <p>You can chant either one, as you wish. For me, I chant Amitabha and GuanShi Yin Pusa on alternate days. It does not matter how many times you chant (3 times, 10 times or 1000 times). éš�ç¼˜å¿µä½›ã€‚What it matters is you must concentrate, it is better not to think of other things while you are chanting. Of course, this will happen but you must be able to bring your thoughts back to chanting, don't let your thoughts wander too far off.</p>
              <p>You can chant anywhere except in the toilet and bedroom (out of respect). Of course you can concentrate better when you are chanting infront of any Buddha. You can chant Amitabha infront of GuanShiYin and chant GuanShiYin infront of Amtibaha, they are all the same. When you are unable to chant aloud, just chant in your heart.</p>
              <p>There are few Buddhists like me who chant and experience something extraordinary. It happened to me once only, there was once I heard chanting of Amitbaha (all are male voice) coming from above (people around me did not hear except me, not CD for sure),  and it lasted for about 5 to 10 minutes, not too loud and not too soft, soothing to the ear. I thought I had gone mad and hope that the chanting would stop. I dare not to tell anyone about this. Till lately, I understand from a Buddhist who also experienced the same thing. She told me she heard a master said this was å¿µä½›çš„æ„Ÿåº”. If I have known I would not hope the chanting to stop then.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm not attached to it. I share my experience here is to let anybody who experience this, do not be afraid. It is å¿µä½›çš„æ„Ÿåº”. The chanting I heard must have come from the Pureland.</p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing your experiences.</p>
              <p>I believe ones chant for oneself and to the loves one.</p>
              <p>Hope that this thread will not turn into someone calling ones preaching.</p>
              <p>I have a friend's wife, she got 3rd eye...one day, I met my friend and his wife. We chatted....etc....Next day, my friend told me his wife saw 2 buddha (one each) at my shoulder, whenever I walk, they just floated behind me.</p>
              <p>I will make it a habit to chant...to have a peaceful mind and thoughts and hopefully can control my anger...recently anger very explosive...hurting my families members heart.</p>

              <p>I have both Faith (believe strongly that there is Pureland) and Vows to be reborn there but I always have doubt whether I am qualified to go there. Will my doubt affect my chance of going there ?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes, it will affect. <br><br>Master Yin Guang says:<br><br>"In the Practice of reciting the Buddha’s name, our Faith and Aspiration [Vow] are emphasised. If one has Faith and Aspiration, even if one has not attained single-mindedness (in Practice) yet, one can still obtain rebirth in [Amitabha Buddha’s] Pure Land. However, if one has attained single-mindedness, and yet lacks Faith and Aspiration, one will not be reborn in Pure Land. Many worldly people emphasise being single-minded, not emphasising Faith and Aspiration, thus missing what is essential. Furthermore, when they have yet to attain single-mindedness, they doubt and fear not being able to obtain rebirth in Pure Land, which is completely opposite of true Faith and profound Aspiration. Therefore, it is beneficial to increase Faith and Aspiration, till single-mindedness is achieved. This is good mindfulness. If we fail to achieve single-mindedness and thus always doubt whether we can be reborn in Pure Land, this becomes bad mindfulness. This should not be not known!"<br><br>So very important to have firm faith and vows. I too have the same doubt as you, i think this is due to having not enough faith and/or vows. <br><br>Check out this thread on faith, vows and practice...<br><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/229">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/229</a></p>

              <p><br>Hi simpo_,</p>
              <p>Thanks for sharing the interesting article. The new Ascension process will be different from the past, which Jesus, Buddha and many other non-famous people around the world (of various forms of spirituality) in the past went through, as they had to leave behind their physical bodies on Earth realm. Though Jesus transformed to lightbody directly.</p>
              <p>This time round, it'll be very different, and will not be limited to just a very small minority of people. This is the reason that a no. of people are back here now, by choice, to assist with the process, even though they no longer need to experience physical lives.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I know you're a good man with good intentions to guide others in the path of Buddhism. My comments were just to highlight that people, in general, practising any faith of their choice need to do it with real commitment and sincerity, in order to achieve true spirituality. Many people just practise a faith for various personal reasons, but are unable to consistently apply the core essence of the faith in their everyday lives, so true spirituality will still be out of reach for them in this lifetime.</p>
              <p>This lifetime is especially precious for everyone. It has the very rare Opportunity to help one fast forward by an extremely huge quantum leap in terms of spirituality, if used properly. Waste this lifetime's Opportunity and one will have to stay on the same long, slow, tiring path of Cycles. I was not discouraging people from leaning towards Buddhism or any other faith.</p>
              <p>I'll end this post with words from Maitreya for everyone who is willing to believe: "<em>If you cannot be the example, do not teach the words - for they are hollow and without meaning.</em>"</p>

                              achieve true spirituality. Many people just practise a faith for
                              various personal reasons, but are unable to consistently apply the
                              core essence of the faith in their everyday lives, so
                              true spirituality will still be out of reach for them in this
                              lifetime.</p>
              <p>This lifetime is especially precious for everyone. It has the
                              very rare Opportunity to help one fast forward by
                              an extremely huge quantum leap in terms of spirituality,
                              if used properly. Waste this lifetime's Opportunity and one
                              will have to stay on the same long, slow, tiring path of Cycles. I
                              was not discouraging people from leaning towards Buddhism or any
                              other faith.</p>

              <p>Hi Rainbow Jigsaw of Life,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
              <p>Years ago, I too have dreams about the body changes. In fact, in the past, i have dream that describe to me new energetic chakra systems... and prototype 'resurrection' system.</p>
              <p>However, i truly believe that Buddhism is a complete path in itself. As described in the article, the rainbowbody 'ascension' were not ancient accounts but happen in the recent year. What does this show? It shows the authenticity and completeness of that particular Buddhist path.</p>
              <p>My understanding is that rainbowbody is not possible without the complete resolution of karma... and that is only possible with very deep level of realisation and enlightenment. Not something that people like you and i can easily achieve.</p>
              <p>My understanding is that the planet is moving towards 4th-5th density. This level is more about service-to-others and morality.. However, especially 4th density, imo, is that they do not require enlightenment per se. I believe most lightworkers have this level of understanding... it is more about being good..light and love... but not much on non-dual level kind of understanding.</p>
              <p>So, i do not think it is appropriate to lump new-ascension/lightworks with spiritual paths leading towards realisation. Sorry if i sounded blunt and i feel the need to get the message clear.</p>
              <p>My understanding is that Enlightened Being are mostly beyond the 5th density. One channeled Being Aaron who was an arhat in the last life is a 6th density Being. Beyond 6th density, there is no mental body and such beings cannot communicate with the 3rd density Beings.</p>
              <p>I will update this post later as i am busy at the moment.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion...</p>

              <p>I can understand your disagreement, and shall not debate over this here.</p>
              <p>What I can share did not come through dreams or hearsay, and is meant to be shared with all who are ready to know, regardless of faith. There's a huge limitation in written accounts. I can understand your admiration of Aaron, but the Universe is far more complex that what he has experienced, or what others' experiences had with him. Earth has a very long history of good and positive spirituality, way before the time of Jesus and Buddha. :) </p>
              <p>There is a lot of sharing of articles on "I AM Presence" by forumers. In reality, once that "I AM Presence" or "connection within" or "soul connection" can be achieved, whether at times or all the time, nothing is impossible on our physical Earth realm. It's only the conscious mind that limits what can be done or not.</p>
              <p>I foresee there could be certain disagreements by forumers over what I'm saying here, especially on the 'academic technicalities' of "I AM Presence", but I'll just leave it here for all who are open. Academic debates serve no real purpose, other than feed the Self Ego. Do it, experience it, learn it first-hand, not just talk empty/hollow talk without actual experience. That's the only way everyone can truly learn. Whether people wish to believe Maitreya's words (about hollow words) which I shared in my previous post, I leave it to all to believe or not.</p>
              <p>Everyone should aim to develop and experience their full spiritual potential, and experience for themselves what they can really do, and not limit their potential based on negative programming of the mind. When people have achieved their full spiritual potential, they will be able to do much much more good for mankind and raise the positivity in our world today. Currently, there's either too much passivity in terms of positive actions, or too much activity in negative actions.</p>
              <p>However, I do agree that Buddhists should focus on realisation, and the other core essences of Buddhism. It will help to remove the negativity built up in people.</p>

              <p>What do you mean 'nothing is impossible on our physical Earth realm'?</p>
              <p>It is true that once you have access to the I AM Presence, there may be some of those who simply see the non-local Source as a place for them to tap mystical power over conventional reality. However, then they miss the more important part of spiritual practice which is of deepening their insight and enlightenment. That means they tap the source not for enlightenment, but for mystical powers. My understanding is that this would be a distraction from the main goal (full enlightenment and liberation), maybe it can be of some help in life, but not to over-emphasize on this aspect.</p>
              <p>p.s. this is what Lao Tzu in Tao Te Ching meant by 'Mysterious and still deeper into the mysterious core, is the gateway of all miracles':</p>
              <p>The DAO that can be expressed<br> is not the eternal DAO.<br> The name that can be named<br> is not the eternal name.</p>
              <p>“Non-existence” I call the beginning of Heaven and Earth.<br> “Existence” I call the mother of individual beings.</p>
              <p>Therefore does the direction towards non-existence<br> lead to the sight of the miraculous essence,<br> the direction towards existence<br> to the sight of spatial limitations.</p>
              <p>Both are one in origin<br> and different only in name.<br>In its unity it is called the mysterious.<strong><br> Mysterious and still deeper into the mysterious core<br>is the gateway of all miracles.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. the I AM Presence* I am talking about here is not some sub-conscious part of psyche or something (that would be the 8th Consciousness in Buddhism), rather it is the fundamental and ever-present essence of one's Being, the undeniable sense of Presence, Existence, Awareness - the ground of Being and Knowing. Anyway this is not 'academic technicality', this is my current experience and I am just mentioning to make sure my terms are not misunderstood.</p>
              <p>Bestseller book 'The Power of Now' by Eckhart Tolle available in almost all major bookstores in Singapore is a good guide to get in touch with the 'I AM Presence'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*the I AM Presence/Eternal Witness is in mine and simpo's terminlogy distinguished from the 'soul' or 'higher self' which is a type of consciousness - particularly a form of subconsciousness that serves as a 'storehouse' or 'alaya consciounsess', however terms are interchangeable or in other words what you call 'higher self' may not be what we mean by 'higher self' etc, as long as we understand each other, that's good enough - these are two different 'realities' that can be experienced and are very different and hence must be distinguished between each other:</p>

              <p><em>Had i not come back to Buddhism, I will be

              <p><em>Sometime after that, I came back to Buddhism 
                          and have
                                                  experiences of the non-dual. Even so, for a 
                          period of time, i was
                                                  wondering, should i 'base' on the experience of 
                          the Alaya or should
                                                  i continue with the non-dual practice. It took 
                          me a long while to
                                                  realise that at the state of the Alaya, there 
                          isn't any realisation
                                                  of the non-dual. That state is seems as a 
                          supreme self (with vast
                                                  information/knowledge) but there isn't any 
                          understanding of the
                                                  non-dual nature of existence. Because of not 
                          realising that
                                                  non-duality is the basis of reality, 'it' 
                          functions in a certain
                                                  manner.</em></p>
              <p><em>If all these is very confusing, please 
                          disregard this post.</em></p>
              <p><em>Just want to stress that Buddhism is 
                          extremely profound and

              <p>However, i have the good fortune and enough humbleness to acknowledge that perhaps there are deeper truths when Thusness point out to me that there are deeper stages to the mystery. And i am grateful for that...</p>
              <p>As for the Rainbow body, i can only regurgitate what i have read elsewhere. The attainment of the rainbowbody originate from the teaching of Dzogchen. Just in case someone think that this is a recent teaching, it has been stated that this special set of teaching dates back to ancient time into a time before our current historical Buddha. It has been stated that the teaching is at least 15000 years old.. dating to an even more ancient Buddha known as Tonpa Shenrap. Also, this set of teaching which focusses on maintaining the non-dual Presence is being taught not only on Earth. It is said to be taught in 13 star systems to humans as well as non-human sentient beings.</p>
              <p>I can roughly understand how the Rainbow body is possible through the deep non-dual, luminousity and emptiness experiences and insight... especially the maha experience but i will keep the judgement on the erring side. :)</p>

              <p>At the I AM Presence level of understanding, one can think that he/she can be recieving information, blessing etc from a higher source that is beyond himself/herself. We may also use visualisation to imagine a Light that will descend upon our body.. blessing and illuminating us. We will think that we are recieving information from some outside higher sources. During those times, i had visions of a source light illuminating me... </p>
              <p>On hindsight, those are interpreted visions... not direct experiences. At I AM, one is a small self with a big self beyond...</p>
              <p>At non-dual, the small self does not exist... no one is there... There is only awareness and its manifestation... even if we interact, knowingness knows that no one is there... this frees the awareness from the grasping of self. This is the unveiling of the mystery... no one is there... the source and the creation(manifestation) are 'merged/linked'. It becomes obvious.. knowingness will think.. why wasn't it seen in the first place... it is obvious. The knowingness understands a new insight that was previously shrouded by a belief that one was born into.</p>
              <p>In another word, simpo does not exist truly... it is awareness getting identified with the name, the bodily experience and all conditions attached to. In the same way, all other persons do not inherently exist, each one is a different experience of the same awareness. This may sound scary to the ego/self... but is actually liberating...</p>
              <p>For the ability to interact in no-one mode, there is a need for a deepening insight of the immediate Presence.</p>

              <p>Thanks you! This is a good thread even it is as simple creating an affinity with Buddhism.</p>
              <p>With practising loving kindness, in this life,, you will discover you start disliking people and things less,reaping the benefit of not creating enmity through your prejudice, however, whether people dislike you any less, that's a different issue!  Heh! Heh!</p>
              <p>It is also said with practising loving kindness, one dies without being confused in mind.</p>
              <p>Also you chant intensely enough, you will discover the chanting also continues into your sleep! Goes to reason, you probably can also chant in your death!  </p>
              <p>However, the most importance is awareness, in this instance, the beginning and continuation of vigilance !  Just as we can be waylaid in our daily lives, distracted by this or that, or let me finish the business of this first before I go round to focus on my practise.</p>
              <p>If we can practise vigilance during our life time, with a lifetime  of practice, then we stand a better chance of not dying confused or being distracted in death. We simply let go.  </p>
