              <p>I think there is nothing wrong with Fame, Fortune and Family (3F). I don't think that Buddhism is not against such pursue especially in layperson life. However, what Buddha taught was not to be too attached to 3F as it our existence is for this sole purpose with a gain or loss mentality. We are bless with the 3F is due to our past good karma. The difference between us and Bodhisattva is the latter always give with a joyful and thankful heart.</p>
              <p>Hence I would like to encourage everybody with Nichiren 3 treasures quote:</p>

              <p>As said above, Buddhists don't proselytize to those who simply aren't interested. Therefore we don't cause any pain.
                                                      
                                                      We simply mind our own practice, and help those who have an interest to progress to find the freedom and insights that other fellow practitioners found through their practice.</p>
              <p>If someone is not interested in the total liberation and awareness the Buddha taught, we rather save our energy and spend it on our own practice for our own benefit.</p>
              <p>Sad to say, almost all my friends aren't interested in these matters, and I'm not doing anything about it. I am not even trying. I am not being selfish - just being realistic about what could possibly come out of it.. Very much similar to how Shakyamuni Buddha after enlightenment wanted to stay in the forest for the rest of his life and did not have any intention to teach thinking that nobody will understand what he is going to talk about. (A Brahma later invited him to teach by doing his best to convince him that <em>some</em> will get it)</p>
              <p>Maybe this will change in the future, maybe one day I will try to start convincing someone that true liberation and realization into the ultimate nature of reality is actually possible. Who knows, it's all within the realm of possibility. But I am certain I will not go more than simply mentioning what I know, from experience, is possible... the rest is totally up to them.</p>

              <p>Hi SoulDivine</p>
              <p>Most people began their cultivation due to family or own problem. The problem maybe related to illness, work related, money, family unrestless and etc. All these problem arising because of our desire for a better outcome. Of course, there will be a minority who seek spiritual cultivation out of curiousity. To me this are the pushing factor.</p>
              <p>When they begin to see that through the practise, the problem was resolved or improve. They start to have confident in the practice. That's spark the beginning of a faith journey.</p>
