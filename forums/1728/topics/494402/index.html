              Development Model Worth Emulating </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Dr Omalpe Sobitha Mahathera
              19 July 2017 IDN InDepthNews</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">ENBILIPITIYA,
              Sri Lanka (IDN) – There will be many answers to the question: which is the
              country where the happiest people live? In response many famous, developed
              nations will come to mind, but you will be surprised that the name of a
              little-known country could be the right answer to this question. It is Bhutan,
              the wonderful and amazing country that beats all others on the happiness index.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bhutan
              has been so identified following a worldwide survey on Gross National Happiness
              (GNH) – not Gross National Product (GDP). Its capital is Thimpu, which reminds
              us of the peace talks held there between the Sri Lanka Government and
              Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) separatists in 1985.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Recently
              I found the opportunity to fulfil a long-cherished hope of finding out more
              about this wondrous country, which recalls the island of Uthurukuru mentioned
              in Buddhist literature. The experiences I had in Bhutan proved that my visit
              there was truly my good fortune.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bhutan,
              with a population of 750,000 people, is located more than 7,000 metres above
              sea level in the Himalayan region, near the world’s highest point, Mount
              Everest. The country has a cold climate (-18 to -7 °C) and the sky above Bhutan
              is always filled with white clouds rising above the mountain peaks surrounding
              the country. Human settlements are located some distance away from each other.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              foreign tourist visiting in the country practically finds himself/herself on a
              Buddhist pilgrimage because all the important places one sees are Buddhist
              temples and monasteries. Tourists are drawn towards the many big and small
              temples which have been built since the arrival of Vajrayana Buddhism in the
              15th century, and most of which stand on hilltops surrounded by thick jungle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Visitors
              are overjoyed by the wonders of the places when listening to the tour guide.
              They are visited by Buddhists to engage in worshipping the Buddha according to
              their traditions and also by non-Buddhists who go there to enjoy a calm and
              relaxed experience, respecting the sanctity of the temples.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tourists
              take their own time in visiting the places, free of the distractions that can
              be found in Sri Lanka, for example, where all types of unscrupulous individuals
              attempt to cheat them by selling different items or becoming self-appointed
              tour guides to extort money from them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Although
              there are various items on sale at shops near the places visited by tourists in
              Bhutan no one tries to force items on tourists. They are allowed to pick and
              chose whatever they wish and prices are fixed so there is no bargaining, unlike
              in Sri Lanka where vendors seek to hoodwink visitors by selling items at a
              price higher than at which they are sold to locals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              restless behaviour of some Sri Lankan ‘bhikkus’ and lay persons whenever a
              group of local or foreign pilgrims visit a place of worship has become a joke.
              The reason is that all of them want to exploit visitors and line their pockets.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              is no selling of tickets or charging of any fee to visit any place of worship
              in Bhutan. Nor are beggars or children running behind visitors and pestering
              them for money or food to be seen. If someone decides on their own account to
              give the children something, they are very shy to accept but eventually do so
              and thank you in English.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is most unfortunate that begging has become a ‘tradition’ in places of Buddhist
              worship in Sri Lanka. Needless to say it tarnishes the image of Buddhism in the
              eyes of foreigners.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              are both bhikkus (monks) and bhikkunis (nuns) in Bhutan – 30,000 bhikkus and
              18,000 bhikkunis. Becoming a bhikku or bhikkuni is voluntary and temporary
              ordination is very popular in Bhutan. Entering the Order of the Sangha, even
              for a short period in life, is considered essential. Children are trained to
              adapt themselves to life in hermitages from the age of seven.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              expression “surprising but true” comes to the mind a thousand times when touring
              Bhutan. It is surprising, for example, that heaps of garbage are nowhere to be
              seen, neither in villages nor towns. There are no bags of rubbish by the
              roadside or hanging from lamp posts. Garbage bins are kept in specified places
              but are not overfilled making the rubbish visible from the outside.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">However,
              it is in moral conduct and an ethical way of living that the Bhutanese are far
              above all other societies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              government restricted cigarette smoking on and off until 2015 when a total ban
              was imposed on tobacco production and the manufacture and smoking of
              cigarettes. Foreigners are allowed to bring a limited number of cigarettes
              (200) with them and special places are allocated for them in hotels for
              smoking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Strict
              laws are also enforced on the consumption of alcohol. No alcohol imports are
              allowed, the sale of alcohol is banned in the vicinity of temples, schools,
              hospitals, universities and community centres, and all alcohol shops are closed
              every Tuesday.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Cattle
              are a treasure for the Bhutanese who make use of them in a very meaningful way.
              In addition to being a source for the production of milk, ghee, cheese and
              butter, cattle are used for agricultural purposes in the rural areas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is an example to us in Sri Lanka that, in accordance with the Brahmana Dhamma
              Sutra of the Majjima Nikaya, the Bhutanese show due consideration for the
              welfare of cattle which help the people in their sustenance and livelihood.
              Cattle slaughter has been banned throughout Bhutan and it is a common sight to
              see cattle roaming freely on the streets.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              those addicted to the consumption of meat, it is imported, but during the first
              and fourth month of every year, meat consumption is completely banned, because
              these two months are considered religiously important based on the lunar
              calendar in Bhutanese culture. This mercy shown to animals reminds us of a
              similar law introduced by Sinhala King Amandagamini (67-79 AD).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Something
              else that amazes foreign tourists is that no poor huts and shanties are to be
              seen anywhere when passing small villages on the way to main towns like Paro,
              Punakha, Thronsa and Mongar. located hundreds of kilometres away from the
              capital Thimpu. And there are no helpless and unfortunate persons on pavements
              or at bus stops anywhere in the country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Every
              citizen has a permanent house built according to state-approved plans, which
              are drafted according to national cultural standards and artistic designs. The
              result is that while all houses almost look alike, they might be even mistaken
              for temples because of their beautiful designs and carvings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              three most important factors that bind the Bhutanese and contribute to their
              unity and harmonious living are king, country and religion. It is compulsory to
              display pictures of the king and the royal family prominently in every house,
              government and private establishment, hotel, hostel and temple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              government of Bhutan is not interested in attracting foreign tourists at any
              cost. Hence, when applying for a visa, would-be tourists have to comply with a
              number of rules and regulations designed to prevent troublemakers and dubious
              characters from entering the country and corrupting the people of Bhutan. In
              fact, up to 1974, the only foreigners allowed to enter the country were those
              invited for specific purposes; others were allowed only after 1974.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bhutan
              communicates with the outside world via two government-owned airline companies;
              no other airlines are allowed into the country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">No
              foreign tourist or groups of tourists are allowed to roam freely, and their attire
              and behaviour should not violate the country’s cultural norms. As a result,
              every tourist should register with a government-approved company and should
              travel with an authorised tour guide. A special examination is held for tour
              guides who should always be dressed in national costume and observe national
              and institutional customs when they are guiding tourists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              rulers of Bhutan are teaching us Sri Lankans a far-sighted lesson by giving
              priority to protecting society’s moral standards and its physical and mental
              health rather than earning foreign exchange through tourism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              thinking about Bhutan we are compelled to question the widely accepted criteria
              of development. Economists and social scientists – as well as politicians and
              the majority of us – consider that acquiring more and more physical resources
              and increasing personal incomes is the road to happiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Consequently
              we are focused solely on reaching economic targets, having entered a dream
              world via theories based on per capita income and foreign-exchange reserves. We
              are engaged in a relentless, tiring rat race towards so-called progress,
              symbolised by skyscrapers, highways, high speed trains, luxury vehicles,
              palace-like buildings, and so on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mesmerised
              by this mirage, we have become so selfish and ruthless that we are ignoring not
              only ethical living and moral standards but also obligations towards our
              parents, as demonstrated by what is happening in our country and the rest of
              the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              people of Bhutan are the living example on this earth that happiness alone is
              wealth as taught by the Buddha. The time has now come for us to realise that
              the true criterion of a happy country is where the people, without being
              trapped in unlimited desires, have fulfilled their basic needs and lead relaxed
              and healthy lives both physically and mentally, spreading goodwill among
              everyone. Bhutan has already set this powerful example for the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "Calibri",sans-serif;         '>It is not political ideology but the Buddha’s
              incomparable teaching which has brought about this unique state of happiness in
              Bhutan.</span></p>
