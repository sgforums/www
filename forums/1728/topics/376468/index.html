              <p>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the <a id="ayojjhans" name="ayojjhans">Ayojjhans</a> on the banks of the <a id="ganges" name="ganges">Ganges River</a>.
              There he addressed the monks: "Monks, suppose that a large glob of foam
              were floating down this Ganges River, and a man with good eyesight were
              to see it, observe it, &amp; appropriately examine it. To him — seeing
              it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it — it would appear
              empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in a
              glob of foam? In the same way, a monk sees, observes, &amp;
              appropriately examines any form that is past, future, or present;
              internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or
              near. To him — seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining
              it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance
              would there be in form?</p>

              when it's raining in fat, heavy drops — a water bubble were to appear
              &amp; disappear on the water, and a man with good eyesight were to see
              it, observe it, &amp; appropriately examine it. To him — seeing it,

              of the hot season a mirage were shimmering, and a man with good

              him — seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it — it
              would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would
              there be in a mirage? In the same way, a monk sees, observes, &amp;

              it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance
              would there be in perception?</p>
              <p>"<a id="heartwood" name="heartwood">Now suppose</a> that a man
              desiring heartwood, in quest of heartwood, seeking heartwood, were to
              go into a forest carrying a sharp ax. There he would see a large banana
              tree: straight, young, of enormous height. He would cut it at the root
              and, having cut it at the root, would chop off the top. Having chopped
              off the top, he would peel away the outer skin. Peeling away the outer
              skin, he wouldn't even find sapwood, to say nothing of heartwood. Then
              a man with good eyesight would see it, observe it, &amp; appropriately
              examine it. To him — seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately
              examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what
              substance would there be in a banana tree? In the same way, a monk
              sees, observes, &amp; appropriately examines any fabrications that are
              past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle;
              common or sublime; far or near. To him — seeing them, observing them,

              magician's apprentice were to display a magic trick at a major
              intersection, and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe it,
              &amp; appropriately examine it. To him — seeing it, observing it, &amp;

              substance: for what substance would there be in a magic trick? In the
              same way, a monk sees, observes, &amp; appropriately examines any
              consciousness that is past, future, or present; internal or external;

              consciousness?</p>
              <p>"Seeing thus, the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones grows
              disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with
              perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with
              consciousness. Disenchanted, he grows dispassionate. Through
              dispassion, he's released. With release there's the knowledge,
              'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled,
              the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>
              <div class="freeverse">Form is like a glob of foam;
              feeling, a bubble;
              perception, a mirage;
              fabrications, a banana tree;
              consciousness, a magic trick —
              	this has been taught
              	by the Kinsman of the Sun.
              However you observe them,
              appropriately examine them,
              they're empty, void
              	to whoever sees them
              	appropriately.
              
              Beginning with the body
              as taught by the One
              with profound discernment:
              when abandoned by three things
              	— life, warmth, &amp; consciousness —
              form is rejected, cast aside.
              When bereft of these
              it lies thrown away,
              	senseless,
              	a meal for others.
              That's the way it goes:
              it's a magic trick,
              an idiot's babbling.
              It's said to be
              	a murderer.<a id="t1" class="noteTag" name="t1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.095.than.html#n1">1</a> No substance here
              is found.
              
              Thus a monk, persistence aroused,
              should view the aggregates
              by day &amp; by night,
              	mindful,
              	alert;
              should discard all fetters;
              should make himself
              	his own refuge;
              should live as if
              his head were on fire —
              	in hopes of the state
              	with no falling away.</div>

              <p>Commentary by Glen Wallis in "Basic Teachings of the Buddha":</p>
                  <p>Practicing the Sabba Sutta, "The All," we become adept at recognizing the way perception unfolds. We start to see clearly the interrelationship of what we had erroneously taken to be purely separate events. My eyes, the act of seeing, and the forms that I see; my ears, the act of hearing, and the sounds that I hear; my nose, smelling, and scents, and so forth, suddenly appear to be a single fluid event. Where does one aspect end and the other begin? One consequence of internalizing the Sabba Sutta is that we begin to feel at home within our sensorium. We realize that this sensory field is where we have already been all along: right here. Where else could we ever be? Now, from within this perspective, we have what the Buddha calls "good vision," and so can "reflect on" and "carefully examine" those appearances. What do we see about the nature of all that arises? Of course, I don't need to tell you. Just look! Listen! Smell! Feel! Taste! Think! This kind of looking is called "direct seeing" or "Careful examination."</p>
                  <p>In the present sutta, the Buddha is sitting with some of his followers on the banks of the Ganges River. Seeing a ball of foam floating up onto the riverbank, he reflects that, contrary to immediate appearances, all forms are fundamentally no different from this ball of foam. What is the nature of this ball of foam? It is, on closer examination, discovered to be "empty, hollow, and insubstantial." And all other foams -- what is their nature? When considered more carefully than our rapid everyday perception allows -- we might, for instance, require a powerful microscope -- they, too, are "empty, hollow, and insubstantial." The Buddha's insight on seeing the ball of foam inspires him to make four further such similies: feeling is like a water bubble; perception is like a shimmering mirage; conceptual fabrications are like a woodless core; cognizance is like a magical illusion.</p>
                  <p>It is important to note that the Buddha is not denying the reality of each of these processes. He is merely clarifying the nature of their realness. In our everyday speech, don't we use "real" to indicate qualities of absoluteness, continuity, solidity, fixedness, and so forth? That sensation you feel on touching a hot cup of coffee is a real, felt sensation. There is no denying the fact. But in what sense is it real? The Buddha's examples seem intentionally to run counter to our common assumptions about the nature of "Real." Like a water bubble, a feeling of "hot" arises when the necessary conditions are present; persists as long as these conditions hold together; dissolves as those conditions weaken; and disappears as they disintegrate. Why is this insight important? You can do an experiment. Practice viewing appearances, perceptions, feelings, conceptualizations, and thoughts in the manner recommended by the Buddha here. Is your habitual way of reacting altered at all? What qualities of being become present when you see forms as balls of foams and thoughts as magical illusions? When you view reality in this manner, what then?</p>

              <h2>On the No-self Characteristic (Samyutta-Nikaya 22.59)</h2>
              <p>Thus it was heard by me. At one time the Blessed One was living in
              the deer park of Isipatana near Benares. There, indeed, the Blessed One
              addressed the group of five monks.</p>
              <p>"Form, O monks, is not-self; if form were self, then form would not
              lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding form: 'May my form be
              thus, may my form not be thus'; and indeed, O monks, since form is
              not-self, therefore form leads to affliction and it does not obtain
              regarding form: 'May my form be thus, may my form not be thus.'</p>
              <p>"Feeling, O monks, is not-self; if feeling were self, then feeling
              would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding feeling:
              'May my feeling be thus, may my feeling not be thus'; and indeed, O
              monks, since feeling is not-self, therefore feeling leads to affliction
              and it does not obtain regarding feeling: 'May my feeling be thus, may
              my feeling not be thus.'</p>
              <p>"Perception, O monks, is not-self; if perception were self, then
              perception would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding
              perception: 'May my perception be thus, may my perception not be thus';
              and indeed, O monks, since perception is not-self, therefore,
              perception leads to affliction and it does not obtain regarding
              perception: 'May my perception be thus, may my perception not be thus.'</p>
              <p>"Mental formations, O monks, are not-self; if mental formations were
              self, then mental formations would not lead to affliction and it should
              obtain regarding mental formations: 'May my perception be thus, may my
              mental formations not be thus'; and indeed, O monks, since mental
              formations are not-self, therefore, mental formations lead to
              affliction and it does not obtain regarding mental formations: 'May my
              mental formations be thus, may my mental formations not be thus.'</p>
              <p>"Consciousness, O monks, is not-self; if consciousness were self,
              then consciousness would not lead to affliction and it should obtain
              regarding consciousness: 'May my consciousness be thus, may my
              consciousness not be thus'; and indeed, O monks, since consciousness is
              not-self, therefore, consciousness leads to affliction and it does not
              obtain regarding consciousness: 'May my consciousness be thus, may my

              <p>Commentary by Glen Wallis in "Basic Teachings of the Buddha":</p>
              <p>In the previous suttas, the Buddha tells us that in order to resolve our persistent lack of ease, it is crucial that we come to know for ourselves the nature of reality. The means of this direct, extradoctrinal, extra-authoritarian knowledge, he further tells us, is immediately available: knowing requires that we learn to attend to the sensorium, to the sense doors -- the modes of immediate, moment-to-moment presence. Once we turn our attention to the sensorium and become accustomed to attending to matters as they unfold right there, the Buddha asks us to push our insight even deeper. He asks us to observe that the reality given through these modes of perception is analogous to a mirage, magical illusion, or woodless core. As we become accustomed to seeing in this manner, it dawns on us that the khandhas, the apparent constituents that make up our (apparent) personalities, are engaged in a dance with shifting, changing, indeterminate, phantomlike entities. It might be that, with this insight, the practitioner now has a sense of attainment, a sense of having finally resolved the important matter of understanding the nature of reality. There is a sense that "I" have understood, that "I" know. This sense of accomplishment gives rise to a feeling of stability, as if there were a firm, fixed position from which "I" look out at the world, seeing that it is really like a dream. Seeing this condition of reality, "I" nonetheless feel constant and real and not at all dreamlike.</p>
              <p>It is precisely at this phase of clarity that the Buddha pushes us to deepen our insight. In the present sutta, he is speaking to the "group of five mendicants." These five men are mentioned in the introduction as the group of mendicants who had practiced with the Buddha early on in his quest but had eventually abandoned him as a backslider. We might imagine, then, that these five men had realized the ephemeral nature of reality. Nonetheless, the Buddha finds it necessary to point out to them something more: there is no self, no actual "I," behind or within this process of realizing, knowing, or simply being. So the fact that the Buddha is speaking this sutta to advanced practitioners may be seen as indicative of the deeply counterintuitive idea of no-self. Our being in the world -- our very way of experiencing, thinking, and speaking -- wants to reject such a notion as simply absurd or simply wrong, doesn't it? If nothing else, no-self certainly runs counter to our normal way of thinking and being. As an experiment, just try to speak without pronouns, or think and experience for a few moments devoid of a persistent underlying sense of "I, me, or mine" doing the experiencing.</p>
              <p>By observing in turn what which we call "experience," "thinking," and "language," we may also gain a vantage point for understanding the Buddha's counterintuitive teaching of no-self. When you carefully examine your actual experience, thinking, and language, isn't each instance run through with the kind of shifting indeterminacy best described as "miragelike"? Just take a look. If "miragelike" is the case, then what sort of "self," not to mention idea or definition of "self," can be preserved in light of this insight? It would be useful to reflect at this point on what it is precisely that you are calling "self." The Buddha presumes his interlocutors hold a notion of self that is by definition self-contained, undivided, integral, individual. As such, the self would be a powerful controlling agent. Is that the case? Again, just look at your immediate experience. If what we call "the self" is not the driving force behind experience, if it is not an agent (from the Greek, agein, "to drive"), then what is it that we are referring to with the term "Self"? Is anyone there?</p>
