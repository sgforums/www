              <p>Wiping Out âlaya’s (storage or relative mind) Self-Evidencing to Reveal One Reality ânanda’s Discrimination </p>
              <p>Ananda said: World Honoured One, the King of the Law has preached the nature of causal enlightenment (Bodhi) which is always present in the ten directions and which is beyond birth and death; does this differ from the concept of primordial profundity, according to the doctrine of Kapila and that of a true Ego pervading everywhere according to heterodox ascetics who cover their heads with ashes and dust? The Buddha, while on Lanka mountain, once said to Mahamati: ìHeretics always speak of natural existence but I preach causes and conditions which are beyond the stage they have reached.Now as I look into this nature of Enlightenment, it is self existent, above birth and death and beyond all falsehood and inversion. There seem to be neither (your) causes and conditions nor their natural existence. Will you please teach us so that we shall not fall into heresies but win the bright nature of wonderful enlightened True Mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wiping Out ânanda’s Discrimination </p>
              <p>Rooting out the self as such </p>
              <p>The Buddha said: I have expediently revealed the truth to you, yet you do not awaken to it but mistake it for being the self as such. Ananda, if it is the self as such, it should show clearly that its substance is the self. Now look into this wondrous seeing and see what is its self; do you mean that light, darkness, clarity or obstruction is its self? Ananda, if light is its self you should not see darkness and if the void you should not see obstruction. If darkness is its self, the nature of your seeing should cease to exist when there is light; if so, why do you still see light? Ananda said: If so, the nature of this wondrous seeing is not the self as such. I now guess that it is created by cause and condition but I am still not clear about it. I pray the Tathagata to teach me how this accords with the nature of cause and condition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eliminating cause and condition </p>
              <p>The Buddha said: You now speak of cause and condition Let me ask you this: When you see things, the nature of seeing manifests; does this seeing exist because of light, darkness, clarity or obstruction? ‚nanda, if it exists because of light, you should not see darkness and if because of darkness, you should not see light; it is the same with clarity and obstruction. Again, is this seeing in a bright, dark, clear or ob- structed condition? Ananda, if it is clear, you should not see any obstruction and if it is obstructed you should not see that it is clear; it is the same with light and darkness. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Revealing the essential Bodhi </p>
              <p>ëTherefore, you should know that the essential Bodhi is wondrous and bright, being neither cause nor condition, neither self as such nor not self as such, neither unreality nor not unreality, and neither reality nor not reality, for it is beyond all forms and is identical with all things (dharma). How can you now think of it and use the frivolous terminology of the world to express it? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is like trying to catch or touch the void with your hand; you will only tire yourself, for how can you catch the void?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Brushing away wrong assumptions </p>
              <p>Ananda asked: ëWorld Honoured One, if the nature of Wonderful Enlightenment has neither cause nor condition, why has the Buddha always told the bhikhus about the nature of seeing which exists because of the four conditions of voidness, light, mind and eye; what does all this mean?</p>
              <p>The Buddha replied: I spoke of worldly cause and condition which have nothing to do with Supreme Reality. </p>
