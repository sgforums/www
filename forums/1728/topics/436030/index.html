              I have problems with the concept of soul.
              
              Alot of religions have the concept of souls. How do we know is there a soul or not ?
              
              Alot of ppl I know also believe in soul which consists of christians, catholic, hindus, taoists and muslims.

              <p>Truth accords to our individual perception of reality. It belies on individual capacity, our newly discovered truth in context of our previously so called truths,now labelled beliefs, and that is the reality.   What you hold to be truth may be just facts without context to another person.
               Just like watching an event on TV, the is no actual experiencing. You react or interpret the event by proxy, your values, your mental state and attention levels.
              Therefore what you may have asserted as truth bears no relevance in others' lives.
              As it does not have any immediate consequence, save in an argument!
              Put it another way, maths, for instance, if you are relating to very young kid, you start with numbers of one, two, then many.  Later, you relate to number of digits on the hand/s.
              Then you introduce symbols of 1,2,3......to 0, +,-. Numbers in to the sum of ten.
              These symbols is no consequence without mathematics. Without the understanding the concepts and its applicability, it becomes irrelevant! It is all greek to me!
              If you wish to relate truth to beliefs and religion, is has to be of some significance and relevance to them! Different people come here with their different disposition. The point is that they benefit in their own way. We practise by helping others and also allow ourselves to be helped! Our previous insights are enriched by increments particular to ourselves and no body else! Knowing truths is not about regurgition of facts, but it's relevance and applicability to our individual lives!</p>

              <p><strong>From the Theravadin Perspective</strong><br> <br> From <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/lofiversion/index.php/t17918.html">http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/lofiversi...php/t17918.html</a>,<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Basically, Ajahn Brahm (and the

                                      between Existences*<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;In contrast to the orthodox stand, there is significant
                                      Pali canonical<br> evidence strongly suggestive of an intermediate state between one
                                      existence and<br> another, a view supported by Theravada fundamentalists. Various
                                      suttas from the<br> Nikayas clearly talk about a state of existence before actual
                                      rebirth as a<br> another sentient being. Let me quote some examples from them.<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;In Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta (MN 3<img title="Cool" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool"> the Buddha
                                      states that for conception to<br> occur, one of the conditions is that the being to be reborn
                                      (gandhabba) has to<br> be present at the moment of union between the father and mother.
                                      Here, it is<br> implicitly stated that there is an intermediate state of existence
                                      between death<br> in the previous existence and rebirth in the next.<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;There are various references to the rebirths of
                                      bodhisattas as well as other<br> beings, which also imply as much. According to Sampasadaniya Sutta
                                      (DN 2<img title="Cool" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool"> and<br> Sangiti Sutta (DN 33), some beings "enter the mother's womb
                                      unknowing, stay<br> there unknowing and leave it unknowing", while others "enter the
                                      mother's womb<br> knowing, stay there knowing, and leave it unknowing". One who
                                      "enters the<br> mother's womb knowing, stays there knowing and leaves it knowingï¿½
                                      is, according<br> to the commentary, a bodhisatta in its last rebirth. This is
                                      confirmed by<br> several suttas that describe the bodhisatta's moment of entry into
                                      the mother's<br> womb as "being mindful and fully awareï¿½. [Mahapadana Sutta (DN
                                      14);<br> Acchariya-abbhuta Sutta (MN 123); Pathama-tathagata-acchariya Sutta
                                      (AN 4: 27);<br> Bhumicala Sutta (AN 8:70)].<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;There are references to a fivefold typology of
                                      non-returners, one of which is<br> called antaraparinibbayi (ï¿½attainer of Nibbana in the

                                      the<br> Samyutta Nikaya (SN 48:15, 24, 66, 51:26, 54:5, 55:25); Purisagati
                                      Sutta (AN<br> 7:55) and Samyojana Sutta (AN 4:131). Ven Bhikkhu Bodhi, in his
                                      "The Connected<br> Discourses of the Buddha: a new translation of the Samyutta
                                      Nikaya", Volume II<br> (Note 65, Pp 1902-1903), argues (with support from Samyojana Sutta)
                                      that the<br> antaraparinibbayi is "ï¿½one who has abandoned the fetter of
                                      rebirth<br> (upapattisamyojana) without yet having abandoned the fetter of
                                      existence<br> (bhavasamyojana)."<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;Orthodox Theravadins argue against this interpretation of
                                      the<br> antaraparinibbayi because in the Kathavatthu (e.g. Kv 366), an
                                      Abhidhamma text<br> regarded by them as canonical, the idea of antarabhava
                                      (intermediate life) was<br> strongly refuted.<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;However, there is further evidence to consider. In Metta
                                      Sutta (Khp 9, Sn<br> 1:<img title="Cool" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool"> there is reference to bhuta (those who have been
                                      born) and sambhavesi<br> (those seeking birth). Several suttas [Channovada Sutta (MN 144);
                                      Channa Sutta<br> (SN 4:35:87); Catuttha-nibbana-patisamyutta Sutta (Ud 74)] mention
                                      the states of<br> "here or beyond or between the two". Kutuhala Sutta (SN 4:44:9)
                                      also tells of "a<br> being [that] has laid down his body but has not yet been reborn in
                                      another<br> body".<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;All the above references from the suttas implying an
                                      intermediate state of<br> existence should provide sufficient food for thought by Theravadins
                                      and ample<br> reason to keep an open mind regarding the mystery of dying and
                                      rebirth.<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;Although fundamentalist Theravadins may subscribe to a
                                      belief of an<br> intermediate afterlife, it does not necessarily mean that they
                                      accept all of the<br> bardo (ï¿½gap in betweenï¿½ or intermediate state) teachings postulated
                                      by the<br> Vajrayana tradition.</span></p>

If such a distinction is agreeable, then perhaps the discussion may be favorable to a subtle ear…</span></span></p>

The objects we perceive through the myriad of causes and conditions seem completely ‘external’ to us, but do they have intrinsic characteristics that define their true nature? What is the true nature of the world as it exists independently of ourselves? We have no way of knowing, because our only way of comprehending the true nature of the world, the true nature of reality, the true nature of fact, the true nature of all things, all conditions and all constituent parts is via our own personal mental process and are the result of our own personal and particular way(s) of investigation. </span></span></p>

It is in this manner that there is but one Truth one Reality, and it resides equally within the Buddha-nature of us all without any insurmountable disparity.</span></span></p>

              <p>If there is no reality .. how could there be ultimate
              reality?  And what is ultimate reality?  Similarly, what
              is ultimate truth?</p>
              <p>"That depends what you mean, .... " - i.e. to say there is no
              reality and reality depends on what you want reality to mean, and
              it is a "if".</p>
              <p>//There is no truth? Emptiness is the ultimate truth.//  I
              take this to mean there is no truth but there is ultimate truth and
              emptiness is the ultimate truth.  Now, now, this is ludicrous.
              There is no truth but there is ultimate truth.  There is no
              truth but emptiness is the truth.</p>
              <p>What kind of bull is this?  It is like saying this, there
              is no tooth but there is great tooth.  However, though there
              is no tooth, nothing is the tooth!</p>

              <p>There is no ultimate reality, however there is an ultimate truth.</p>
              <p>Ultimate reality means something like God... something totally real, existing, that we must seek.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, there is no ultimate reality.</p>
              <p>But there is an ultimate truth, and that is emptiness. What dependently originates is in nature empty, and this emptiness is the ultimate truth and applies to all things.</p>

              <p>When a message is clear and easily understood, there is clarity.  It means no clarification is needed.  What is clear is clear.  Unless it was not so clear before, then you can use the term clearer (as comparison). </p>
              <p>Do not confuse clarity with reality or truth.  I don't know what is ulitimate clarity.  Is there an undertone in your question or you care to explain?</p>
