              <p>Buddha tooth relic is reality but not ultimate as it is still relative as opposed to Absolute reality. Teeth of living beings can be destroyed by worldly material like hammer. Hammer dented when it was hit on the tooth relic of Buddha. And yet, the relic is not ultimate reality, it is depicting an ultimate reality of sentient beings the same as Buddha truly attainable.
              The discussion is surrounding reality and ultimate reality or another term known as relative and absolute reality. In Buddhism reality is denoting the emptiness attainment that of Arahat, while ultimate reality is on the attainment of Buddha, and bodhisavattas are also classified in the ultimate reality as there are various levels of bodhisavattas in each category. Nonetheless, if strictly on ultimate reality is Buddha nature.</p>
              <p>å‰�å¿µï¼ˆå¦„ï¼‰ä¸�ç”Ÿï¼Œå½“å¿µï¼ˆçœŸï¼‰ä¸�ç�­ is ultimate reality or realization.</p>
              <p>Residing at this level of realization will achieve fruition either gradual or sudden. It may fruition at the level of bodhisavatta which according to Flower Adornment Sutra is 11th onwards or Supreme Buddha nature as that of Buddha Sakyamuni, depending on your own level of non-grasping or so called the progress of Buddha karmic seeds from past and present.
              By the way, personally I am not enlightened beings but still can share abit of enlightenment note. So, you should be able to imagine the scale of wisdom from supreme enlightened beings like Buddha Sakyamuni is awesome, amazing, inexplicably touching and lovely. Wow! and you are potentially that supreme because you are and you will <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>The solid I am talking about is also stable and unchanging (not in the long run of course). Generally, when we talked about solidity we are talking about the physical form of a compounded entity that can take such form.  Diamond is one example.  Diamond is actually carbon but it is so densely packed that it is the hardest thing. Diamond takes a long time to arise and subside compared to human life, we can say it is almost permanent.  Thoughts and imaginations cannot take solid forms.  Therefore they arise or subside quickly and display no permanence. </p>
              <p>I cannot see what meditation has to do with my understanding of the Buddhist concept of impermanence.  The Buddhist concept of impermanence is about the moment to moment existence.  Because of this concept, there is this emphasis that 'everything' constantly arise and subside moment to moment.</p>
              <p>Do not confuse this concept with solidity.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>hahaha, a cat can also meditate.  sitting cross-legged all day in stupor doesn't mean you are deep in thoughts, contemplating or observing.  I have seen people in meditation sessions falling asleep!</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Seriously, watching your breath only makes you mindful that you are alive!  Meditators are basically doing meditation for their own well-being.  And there is this MISCONCEPTION that meditation is the WAY to liberation!  Or even to clean mental defilements.  As to whether meditation helps one to gain insight or knowledge is doubtful.  It depends.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>To me, meditation is to engage your own thoughts.  Thinking, contemplating, deliberating, raking one's own mind, all can be done in any setting not necessarily with eyes closed and legs crossed.  However, it would be better to do so away from distraction or disturbance.  Meditation is like what the Christians call quiet personal time for reflection and to be with God.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>For non-religious practice, meditation permits one to 'withdraw' to his inner self, to be detached (temporary) from the material world, to reflect, to contemplate, to reconcile, to 'renunciate' or to still one's mind.  It helps to create mindfulness, calmness and relaxation.  Meditation is best done alone and away from distraction.  Don't waste money or time on group meditation retreat/resort and don't be monkish hero doing weeks and months of meditation!</span></p>
