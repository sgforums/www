              <p>At the time when the Mahaacharya Padmasambhava was departing for the southwestern country of cannibal demons, at Gungtang Pass, in the country of Mangyul, Nothern Nepal, Yeshe Tsogyal made prostrations and circumambulations, and placing the crown of her head at the exalted feet  of the Guru, she prayed in this way:</p>
              <p>Through the blessings of the Mahaguru, <br>may I, in all my lifetimes, <br>in the pure palaces of the buddhafields, <br>follow the Guru inseparably. <br>Through unceasing interest and devotion, <br>the practice of pleasing service, <br>and the profound intention, the vital essence of awakened mind, <br>may I attain the transmission of blessed nectar. <br>Through the blessings of awakened embodiment, awakened dynamic expression, and awakened cognizance, <br>may my body, speech, and mind be ripened, <br>and through the two aspects of the profound Generation and Completion stages, <br>may I become accomplished in the practice of receiving empowerment. <br>May the hosts of maras of wrong understanding, <br>sickness, malevolent influences, and obstacles be pacified, <br>and with the effulgence of retinues and enjoyments, <br>may my wishes be accomplished just as I wish. <br>In burial grounds, mountain hermitages, and snowretreats, <br>in those very places of prosperity and abundance, <br>in the meditative absorption of the vital essence of <br>the profound state of understanding, <br>may I always accomplish my practice. <br>Through the fruit of accomplishing my practice, <br>with the practices of the four aspects of awakened activity, <br>and through binding gods and spirits into servitude, as well, <br>may I guard the Buddha’s teachings. <br>May all the sacred Dharma teachings nobly spoken by the Teacher, <br>without effort, dawn in my mindstream. <br>Through finding the possession of supreme knowledge, <br>may I become endowed with supreme realization. <br>Through the interdependence of bodhichitta, <br>through encompassing the power of all living beings without exception, <br>and through the extraordinary power of the unobstructed wish-fulfilling jewel, <br>may I become endowed with the power to benefit everyone I encounter. <br>Through the extraordinary power of the spreading of the Buddha’s Teachings, <br>may the holders of the lineage and Dharma teachers bloom, <br>place all beings in happiness, <br>and as well, purify all realms of experience. <br>By way of my body, speech, and mind, all three, <br>in the realms of mind-objects of each individual to be tamed, <br>may my Nirmanakayas who tame in every way possible <br>arise in measurelessness. <br>In brief, in all of samsara and nirvana, <br>may I be inseparable from the nature of the Guru, <br>and may I quickly attain the Three Kayas which are free from joining and separation, <br>and the knowledge of all aspects of phenomena, Buddhahood. <br>May sentient beings make supplications! <br>May the Guru confer his blessings! <br>May the meditational deities bestow spiritual powers and realizations! <br>May the dakinis grant predictions! <br>May the Dharma protectors dispel obstacles! <br>May the Teachings of the Buddha spread and flourish! <br>May all sentient beings be blissful and happy! <br>Day and night, may they practice the Dharma! <br>May the welfare of myself and others be spontaneously accomplished! <br>Through this virtue that is pure in its own-being, <br>may samsara and the lower realms be shaken from their very depths, <br>and in the ocean of conditioned existence, furthermore, may I not stay, <br>and simultaneously, may I actualize the Three Kayas. <br>This treasury of the great secrets of all the Victorious Ones, <br>this unexcelled, supreme teaching, <br>like the manner in which the sun shines in the sky, <br>may it spread and flourish to all the kingdoms and realms in their entirety. <br>Through the generation of these roots of virtue of mine,<br>and of the roots of virtue of others, <br>may we become endowed with the utterly perfect <br>qualities of the glorious Guru’s awakened mind and true understanding. <br>May I become a mighty person who spreads and propagates the precious Teachings of the Buddha. <br>Through bringing to final consummation the triad of wisdom, love, and power, <br>may I become a perfect buddha. <br>May all sentient beings who abide in the six classes of being be <br>saved from the ocean of samsara and suffering,<br>and swiftly, may they become manifestly complete buddhas! <br>For people like ourselves, Padma Lingpa, in Lhodrak, from a boulder of medicine-stone that had the face of a lion, revealed this.</p>
