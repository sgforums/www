              Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse on the passing of his father, Thinley Norbu Rinpoche</h3>
              <p class="para">Thank you for your sympathy and best wishes at this time.</p>
              <p class="para">We live in a world of our own making, a world built 
              by our own unique perceptions which we believe in fully, every year, 
              every day, every hour and every moment of our lives.</p>
              <p class="para">Even though in reality this life is fleeting and 
              lasts no longer than the time it takes for a spark of fire to shoot out,
               it is experienced by some as dragging on interminably for aeons and 
              aeons. Yet for others, although in reality the span of this world's 
              existence is infinite, their experience of it lasts no longer than the 
              blink of an eye.</p>
              <p class="para">For some, this world is no bigger than a worm hole, 
              yet they feel insignificant and isolated, lost in a vast and infinite 
              void. Others perceive the world to be small--as small as an entire 
              universe--and to them it feels uncomfortably confined and 
              claustrophobic.</p>
              <p class="para">Most of us, myself included, have been conditioned 
              to live and die in a world created by our own perceptions, and continue 
              to create conditions that will ensure we repeat this same game over and 
              over again.</p>
              <p class="para">Amongst myriad possible perceptions, Thinley Norbu 
              Rinpoche is seen variously as an ordinary person, a father, a teacher 
              and a perfect being--a diversity of perception that is the result of 
              each perceiver's individual merit, or lack of it.</p>
              <p class="para">For people like me, whose limitations lead me to see
               him merely as my father, your condolences will be accepted as emotional
               support.</p>
              <p class="para">For those of you with 'superior qualities'--or who 
              aspire to develop such qualities--and are able to see Thinley Norbu as a
               perfect being, this is yet another opportunity to shrug off impure 
              perception and generate pure perception, so that eventually you will go 
              beyond perception altogether.</p>
              <p class="para">'Awareness' is the quintessential teaching of the 
              Buddha--from the awareness of cool air as you breath in and then out, to
               the profound awareness of natural perfection. And with boundless 
              compassion and courage, the sole purpose and activity of all the buddhas
               it is to ring the alarm bell that brings us to this awareness.</p>
              <p class="para">With enough merit, the passing of this great being 
              can be interpreted as the ringing of that alarm bell, and a timely 
              reminder of all the teachings, from the simple truth of impermanence, 
              all the way up to the realization of unobstructed compassion. In this 
              way, as much as this deluded mind of ours appreciated and valued his 
              appearance in this world, it should also appreciate and value his 
              disappearance.</p>
              <p class="para">Touching as it is to hear from those who are 
              offering various prayers, recitations, butter lamps and many other 
              wholesome activities at this time, allow me to remind myself and all 
              those who are interested, that none of the practices we are currently 
              engaging in are for him, but for ourselves.</p>
              <p class="para">However brilliantly the moon appears in the sky, if 
              the pond is muddy, the moon will not be reflected in its waters. In the 
              same way, it is through the purification of defilements and accumulation
               of merit within our own minds that will enable us, in time, to perceive
               a reflection of the Buddha, fully intact and never to depart.</p>
              <p class="para">So, rather than congratulating ourselves with the 
              thought that we have accomplished all these practices during this 
              special time, bear in mind that we should already have been doing 
              them--and for that matter, we should continue doing them throughout this
               and all our future lives. But to imagine that our practise is something
               like providing this great being with the 'last rites' is definitely not
               the best way to go.</p>
              <p class="para">I have also been asked which specific practices 
              should be done. Again, I will repeat that mindfulness, in other words 
              'awareness', is our practice. We are ignorant beings, and as such 
              require constant reminders about the importance of making the effort to 
              land in this awareness. Therefore all our guru's activities--from when 
              he yawns or coughs, to when he appears or disappears--are his way of 
              reminding us to come back, again and again, to mindfulness.</p>
              <p class="para">And as long as we are mindful and aware, no one practice is better than another.</p>
              <p class="para">Written and dedicated to the enlightenment of all sentient beings in the presence of the rupakaya of Thinley Norbu.</p>

              <h3>Message from Ven. Gyatrul Rinpoche on Dungtse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche's Passing</h3>
              <p class="comment">Word is spreading of the passing of Dungtse Thinley 
              Norbu Rinpoche, eldest son of His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche and 
              incomparable scholar and contemporary Nyingma master. He was an 
              incarnation of Tulku Trim Ozer, who was one of seven sons of Dudjom 
              Lingpa, and was also considered to be an emanation of Longchenpa. On 
              hearing of the passing of this remarkable lama, Venerable Gyatrul 
              Rinpoche sends the following message to the sangha:</p>
              <p class="para">We have heard that Thinley Norbu Rinpoche passed 
              away. Therefore, at all the centers students should gather if they can 
              and practice Dorsem Lama Chodpa--the practice of making offerings to the
               guru as Vajrasattva. Individually, students should recite Vajrasattva 
              mantra as much as they can. Why should everyone do Vajrasattva at such a
               time? Whether or not the lama who passed away needs purification, we 
              have no way of knowing. But when a great master passes, the power of 
              merit accumulated at such a time is said to be increased even 100,000 
              times. Therefore, since we all need to purify our obscurations and 
              accumulate merit, we can use the Lama Chodpa (practice of offering to 
              the guru) as the method to engage our three doors in virtue at that 
              time. Engaging our body, speech, and mind in such powerful virtue 
              purifies the negativity that we constantly use them for out of habit. 
              And we all have connection to this lama, the son of His Holiness Dudjom 
              Rinpoche, so therefore we need to practice now.</p>
              <p class="para">There is a special blessing and power to practices 
              done at such a time with faith and devotion--the merit gathered and the 
              negativity purified are truly inconceivable. This is because of the 
              enlightened intent of such a master, whose every act is only to bring 
              benefit to all beings. Such masters are not ordinary like ourselves. 
              They don't die like we do, powerless and sniveling. They are born into 
              this world as an act of compassion, as long as their physical body 
              endures they use it only to bring benefit, and then they pass away and 
              again teach the truth of impermanence just as Buddha Shakyamuni did. 
              Therefore their passing, too, is part of their enlightened display, 
              their miraculous activity in this world. That is why there is such power
               and blessing at their seeming 'death.' We should not think, "Oh, I'm so
               sorry that this lama is dead." Instead, we should feel faith and 
              devotion and appreciate that we personally have such an opportunity for 
              powerful practice. We shouldn't think, "Oh, it is just tradition to 
              practice when a lama passes." It is more than just a tradition; it is an
               opportunity to take advantage of the exceptional blessing of that time.
               Also, traditionally you might go and offer katags and other offerings, 
              and maybe you can't do that now, but always you can make the offering of
               practice. That is a real offering, and you don't have to go anywhere to
               make it.</p>
              <p class="para">We also shouldn't think, "This was not my lama." In 
              fact, when any great lama of any tradition passes away there is this 
              same opportunity. We can always do the Lama Chodpa practices at such a 
              time. Gelug, Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma--it makes no difference what school 
              of Buddhism the master taught or practiced. We also should not think 
              that there is no blessing for us if we never met that master in this 
              life. When you do the Lama Chodpa, you are offering to all gurus, all 
              yidams, all dakinis. You should think in a vast way like this when you 
              practice, don't be narrow or rigid thinking that it is only one way. A 
              true guru encompasses all the three roots--all guru manifestations, all 
              yidams, all dakinis. You don't have to do the Lama Chodpa only for a 
              lama, or only at their passing. We always need to gather merit, because 
              we are always exhausting our merit. We always need to purify negativity,
               because we are always so busy making more negativity. Therefore see 
              this as an opportunity to practice, a time of blessing and guru 
              devotion, and do as much Vajrasattva as you can--a little bit here and 
              there continuously. It will be of great benefit.</p>
              <h3>Lama Tharchin Rinpoche's statement to the sangha</h3>
              <p class="para">Our lord protector His Holiness Kyabje Dungtse Thinley 
              Norbu Rinpoche passed into parinirvana last night. Rinpoche wrote down a
               message for all of us, asking that everyone do Vajrasattva practice for
               three weeks. These were Rinpoche's last vajra words for us.</p>
              <p class="para">If you are able to join with sangha and do practice 
              in your area with a lama, please do that. If possible, please join with 
              our sangha at Pema Osel Ling to do the Dorsem Lama Chopa, at Kunzang 
              Gatshal, or with your local sangha. If you are not able to do that or if
               there is no local sangha, it is fine to do any form of Vajrasattva 
              practice according to any sadhana including Ngondro and the Hundred 
              Syllable Mantra. Meditate that our lord protector Dungtse Rinpoche is 
              inseparable with Vajrasattva's form. Meditating this way, take 
              empowerment and receive blessings. Then as Vajrasattva dissolves into 
              you, you become inseparable with Vajrasattva. Rest in formless 
              meditation in this way, with your mind and Kyabje Dungtse Rinpoche's 
              wisdom mind inseparable.</p>
              <p class="para">This is the best way for us to get a taste of Kyabje
               Dungtse Rinpoche's wisdom mind, even though Rinpoche is not physically 
              present. This stays with us inseparably until we reach enlightenment. 
              Receiving Rinpoche's blessings in this way is most essential. Now in 
              particular, after Rinpoche's wisdom mind has been uncovered from the 
              physical elements and has merged with the vast dharmakaya, receiving 
              Rinpoche's blessings is more powerful even than when Rinpoche is alive. 
              Rinpoche's wisdom mind merges and pervades everywhere.</p>
              <p class="para">Please do Vajrasattva practice every day. This is a very special opportunity to receive Kyabje Dungtse Rinpoche's blessings.</p>
              <p>Do not think that Rinpoche needs our help with puja.
               Don't have that concept. This is our practice so that we can receive 
              Rinpoche's blessings and have a taste of Rinpoche's wisdom mind and how 
              to seal Rinpoche's wisdom mind with our mind. That is the purpose for us
               to do puja with faith and devotion.</p>
