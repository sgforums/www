Therefore, CGS is not a Mainstream Buddhist tradition and is not recognised in Buddhism.<br><br>See our ex-moderator's reply regarding them:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by _wanderer_:</div><div class="quote_body">Yup, do avoid all books by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, because him and his followers are proponents of a particular practice which has been very severely warned by HH Dalai Lama and many great teachers, that is harmful to the Dharma. The practice also tends to distract one's mind away from the Dharma but rather preoccupied with worldly benefits like wealth etc.<br><br>Since you have already bought the book, I suggest you burn it away respectfully (since there is still Dharma content in the book) or bring to a Buddhist temple and request them to help you dispose of the book appropriately.<br><br>I agree with Eternal Now that the most dangerous are the ones which have 90% truth and 10% untruth, which can easily lead us up the wrong path.<br><br>For your information, in Singapore this particular tradition has a center known as the Singapore Gelugpa Buddhist Society (can't remember if it ends with "Buddhist Society", "Buddhist Centre" or "Buddhist Association"). Heard that they may be holding a hundred million chants of Om Mani Padme Hung end of this year maybe in Kallang Theatre. Do take note of it and avoid taking part in it. </div></blockquote></div>

Because we generally see denominations and sects in a different light. <strong>As long as the teachings of each 'sect' follows the guidelines of the 3 Dharma Seals it should be OK.</strong><br><br>And also, it is a common view among Buddhists that there are '84000' dharma doors in Buddhism - that Buddha taught not only one dharma door for enlightenment but many different kinds of dharma doors - a person only need to focus on one to attain enlightenment. For example zen focuses on meditation and koan and the pure land school focuses on chanting Amitabha. Different patriarches open up different sects according to the needs of the times and focuses on different aspects of Buddhism. And after all, there are enlightened people from all the different schools of Buddhism, so I think this sectarian thing is totally unnecessary.<br><br>But of course, there is a history of sectarianism in different times and different parts of Buddhism, but much of it I believe is resolved. As for now, there is very little sectarian tendencies among Buddhists, but you can say perhaps a very minority of them continue to prejudiced in some ways.<br><br>Regarding 'heresy', see <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=158048" rel="nofollow">The Four Seals</a><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by _wanderer_:<br><strong>The entire Buddhist teachings can be summarized in the four seals (in the Theravadin tradition, it is more commonly known as the three seals). Anything that sounds Buddhistic but does not contain the 4 seals is not Buddhism. As such, the 4 seals are often used as a reference for people to distinguish what is Buddhism and what's not.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The 4 seals are:<br><br>1. All compounded things are impermanent.<br>2. All afflictive emotions are painful.<br>3. All phenomena are empty; they are without inherent existence.<br>4. Nirvana is beyond extremes.<br><br>(there may be other slightly different versions due to translation)</span><br><br>Read a very good teaching on the 4 seals from the following url:<br><br>[b]Buddhism In a Nutshell: The Four Seals of Dharma</strong><br>- Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche<br><br>http://www.shambhalasun.com/Archives/Features/2000/Mar00/4Seals.htm<br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by laoda99:<br><br>what is mainstream buddhism? i only know mahayana and ...oops...sorry the other one practised by thai/sri lanka buddhism.</blockquote>Thai/Sri Lanka Buddhism is Theravadin Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism is Vajrayana Buddhism. There is a lesser known Vajrayana Buddhism in Japan, known as Shingon Buddhism.<br><br><blockquote>IMHO, when religion spreads, it absorbs "local favours" and syncretism develops....like shinto merge with buddhism in japan, taoism merge with buddhism/confucianism in china</blockquote>Actually all these are OK.<br><br>It is perfectly OK to merge religious customs from Shinto and Taoism, as long as the teachings of Buddhism does not become distorted by them. Like I said - follow the Dharma Seals.<br><br>Buddhism is a very flexible religion and can easily adapt to the different cultures of the people - and as for current, it is trying to adapt to western societies.<br><br>But one thing though: <strong>Buddhism does not worship deities and spirits like the (modern day) Taoists and Shinto</strong>. And also, Taoist influence on Buddhism is a much more earlier event - during that time, Taoism also did not have these kind of practises.</div>
