Our ordinary conception of kindness is something about smiling and being nice. If a cow is standing near the cliff and about to fall down, what the cow needs is not a pleasant smile but perhaps a thick branch to hit it in the direction that ensures its safety.<br><br>If someone were to engage in very harmful actions to himself and others, a Buddha/Bodhisattva may not hesitate to take extreme actions out of the compassion to prevent this person from planting such negative seeds for himself/herself.<br><br>This is not an excuse for us to engage in extreme acts in the name of "helping people". We need to be aware of our own motivations in whatever actions we undertake. However, we also need to know that sometimes great realized beings may not act in the ways we expect them to. An enlightened being doesn't really care about how we see them - as being sacred, wise, compassionate, moral, or not - they act in whichever ways necessary to bring about sentient beings' enlightenment.<br><br>The Shugden practice has been highly discouraged by many great lamas and there are reasons for that. If you wish to know more about the practice and why it's been so strongly discouraged, I find that the wikipedia provides quite a good overview -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shugden<br><br>Condemning the Shugden practice is not denying that Shugden is able to attain enlightenment one day. Just because Shugden has Buddha potential doesn't mean we should allow/condone the harmful practice. Similarly, just because pseudo-Buddhist cults (like Yi-Kwan-Dao, Falungong etc) also teach people to do good or the practitioners also have the Buddha Nature, doesn't mean that we shouldn't differentiate them from the Buddhist path.<br><br>My personal opinions only.
