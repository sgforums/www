Since July of last year NKT people, including myself, have remained peacefully without any further involvement in the Dorje Shugden controversy. We received messages from many people, including some Tibetans in London, thanking us for leaving the controversy in peace and indicating their appreciation. Now we are very surprised by this article in Newsweek, which includes very unpleasant quotations from Robert Thurman and HH the Dalai Lama, and which causes new problems to arise.<br><br>We find that most of the information in this article is false. Amongst other things, for example, it says that the First Dalai Lama was Je Tsongkhapa's nephew. We believe that Je Gendundrub became the First Dalai Lama. Are you saying that Je Gendundrub was Je Tsongkhapa's nephew? If so, this is incorrect. ....<br><br>HH the Dalai Lama claims: "Nobody would pray to Buddha for better business, but they go to Shugden for such favours - and this is where it has become like spirit worship." This is not true. Many Tibetans pray to other Buddhas such as Tara and make prayers to other Dharma Protectors for success in business and for the removal of obstacles. Why are Shugden practitioners singled out? Particularly, in the Kadampa tradition we do not pray for worldly attainments such as wealth, reputation, success in business, etc., we pray for the welfare of all beings and the attainment of spiritual realizations.<br>HH the Dalai Lama is also contradicting himself. He previously regarded Dorje Shugden as a Buddha, and composed verses of praise to him that can still be seen today. It is his responsibility to resolve this contradiction.....<br><br>(cont in link) </blockquote>really dunno.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

After every Sutra we read at the end, those Qian Da Po, Qin Na Lo, Lo He Mo Lo, are all Maras. All take oathed to help Buddha, protect the Dharma. If in the Future buddhists who recite the sutras and are bother by anyone, they oathed to destory them. if not their heads will break/crack into 7 pieces. Maras are very afraid of swearing. But now they swear to Buddha. Look at how great is Buddha. So maras are not unchangable. When we change them, they no longer become mara.<br><br>/\<br></div>

Padmasambhava, the founder of Tibetan Buddhism, has converted a lot of spirits and evil spirits in the past.

As for the problem of 'Dualism', this is really that 'true person' personal matter - whether he becomes attached to this situation or not. But it will be silly if he is not attached to the situation, but instead, he is attached to Emptiness.

Those who are speaking out need to, and have been asked to, this is not a personal crusdade they are taking up for the sake of some rigidly held view. There's too much evidence to the contrary to take that stance.<br><br>To let this go on is to allow alot of people to be harmed.
