              <p>I live in a tian dao family only i converted to buddhism recently on vesak day i seeked refuge in triple gems.</p>
              <p>My parents do ask me read some of their books on Tian ji . ( heavenly secrets )</p>
              <p>I pretened to read but declined later on.</p>
              <p>How should I coexist with them .</p>
              <p>Some buddhism thing they teach nt so correct.</p>
              <p>They have their Real maitreya sutra etc Jigong sutra ..... ....</p>
              <p>they composed their own budai fo mileji</p>
              <p>every fifteen and first of lunar month they gt celebration and sometimes they teach incorrect things.</p>
              <p>zzz</p>
              <p>abit hard leh , every 2 to 3 day will ask me read tian dao thing see them pray. teavh me their teachings ..... ....</p>
              <p>they told me they repented 500 to 1000 times a day.</p>
              <p>that time i christian they din brainwash so much me now buddhism kept on brainwashing .... ....</p>
              <p>is it because buddhism more linked to tian dao ?</p>
              <p>i din take part in their religion much only very young that time .</p>
              <p>I hardly take part one. i do help them clean the altar to reduce their workload lah. thats all</p>
              <p>then i became free thinker athiest , christian buddhist.</p>
              <p>but i young that time i was made to seek the tao like infant baptism and infact triple gems but i din consider myself as tian dao.</p>

              <p>Well, my advice is, study more on buddhism sutra, and when you have substaintial wisdom and knowledge, share the knowledge with your parents.</p>
              <p>There is nothing to be in tian dao, personally i feel that there teaching do not coexist with buddha teaching, but they do teach morally good things to their faith holders.</p>
              <p>You should go read up more on their stuffs, you can find online, then after reading, you go back to buddhist sutra, find the differences, and share it with your parents.</p>
              <p>I know that they have this Mitreya Sutra, Mi le Zheng Jing, first of all, you go find the sutra in the buddhist cannon, there are a few sutra on Mitreya, read it, try to understand it, and share with your parents.</p>
              <p>Everyone has different condition to be intact with buddhism,dharma, in order you to be a dharma protector, first of all you need to understand the conceptual and dharma teaching by buddha, then you can have to wisdom to spread to people who is outside in the dharma circle. I have read a long articles on a person who left Tian Dao and took refuge in the triple gem, he is knowledgable in Tian Dao, and he also verse in Dharma teaching, he has spotted the differences, and reacted to their teaching.</p>
              <p>So work hard on the dharma.</p>

              <p><br>You should ask you mum these questions.</p>
              <p>Where is Mitreya now?</p>
              <p>In the buddhist sutra, Mitreya should come in 5.6billions years later.</p>
              <p>Next the time of measurement is a big differences, Shakayumuni buddha left this world 2550++years, in our world 2500++years is equal maybe just a fracture of seconds in buddha pureland. So how to define the Era of green,red and white.</p>
              <p>Next,in the sutra, Mitreya heaven is not the highest in the æ³•ç•Œï¼Œthere are higher heaven above it. So if Tian Dao people are to be going to Mitreya pureland, why not you go further.</p>
              <p>Tian Dao cultivation, going to the Mitreya pureland, which level of cultivation will they become?</p>
              <p>There is no so called what tian dao said Wu Ji lao Mu, in buddha teaching, main core teaching is ç¼˜èµ·æ€§ç©ºã€‚ Do they know what is emptiness?</p>

              <p>Do they believe in buddha, or believe in some historical people from the past and said mi le zhen jing is spoken by buddha. Sutra that spoken by buddha, you will have the start verse to be å¦‚æ˜¯æˆ‘é—», then the place of the discouse is spoken, the people that is attending the discourse. I came to know that mi le zhen jing has the starting verse of å¦‚æ˜¯æˆ‘é—»...as such, this is a mispresentation of buddha, the sin is very heavy, can go to hell.</p>
              <p>I can write alot more, becoz the article i read is very comprehensive, with buddhist cannon sutra counteract with their teaching. The above are just some of my views that you can share with your parents.</p>

              <p>Buddha was not a vegetarian tat time in his time.</p>
              <p>Next, showing the Ven Xing Yun picture, what is it going to prove? Can that picture enhance their cultivation, and if by showing off, that is already proudness, so isnt buddha teaching teaches us to break from all these.</p>
              <p>I only can say, they are just doing those è¡¨æ³•...things that externally express to faith, they do not really understand the dharma teaching is universal, not about races, not about religions, so long you have the correct method, the practise of eightfold path, anyone can be enlighten.</p>
              <p>Its not like you go for prayer group, bow 1000 times, eat vegee, or so ritual you will be enlighten. If like this, many people already enlighten.</p>

              <p>You should enhance your buddhism foundation....</p>
              <p>They ask you clean, just clean, you do it as a respect.</p>
              <p>They ask you bow, take it as a repentence.</p>
              <p>They talk to you, you listen, and ask them questions( you need to have knowledge in buddhism, so that you can in return share with them)</p>
              <p>Nevermind about the chores at the tian dao. Importantly you must know how to cultivate yourself, not shaken by all these external factors.</p>
              <p>SImply to day, Their founder is not buddha, and buddha has go thought nirvana, he need not some manifestation to come tell you another side of the teaching. Tian Dao history is pretty long, it all started with one Dyansty Queen whom dream about a sutra, then all the things linkage started to have this 3 era periods.</p>
