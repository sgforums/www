            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> I've read through the link you've provided and frankly, with all due respect, I find several doubts about it. Is the explanation of human's origin and the numbers given directly by the Buddha Himself? The story about the "tasty fluid" suggests that humans were the first creatures on Earth, which is not the case according to existing evidence. </blockquote>Only a few centuries ago, people thought that the world was flat. The Kalachakra tantra, a buddhist tantra from Buddha Sakyamuni, already stated that the world was round. It was so much later that explorers found out that indeed, the world was round. There are so much things in Buddhism that was only prooven recently.<br><br>Buddhism certainly supports evolution within the animal kingdom. Evolutions in the animal kingdoms, changes in geographical situation on Earth. Buddha said that throughout ages, land can turn into sea, sea can turn into land, land can turn into mountains, and so on. There will even be a time when all the oceans dry up and there are just plain land.<br><br>However, the Human realm did not originated from the Animal realm, instead, it's another way round. The Human realm is a good transition point to all the other realms, because in the human world, all sorts of karma can be created. I also personally do not believe that humans are an evolution from the animal kingdom, like what the website has said, I believe that it's a fallacy.<br><br>Modern science has yet to proove ghosts, rebirth, and definitely astronomers can't find the Heavens in their telescope, so they can't see the Jhanic planes nor do they believe in existence of Devas.<br><br>My point to you is - there is a lot of things in the world that has yet been prooven by science.<br><br>Throughout history, devas (heavenly beings) have visited human world, but think about it, why would they want to visit an unpleasant world like us to them? The Earth is probably like a very smelly and dirty toilet that you can find in third world countries or if you lived in the Kampong days. It's unpleasant, but those who lived there has gotten used to it. If we visit some countries the toilets, we will want to get the business done quickly, we will not stay long. This is an analogy given by my dharma teacher.<br><br><a href="http://www.gbm-online.com/dharma/Science.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gbm-online.com/dharma/Science.html</a> - Science &amp; Light-Sound heaven<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As for the so-called science, there is no real thing called science. People just made up the name "science" and called it that. It's actually just a body of theories. Is this kind of reasoning perfect or not? It depends on each person's perspective and faculty of understanding. Some people understand it. Others have not studied science before, and do not understand science. Does that mean the people who haven't studied science before lack that kind of reasoning in their own nature? No. Regardless of whether you've studied science or not, that kind of reasoning exists in your nature. You cannot say that if someone has studied science, then he has the ability to understand science, and if he hasn't studied science, then he doesn't have the ability to understand science. It's the same with the Buddha-nature; everyone has it in his own nature.<br><br>Science is only a small part of the Buddha-nature, and it is not a very complete kind of reasoning. You may say people are doing such and such research in science, and writing about such and such theories, but actually, those are just the upside-down attachments of people. They are as if "adding a head on top of a head." Having nothing to do, they look for something to keep them busy. Busily doing this and that, they never discover anything. They study science, investigating back and forth, but they never reach any real conclusions.<br><br>People become attached to science, thinking it's something special. In fact, it is all inherent in our nature, and you don't need to look outside. If you seek outside, you'll never find it. You may say it's real, but that's just the superficial. The real thing can neither be found nor spoken of. Basically, science doesn't exist. It's just called science because that's what we call it. </span><br><br>This article by Venerable Hsuan Hua is similar to Ajahn Brahmavamso's (the monk who was once a scientist) observation of many scientists, during his years in the science career, as being very "dogmatic". Ajahn Brahmavamso has written an article: <a href="http://www.saigon.com/~anson/ebud/ebdha264.htm" rel="nofollow">Buddhism - The Only Real Science</a><br><br>My advise to you is, do not take Buddhist time calculation literally, there are many variations, but Buddha never gave exact numbers, but only a rough idea to the level of what he was talking about. You will read later on.<br><br><blockquote>- The universe is estimated to be about 11+ to 20 billion years old, while the Earth is about 4.6bil yr old. This figure is much greater than a complete cycle of the 4 stages(1.344bil). How accurate are the estimates of a "kalpa"?</blockquote>Firstly, the statement that 1 great kalpa is "1.344 billion years" is a calculation by the editor of the website. I personally do <strong>not</strong> agree with this calculation to be taken literally because there's a problem with the Small kalpa - Each small kalpa is made up of 10 X 2 X 84000 = 16.8 million years, however, the number "84000" is <strong>not</strong> to be taken literally! And so, the medium kalpa, great kalpa and so on, are all affected because of the first calculation of the small kalpa. The number 84000 is used in several occasions by Buddha to describe "uncountable". For example, Buddha held up a cup of water, pointed to it and said something like... "there are 84000 tiny unseeable beings", which of course was unimagineable then but explanable now. 84,000 years could be 200,000 years, who knows the exact calculations? Only Lord Buddha knows through his wisdom. So, don't you think the lost years could easily be make up? In fact, there is one calculation by Ajahn Brahmavamso, he's a famous monk who was a scientist before renuncing. He calculated according to Buddhist sources that the universe is 12.7 (i know it's 12 point something, but not too sure whether its 12.7) billion years old, and that's very accurate to modern findings.<br><br><blockquote>The radiowave analogy can be easily understood. What happens if the intermediate state of 49 days are over and the deceased juz cant find any "receiver"? Will he get "dispersed" (hun fei po san) and cease to exist? Will such a phenomenon of dispersion even occur?</blockquote>His bardo state will transform into a ghost if he were not to be reborned within 49 days, very often it's due to attachments, that the bardo could not reborn. It does not mean he cease to exist. He will still continue to be reborn in the 6 realms, undergo sufferings in samsara, until he walks the path of liberation.<br><br>In regards to the phenomenon of dispersion... this one, I cannot find anything in Buddhist scriptures. But from what I heard... after 49 days, the bardo will become a ghost and "disperse" into a messy form and then reform into a shape due to his karma. So if you have of ghostly stories of sightings of foggy ghosts, it could be the transformation. I don't know about this, because I've not witnessed.<br><br><blockquote>What do u mean by a "character"? What is "8th conciousness"?</blockquote>Characters and the 8th consciousness are related. The 8th consciousness is like a video tape, it goes all the way back for kalpas and aeons, and it records things that happened. And then, you can rewind back and refer to the past happenings. It's basically our memory consciousness.<br><br>Our character is hardened through our habits, these habits (xi qi) will continue to manifest itself after lives if it has not been purified. So if you plant a bad seed into your mind, this seed may grow into bad speech and actions, and may cause further karma. But if you plant a good seed (e.g generosity, practicing 10 virtuous deeds), these good seeds will become your character too, and naturally more virtuous karma in future lives.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The thought manifests as the word; the word manifests as the deed. The deed develops into habit; and habit hardens into character. So watch the thought and its ways with care, and let it spring from love. Born out of concern for all beings... The shadow follows the body and never leaves. In the same way, as we think, <strong>so we become.</strong> - Lord Buddha[i]<br><br><blockquote>I understand when u said everything is not permanent, and everything is ever-changing, thus the mind and soul is not the same all the time. (hmm, i can't find the link to the story on the flames on the first and third watch)<br><br>Why is it then that the characters, karma and 8th conciousness gets transferred? There must be some kind of a bonding amongst these three, it is a "collection" of the three "elements" and it follows the "person" on to his next life. Rather, it is that which [i]defines the person.</blockquote>Karma is a universal balancing law of cause and effect, each Mind, Speech, Action committed with intent will surely result in a consequence, with exception of neutral acts like e.g walking, that one probably doesn't have much karma.<br><br>Whatever happens from our Mind, Speech, Actions, gets registered into the 8th consciousness. This is how we usually get our dreams - during our dreams, during our semi conscious states, our minds reconstruct parts of our 8th consciousness into dreams.<br><br>As for what links are there, there are the 12 Interdependant Links of Origination:<br><br><a href="http://www.onclipevent.com/archives/sugatagarbha/000384.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onclipevent.com/archives/sugatagarbha/000384.html</a><br>* Dependent on ignorance (avijjÂ±), reactions (saÂªkhÂ±rÂ±) arise,<br>* Dependent on reactions, consciousness (viÃ±Ã±Â±Âºa) arises,<br>* Dependent on consciousness, mind and body (nÂ±ma-rÂ³pa) arise,<br>* Dependent on mind and body, the six sense doors (saÂ¼Â±yatana) arise,<br>* Dependent on the six sense doors, contact (phassa) arises,<br>* Dependent on contact, sensation (vedanÂ±) arises,<br>* Dependent on sensation, craving (taÂºhÂ±) arises,<br>* Dependent on craving, clinging (upÂ±dÂ±na) arises,<br>* Dependent on clinging, becoming (bhava) arises,<br>* Dependent on becoming, birth (jÂ±ti) arises,<br>* Dependent on birth, decay and death (jarÂ±, maraÂºa) arise<br><br><blockquote>Can't it be said that the soul is a collection of these three elements? Even if they are ever-changing, they are still existent isn't it?</blockquote>Buddha said that there is the 5 skandhas, but no such components as a "soul". If you ask me, I would say that there is the soul, the soul is our 7th consciousness.  But the Buddha no longer has the 7th consciousness. The 7th consciousness creates a false perception that we have a fixed "self".<br><br>Also, you have to understand what the concept of "emptiness" is all about in Buddhism. In Buddhism, "Emptiness" does not refer to absence nor rejection. It is definitely <strong>not</strong> nihilism as some people may think. In buddhism, Emptiness means the emptiness of inherent existences, which means, nothing exists seperated from the rest of the world. For example, if you sit on a chair, does the emptiness around the chair reject you? If you stand up, does the emptiness reject you? It's our minds that make identities to them, but they themselves have no inherent existence on their own. All things in the world originates from Emptiness, they ends with Emptiness too. A watermelon was once only a seed (Cause). This seed meets with the conditions (Water, nutrients), and grow into the fruit.<br><br>So, all things are just causes and conditions, they are impermanent, they are interdependant with no inherent existences.<br><br><blockquote>Can I say that when a person dies, his character, karma, and 8th conciousness gathers on to a "new body" and his new life begins. At the end of this new life, these three elements (albeit being different now) will again gets transferred to another body?</blockquote>Yes, they get manifested again in the body they are reborned.<br><br><blockquote>P.S&gt; Is it true that all life consists of character, karma  &amp; 8th Conciousness? Are plants and bacteria considered life? If so, they would have these three elements too?</blockquote>Plants and bacteria/viruses are considered life, but they are inanimate life, they do not have karma, they do not have mind, they do not have consciousness, and so on (all the things listed in the 12 dependant origination). They have the Dharma Nature*, but they do not have the sentient being's nature, they do not suffer nor are reborned in the 6 realms.<br><br>How do we know? There are a few methods to test. You can do a simple test. If you believe a bacteria has a soul, when u try to kill it, it should try to run away. This is the nature of all sentient beings, they react to the threat, and they try to save their lives, whether they are humans, large animals, or small animals like ants, or smaller ones which we cannot see. If the bacteria and virus do not run away, it is not a sentient being. I believe usually bacteria and viruses are too small for consciousness, thinking, to occur. It's made up of only a coulple of cells, how do you think that there are nervous systems?<br><br>There was once a researcher told my master that he was afraid he would commit bad karma because his works involves in killing a lot of microscopic organisms (bacteria/viruses). My master told him that it's OK.<br><br>* Dharma Nature: The intrinsic nature of all things. Used interchangeably with<br>"emptiness," "reality."<br><br><blockquote>Thanks again  m(_ _)m</blockquote>Welcome <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>However, the Human realm did not originated from the Animal realm, instead, it's another way round. The Human realm is a good transition point to all the other realms, because in the human world, all sorts of karma can be created. I also personally do not believe that humans are an evolution from the animal kingdom, like what the website has said, I believe that it's a fallacy.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Did the Buddha Himself specifically say that humans come before animals?

It is true that science is far from proving <span style="font-style: italic;">Everything</span> in the world. The important thing to note is - science requires evidence, it is not make-believe.

We couldn't have been around with the dinosaurs, and certainly not before them. This is in terms of 100s of millions of years before mankind.<br></span><br><br>As for the so-called science, there is no real thing called science. People just made up the name "science" and called it that. It's actually just a body of theories. Is this kind of reasoning perfect or not? It depends on each person's perspective and faculty of understanding. Some people understand it. Others have not studied science before, and do not understand science. Does that mean the people who haven't studied science before lack that kind of reasoning in their own nature? No. Regardless of whether you've studied science or not, that kind of reasoning exists in your nature. You cannot say that if someone has studied science, then he has the ability to understand science, and if he hasn't studied science, then he doesn't have the ability to understand science. It's the same with the Buddha-nature; everyone has it in his own nature.<br><br>...<br><br>People become attached to science, thinking it's something special. In fact, it is all inherent in our nature, and you don't need to look outside. If you seek outside, you'll never find it. You may say it's real, but that's just the superficial. The real thing can neither be found nor spoken of. Basically, science doesn't exist. It's just called science because that's what we call it.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> I think this is getting too philosophical. Yeah, I agree Science, like other names, is used as a term to describe something, so everybody know what the other guy is talking about...

However, that does not take away the credibility of the theory!

The 8th consciousness is like a video tape, it goes all the way back for kalpas and aeons, and it records things that happened. And then, you can rewind back and refer to the past happenings. It's basically our memory consciousness.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> If the character, 8th consciousness and 5 skandhas (??) follows a "person" to his next rebirth, then isn't this combination equivalent to an identity? It is what constitutes to "his identity".<br></span><br><br>Also, you have to understand what the concept of "emptiness" is all about in Buddhism. In Buddhism, "Emptiness" does not refer to absence nor rejection. It is definitely not nihilism as some people may think. In buddhism, Emptiness means the emptiness of inherent existences, which means, nothing exists seperated from the rest of the world. For example, if you sit on a chair, does the emptiness around the chair reject you? If you stand up, does the emptiness reject you? It's our minds that make identities to them, but they themselves have no inherent existence on their own. All things in the world originates from Emptiness, they ends with Emptiness too.<br><br>So, all things are just causes and conditions, they are impermanent, they are interdependant with no inherent existences.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Not thinking about it <span style="font-style: italic;">doesn't</span> make the thing go away! It is true that everything is not permanent, but at that particular instance, it is a <span style="font-style: italic;">fact</span> that the chair exists. Whether you take notice of it or not, does not make a difference - it is there and it exists.<br></span><br><br>How do we know? There are a few methods to test. You can do a simple test. If you believe a bacteria has a soul, when u try to kill it, it should try to run away. This is the nature of all sentient beings, they react to the threat, ...<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> So the important point is "sentient" or "conciousness" huh? However, it is indeed a very vague concept of "conciousness". Plants, bacteria and viruses can react too when faced with environment challenges. For example, viruses can mutate themselves to become immune to antibiotics, plants can grow to spread out their branches to try to get more sunlight.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Emptiness is perhaps one of the more difficult things to understand in Buddhism. I always emphasize that Emptiness is <strong>not</strong> about absence nor rejection, which is what people usually think of when they speak of emptiness.<br><br>In Buddhism, emptiness is the nature of everything. This is the nature of all things, you cannot imagine it, if you start to think or imagine, then it's not emptiness but something else (which you have imagined). That's the point. If you see things the way it is (without your imaginations and your conceptual thinkings), then you see it in its true nature.<br><br>I hope that in future Origami can answer your questions more...

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok karmic imprint.<br><br>Ever wonder why sometimes we learn certain things so easily? In Buddhism we classify this as imprint.  This imprint is what we accumulate through our countless rebirths, be it good or bad.<br><br>Wonder why some people enjoy violence and some enjoy peace? All karmic imprints. This is a conciousness which follows one through all existence. That is why we seek the way to be liberated from such cyclic existence.<br><br>U can say it's like an 'identity'. As long as it helps u understand it better.<br><br>What is emptiness?<br><br>Usually people associate emptiness as nothingness. In Buddhism, emptiness is not nothingness. Just like non-attachment is not detachment. It is not getting attached to anything while at the same time able to enjoy it without having to do without it. Ok before I confuse u, let me simplify it.<br><br>We get attached to things we like or love. For eg. a dog, family, friend etc. So when we lose it we get upset. non-attachment means not to get attached to things as we know that all things are impermanent. But some may miscomprehend non-attachment as detachment. They think since getting attached to such things will cause unhappiness, they rather do without it. This is an extreme of one end. So Buddhism advocates the middle path. We understand that the nature of all things are impermanent. Nothing lasts forever. So we can accept it when something goes away for good as a way of life and appreciate it n enjoy it while it lasts.<br><br>Since we now know all things r impermanent, all things are originally empty of inherent nature. True a chair is there. It is always there. U see it. I see it. What is meant by empty of inherent nature means it appears as what we see, to put it simply.<br><br>For eg. we all know the color of blue. We know that the sky n the sea is the color of blue. We can identify the different colors. So we assume the nature of the color of the sky is blue. Let's imagine that the color of the sky is actually red. So since the day we were born n we can differentiate colors we were told that the sky is blue. We look up n see the sky n we label it blue. Ok. So I see it as red n I call it blue. Maybe u see it as green n u call it blue too. Then we see grass n we're told it's green. But I see white but I call it green cos I'm told so. N u see it as yellow n u call it green too. So all yellow appearing in youe eye conciousness appears as green. N all white appears as green to me too.<br><br>Why do we see it differently? It's due to our karmic imprint. That's why we all have different levels of understanding of things. N this also show that all things r empty of inherent nature. They appear as what our eye conciousness comprehends due to our karmic imprints.<br><br>Once we understand that all things r empty of inherent nature, we can then contemplate on emptiness. Before that it is best not to try. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  We just get confused n probably fall asleep in the process. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I can only write from my own experience and understanding.<br><br>This pure presence is called Rigpa in Tibetan Buddhism. I am not a Buddhist in this life, but I was a Tibetan Monk of Nyingma school several lifetimes ago. That is why I still have a lot of interest in Buddhism.<br><br>About Rigpa, when we experience it. It is formless and empty and at the same time infinite and all pervading. It is NOT BLISS. Bliss is a samadhi state but it is not the true nature yet, it is still a state in the mind. I have bliss experiences also, in fact i have then now quite often outside of meditation also.<br><br><strong>Rigpa is a presence of 'yourself' that is connect to everything in the universe. That is probably why the Buddha say that there is 'no self'. All is connect to all in the Dharmakaya. Rigpa is a part of the Dharmakaya. When in the state, there is no separation into you or me... We are all one thing which cannot be described.<br><br>However, I must say that even now, while reading this, we are already the rigpa. We do not realise this is because we THINK we are just the mind/personality. The mind/personality is a REFLECTION from rigpa. It is not the true self. If you understand what I am write, you may get a sudden awakening/realisation. And if the realisation is deep enough, your viewpoint or way of seeing the world will change.</strong><br><br>Just my 2 cents...<br><br></blockquote></div>
