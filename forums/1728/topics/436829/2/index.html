              Without fully knowing,would we rather be on the side of generosity, or on the side of  caution on being cheated?
                      
              On being made of aware of being cheated, are we going to be unhappy to being cheated, or the fact that someone is making an  attempt to cheat you ,riles you.

              what is a few dollars compared to someone who go from door to door telling people Amitabhva Buddha can tell a human to go and beg ?
              
              a few dollars loss is nothing to me. Even if this man should have acted like he has a stroke ( not difficult) and i gave him money based on that alone, it's still fine with me.
              A few dollars don't buy much today.
              
              BUT ...................he is going around telling people that Amitabha Buddha can do such thing as asking a devotee or a worshipper to beg?!!!
              
              hey where does that place Buddhist ? supersitious or medium taoist ritual?

              <p>I guess Leogirl's main objection is the use of Amitabha's name in vain, and I can understand why.</p>
              <p>None of us saw this beggar, or for that matter how well-dressed his two companions were.  However, I guess Leogirl had her own gut feeling about these people who turned up at her door-step.  It's true that I don't always give when people beg.  In the past, I have turned away beggars who looked too well and healthy to be needing alms, or those whom I regularly see at the same old locations. </p>
              <p>There's however nothing we can do to stop people from using Buddhas' names to cheat.  We can only warn them not to do that, but there will always be people like that. </p>
              <p>Over the past few weeks, I came across a beggar just outside the temple I went to for sutra recitations.  He wished me "Amituofo" and extended his hand for alms.  In the past, I had also often come across a mother and daughter duo outside a famous church in Singapore. </p>
              <p>These people know that temples and churches are visited by the pious or by those who are seeking blessings.  Under such circumstances, people would be more willing to extend charity, and that's just the mentality that beggars prey upon. </p>
              <p>We can choose to give money or not, based on however we have chosen to measure their worthiness.<strong>  </strong>Sometimes, it's also an on-the-spot decision.</p>
              <p>If possible, we could alert the authorities about these people, who may genuinely be in need of help, but don't know where to get it.</p>

              I am not trying to be judgemental, but trying to remind myself in such situations.
                          Also, there happen to be people who believes the Buddha Amitabha among others visit them in dreams. 
                          Also it may be possible that he was given divine directions by a taoist medium been possessed by Amitabha! Ha! Ha! I know there a taoist medium possession by kwan im ma, but Amitabha? I am not sure?! Ha! Ha!
                          If he is a sincere devotee of Amitabha, and really believe that Amitabha really commanded, would you still condemn(hmmn...too strong a word) ostracise him?

              realization, thanks for your understanding. 
              
              weychin, i think you are using the fear factor which is not the reason i want to chant Amitabha Buddha. I do not chant his name because i fear He will punish me.
              
              Even if this man should be commanded by what he claims, the Amitabha Buddha to beg, i will not give in to this type of psychology threat. I will then ask him to wait till Amitabha Buddha gives me the command to give him money.  Why should i be coerced to give because the man use the name of Buddha ? because i fear what ? re-tribution ? is this what you chant Amitabha Buddha name for ?

              <p>I still feel LavenderWu's suggestion to get these people assistance from social welfare agencies is a sound one. </p>
              <p>We can give them the benefit of the doubt like what Weychin is 
              suggesting, but if we have time and wanted to take an extra step, then 
              we may consider asking them if they know that help is available from 
              other avenues.  For example, tell them that they can obtain free meals 
              at temples, teach them how to seek help from welfare service agencies, give them relevant hotline numbers they can call, etc. </p>
              <p>On the spot, we can give some money, but then these people will always need to rely on begging to make ends meet.  Sometimes, it is also the desperation of their circumstances that make them tell lies and resort to underhanded means... not saying it's right, but we're also not them... so it's better to help them get out of their desperate circumstances where possible. </p>
              <p>(Of course, all this is subject to whether we have the time and whether the circumstances are conducive to engaging them there and then.)</p>

              i have helped out in social works before and i know i have to do a secret survey when i send food rations to any poor home. 
              
              Meaning i will mark what is in the house of the poor, what the person is wearing down on a survey to feedback to the organisation whether is this person really poor as he/she claims.
              
              i have met a so called poor malay woman wearing all her gold earrings, gold necklace and gold ring in full to receive our food rations and we had to note that down. I have visited homes with a tank full of the most expensive rowana fishes in the sitting room.
              
              I have even being whispered to by the so called poor home's neighbour that the maid would come out of the house to sweep the floor daily. 
              
              It is much easier for me to stop thinking and just stuff a few dollars in the palm of that man at my door. 
              
              It is easy to tell the man Not to use the name of the Buddha to beg.  Easy to tell the man where he can get free vegetarian meals.  Easy to pass him the number to call for help. 
              
              BUT ..............it is difficult for any poor to get the social help without having to go through an interview, a referree (by hospital) , fill in forms to justify why he needs social welfare.
              
              judging from the responses to my post, i really doubt someone knows how difficult for a poor in Singapore to get help fast.

              No, fear is the furthest from my mind! Being a Buddhist also means being mindful; of loving kindness and compassion. That being reminded of Buddha Amitabha also being mindful of loving kindness and compassion. 
              Using Amitabha's name to coerce or to blackmail a Buddhist is rather counterproductive, don't you think!
              
              The less there is of one's "self', the less there is of you(I) and the man with stroke(other)!

              Therefore, begs the question, do you,if  being an arbiter, would rather err on the side of generosity, that you don't leave a family hungry and feeling alone and helpless, or, do choose on the side of error, so as not to be cheated!
              Yes! we do have a duty to ensure there is no abuse, to make sure those truly deserving of help! 
              Also,one is not always rich, neither is one always stays poor, not everybody is out to cheat you. Also, there are threshold of pride and dignity some have to cross to ask, to beg! The quiet ones are the ones who suffers in silence.
              There are no solutions to be offered by me, only questions, and the constant refrain; be mindful, be compassionate, do not let "I" cloud our judgement!

              he needs social welfare.</p>
              <p>judging from the responses to my post, i really doubt someone
              knows how difficult for a poor in Singapore to get help fast.</p>

              Ney ...compassion alone is not good enough, we should still use wisdom to make a right decision.
              
              In this case, i have used my head over my heart.  I dun think it is entirely a bad thing for the stroke guy to be rejected and told off for using a buddha 's name to beg.  At least he will know that a serious buddhist will be offended by it.
              
              Maybe i have even got him curious about the sutra and he will go and learn it after.

              <p>i just had a strange encounter. A man came to my door and told
              me Amitabhva Buddha asked him to go around asking for alms for a
              period of time. There was a little boy with him about 3 years and
              another 9 – 10 years boy behind him.</p>
              <p>I asked him how did Amitabhva Buddha ask you to go begging? did
              you dream of him?</p>
              <p>He just showed me his half limp body and said he had a stroke
              and Amitahbha Buddha asked him to beg for a period of time.</p>
              <p>I then asked do you know how to chant the Amitabha Sutra? He
              said he only know how to say Namo Amitabhva buddha.</p>
              <p>I told him to use his conscience and do not insult
              buddhists.</p>
              <p>I didn’t give him any money at all although i can tell his
              stroke is for real. But i was a bit angry at the way he used
              Amitabha Buddha name to ask for money. He left looking a bit sad
              and disappointed. I don’t know whether i have done the right thing
              but it is the first time someone come to my door to beg. It’s quite
              a shocker. Plus he use the name of buddha.</p>

              <p>Begging in this manner may not be proper to encourage. You can maintain the courtesy of without fully knowing right or wrong , and channel them to those charity organisation and mp who are around to help needy. As they have the courage to knock door, there should not be any constraint in them looking for mp and charity organisation for their need.</p>
