              i just had a strange encounter. A man came to my door and told me Amitabhva Buddha asked him to go around asking for alms for a period of time. There was a little boy with him about 3 years and another 9 - 10 years boy behind him.
              
              I asked him how did Amitabhva Buddha ask you to go begging? did you dream of him?
              
              He just showed me his half limp body and said he had a stroke and Amitahbha Buddha asked him to beg for a period of time.
              
              I then asked do you know how to chant the Amitabha Sutra? He said he only know how to say Namo Amitabhva buddha.
              
              I told him to use his conscience and do not insult buddhists.
              
              I didn't give him any money at all although i can tell his stroke is for real. But i was a bit angry at the way he used Amitabha Buddha name to ask for money. He left looking a bit sad and disappointed. I don't know whether i have done the right thing but it is the first time someone come to my door to beg. It's quite a shocker.  Plus he use the name of buddha. 
              
              Will you give him money?

              <p>I will give him some money (probably not more than $5). </p>
              <p>If I have an extra strand of mala beads at home and one of those Amitabha Sutra free publications, I will give those to him and teach him how to recite 'Namo Amituofo'.</p>
              <p>--------------------------</p>
              <p>A bit of explanation. </p>
              <p>Many years ago, when I was browsing books at MPH (the one at Stamford Road), this guy standing beside me told me, "Buy this... buy the Tibetan Book for the Living and the Dead".  I bought the book on his recommendation and spent some time listening to him talk about his retreat experience in Nepal. A week later, he asked me out to give me a strand of mala beads and taught me to chant "Om Mani Padme Hung". </p>
              <p>While I didn't immediately decide to follow the teachings of the Buddha then, I believe it planted the seed.  From the book I bought, I learnt very basic breathing meditation (pay attention to the gap between the in and out breath).  I still have that strand of mala beads.</p>
              <p>Amituofo.  /\</p>

              I was almost a beggar before too. Beggars whether street or door to door one already "throw away their face" and give their all to beg.
              If I am the one facing this scenario. I will do 2 good deeds at 1 go. 
              
              Amitabha have mercy, hope he forgave this man for using his name to beg.
              1) I will introduce him to Amitabha religion, bring him to temple which have Amitabha.
              And a good thing is, he can repent and say sorry to Amitabha in the temple.
              Second good thing is some temple provide free vegetarian meals everyday.
              I will encourage him to chant Amitabha mantra to change his fate.
              
              2) Religion is not bread. Hence regarding his poverty. I will get help from social service or old folk home or destitute home to take him in. Or CDC to help him get a job. Since he had stroke, he can't work. Hence will find a home willing to adopt him.

              actually if the man had come to my door and said "" i had a stroke and no job for a long time, can you give me some money?"  i will straightaway give him a few dollars and no questions ask.
              
              but he came and said " namo amitabha buddha,  Amitabha Buddha had asked me to ask for alms for a period of time".  I go like ???!!! are you sure.  
              
              are you so good a person that Amitabha Buddha even tell you what to do ???
              
              i mean is it going to be a trend that beggar go around and say " Guan Shi Yin Pusa ask me to beg ".....that kind of stuff.  It is very false.  If he has been straightforward and said his stroke problem without citing buddha's name, i will definitely help him.
              
              Anyway if i gave him a mala bead and even teach him how to chant the sutra, don't you think he might even use it to beg even more successfully?  with a mala bead in one hand and the sutra in the other ? and telling people Amitabha buddha ask him to beg????

              and i remembered the two boys that followed him were well dressed. I have seen really poor boy in tattered t-shirt, so these two were dressed quite well. The older boy even look sheepish when i questioned this guy about the content of the Amitabha Buddha sutra. 
              
              Although i felt bad not helping this man but i don't want to feel cheated because someone use the name of Buddha to "pressurize" me to give.  And i want to stop him from using the name of Amitabha Buddha,, so i questioned him.
              
              I told him to go to any temple and they will let him sit to chant.  The reason he gave me was he had a stroke he can't pray and " how do you chant the sutra?"    Coming from someone who claimed Amitabha Buddha asked him to beg for alms, this is unbelievable.
              
              Imagine beggars go around saying " Jesus ask me to beg ", " Guan Shi Yin Pusa ask me to beg " ......for eg....goodness...what's next ?

              i am wondering why did he drag two well dressed boys along with him to beg from door to door? one about 5 and one older about 9 years old.
              
              is there a syndicate coming to Singapore to beg door to door ?
