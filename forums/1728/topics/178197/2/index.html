I dun see anything wrong with it as it can help the lay follower understand and appreciate the life of a monk, rather than a person who enter monkhood for a very long time, but is avaricious and is not really interested in the Dhamma, like some bogus monks collecting and building up money for himself  from devotees.<br><br></div>

Besides accruing a great deal of merit, that is not the point. The point is to obtain liberation from the samsara, either as arahant or bodhisattva. Bodhisattva will still remain in this saha world practising the paramitas and learning until he is ready to be a buddha to save all sentient beings.<br><br>Even if this life you do not attain arahanthood, you will one day attain arahanthood in the future.<br><br></div>
