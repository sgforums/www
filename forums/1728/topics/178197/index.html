            <div class='col-md body'>how many of u r buddhist for a long time?? Renouncing is nt as simple as it seem...Nt sae u wan to renounce means u renounce...U muz have fate too or karma...Take me for an instance...I was nt a Buddhist, nv was until tt day i renounce...I nv believed in religion..So as long as u renounce, renouncing for short term or long term is still good...<br><br>No matter how u r still human...Even after u become monk u cant totally let go of ur lay man life affair...Imagine u r a monk, ur mom become very sickly, nobody to look after...R u going to cont being a monk or disrobe to look after her?? Filial piety....<br><br></div>
