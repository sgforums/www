              <p>I don't think so, but it is nevertheless still planting a negative unwholesome seed in your 8th consciousness that will sprout and turn into something bad in the future.</p>
              <p>That is, if the seed meets conditions (like a bad environment encourage violent tendencies deeply rooted in the mind, etc).</p>
              <p>I personally like to play some FPS games though not too into gaming these days :P</p>

              <p>He's only refering to the makers, not the game players (or at least I don't think he said that video game players are going to hell).</p>
              <p>I don't exactly agree that playing a video game is anything near killing a real person.</p>
              <p>However I would also like to give him benefit of doubt on his comments on video game makers, because what he said has some scriptural basis. (Master Chin Kung is a famous sutra explainer and commentator and must be very familiar with them, so I believe his comments usually have some direct or indirect scriptural backing or source and aren't just made up by himself)</p>
              <p>For example, the Buddha actually said that actors that incite people's passions (the three poisons of Greed, Hatred, Ignorance) are destined for rebirth in hell, so by this logic I believe this equally applies to video game makers:</p>
              <p>(oh btw before I quote the sutta just wanna add 2 points: Buddha is refering to actors here, not audiences, and also when I play video games I just play mindlessly and emotionlessly without hatred or anger as I understand them to be totally illusory and virtual and so I don't think I'm at fault of being 'inspired passions', in the same way that when I watch a movie I don't hate the actor for acting as a bad guy because he's just an actor, therefore I personally think my playing games is quite blameless even though I can't say this is the case for others)</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 15px; color: #606060;"><br>SN 42.2<br>PTS: S iv 306<br>CDB ii 1333<strong><br>Talaputa Sutta: To Talaputa the Actor</strong><br>translated from the Pali by<br>Thanissaro Bhikkhu<br>© 1998–2010<br><br>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel's Sanctuary.<br><br>Then Talaputa, the head of an acting troupe, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Lord, I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that 'When an actor on the stage, in the midst of a festival, makes people laugh &amp; gives them delight with his imitation of reality, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas.' What does the Blessed One have to say about that?"<br><br>"Enough, headman, put that aside. Don't ask me that."<br><br>A second time... A third time Talaputa, the head of an acting troupe, said: "Lord, I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that 'When an actor on the stage, in the midst of a festival, makes people laugh &amp; gives them delight with his imitation of reality, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas.' What does the Blessed One have to say about that?"<br><br>"Apparently, headman, I haven't been able to get past you by saying, 'Enough, headman, put that aside. Don't ask me that.' So I will simply answer you. Any beings who are not devoid of passion to begin with, who are bound by the bond of passion, focus with even more passion on things inspiring passion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival. Any beings who are not devoid of aversion to begin with, who are bound by the bond of aversion, focus with even more aversion on things inspiring aversion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival. Any beings who are not devoid of delusion to begin with, who are bound by the bond of delusion, focus with even more delusion on things inspiring delusion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival. Thus the actor — himself intoxicated &amp; heedless, having made others intoxicated &amp; heedless — with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in what is called the hell of laughter. But if he holds such a view as this: 'When an actor on the stage, in the midst of a festival, makes people laugh &amp; gives them delight with his imitation of reality, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas,' that is his wrong view. Now, there are two destinations for a person with wrong view, I tell you: either hell or the animal womb."<br><br>When this was said, Talaputa, the head of an acting troupe, sobbed &amp; burst into tears. [The Blessed One said:] "That is what I couldn't get past you by saying, 'Enough, headman, put that aside. Don't ask me that.'"<br><br>"I'm not crying, lord, because of what the Blessed One said to me, but simply because I have been deceived, cheated, &amp; fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of actors who said: 'When an actor on the stage, in the midst of a festival, makes people laugh &amp; gives them delight with his imitation of reality, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas.'<br><br>"Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</span></p>

              <p><br>Karma is very subtle.  Most people when i see them play video games are very engrossed and caught up in the game.  When they kill, there is a certain aggression, and when the enemy gets killed, they rejoice.  There is alot of mental upheaval. No doubt this is one of the attractions of video game... but i think it will create karma most definitely. </p>
              <p>The four factors of karma /actions include:</p>
              <p>1. Basis (ie, object you do the negative act on)</p>
              <p>2. Intention (or motivation)</p>
              <p>3. Action</p>
              <p>4. Completion of the act</p>
              <p>If the four factors are present, then the karma is complete. In the case of video games, the four factors are present.  But the karma is not strong because the basis, which is a non-existent enemy in the video game being killed, is weak.  So although karma is created, but basis being weak, therefore karma is not strong.  However, if one repeatedly does it, we can imagine that you are building up strong karma.</p>
              <p>Even if one wishes to say that the basis is not a factor because it is just a game, but the other three factors still exist, so it makes it an incomplete karma but still karma is created.</p>
              <p>One of my relatives (young kid) played video games until he developed a quite aggressive personality.  I think it is not a joking matter.</p>

              <p>Hi Optimus</p>
              <p>When a person do self inflict harm on one body, most probably he has caught up in his murky state of karma . Based on Tien Tai teaching on 10 states of existence, pyschological speaking that person is experiencing the state of Hell, where he experience pain and anger. He will need to reconcile what is within his heart. He need to confront the inner struggle to let go of the attachment so that healing can take place.</p>

              <p>To a dying person, every minute counts and he pray that he could live on.</p>

                                  <p>Btw there's a youtube video circulating by someone who rejects
                  the notation of karma and he spoke about it. In some sense his
                  explanation sounds reasonable...just for sharing</p>

                              </blockquote><br>I agree karma wouldn't make much sense if there is only one life. However, in Buddhism we have countless lives. Not only Buddha, but countless practitioners can testify karma and rebirth. Our moderator simpo_ talked about tracing current life experience to karma from past lives and can testify how accurate karma is and the importance of five precepts. He also have very vivid past life memories through meditation.
