              <p>The awakening of Kundalini energy at the base of your spine can be a dramatic experience that is said to profoundly shift your level of consciousness. Kundalini awakening symptoms vary a great deal from person to person. Some people experience intense physical symptoms. Others might have mostly psychological or emotional symptoms. Kundalini awakenings involve your unresolved physical or emotional situations coming to surface so that you can resolve and release them.</p>
              <h3>Involuntary Movements</h3>
              <p>As Kundalini energy moves through your body to clear away your physiological blocks, you might experience intense involuntary jerking movements of your body. These movements can include vibrations, shaking, muscle spasms and contractions. You might re-access emotions and memories connected to past injuries and traumas.</p>

              <h3>Yogic Phenomenon</h3>
              <p>Some Kundalini awakening symptoms involve people performing yogic postures or mudras (hand gestures) that you have never learned or could not perform in a regular state of consciousness. Additional symptoms include having an awareness of inner sound or music, tones or mantras. You might also have unusual breathing patterns that are slow or very rapid. You might not even breathe at all for an extended period of time during Kundalini awakening.</p>
              <h3>Physiological Symptoms</h3>
              <p>Kundalini awakening can cause strange physiological activity as the movement of energy helps release toxins from your body. Physiological symptoms can include pains in your spine and head, nervous system problems, heart problem and gastrointestinal disturbances. Internal symptoms may include burning sensations, hyperactivity or lethargy, greatly increased or decreased sexual desire, and even spontaneous orgasms. These symptoms might come and go without response to medical treatment.</p>
              <h3>Emotional Upheaval</h3>
              <p>You might experience an emotional roller coaster with feelings of guilt, depression, anxiety, joy, compassion, love accompanied by uncontrollable crying. These unexplainable emotional shifts are the result of the Kundalini energy helping you clear away your unresolved issues. The confusion and imbalance that accompanies these changes is normal.</p>
              <h3>Extrasensory Experience</h3>
              <p>Kundalini awakening symptoms can include unusual visual phenomena such as symbols or visions of lights. You may also hear voices, inner sounds, music or mantras. Symptoms include smelling incense, rose or sandalwood. You might also feel bigger than your body or out of your body with an accompanying sense of disorientation and confusion.</p>
              <h3>Psychic Ability</h3>
              <p>Kundalini awakening symptoms include psychic abilities like precognition (knowing something before it happens), telepathy, healing abilities and awareness of auras.</p>
              <h3>Deep Peace</h3>
              <p>Kundalini awakening can cause you to experience an altered state of consciousness through which you can perceive the unity that underlies the world. This creates a deep sense of serenity and peace.</p>

              <p>i feel dizzy when i look at the monitor for too long. could be the radiation. the humid weather also play a part in term of dehydration. can also involve caffeinated beverages. the symptoms also come with nausea, weak stomach, indigestion and fatigue.</p>
              <p>think can get some fresh air, take some rest away from the computer, look a far like out of the window to steady the mind. take a cool shower, drink more water, less coffee, and sleep eariler. i see, 1am already still posting. don't worry and think too much. be happy and relax. breath in breath out slowly. :)</p>

              <p>There was a period when i often got a kind of shock or electrical current/force against my palm whenever i used the mouse or touched the computer... i think it has to do with the energetic shifts in the body after doing practices like chanting / meditation etc.  Somehow the sensitivity is increased.

              <p><br>yea mostly for vegan. i still sometimes eat (non fetilized) eggs, chesse and dairy product which have B12. so it's already more than enough. i can also eat vegetable stall's "meat side vegetable", where they cook with meat wok. beside, seaweed and cereal also have B12.  i saw a taiwan health show. they discourage supplements pills, as it can hurt the liver. if can get directly from flesh food better.</p>

              <p>There are many types of devices that can absorb EMFs... you can check on the internet. The type i use is called Orgonite.  Which is very cheap and yet i find that it works for me.</p>
              <p>I also wear a pendant that absorbs the EMFs as they are all around us. Eg, when u r on MRT on a crowded trip, observe how everyone around u is on their mobile... that is how much daily exposure we get.<br><br>I find that ever since i use these devices, my energy level has increased significantly and no more headaches from the EMF...</p>

              <p>If you are meditating regularly, the energy collects at the dantien naturally when you are totally relaxed and clear. Over time, your cold symptoms can be completely gone and you can even be more resistant to cold than people who eat meat.  I have a friend who used to be very afraid of cold, after her meditation for years, she can wear shorts even in winter like conditions.  At minimum, one's hands and legs will no longer be so cold, one's face will become more ruddy and health will be much better.</p>
              <p>I have read that in some cultures in China, they use meditation as a health therapy. Not for gaining realisation of the nature of reality.  But just to keep healthy and it works very well.</p>

              <p>If you are meditating regularly, the energy collects at the dantien naturally when you are totally relaxed and clear. Over time, your cold symptoms can be completely gone and you can even be more resistant to cold than people who eat meat.  I have a friend who used to be very afraid of cold, after her meditation for years, she can wear shorts even in winter like conditions.  At minimum, one's hands and legs will no longer be so cold, one's face will become more ruddy and health will be much better.</p>
              <p>I have read that in some cultures in China, they use meditation as a health therapy. Not for gaining realisation of the nature of reality.  But just to keep healthy and it works very well.</p>

              <p><br>yea, there's a form of tibetan meditation method that can withstand cold. i saw it on documentry, most impressive. got a german(?) guy practice until can swim in the icy water.</p>

              <p>thanks, i don't have cold hand non feet. i can anticipate flu
                  coming and can immediately remedy it before getting sick. unless
                  those infuenza virus type, then it is more difficult to remedy.
                  it's a lot better now. last time when i used to eat meat, i get
                  sick easily. all the bacteria/virus/illness, mostly come from
                  the meat food. now, seldom get sick. :)</p>
              <p>the æ¹¿æ°” or å¯’æ°” u mentioned, i know, is the one that a part
                  of body is subjected to blowing wind from fan or aircon or at
                  night sleeping near the window or rainy weather. lucky the office
                  aircon is not too cold. if not i can catch a cold easily.</p>
              <p>i also cannot stand too humid a weather like most people. i
                  think most vegetable food are colder in nature å‡‰æ€§. so yes
                  ginger is a good "heaty" remedy. it's also hapening to MCK. a
                  doctor told him to get more "heaty" food. he also mention ginger
                  and can also eat a bit more nuts or peanuts but not too much. need
                  to balance depending on the weather and body.</p>

Improved slightly when I switch to indian vegetarian which is heavier tasting, and contain pungent spices. In hindsight, should have supplemented with milk. For those supplementing is good to rotate with different vitamins brand to avoid built up of toxicity. However, the benefit of vegetarian diet was less aggression and clearing of a chronic case of whitespot.</span></span></p>

              <p>see. lucky my mom supported our vegetarian diet and had home cook dinner instead of outside food. </p>
              <p>except, vegetarian diet might also be harder to increase weight. only know to get a weight gaining nutrition milk that also include a lot of vitamin etcs. but quite expensive.</p>
              <p>actualy i think my coldness got it's advantage of dispeling heat of the weather in itself more than other people that eat meat. people now a day need aircon to sleep, i can without. the coldness come early in the morning, but go away after sunrise.</p>

              <p>If you are feeling colder could be æ¹¿æ°” or å¯’æ°” or just poorer
                  circulation on the whole.</p>
              <p>This is a recipe given me by someone who tried and tested
                  it.  Susceptibility to cold and cold hands/feet disappeared
                  after two months of continuous use.</p>
              <p>Try grating between 1-2 teaspoons ginger, add 4-5 red dates and
                  black sugar to taste.  Pour hot water into cup and drink it as
                  a tea.  Also swallow the ginger.  Drink in the morning,
                  not at night. (If too lazy to grate ginger, can thinly slice, but
                  also remember to eat the ginger.)</p>
              <p>Personally, I would recommend using blackstrap molasses syrup
                  (richer in nutrients), instead of the black sugar.</p>

              <p>Dear realisation ,based on what you mention ,that you got dizziness .I came to one conclusion , i think u do have to chant repentance ,becos one of your past live you disturb an arhat in meditation .</p>
              <p>though the arhat didnt fail in attaining arhatship , but your action propel to the present times . I suggest you chant repentance to the 35 Buddhas before beginning on ur meditation practice</p>
