              SOCIETY,</span></strong></strong><span> </span>letting go is often paired with moving on. 
              People encourage friends who have suffered a loss to learn to let go of the past 
              and get on with living. In New Age terminology, “just let go” has become an 
              all-purpose piece of advice. But we humans are very cunning: While we talk a lot 
              about letting go, we usually find a way to have our cake and eat it, too—to let 
              go and still manage to hang on. In fact, it is easy to use the notion of letting 
              go as yet another ego-tool. We can use it to prop ourselves up, to cloud things 
              over, and uphold our illusion of solidity. We are so clever: we can take a 
              concept like letting go, so threatening to our ego-fixation, and turn it 
              completely on its head, so that instead it becomes a credential, an ego 
              adornment. We can take pride in our letting go and revel in how pure we are now 
              that we have pared down and simplified and become so much less materialistic. We 
              can mask our laziness by seeing it instead as a letting go of ambition; we can 
              mask our inability to connect with other people with the more spiritual notion 
              of letting go of frivolous attachments. The possibilities are endless. So if we 
              are to deepen our understanding of letting go, it is important to begin with an 
              insight into how easily it can be distorted. Then we may be able to discriminate 
              between a pretense of letting go and the real 
              thing.</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">To learn to let 
              go, it is necessary to understand how averse we are to change, and how attached 
              we are to our idea of a solid, separate self. At times, of course, we do want 
              change, for various and sundry reasons. But when we begin to bump up against the 
              fact that no matter what we want or do not want, change just happens, we begin 
              to feel a little uneasy. We feel protective. Of what? We’re not completely sure, 
              but we hang on anyway, struggling to secure our ground. We are reactive and we 
              dig in our heels. The greater the threat, the more tightly we hold on. We try to 
              capture something moving and to make it still, so that an experience that has 
              come and gone seems still to exist. Viewing our life as something we can fix and 
              possess, we become completely attached to our mental snapshot of ourselves and 
              equally threatened by its potential loss. We have taken a tiny speck of the 
              vastness of the universe and staked it out as our territory, and now are stuck 
              with protecting it from change.</span></span></p>

              DEEPEN</span></span></strong></strong><span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">our approach to 
              letting go and undercut some of these distortions? The Buddhist teachings 
              provide a pretty clear answer. The starting point is realizing that letting go 
              is not a dramatic moment we build up to some time in the future. It is happening 
              now, in the present moment—it is not singular but ongoing. Letting go is based 
              on our present realization of the reality of 
              impermanence.</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Change is 
              continuous in spite of our efforts to resist it. We begin to realize that we do 
              not have any way to stop it or to slow it down. The more we try, the more we 
              suffer. But there is a way to let go, to break this cycle of suffering. We can 
              slow down and have a closer look at our experience of it. When we have a look, 
              we begin to realize what we have been doing, and the whole enterprise begins to 
              feel more and more dubious. It becomes more difficult to hide from what in our 
              hearts we know to be true—the fact of impermanence. We recognize that we have 
              fabricated a false and fixed identity based on self-deception, delusion, and 
              fear; that we have enslaved ourselves to the never-ending project of shoring it 
              up. And we begin to long for another way of going about things. The process of 
              letting go begins at the point when we recognize how trapped we are. Being 
              trapped is the bad news, but the fact that something or someone has recognized 
              we’re trapped is the good news. It’s as if we have spent all our life living in 
              a house with very dirty windows, so dirty we had no idea any windows were there. 
              What at first had seemed quite cozy gradually begins to feel claustrophobic. We 
              begin to question what has been so safe and familiar. That questioning is very 
              powerful. To our surprise, as we gingerly explore our little house, a smidgen of 
              dirt falls off a window and we discover a peephole—we see that there is an 
              entire world outside. That tiny glimpse awakens our desire to be 
              free.</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Even the smallest 
              glimpse of freedom heightens our awareness of the pain we have created by our 
              ego-fixation. Seeing the contrast is what inspires us to go forward on the path. 
              In particular, each time we sit on the cushion and meditate, we relax and let go 
              a little bit more. The notion we’ve held onto—that if we don’t keep up our 
              ego-momentum something bad is going to happen—dissolves bit by bit. In a 
              traditional analogy of walking the path, it is said that our ego-attachment is 
              like a pair of shoes. Without such shoes we wouldn’t start out on the path, 
              although as we walk along, we find that our shoes begin to break down and wear 
              away. But if someone told you to toss out your shoes right at the start, you 
              would be offended. “How dare you! Do you think there’s something wrong with my 
              shoes? I love these shoes!”</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">As you walk the 
              path, the letting go happens naturally, just as your shoes wear away. You do not 
              need to make a dramatic statement by tossing them out; you just need to continue 
              on. The path that initially seemed so inviting and accommodating slowly and 
              surely begins to be more sandpapery and scrapes away tougher and tougher layers 
              of leather.</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">From beginning to 
              end, the path of dharma is about letting go. As we let go of one thing along the 
              way, we find ourselves attaching to the next. As we let go of gross attachments, 
              we find our more subtle attachments becoming heightened. For instance, we may 
              let go of clinging to material possessions, but then find ourselves totally 
              attached to our philosophy of simplicity. It is hard to let go of things, harder 
              to let go of ideas, and even harder to let go of spiritual pretensions. Over 
              time, as we familiarize ourselves with the many subtle twists and turns of 
              letting go, we begin to be more savvy about how ego steps in to appropriate the 
              entire process. In the millions of mini-decisions we make day by day and moment 
              by moment, we are challenged each time either to let go or to re-solidify. To 
              let go cleanly—without re-solidifying—we can practice what my teacher Chögyam 
              Trungpa Rinpoche referred to as “disowning”:</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Even though the 
              acceptance of what is happening may be confusing, just accept the given 
              situation and do not try to make it something else; do not try to make it into 
              an educational process at all. Just see it, perceive it, and then abandon it. If 
              you experience something and then disown that experience, you provide a space 
              between that knowledge and yourself, which permits it simply to take its 
              course.</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">The letting go 
              itself is not held, but immediately dropped. Then letting go becomes simple and 
              natural, like a snake shedding its skin.</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">The process of 
              letting go is a tender one. We should notice the poignancy and humor of this 
              very human struggle. It is less of a battle and more a path of acceptance and 
              accommodation to the natural arising and dissolving of our ordinary experience. 
              The two-step process—first letting go, and then letting go of the letting 
              go—allows us to approach the idea of letting go gently, precisely, step by step. 
              In doing so we see that even though we so often tend to re-solidify our 
              experience, between the letting go and the re-solidifying there are real 
              glimpses of openness.</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><strong><strong><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">ALTHOUGH LETTING 
              GO IS SOMETHING</span></span></strong></strong><span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">that happens all 
              along the Buddhist path, it tends to rise to the surface most vividly in 
              relation to death. When dealing with terminal illness, someone else’s or, 
              finally, our own, we are bluntly confronted with the ultimate futility of 
              holding onto anything. Our concept of our own mortality, once safely distant and 
              abstract, suddenly gets close and personal in the face of death, exposing 
              powerful emotional undercurrents and deep attachments. At this point, telling 
              someone to simply “let go” may not be very skillful or effective. The problem 
              with the phrase is that there seems to be something solid to let go of, and 
              someone solid to do the letting go. Furthermore, trying to force an experience 
              tends to be a stumbling block in terms of practice.</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Death has a way of 
              bringing us back to what is most essential. In the presence of death, I have 
              found that many extraneous concerns and preoccupations fall away quite simply 
              and naturally. A lot of letting go just happens, simply and effortlessly. So we 
              can approach death by attuning ourselves to its presence and all that it has to 
              teach us. In that heightened atmosphere, our own sticking points become more 
              obvious. In working with a dying individual, we can begin with our own letting 
              go—especially letting go of how we want that person to be. We can relax our 
              opinions and moral judgments as to how that person is going about dying. We can 
              be a more true support, less cluttered by our own fixations. On that basis, we 
              can encourage the dying person to use her remaining time to continue on her 
              journey—to let go of attachments and distractions, and at the same time to hold 
              what is truly meaningful.</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12.75pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; "><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">In terms of our 
              own practice, when we ourselves come to die, we can remain in the space between 
              holding on and letting go. In that space, you are not trying to get rid of 
              anything or force anything to happen. Instead, you are being present with 
              experience, whatever it is, as it arises and falls. Things go, accept that, be 
              with what is. Being present is the best way of letting go, and, curiously, as we 
              let go we become more present. It may even be possible, as Trungpa Rinpoche 
              suggested, to die with curiosity, and to breathe our last breath without 
              expectation or regret.</span></span></p>

              go is more than just relaxation. It is relaxation based on being in tune with 
              the environment, the world. One of the important principles of letting go is 
              living in the challenge. But this does not mean living with a constant crisis. 
              For example, suppose your banker calls and says that your account is overdrawn, 
              and the same day your landlord tells you that you are about to be evicted for 
              failing to pay your rent. To respond to this crisis, you get on the telephone 
              and call all your friends to see if you can borrow enough money to avert the 
              crisis. Living in the challenge is not based on responding to extraordinary 
              demands that you have created for yourself by failing to relate to the details 
              of your life. For the warrior, every moment is a challenge to be genuine, and 
              each challenge is delightful. When you let go properly, you can relax and enjoy 
              the challenge.</span></span></p>
