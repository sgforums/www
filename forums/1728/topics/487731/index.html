              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Published by </span><span class="author"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; "><a title="Brad" href="http://hardcorezen.info/author/brad"><span style="color: windowtext;">Brad</span></a></span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> on <abbr class="published" title="Sunday, February 15th, 2015, 2:22 pm">February
                                  15, 2015</abbr></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">QUESTIONER: Hello Mr. Warner. I have a question for
                                  you. Even though we are only human, after we get enlightened, is that supposed
                                  to change our life? For example, would I still be a Nazi after I get
                                  enlightened?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">ME: Are you a Nazi now?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">QUESTIONER: No, far from it. I tried to give an
                                  example. Let me try and reformulate. If a teacher is said to be enlightened but
                                  his deeds are … controversial, can we put his enlightenment to doubt? Is his
                                  enlightenment manifested in his deeds?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In one form or another, this is a question that has
                                  vexed spiritual seekers of every faith for as long as we have had spiritual
                                  seekers to be vexed about things.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The simplest answer I can give is that there is no
                                  spiritual experience that can zap a jerk and turn him instantly into a nice
                                  person. (Since the questioner’s example was male, I’ll continue to use a male
                                  example for simplicity’s sake, but what I’ll say here applies to all genders.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">I don’t like bringing Nazis into questions like these.
                                  I don’t like bringing Nazis anywhere, in fact. But since our questioner asked
                                  I’ll say that it is highly unlikely that one could be a Nazi and at the same
                                  time have what is commonly (and mistakenly) called an “enlightenment
                                  experience.” This is because being a Nazi requires a person to expend a huge
                                  amount of mental energy trying to justify actions that he knows intuitively to
                                  be wrong. Because of this, our hypothetical Nazi would almost certainly miss
                                  any kind of “enlightenment” that might come his way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">This is because enlightenment is not an experience. It
                                  is something we all possess. It is something we all </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    '>are</span></em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">.
                                  Even Nazis. This is where the answer starts to get very tricky.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Meditation is not a technique to bring about the
                                  experience of enlightenment. It is something you do to calm and quiet the mind
                                  enough that you might eventually, after lots of practice, begin to dimly
                                  discern the enlightenment that already exists and has been there since before
                                  you were born.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">There is nothing intrinsic to so-called “enlightenment
                                  experiences” that instantly fixes all the unfortunate shit you’ve ever done in
                                  your life, or erases all the unfortunate shit that’s been done to you. There
                                  are loads of koan stories about this. The most famous is usually called </span><a style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.zenguide.com/zenmedia/books/content.cfm?t=the_gateless_gate&amp;chapter=02"><span style="color: windowtext;">Hyakujo’s Fox</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> and it
                                  is koan #2 in the Mumonkan (Gateless Gate) collection. I wrote about this koan
                                  in my book </span><a style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1577315596/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1577315596&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hardzen-20&amp;linkId=K4LIA3BHLJOYZWJU"><span style="color: windowtext;">Sit Down and Shut Up</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The moral of this koan is that one is never free from
                                  cause and effect, no matter what kind of realization you have. So if you had </span><a style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rainbowcrab/16-strange-disturbing-sexual-fetishes-2xqn"><span style="color: windowtext;">dendrophilia</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> — which
                                  is a sexual fetish for trees, check the link if you don’t believe me — before
                                  realization, due to whatever it is in someone’s personal history that makes
                                  them have dendrophilia, you will still have dendrophilia after your experience
                                  of realization.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">You may have a better understanding of the true nature
                                  of your tree fetish and of your relationship to trees. You might come to
                                  understand the reasons why it may not be wise to engage in your tree fetish.
                                  You may understand the trauma you are causing to those poor trees or whatever.
                                  But that will not make your tree fetish magically disappear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">You also will not lose the capacity to mentally shout
                                  down your innate sense of ethics. We all have an innate, in-born sense of right
                                  and wrong. However, this in-born sense of right and wrong can get messed up in
                                  a lot of ways. Sometimes a person gets so damaged that it is much, much more difficult
                                  for them to respond to this in-born ethical sense than it is for the rest of
                                  us. We have names for people like that, such as “sociopath.” Yet even a person
                                  with that kind of damage can still sometimes learn to quiet his mind enough to
                                  notice the enlightenment which underlies his existence. It’s uncommon, but it
                                  happens.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Another point my questioner raises is the nature of
                                  ethical action. He starts off by using the example of a Nazi, who is a person
                                  that does terrible things by just about any standard of ethical behavior. But
                                  then he asks, “If a teacher is said to be enlightened but his deeds are …
                                  controversial, can we put his enlightenment to doubt?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I’m going to pass over the phrase “said to be
                                  enlightened” for the time being. But it’s crucial. Instead, let’s first focus
                                  on our hypothetical enlightened person doing deeds that are controversial. This
                                  presupposes that ethical behavior will always look to us like ethical behavior.
                                  That’s a tough call.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">We never know exactly what goes on in someone else’s
                                  life. So it’s very difficult to judge the ethics of another person except in
                                  extremely broad terms (see the discussion of Nazis above). You </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    '>can</span></em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> judge whether someone else’s
                                  conduct is problematic to the rest of society, though.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Your enlightened master’s dendrophilia is ultimately a
                                  matter between him and his chosen sycamore. However, if the sight of him
                                  nakedly humping trees outside the temple is disturbing to the community, they
                                  may have reason to ask him to stop. Most such controversial behavior works pretty
                                  much the same way. To take a more relevant example, if the enlightened master
                                  is </span><a style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.tricycle.com/blog/joshu-sasaki-roshi-rinzai-zen-master-dies-107"><span style="color: windowtext;">groping</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> people who do
                                  not want to be groped, it is right and proper to tell him to cut it out or, if
                                  he won’t cut it out, to tell him you’ll no longer be attending his lectures and
                                  retreats.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">But even such behavior does not necessarily mean that
                                  his experience of realization never happened or that his teachings regarding that
                                  aspect of his (and everyone else’s) life are false.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">On the other hand, there are people out there who are
                                  just plain nuts and somehow manage to convince lots of others that their
                                  nuttiness is an example of some kind of “crazy wisdom.” Without closely examining
                                  each individual who professes such things, it’s impossible to know for sure one
                                  way or the other. And frankly, I haven’t got time for that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Ultimately, I think what my questioner is asking is
                                  whether there is some quick easy way to tell if someone else’s claims of
                                  realization are genuine or not. The answer to that is simple; No, there isn’t.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">There are a few red flags that clue you in to the
                                  possibility that you’re being hoodwinked by a sociopath in pretty robes.
                                  Actions that appear to indicate a serious lack of ethics are indicators that
                                  maybe your enlightened master isn’t that enlightened after all. But that’s
                                  about as far as you can go. There’s no absolute test to see if someone’s
                                  supposed “enlightenment” is genuine, not even if he’s kind of an asshole.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 3.25pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; "><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In the Theravada tradition, an
              individual who has realized the lowest of the four noble paths, i.e. a stream
              enterer, is already considered a noble person, an enlightened individual. But he
              has not yet overcome completely the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> fetters of
              sensual desire and ill-will, two of the five lower fetters.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 3.25pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; "><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 3.25pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; "><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One can see that a so called enlightened
              person does not necessary means that they are free from defilements which were
              accumulated over their many pass lifetimes. Sutta SN 22.89 Khemaka Sutta points
              out those who have overcome the 5 lower fetters will still have, as described, ‘lingering
              residual scent of ‘I am’ present in them that requires continuous practice to
              overcome.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 3.25pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; "> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 3.25pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; "><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">Only Arahants will not cause taints
              to themselves by committing acts of defilements. AN 9.7 Sutava Sutta, points out
              the impossible acts of an Arahant. It shows the importance of the Buddhist five
              precepts.</span></p>
