              <p>On the auspicious day of Medicine Buddha, June 19, 2010 at 8:07pm, our most beloved teacher and one of the great scholars and masters in Nyingmapa Buddhism, Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche passed into parinirvana peacefully and beautifully. All stages of meditation were perfectly demonstrated according to the teachings of the Buddha and Guru Padmasambhava, and as Khenchen Rinpoche himself taught for so many years. He entered fearlessly without any emotion or attachment, joyfully and with confidence at his home, Arya Palo Ling, in the presence of his beloved brother, Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche, and Jomo Lorraine, and during the sangha’s practice of Vajrasattva in the glorious Copper-colored Temple at Palden Padma Samye Ling monastery. Surrounded by every lush spring quality of gentle breezes, birds singing, flowers blooming, and deer playing in the meadows, he remains in thugdam meditation.<br><br>Offering ceremonies began in India, Nepal, and Tibet immediately following Khenchen Rinpoche’s parinirvana, and beginning today we will hold 49 days of offering ceremonies at Palden Padma Samye Ling.</p>
              <p><a href="https://app.e2ma.net/app/view:CampaignPublic/id:10315.6707174925/rid:3983682e5df099bde7dfd82f43a06510">https://app.e2ma.net/app/view:CampaignPublic/id:10315.6707174925/rid:3983682e5df099bde7dfd82f43a06510</a><br><br>Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche was born on May 10, 1942 in the Dhoshul region of Kham, eastern Tibet, near the sacred mountain Jowo Zegyal. On the morning of his birth a small snow fell with the flakes in the shape of lotus petals. Among his ancestors were many great scholars, practitioners and treasure revealers.<br><br>His family was semi-nomadic, living in the village during the winter and moving with the herds to high mountain pastures where they lived in yak hair tents during the summers. The monastery for the Dhoshul region is called Gochen and his father's family had the hereditary responsibility for administration of the business affairs of the monastery. His grandfather had been both administrator and chant master in charge of the ritual ceremonies.<br><br>He started his education at the age of four at Gochen monastery, which was founded by Tsasum Lingpa. At the age of twelve he entered Riwoche Monastery and completed his studies just before the chinese invasion of Tibet reached the area. His root teacher was the illustrious Khenpo Tenzin Dragpa, Katog Khenpo Akshu.<br><br><br>In order to remember the sublime qualities of our most kind and humble teacher, here are a few excerpts from A Praise of the Venerable Lama Called the Melodious Words of the Ocean of Devotion, that Khenpo Pema Gyaltsen composed in the late 1990’s:<br><br>"Although dwelling primordially in the expanse of Samantabhadra,<br>You possess the magical display of most glorious VajrakumÄÂ�ra.<br>Maturing and liberating whomever, incomprehensible protector,<br>All-victorious embodiment of wisdom, to the lama I bow down.<br><br>From the rich, fertile soil of your positive merit and generosity,<br>The sweet smell of saffron arisen from your ethical discipline pervades.<br>Sovereign of realization arisen from meditation, full bloom of spring,<br>Endowed with the three grounds of positive merit, to the lama I bow down.<br><br>Steadfast, constant root of the wish-granting tree of the four immeasurables,<br>Luxuriant, full blossom of the activities of the six perfections,<br>Tending after others, the fruit of the four bodhisattva activities,<br>Beneficial action, glorious protector, to the lama I bow down.<br><br>Having abandoned long ago the obstacles to all objects of knowledge,<br>Teaching all the ways of Dharma to disciples of good fortune,<br>Just like a second Lord of Conquerors in the teachings of the Conqueror,<br>Bliss-gone one with perfect skill in the ten powers, to the lama I bow down.<br><br>The most beautiful moon, Manjushri, the wisdom of exalted knowledge,<br>Coming from the awakened mind of Chenrezig, the great compassion,<br>Just like Vajrapani, the power and might both unchallenged and unrivaled,<br>Living countenance that gathers the three families, savior, to the lama I bow down.<br><br>Listening, contemplation, and meditation, the three, vast as the rich Earth,<br>Teaching, debate, and composition, the three, resounding music everywhere,<br>Knowledge, virtue, and goodness, the three, dramatic play of Samantabhadra,<br>Perfect monarch of these nine excellent manners, to the lama I bow down.<br><br>Possessor of firm skill, virtue, and glory, great holder of the Vinaya,<br>With marvelous bodhichitta guiding wanderers, hero bodhisattva,<br>Completely, clearly realized in the four empowerments, great vidyÄÂ�dhara,<br>Crown ornament of all teachers, to the venerable lama I bow down."<br><br>Yours in the Dharma,<br>Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche<br><br>Message From Khenpo Guru<br><br>"Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche was one of the most senior and learned scholars among the Nyingma khenpos. In 1967, His Holiness Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche appointed Khen Rinpoche to head the department of Nyingma studies at the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies in Varanasi, India. Khen Rinpoche was the first so honored to hold this position. <br><br>Khen Rinpoche taught and served at the Institute for more than 18 years with great sincerity, success, and dedication. His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche was very pleased with Khen Rinpoche's service, as well as the high degree of dedication with which he carried out all of his duties. Khen Rinpoche always showed the greatest respect and worked in the most harmonious way with the Institute's administrators, Indian and Tibetan teachers, and all those who worked and studied there. Everyone within the Buddhist community has always had the most tremendous appreciation for Khen Rinpoche's great knowledge, and specifically with regard to the Ngagyur Nyingma tradition.<br><br>Khen Rinpoche was not only a great scholar but also a profoundly accomplished Dzogchen meditation master and practitioner. In his life, he benefited numerous beings throughout the world, as evidenced by the many dharma centers he established and his devoted disciples. In his memory and for the tireless kindness with which he taught and benefited us all, we can dedicate ourselves to carrying out the Vajrasattva practice and mantra accumulations as a means for purifying any violations of samaya that may have occurred. Also these recitations help to purify our own relationship with all of our spiritual teachers who have shown us such kindness as Khen Rinpoche who dedicated his life to teaching and benefiting so many of us.<br><br>Please send out an email to all of our centers to carry through these practices and also try to make lamp offerings as much as they can.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Khen "<br><br>May all beings benefit!</p>
