              <p>Hi all,<br> <br> Recently a devotee from a temple approached me to enter the their temple for some event to listen/pray.<br> Out of curiosity, I went in to the temple and to explore.<br> <br> During the visit, almost everyone inside the temple gave me a warmth 
              welcome and started to congratulate me which I'm not sure what is the 
              reason.<br> <br> I was then brought to another level and they asked to register my name. 
              Shortly while waiting, there is a person who briefed us about the Tian 
              Dao and talked about the life cycle(shen lao bing si) and also mentioned
               that Tian Dao will bypass the cycle by going to Tian straight upon 
              death.<br> <br> After the short introduction, they send us for some prayer thingy and we
               were asked to repeat what they said. During the debrief, they talked 
              about the triple gems thingy and heavenly secret thingy which cannot be 
              leaked.<br> <br> I find it amused and therefore went home and researched and realized that this seems to be related to Yi Guan Dao / Tian Dao.<br> I also found out that the consequences of leaking the triple gems will 
              be strike by lightning or something though I still saw someone make fun 
              and posted the secret prayer online though.<br> <br> After reading more on Yi Guan Dao / Tian Dao related stuffs, I find 
              myself quite uncomfortable especially on the heavenly secret and vowing 
              of keeping the secrets. As I heard true religion should not make someone
               to do such things? Some also mentioned that Yi Guan Dao is a cult 
              thingy.<br> <br> As my religion is buddhist since I was born though I don't really know 
              much about buddhism or pray often. I only know some on the teaching of 
              good value and karma thingy. Therefore would like to seek some guidances
               here.<br> <br> My questions here:<br> <br> 1) I do not wish to associate with Yi Guan Dao / Tian Dao. Can I safely withdraw myself from this or break the vow?<br> <br> 2) Can I seek forgiveness from my buddhist religion due to my  ignorance/lack of understanding?<br> <br> 3) I have actually left my contact to the devotee who brought me in and I
               should be expecting the contact soon. How do I reject nicely without 
              offending their religion/belief?<br> <br> I'm in confused state now. Hope someone can enlighten me or let me know 
              if I need to go to any recommended buddhist temple and talk to who on 
              this?<br> <br> Thanks.</p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Breaking a vow and get
              strike by lighting? It sounds rather ridiculous to me. You can tell that to a
              little child and frighten the hell out of him. To me it is just a silly little
              tactic to instill fear and guilt in a person so as to try to exert some control
              over the person. There is nothing for you to withdraw from, just do not visit
              their place of worship again. In some religions, the last physical stage to
              bring in the new converts is to get them to visit their place of worship. Just
              don’t go again.</span></p>

              buddhist religion due to my ignorance/lack of understanding?</span><span style="color: #1f497d;"></span></em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">There is no one all mighty
              being that you need to seek forgiveness from in Buddhism. It is not a religion
              of commandments. Just go and read up more on basic Buddhism for starter.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">To me a simple ‘no’ is
              good enough. You can always give whatever reason that is valid and compelling. Refrain
              from talking about the person faith, that way, there is nothing to offend at
              all. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Go to any Buddhist temples
              around where you a staying, you should be able to get some reading material and
              also courses available there. You may find some that may be of interest to you.
              Better still talk to the monks or members of the temple there. It would be
              useful and they may be able to assist you further.</span></p>
