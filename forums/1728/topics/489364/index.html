              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #363638;'>A friend of mine, who's a Christian and a
                  very insightful writer, recently wrote an article that started me thinking
                  about both Christianity and organized religion in general.  In his article
                  he asked a pivotal question that I believe goes right to the core of
                  Christianity - "What if Jesus was merely the teacher of a social gospel
                  and moral philosophy . . .?"<br> .<br>  In my opinion, that question captured the essence of what Jesus was all
                  about.  Jesus wasn't a superhuman; he was simply a very intelligent and
                  insightful human being, a philosopher. But after he espoused his philosophy,
                  ignorant, self-serving, and superstitious people - people who believed in
                  talking snakes - took his words out of context and turned him into some kind of
                  superhuman being, and gave him powers that contradicted the laws of nature, the
                  universe, common sense, and God.<br> .<br> If we hadn't been conditioned all our lives to believe in this counterintuitive
                  nonsense it would be clear to us that the Christian belief system holds just
                  about as much validity as voodoo: Dead men don't walk.  No man can walk on
                  the water. No man can tell the Red Sea to scoot over. And if Adam and Eve were
                  the first people on Earth, where did the people come from that Cain went to
                  live with after he slew Abel?<br> .<br> Take a moment to consider the following.  All of your religious beliefs
                  are merely an accident of birth?  If you'd been born in Israel, chances
                  are you'd be a Jew; if you'd been born in Iran you'd be a Muslim, or China, a
                  Buddhist.  So your religion isn't so much God-inspired as it is a result
                  of the environment that you were raised in. You were SOCIALIZED into believing
                  what you believe. Thus, if you truly believe that a person born in Israel,
                  Iran, or China, is going to Hell because they don't believe what you believe,
                  you're stupid. <br> .<br> This is a serious problem, because people are doing more "believing"
                  than thinking. Hoards of people are taking MAN'S word for the fact that the
                  Bible is "the word of God." So they're placing all of their
                  "faith" in MAN, not God - and a very evil man, at that. On the other
                  hand, we KNOW that God gave us our minds (By God, I mean whatever force is
                  responsible for the existence of the universe and what we consider reality).  So
                  we need to start using it.<br> .<br> Take Black people for example. Black people are some of the most devout
                  Christians in the world, even though they were taught Christianity while they
                  were tied up next to the mules - and every rule, law, and tenet of Christianity
                  was being brutally violated while they were being indoctrinated - yet, they
                  still believe it, that a blond haired, blue eyed Scandinavian was born in the
                  desert with supernatural powers. <br> <br> No wonder so many Black people are finding it so hard to get their act together;
                  they're walking around in a state of somnambulism, and it seems that the worse
                  they're treated, the more they cling to that ridiculous myth -
                   "Lord, please forgive the White boy who walked in our church and
                  blew nine of our member's brains out." The reason for that is simple.
                  They've been conditioned to believe that no matter how bad they're treated,
                  they shouldn't worry about it, because God is going to take care of them when
                  they die.  OH, REALLY!!!?  Then why is everybody else killing one
                  another trying to get theirs now - including their preachers?  It's the
                  perfect hustle - it keeps Black people docile, it keeps them thinking that the
                  worse their treated the more God is going to love them, and the powers that be
                  don't have to worry about anybody ever coming back and telling the people that
                  it's a lie.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #363638;'><br></span><span style="color: #363638; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Here's another thing that should be
                  considered. If God had decided to put religion on Earth to guide man, don't you
                  think he'd have had sense enough to create just ONE religion so religious dogma
                  wouldn't be the most hate-inspiring, murderous, and destructive forces on
                  Earth? Look around you - here in America, in the Middle East, and literally all
                  over the world - organized religion is THE  primary source of most of the
                   agony, pain, and misery on the planet. Thus, organized religion isn't a
                  blessing, it's a curse. Would a loving God place a curse like that on
                   mankind?  I don't think so. God gave us spirituality, which is found
                  within. It's a state if existence that's only between you, God, and the
                  universe. Man has absolutely nothing to do with it, because everything man
                  touches, he corrupts. God made birds to fly, fish to swim, and man to THINK,
                  not to follow a users guide written by other men.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #363638; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Man is much too ignorant, self-serving, and greedy to write anything sacred. Yes, man says the Bible was "inspired" by God, but he also said
                  that God told him in the Manifest Destiny to slaughter the Native Americans and
                  take their land, and Zionists are saying the very same thing with regard to the
                  Palestinians today.  Do you actually believe that God is telling them to
                  kill children? And what about Boko Haram, do you really believe God is telling
                  them to kidnap young women and sell them into sexual slavery because he doesn't
                  want women to get an education? That's not God saying that; that's self-serving
                  men placing their words and beliefs in God's mouth, and the exact same thing is
                  happening here in this country. Organized religion is man-made nonsense
                  designed to manipulate the ignorance of the masses and promote the prejudice
                  and greed of the elite.  You can trace virtually any form of bigotry in a
                  straight line right back to some form of religious dogma. So again, organized
                  religion is a curse on man, that's been created by man, and it's ultimately
                  going to lead to our destruction - even global warming is being defended in the
                  name of God.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #363638;'> .<br> About the Bible<br> .<br> The Bible that Christians Worship today was compiled and “bless” by the
                  Catholic Church, not God. Any book that disagreed with the Catholic Church was
                  banned. What Christians call "The Holy Bible," and what these
                  preachers run around thumping, wasn’t even put together until almost 400 years
                  after the death of Jesus. So everything in it is hearsay. In terms of years, at
                  the time the Bible was complied, they were twice as far away from the life and
                  times of Jesus Christ as we are away from George Washington today. So in
                  reality, they didn’t know fact from fiction, any more than we know whether or
                  not George Washington really chopped down a cherry tree:<br> .<br> "For the first 300 years of Christianity, there was no Bible as we know it
                  today. Christians had the Old Testament Septuagint, and literally hundreds of
                  other books from which to choose. The Catholic Church realized early on that it
                  had to decide which of these books were inspired and which ones weren't. The
                  debates raged between theologians, Bishops, and Church Fathers for several
                  centuries as to which books were inspired and which ones weren't. In the
                  meantime, several Church Councils or Synods, were convened to deal with the
                  matter, notably, Rome in 382, Hippo in 393, and Carthage in 397 and 419. The
                  debates sometimes became bitter on both sides. One of the most famous was
                  between St. Jerome, who felt the seven books were not canonical, and St.
                  Augustine who said they were. Protestants who write about this will invariably
                  mention St. Jerome and his opposition, and conveniently omit the support of St.
                  Augustine. I must point out here that Church Father's writings are not
                  infallible statements, and their arguments are merely reflections of their own
                  private opinions. When some say St. Jerome was against the inclusion of the
                  seven books, they are merely showing his personal opinion of them. Everyone is
                  entitled to his own opinion. However, A PERSONS PRIVATE OPINION DOES NOT CHANGE
                  THE TRUTH AT ALL. There are always three sides to every story, this side, that
                  side, and the side of truth. Whether Jerome's position, or Augustine's position
                  was the correct position, had to be settled by a third party, and that third
                  party was the Catholic Church.<br> .<br> "Now the story had a dramatic change, as the Pope stepped in to settle the
                  matter. In concurrence with the opinion of St. Augustine, and being prompted by
                  the Holy Spirit, Pope St. Damasus I, at the Council of Rome in 382, issued a
                  decree appropriately called, "The Decree of Damasus", in which he
                  listed the canonical books of both the Old and New Testaments. He then asked
                  St. Jerome to use this canon and to write a new Bible translation which
                  included an Old Testament of 46 books, which were all in the Septuagint, and a
                  New Testament of 27 books" (</span><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080928064041AATOZUD"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080928064041AATOZUD</span></a><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #363638;'>).<br> .<br> SO THE POPE HAD SPOKEN, AND THE ISSUE WAS SETTLED.
