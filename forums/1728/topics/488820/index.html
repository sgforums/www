              the great Tibetan saint Milarepa, we can learn to face our fears with clarity

              to know what is true. One of the essential elements of such a life is the
              understanding that everything we encounter—fear, resentment, jealousy,
              embarrassment—is actually an invitation to see clearly where we are shutting
              down and holding back. At some point we realize we can’t manipulate life to
              give us only what we want: the rug gets pulled out regularly. So what do we do?
              Although our deep-seated tendency is to reject the unwanted in an effort to
              prevent suffering, it turns out that all the ways we resist actually limit our
              lives, bringing us pain. And yet how do we find the courage to open to, and
              accept, all of what we are and all of what is arising in our body and mind? How
              do we tap the confidence to live with that kind of openness and receive what is
              arising in the moment, just as it is, with clarity and kindness? How do we let
              life, with all of its disappointments and sorrows soften our heart? In the
              Tibetan tradition there is a story about the great cave-dwelling yogi Milarepa
              that illuminates the often bumpy road we travel in the process of releasing
              resistance and making peace with ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>One day Milarepa left his cave to gather firewood, and when he returned
              he found that his cave had been taken over by demons. There were demons everywhere!
              His first thought upon seeing them was, “I have got to get rid of them!” He
              lunges toward them, chasing after them, trying forcefully to get them out of
              his cave. But the demons are completely unfazed. In fact, the more he chases
              them, the more comfortable and settled-in they seem to be. Realizing that his
              efforts to run them out have failed miserably, Milarepa opts for a new approach
              and decides to teach them the dharma. If chasing them out won’t work, then
              maybe hearing the teachings will change their minds and get them to go. So he
              takes his seat and begins teaching about existence and nonexistence, compassion
              and kindness, the nature of impermanence. After a while he looks around and
              realizes all the demons are still there. They simply stare at him with their
              huge bulging eyes; not a single one is leaving.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>At this point Milarepa lets out a deep breath of surrender, knowing now
              that these demons will not be manipulated into leaving and that maybe he has
              something to learn from them. He looks deeply into the eyes of each demon and
              bows, saying, “It looks like we’re going to be here together. I open myself to
              whatever you have to teach me.” In that moment all the demons but one
              disappear. One huge and especially fierce demon, with flaring nostrils and dripping
              fangs, is still there. So Milarepa lets go even further. Stepping over to the
              largest demon, he offers himself completely, holding nothing back. “Eat me if
              you wish.” He places his head in the demon’s mouth, and at that moment the
              largest demon bows low and dissolves into space.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>One of the things I love about this story is that it doesn’t feed our
              romantic vision of spiritual life. We sometimes imagine that if we just lead
              our spiritual life the “right” way, we won’t encounter life’s sharp edges. We will
              be on a direct path to ever-increasing tranquility and joy. We are not prepared
              for all of our unfinished business being exposed, all of our unresolved trauma
              pushing up from the depths like a geyser of black mud. The story of Milarepa
              feels much closer to the truth. Working with all that has been pushed down is a
              central part of the spiritual journey. And when those demons appear, it is not
              so easy to just relax and let go. We usually try a number of different
              approaches to get these uninvited guests to go back to the dungeon. This story
              takes us on a journey that includes the well-worn strategies and habitual
              maneuvers we attempt—and ultimately abandon—in the process of genuinely opening
              to ourselves and our lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The first stage of this journey is awareness. We begin to see what is
              happening. Milarepa comes back to his cave, and finds that it is full of
              demons—maybe they’ve been there all along, but now he clearly sees them. We
              experience this dawning recognition as we begin to see the things we have been
              running from, hiding from, or trying to push away. Our patterns of avoidance
              and denial can take so many different guises that often we don’t even really
              see them until our awareness begins to deepen. It may be 20 years before we
              realize, “Oh, I became a doctor because I wanted my parents’ approval.” Or “I
              am always taking care of people because I want others to need me.” Or “I was
              the life of the party because I felt empty inside.” A lot of times we look at
              the things that we do without recognizing that what’s really driving us is a
              need for approval, a need to be needed, or a need to fit in. And sometimes our
              most obvious destructive behaviors conceal something else that is even more
              difficult for us to acknowledge. We may, for example, be willing to acknowledge
              our anger, but unwilling to look at the fear and vulnerability beneath it. So
              we “work on our anger” without touching the raw place underneath.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I remember years ago when I was living with one of my closest friends
              how appalled I was when I realized how competitive I was with her. She was
              getting the attention I wanted for myself, and I was burning with jealousy and
              resentment. I thought of myself as a loving person who wanted the best for my
              friends, and the situation revealed a side of me I didn’t want to know. Even
              more upsetting was the growing realization that beneath that jealousy was a
              deep sense of unworthiness. I came to see that I craved that attention in order
              to feel good about myself, and not getting it felt annihilating. There was no
              escaping this situation—I felt like I was in a pressure cooker, and it was
              incredibly painful. But not being able to hide or run away, I gradually
              discovered what compassion for oneself really means, and how it really is the
              basis of an authentic and openhearted life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When we don’t acknowledge all of who we are, those unacknowledged parts
              will land in what Jung called the “shadow” that we then project onto others.
              This is one way of seeing Milarepa’s encounter with the demons. He was
              encountering his shadow—all that he had suppressed and rejected in himself—in
              the demons.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Often when a painful feeling arises, we short-circuit that experience;
              we don’t listen to it. We’re afraid to touch it. We turn on the television. We
              spend hours on the computer. We eat a bag of chips. We go to a movie. We shop.
              We drink too much. We find some way to keep ourselves busy and numb. We have
              many ways of distracting ourselves so that we don’t feel the full impact of
              pain. Instead of being accepted into consciousness, the feeling goes
              underground and enters the cells of our body. It doesn’t go away; it goes in.
              Anyone who has had deep body work, has done intensive meditation practice, or
              has engaged in somatic practices on their own has likely experienced how the
              body reveals our history in surprising—and sometimes unsettling—ways. Things
              we’ve long forgotten, our body remembers with impeccable accuracy. We may
              imagine that spiritual awakening is something separate from our physical
              embodiment, but awakening and embodiment go together. To be embodied isn’t just
              about feeling comfortable in our own skin—it’s about a complete opening to
              life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This is where awareness comes in. With awareness, even if we shut down,
              we see ourselves shutting down. That in itself begins to illuminate the
              territory. We may not be able to stop ourselves from doing the habitual thing,
              but we are watching ourselves do it. Most of us, when we do become aware of
              something unwanted in ourselves, have a knee-jerk reaction to it, and do just
              what Milarepa first did when he saw those demons. We ask, “How can I get rid of
              this thing?” This second stage on our journey is one of our habitual maneuvers.
              We see something, and if we don’t like what we see, we want to expel it. We
              recoil. We judge. We attack. I can’t begin to count the number of times I’ve
              sat with someone in therapy who wants me to help them figure out how to get rid
              of whatever they don’t like about themselves. And sometimes this tendency can
              be even worse in those with long years, even decades, of dedicated spiritual
              practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We come upon our greediness, jealousy, or impatience, and the next
              impulse is to go to war with it. We don’t realize that all the while we’re
              strengthening the thing we’re fighting against. It’s like trying to push a
              beach ball into the water. Holding it down requires a huge amount of energy,
              and inevitably it pops back up with equal force, taking an unpredictable
              direction. But if you give the beach ball space and let it be, it will float
              effortlessly along the surface.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Some years ago I read a piece by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche in which he
              described the spiritual warrior as someone who is not afraid of space—not
              afraid to experience oneself, and one’s world, fully. If we’re afraid of who we
              are, we continually feel frantic about filling that space, anything to avoid
              that persistent unease beneath the surface of our lives. The fearlessness of
              the warrior comes from stepping again and again into open space, with body,
              breath, and heart exposed. It is the fearlessness that is willing to be
              intimate with fear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As Milarepa’s story unfolds, we find that there is a discovery process
              at work. When the direct attack fails, as it inevitably does, he tries another
              approach—indirect manipulation. He begins this third stage when he decides,
              “I’m going to teach these demons the dharma.” There is subtle fix-it energy at
              work here. The indirect manipulation looks like a greater acceptance and
              accommodation, but it is still rooted in the rejection of experience. We are
              still bent on avoiding and getting rid of what we don’t like. We still don’t
              want to face our most undesirable parts, and we’re secretly hoping that maybe
              we can pass directly into freedom without doing that. There is a lot of room
              for self-deception here; this is where we can get caught in spiritual
              bypassing. We begin to use our spiritual practices and all the things we’ve
              learned to perpetuate a disconnection from experience and a disembodiment from
              life. Our idealized image of what it means to be a spiritual person doesn’t
              allow for self-knowledge that contradicts it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So the ego moves into a high-rise. It’s possible to live for a long time
              in a luxurious penthouse in the ego’s high-rise, while all the lower floors are
              rotting and decaying. If you’re lucky, before you die the whole thing will
              collapse and you’ll find yourself on the ground. The transcendence experienced
              at the level of ego’s high-rise is not embodied. It has not penetrated the
              matter of our lives. The “gone beyond” of prajnaparamita, the perfection of
              wisdom, is not this. True transcendence is the deepest form of intimacy because
              nothing is excluded from its embrace. Transcendence is union. In the union of
              form and emptiness, our bodies and minds and the whole phenomenal world are not
              rejected but rather are found to be direct expressions of the sacred. In
              spiritual bypassing we use spiritual practices and beliefs to avoid dealing
              with our painful feelings, unresolved wounds, and basic needs. Avoiding our
              full humanity actually stunts our spiritual growth and prevents real spiritual
              maturity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>There was an article a few years ago in <em>The New York Times Magazine </em>called
              “Enlightenment Therapy,” about a Western Zen master who had his high-rise
              collapse. After living for decades in what seemed to be a highly actualized
              spiritual consciousness, he began experiencing terrible depression,
              debilitating anxiety, and dark despair. His decades of meditation had not
              healed his core psychological wounds, and his life was coming apart. In
              desperation he went to see a therapist, and gradually he was able to open to
              and heal some of the profoundly fragmenting trauma that he’d experienced in his
              early life. His depth of meditation had allowed him to “rise above” these
              wounds until one day the wolves of his undigested pain came howling at his
              door. He understood, over time, that his “talent” for enlightenment experience
              was in part an expression of the ability he had developed early in life to
              dissociate from pain. Through opening to these buried conflicts he was able to
              move toward a genuine friendship with himself, and a more authentic wholeness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This capacity to see every situation in our life as our path marks a
              shift from willfulness to willingness. This is the fourth stage in the story.
              Milarepa relinquishes his solutions and strategies and surrenders to the
              presence of the demons, and to whatever they may have to teach him. At this
              point we begin to see everything that arises as an opportunity to deepen our
              understanding and to soften our heart. We view our life situations as
              inherently workable. We are willing to be with our experience, whatever it is,
              without judgment, without trying to fix it or get rid of it. And somehow this
              willingness, this gentle allowing, starts to calm things down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In order to be with ourselves in this complete way, we need to be in
              contact with our inner resources of self-compassion and lovingkindness. Our
              capacity to turn toward whatever scares or repels us, and remain present with
              it, depends on our access to inner goodness. When we are able to connect with
              this ground of inner goodness, it brings a level of confidence and ease that
              can embrace our full humanity in all its complexity. Without that, we won’t be
              able to stay with whatever’s arising. This connection to our inner goodness is
              like the rope a rock climber uses to stay in contact with the steep rock face.
              Without that rope of connection, we can free-fall into self-blame and
              self-hatred and actually intensify the existing wound. Transitioning into this
              fourth stage requires a bone-deep commitment to honesty. We really have to be
              willing to look at ourselves, and this takes guts. We aren’t going to run away
              even if we see a demon staring back at us in the mirror. We are going to stick
              with ourselves no matter what, because we are more interested in what is true
              than in what is comfortable. As we begin to really look into our lives we ask,
              and want to know, “What is this uneasiness I don’t want to touch?” “What is
              this unhappiness that is always there despite all my accomplishments?” “What is
              this anxiety that is always humming beneath the surface of my life?” We have
              the courage and strength to move toward that which we may have spent a lifetime
              hiding from.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Jung commented that we don’t become enlightened by imagining beings of
              light but by making the darkness conscious. That is the work at this stage of
              the journey. We’re retrieving all the lost and exiled places in our lives. In
              truth, it is life returning for itself. In our willingness to open, we are
              returning for the life that is still waiting to be received. All that we pushed
              aside is ever waiting to be received into the arms of our clear-seeing
              tenderness. Rumi said, “When you embrace hurt, it becomes joy.” Is this true?
              What happens if we soften toward something when we would usually harden? At
              this fourth stage, we begin to risk exploring the forsaken landscape of our
              lives. This terrain can be highly charged, and sometimes we find we don’t have
              the resources in a given moment to move any closer. We get overwhelmed, and our
              brain starts melting out our ears, our belly starts to flip, we want to vomit,
              and our whole system feels like it’s crashing. So we are present to that. We
              reconnect with our inner goodness, deepening our confidence, our well-being,
              and sense of basic trust. And then we try again. We discover that the journey
              is a dynamic process, full of alternating successes and failures. And we discover
              that failures are not dead ends. Every time we’re up against the wall, we’re
              also standing at a threshold. The invitation to open to our experience—whatever
              it is from moment to moment—is always there, no matter how many times we need
              to rediscover it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This ultimately brings us to the fifth and final stage of complete
              letting go, where all resistance is gone. We no longer demand that life be on
              our terms. Instead, we begin living with the understanding that the source of
              wisdom is in whatever is in front of us—it is in whatever is arising in this
              moment. Wisdom is not somewhere else. It’s not in someone else. It’s right here
              in our own bottomless heart.</span></p>

              back and places himself in the largest demon’s mouth. The demon dissolves into
              space. In this space, wakefulness radiates with an unconditioned compassion
              that, in the words of the late Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck, “goes against
              nothing and fulfills everything.”</span></p>
