              husband, Harry, since Harry’s heart transplant a few weeks back. His recovery
              had been lengthier and rockier than expected, but he was finally getting ready
              to go home. Faye was Catholic; Harry had promised her that he’d convert if he
              recovered. We joined hands and offered prayers of thanks to God the Father,
              Christ his Son, and the Blessed Virgin Mary. We vowed to do our best to benefit
              those less fortunate than ourselves. “You’re my rock, Chaplain Pamela,” Faye
              said. “Your faith has carried us through. I’ll miss you.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">As usual, I vacillated between gratitude that I could be of any help at
              all to people facing such trials, and the sense that I was pulling one over on
              good, unsuspecting folk who assumed I was as Christian as they. Could I—a JewBu
              chaplain-in-training unversed in Christianity—get away with praying out loud to
              Judeo-Christian gods while envisioning soothing waves of lovingkindness pouring
              forth from Avalokiteshvara? I didn’t know <em>any </em>of the standard prayers by
              heart and was ever pulling out my dog-eared prayer booklet. Was I an interfaith
              chaplain or a Buddhist chaplain? Would I ever feel qualified to be a chaplain
              at all? Three intense months of Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) in
              Philadelphia some summers ago left most questions dangling. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">An increasing number of Americans who identify as Buddhist are becoming
              involved in chaplaincy, notably (but not exclusively) in hospitals, hospices,
              and prisons. Many inspiring spiritual leaders and practitioners have translated
              their commitment to dharma into palliative and end-of-life care for patients
              and their loved ones, or applied it to the experience of incarceration. The
              mindfulness movement is also very present in modern chaplaincy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">As it happens, dharma and chaplaincy are a great fit. So what do
              chaplains do? We bear witness, we breathe in, we breathe out, and sometimes we
              pray. We accompany patients, families, hospital personnel. We bless police
              officers and criminals. We teach prisoners to meditate. We conduct christenings
              and funerals and weddings. Above all, we listen. Incredible, isn’t it, that one
              might actually make a living doing this?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Typically, however, the geist and language of chaplaincy are patently
              theistic, even when there’s an effort to be inclusive. <em>Merriam-Webster’s
              Collegiate Dictionary </em>defines a chaplain as “a priest or other Christian
              religious leader who performs religious services for a military roup (such as
              the army) or for a prison, hospital, etc.” Ciao-ciao rabbis, imams, roshis, and
              the rest of us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">My first interview in Philly was conducted by three white Christian
              clergymen. Earnest, kind, and intrigued by my candidacy, they said, “We haven’t
              had many Buddhist applicants, and we’re not too clear on Buddhist doctrine.”
              “Well,” I began, “there are probably as many forms of Buddhist doctrine as
              there are of Christian doctrine . . .” “And in all of them there’s no God?”
              “You could probably say that the different forms of Buddhism agree that there’s
              no omnipotent creator God. But there’s not nothing, either.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Pause.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">They looked at me quizzically before the youngest finally voiced the
              question. “Then who,” he asked, arms wide, embracing the world, “created all
              this?” “Ignorance,” I let slip. Seeing their faces, I laughed and adjusted my
              answer: “That is, our minds create all this through habits and tendencies. But
              that’s another story.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Later, when one of our chaplaincy externs, a white-haired gentleman
              named Isaiah who had once been a Catholic priest, told me he was a Buddhist
              too, I happily imagined I’d found a kindred spirit. But when I also heard him
              tell Jews that Judaism grabbed him, Muslims that he was interested in Islam,
              and Pentecostals that he was born-again, it nettled. Isaiah was gentle,
              erudite, and uncommonly protean. In the same way that identical twins throw me
              off because it can be difficult to tell them apart or identify them, I couldn’t
              place him. If you’re a Buddhist, you’re a Buddhist, right?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">It’s no secret that identification is designed to pigeonhole rather than
              to foster an open mind; I like to think that definitions and beliefs are secondary
              to experience. But on the floors, I belatedly began paying closer attention to
              just how deeply embedded my own belief system is. Why do I automatically circle
              clockwise, notice the number 108, hold my rosary in my left hand? Why do I sing
              for rebirth in the Pure Realm, scoff at the notion that mind is a by-product of
              matter, avoid touching the lower parts of a dying person’s body, and presume
              that there is continuity beyond physical death?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">During my last overnight on-call in Philadelphia, there were three
              requests for a Buddhist chaplain. Two Buddhists, Laotian and Western, were
              dying; a Korean woman had just learned that her cancer had returned. During
              debriefing the following morning, the august head of the chaplaincy department
              said that in all his years at the hospital, calls for Buddhist chaplains had
              been few and far between; it was providential indeed that a Buddhist was
              attending during this atypical night.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Having recently begun a yearlong chaplain residency, I’m giving myself
              space to unravel the identity question. These days, I tend to think that Isaiah
              got it right. As bodhisattvas in training, what if we simply tried to follow
              Shantideva’s lead?</span></p>
