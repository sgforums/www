              <p><span id="textNode_25977070" class="threadText">Hi -- I'm new to the 
              site and find the discussions here interesting and lively.<br><br>Kenneth
               writes in the "2nd Gear" article: "Tasks that require dualistic 
              thinking (writing this message, for example) can be effectively 
              accomplished from the witness state, and with practice it gets easier 
              and easier..."<br><br>With fewer commitments than usual in the week 
              ahead, I am interested in practicing with the witness state while 
              engaged in activities like writing, reading, speaking, listening, doing 
              the dishes, making decisions, etc.  The witness state is a familiar one 
              in meditation, on retreat and even in the 'still moments' of daily life.
                However, the witness state falls rapidly into the background once I 
              engage in activities, especially when there's a sense of time pressure 
              (a time pressure with the identification of me, mine or my ; ) ).<br><br>It
               seems easy enough to say: Stay focused on the sense of 'I' that is 
              witnessing in the midst of doing or keep asking 'Who am I?'  However, I 
              find, in the midst of doing, that the attention keeps leaving the sense 
              of 'I' or the continuity of inquiry fades out.  So, is the guidance that
               when there's noticing that the attention has left the witness, the 
              attention is returned to the 'I'/witness -- over and over again? ...just
               like bringing attention back to the the breath in anapanasati, for 
              instance.<br><br>I would like to hear from others about how they work 
              with 2nd Gear off the cushion in as much detail as they're willing to 
              share.  Any tools or devices that you find especially useful?  More to 
              say about this kind of practicing?  Hope this line of questioning makes 
              some sense.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Aaron</span></p>

              technique. If you have a less-than-challenging week ahead, you can 
              prioritize the Witness and let everything else go on in the background. 
              Of course you will forget a million times, but as you have pointed out, 
              you can always return. In fact, the attitude you describe is crucial; 
              since, for some period of time, you have chosen to prioritize the 
              Witness, it doesn't really matter whether you accomplish anything else 
              or not. Keep the Witness in the foreground as much as possible, and slow
               down everthing else until it becomes possible to stay with the Witness 
              even as you do other tasks. I am experimenting with this right now as I 
              write this, and I see that the slower I type, the less I lose focus on 
              the witnessing consciousness. I am in the middle of my work day, so this
               is challenging, but once the momentum builds it becomes possible to 
              dwell continuously as the Witness for longer and longer periods of time.<br><br>The
               beauty of 2nd Gear practice is that instead of an infinite number of 
              changing objects, you have only one. Everything appears to be contained 
              within pure subjectivity. Because there is no jumping from object to 
              object, it's easier for the mind to stay in one place. This focused 
              awareness leads to development of the kundalini energy within the 
              mind/body and also provides a jumping-off place from which to realize 
              nondual awareness.<br><br>Kenneth</span></p>

              the 3-Speed Transmission is "dwelling as the Witness." The first thing 
              to know about the "Witness" is that it isn't what it appears to be. In 
              other words, although there is, in every moment of conventional 
              experience, a sense that there is an "I" who knows the experience, this 
              "I" is actually a fiction, a fabrication of mind. One way to see through
               this apparent watcher is to become absorbed into it, understanding that
               it will eventually collapse of its own accord. Ramana Maharshi referred
               to the Witness as "the stick that stirs the fire and is eventually 
              consumed by it." When the Witness dissolves, you will find that you have
               naturally arrived at 3rd Gear, the direct apprehension of buddha nature
               in your own being.<br><br>With this in mind, dwelling as the Witness is
               seen as a transitional step. It could be said to lie halfway between 
              1st Gear and 3rd Gear, halfway between the object-oriented practices of 
              concentration/insight and the complete surrender to what is, also known 
              as non-duality. Since it takes a great deal of concentration to become 
              absorbed into the sense of "I," this practice kills two birds with one 
              stone; it serves as a transition to recognizing buddha nature while at 
              the same time strengthening your ability to concentrate. As 
              concentration is essential to progress through the Insight Knowledges 
              (ñanas) and Realms of Absorption (jhanas), this technique of dwelling as
               the Witness is a very streamlined way to both Realization of what is 
              always already the case (3rd Gear) <em>and </em>developmental 
              enlightenment (1st Gear).<br><br>How to dwell as the Witness:<br><br>As 
              you go about your daily life and as you sit on the meditation cushion, 
              ask yourself the question, "Who am I?" Don't try to answer it with 
              trivialities like "I am Joe," etc. The question is just a pointer to get
               you to notice who it is that seems to be having this experience. As you
               ask this question, "Who am I?" you might get a flash of something like 
              "I" as an answer.<br><br>"Who am I?"<br><br>"I, that's who! I am I!"<br><br>OK,
               that's what we're looking for. You don't have to go beyond that. That 
              sense of "I" is the very Witness we are seeking. You don't need to 
              debunk the Witness. This is a self-debunking practice; all you have to 
              do is become absorbed into this sensation of "I, I" and enjoy it. You 
              will find that it is very enjoyable indeed, as this apparent "I" has no 
              stake in anything that goes on; it is just an impassive witness. 
              Continue to become ever-more-deeply absorbed into this sense of "I", 
              understanding that someday it will dissolve of its own accord, leaving 
              only pure, non-local awareness. At that point, you will have arrived at 
              3rd Gear.<br><br>One of the things I most want to communicate to people 
              is that when we talk about the witness we aren't being poetic or 
              metaphorical; the "witness" is a clear, discreet, recognizable, and 
              reproducible state that can be mastered with practice. Once mastered, it
               becomes one of the most empowering tools in a yogi's toolbox. Not only 
              does it pave the way to direct realization of the non-dual, it is 
              valuable in its own right as a way to maintain a connection with 
              awareness while going about daily life activities.<br> <br>I think of an
               hourglass, turned on its side. On one side of the hourglass is the 
              non-dual. If all of the sand has gone to that side, there is only the 
              perfection of primordial awareness, which pervades, includes, and gives 
              rise to all things. This is the most precious jewel of all the Buddhas, 
              but does not lend itself to productivity or even functionality in modern
               daily life; we can only practice the non-dual when we don't have any 
              other cognitively demanding tasks to attend to. On the other end of the 
              hourglass is duality; when all the sand has moved to that side of the 
              glass, the apparent self has completely lost touch with the greater 
              reality and sees itself as cut off and separate from the whole. Although
               it is possible to be extremely productive in terms of daily life 
              activities while isolated in this way (indeed, most people will spend 
              their entire lives in the thrall of duality), the price to be paid for 
              such a productive life is a horrendous amount of suffering. In the 
              middle, in the narrow part of the hourglass, is the Witness. Experience 
              is somewhat limited here, consistent with the narrowness of the glass; 
              everything is seen as self. There is only pure subjectivity. All of the 
              usual objects of consciousness are present, but they are not seen as 
              Other. As such, the Witness is upstream from suffering. In other words, 
              suffering, which is part and parcel of our ordinary dualistic condition,
               has not yet arisen during the witness state. And yet, unlike the full 
              experience of non-duality, it's possible to do most daily tasks while 
              dwelling as the Witness. Tasks that require dualistic thinking (writing 
              this message, for example) can be effectively accomplished from the 
              witness state, and with practice it gets easier and easier. The 
              flexibility of the witness state, lying as it does halfway in between 
              the dual and the non-dual, makes it possible to remain functional in 
              daily life while staying poised at the very gates of primordial 
              awareness, ready to tip over at a moments notice into what the Dzogchen 
              masters call The Great Perfection. Because of its ability to serve as a 
              bridge between the unborn and the manifest along with the practical 
              value that goes along with that bridge status, I can scarcely imagine a 
              more useful or empowering tool for those of us who have chosen to pursue
               awakening while living as householders.<br><br>Kenneth Folk<br>July
