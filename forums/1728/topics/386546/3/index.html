              <p>Sages appear only to help us realise our true nature and let go
              of all self attachment, not to cause further attachment, and that
              is the point. If we mistake the finger for the moon, then we
              fail.</p>
              <p>In Christianity, the highest goal is to achieve union with
              Christ. It is realising in direct experience what Christ is,
              without a dualistic relationship (I and God) but rather, the
              dissolving of the 'me' into Christ - <em>I have been crucified
              with</em> Christ; it is <em>no longer I who live</em>, but
              <em>Christ lives</em> in me. (Galatians 2:20)</p>
              <p>The cross is the symbol of such a crucification, but if they do
              not 'crucify with Christ' but instead treat the cross as some
              special symbol to attach to or wear on their necks or whatever,
              then that's mistaking the finger for the moon.</p>
              <p>There is something by Eckhart Tolle which I think is good, even
              though it is not Buddhist, it can lead to an important
              realisation.</p>
              <p>From 'The Power of Now', Eckhart
              Tolle<strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Christ: The Reality Of Your Divine Presence</strong></p>
              <p><br> Don't get attached to any one word. You can substitute "Christ" for
              presence, if that is more meaningful to you. Christ is your God
              essence or the Self, as it is sometimes called in the East. The
              only difference between Christ and presence is that Christ refers
              to your indwelling divinity regardless of whether you are conscious
              of it or not, whereas presence means your awakened divinity or
              God-essence.</p>
              <p>Many misunderstandings and false beliefs about Christ will clear
              if you realize that there is no past or future in Christ. To say
              that Christ was or will be is a contradiction in terms. Jesus was.
              He was a man who lived two thousand years ago and realized divine
              presence, his true nature. And so he said: "Before Abraham was, I
              am." He did not say: "I already existed before Abraham was born."
              That would have meant that he was still within. the dimension of
              time and form identity. The words I am used in a sentence that
              starts in the past tense indicate a radical shift, a discontinuity
              in the temporal dimension. It is a Zen-like statement of great
              profundity. Jesus attempted to convey directly, not through
              discursive thought, the meaning of presence, of self realization.
              He had gone beyond the consciousness dimension governed by time,
              into the realm of the timeless. The dimension of eternity had come
              into this world. Eternity, of course, does not mean endless time,
              but no time. Thus, the man Jesus became Christ, a vehicle for pure
              consciousness. And what is God's self-definition in the Bible? Did
              God say "I have always been, and I always will be?" Of course
              not.That would have given reality to past and future. God said: "I
              AM THAT I AM." No time here, just presence.</p>
              <p>The "second coming" of Christ is a transformation of human
              consciousness, a shift from time to presence, from thinking to pure
              consciousness, not the arrival of some man or woman. If "Christ"
              were to return tomorrow in some externalized form, what could he or
              she possibly say to you other than this: "I am the Truth. I am
              divine presence. I am eternal life. I am within you. I am here. I
              am Now."</p>
              <p>Never personalize Christ. Don't make Christ into a form
              identity. Avatars, divine mothers, enlightened masters, the very
              few that are real, are not special as persons. Without a false self
              to uphold, defend, and feed, they are more simple, more ordinary
              than the ordinary man or woman. Anyone with a strong ego would
              regard them as insignificant or, more likely, not see them at
              all.</p>
              <p>If you are drawn to an enlightened teacher, it is because there
              is already enough presence in you to recognize presence in another.
              There were many people who did not recognize Jesus or the Buddha,
              as there are and always have been many people who are drawn to
              false teachers. Egos are drawn to bigger egos. Darkness cannot
              rec-ognize light. Only light can recognize light. So don't believe
              that the light is outside you or that it can only come through one
              particular form. If only your master is an incarnation of God, then
              who are you? Any kind of exclusivity is identification with form,
              and identification with form means ego, no matter how well
              disguised.</p>
              <p>Use the master's presence to reflect your own identity beyond name
              and form back to you and to become more intensely present yourself.
              You will soon realize that there is no "mine" or "yours" in
              presence. Presence is one.</p>
              <p>Group work can also be helpful for intensifying the light of your
              presence. A group of people coming together in a state of presence
              generates a collective energy field of great intensity. It not only
              raises the degree of presence of each member of the group but also
              helps to free the collective human consciousness from its current
              state ofmind dominance. This will make the state of presence
              increasingly more accessible to individuals. However, unless at
              least one member of the group is already firmly established in it
              and thus can hold the energy frequency of that state, the egoic
              mind can easily reassert itself and sabotage the group's endeavors.
              Although group work is invaluable, it is not enough, and you must
              not come to depend on it. Nor must you come to depend on a teacher
              or a master, except during the transitional period, when you are
              learning the meaning and practice of presence.</p>

              <p>No, giving them a short answer will do, like anything in place of Christ itself can be an obscuration to the true Spirit of Christ which has no form. If you focus on a representation of Christ instead of on the Christ itself, it becomes idolatry. It is not the statue or the cross or the whatever that is the problem but the mindset of the Christian.</p>
              <p>For example someone in the internet said,</p>
              <p><em><br> My argument is simple. When one uses a crucifix as a physical symbol of
                                          faith, that person is practicing idolatry by using the idol (crucifix)
                                          as the focus of the reverence. When a Christian grabs his / her
                                          crucifix necklace to gain comfort in times of trial, he or she is in
                                          effect worshiping the crucifix, thereby practicing idolatry.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for whether they are experiencing divinity, as long as there is still a sense of doubt or a sense of 'me' being separate from Christ, or a sense of 'me' at all that experiences Christ, then one is still in doubt and delusion of the ego, or false identification with the small self identified with the mind and body. Union means there is no separation of you and Christ, no more illusion of a separate me, that false sense of identity has dissolved back to the Source, leaving only Christ itself. "The great I AM, the pure radical subjectivity or witness" -- that which alone cannot be doubted. (See <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/some-writings-on-non-duality-by-ken.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/some-writings-on-non-duality-by-ken.html</a>) It is not that it is a special experience, but is already the <strong>Ground of Being</strong>/all experiences, the source of all creation at all times. There is a pure certainty of being, having touched the ground/source of which everything emerges from and subsides while the ground itself remains unmoved. You will also understand what German writer and theologian Meister Eckhart mean by '“The <em>eye</em> with which I <em>see</em> God is the same <em>eye</em> with which God sees me”'</p>
              <p>As I wrote in another forum:<em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>You can't run away from You, for that attempt to run away is simply a
                                  thought arising in the clear presence of You. Even if one wants to
                                  doubt that I AM Presence, that I AM Presence is present as that to
                                  which the doubting arises, and that is undeniable, so the doubt is
                                  without basis. So it is certainly not just an experience that is
                                  available at a particular meditative state or a particular experience,
                                  it just goes unnoticed for most people whose attention is almost
                                  constantly fixated on and chasing after their conceptual notion of self
                                  and things. But Presence can never be lost anytime (it is timeless) and
                                  that is not separate at all from you -- It cannot be made an object of
                                  observation from a point of view of an observer, for you are never
                                  separate from IT -- this Presence that you are, being of the nature of
                                  cognizance is Self-Knowing. Therefore as I state earlier, that pure I
                                  AMness is non-dual, non-separate. For it is YOU/I, so when one who
                                  realises it feels that he/she has touched his innermost core of being.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also you will know what 'God' is without a doubt:</p>
              <p><em>(Thusness)</em></p>
              <p><em><br> Like a river flowing into the ocean, the self dissolves into
                                              nothingness. When a practitioner becomes thoroughly clear about the
                                              illusionary nature of the individuality, subject-object division
                                              does not take place. A person experiencing Â“AMnessÂ” will find
                                              Â“AMness in everythingÂ”. What is it like?<br><br> Being free individuality -- coming and going, life and death, all
                                              phenomenon merely pop in and out from the background of the AMness.
                                              The AMness is not experienced as an Â‘entityÂ’ residing anywhere,
                                              neither within nor without; rather it is experienced as the ground
                                              reality for all phenomenon to take place. Even the moment of
                                              subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that
                                              reality; experiencing the Â‘RealÂ’ as clear as it can be. We cannot
                                              lose that AMness; rather all things can only dissolve and
                                              re-emerges from it. The AMness has not moved, there is no coming
                                              and going. This "AMness" is Â“GodÂ”. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is not Buddhist teaching, so I am getting a little off topic.</p>

              <p>No, giving them a short answer will do, like anything in place
              of Christ itself can be an obscuration to the true Spirit of Christ
              which has no form. If you focus on a representation of Christ
              instead of on the Christ itself, it becomes idolatry. It is not the
              statue or the cross or the whatever that is the problem but the
              mindset of the Christian.</p>
              <p>For example someone in the internet said,</p>
              <p><em><br> My argument is simple. When one uses a crucifix as a physical
              symbol of faith, that person is practicing idolatry by using the
              idol (crucifix) as the focus of the reverence. When a Christian
              grabs his / her crucifix necklace to gain comfort in times of
              trial, he or she is in effect worshiping the crucifix, thereby
              practicing idolatry.</em></p>

              <p>As for whether they are experiencing divinity, as long as there
              is still a sense of doubt or a sense of 'me' being separate from
              Christ, or a sense of 'me' at all that experiences Christ, then one
              is still in doubt and delusion of the ego, or false identification
              with the small self identified with the mind and body. Union means
              there is no separation of you and Christ, no more illusion of a
              separate me, that false sense of identity has dissolved back to the
              Source, leaving only Christ itself. "The great I AM, the pure
              radical subjectivity or witness" -- that which alone cannot be
              doubted. (See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/some-writings-on-non-duality-by-ken.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/some-writings-on-non-duality-by-ken.html</a>)
              It is not that it is a special experience, but is already the
              <strong>Ground of Being</strong>/all experiences, the source of all
              creation at all times. There is a pure certainty of being, having
              touched the ground/source of which everything emerges from and
              subsides while the ground itself remains unmoved. You will also
              understand what German writer and theologian Meister Eckhart mean
              by '“The <em>eye</em> with which I <em>see</em> God is the same
              <em>eye</em> with which God sees me”'</p>
              <p>As I wrote in another forum:<em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>You can't run away from You, for that attempt to run away is
              simply a thought arising in the clear presence of You. Even if one
              wants to doubt that I AM Presence, that I AM Presence is present as
              that to which the doubting arises, and that is undeniable, so the
              doubt is without basis. So it is certainly not just an experience
              that is available at a particular meditative state or a particular
              experience, it just goes unnoticed for most people whose attention
              is almost constantly fixated on and chasing after their conceptual
              notion of self and things. But Presence can never be lost anytime
              (it is timeless) and that is not separate at all from you -- It
              cannot be made an object of observation from a point of view of an
              observer, for you are never separate from IT -- this Presence that
              you are, being of the nature of cognizance is Self-Knowing.
              Therefore as I state earlier, that pure I AMness is non-dual,
              non-separate. For it is YOU/I, so when one who realises it feels
              that he/she has touched his innermost core of being.</em></p>
              <p>And also you will know what 'God' is without a doubt:</p>
              <p><em>(Thusness)</em></p>
              <p><em>Like a river flowing into the ocean, the self dissolves into
              nothingness. When a practitioner becomes thoroughly clear about the
              illusionary nature of the individuality, subject-object division
              does not take place. A person experiencing Â“AMnessÂ” will find
              Â“AMness in everythingÂ”. What is it like?<br> <br> Being free individuality -- coming and going, life and death, all
              phenomenon merely pop in and out from the background of the AMness.
              The AMness is not experienced as an Â‘entityÂ’ residing anywhere,
              neither within nor without; rather it is experienced as the ground
              reality for all phenomenon to take place. Even the moment of
              subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that
              reality; experiencing the Â‘RealÂ’ as clear as it can be. We cannot
              lose that AMness; rather all things can only dissolve and
              re-emerges from it. The AMness has not moved, there is no coming
              and going. This "AMness" is Â“GodÂ”. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></em></p>
              <p>This is not Buddhist teaching, so I am getting a little off
              topic.</p>
              </blockquote></div>
              <p>Hmm, it sounds like Buddhist teaching to me. As in no separate, fixed self from Christ. So a little surprised here. Since you sound detailed in your explanation, I really thought you were explaining using Buddhist teachings on the divinity and presence concept.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if the TS doesn't mind, then there's no issue of you being off topic. So it's the TS's views that we need to seek.</p>

              <p>No, the I AMness or ground of reality spoken here is not only experienced by Buddhist practitioners. It is found in basically all religions, the Hindus Advaita Vedanta, the Christian Mystics, the Islamic Sufis, the Jewish Kabbalah, the Taoists, the and so on, they all had practitioners who realise this.</p>
              <p>However, the I AMness is only Stage 1 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's

              <p>It is still not the realisation of Anatta or Shunyata. Dissolving the ego into a large Self, a metaphysical essence, God, Brahman, etc, is not in accord with Buddhist emptiness teachings. However many practitioners including in Buddhism will go through this I AMness phase. Practitioners up to Thusness Stage 4 have not overcome the view of an Ultimate Reality of a metaphysical essence.</p>
              <p>As Thusness says,</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><br></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">Although there is 
                  non-duality in Advaita Vedanta, and no-self in Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta
                   rest in an “Ultimate Background” (making it dualistic), whereas 
                  Buddhism eliminates the background completely and rest in the emptiness 
                  nature of phenomena; arising and ceasing is where pristine awareness is.
                   In Buddhism, there is no eternality, only timeless continuity (timeless
                   as in vividness in present moment but change and continue like a wave 
                  pattern). There is no changing thing, only change.</span></em><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><br></span></p>

              <p>Most of the Buddhists know that it is common for the well practised Buddhists to foretell the day they would pass away. Amitabha would appear in their dreams and told them the exact day that He was coming to bring them to Pureland. In some cases, family members of the deceased would see Amitabha on the day the Buddhist passed away.</p>
              <p>One of my friend's father-in-law  told his family members that Amitabha would bring him to Pureland in 4 days time.  His father-in-law passed away on the 4th day.</p>

              <p>I have seen a VCD which recorded a Hindu lady who chanted Amitabha when she was suffering from cancer. The film showed from the day she suffered in pain till she was relieved from pain by chanting Amitabha. She was also able to foretell the exact day she would pass away. If I am not wrong, this VCD was filmed in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>It will be easier to film the pheonomenon after the chanting event as it happens quite frequently in Singapore's Buddhist Temple. Devotees at Bee Low See Temple (near Bukit Timah) used to see pheonomenon after æ°´é™†æ³•ä¼š which is held once in 2 years. I saw it once myself, it was sometime in May last year. At least I know for the past 3 events, the devotees saw the pheonomenon without fail. Some claimed that they saw Buddha.</p>
              <p>I will keep you guys inform when they hold the next event. You will not believe it till you see with your own eyes.</p>

              <p>It is the biggest chanting event in Buddhism. During this event, the monks will chant all the scriptures in Buddhism. It takes about a month and the devotees will join the chanting on the last week of the event.</p>
              <p>The pheonomenon will usually happen immediately or within 15 minutes after the chanting event is officially over (on the very last day of the event).</p>

              <p><br>I know, as a Buddhist, we should not cling on to the phenomenon. You know, the monks at Beeh Low See Temple couldn't bother to lift up their head to look at the phenomenon, they just walked passed the excited devotees who were looking at the sky.

              <p> </p>
              <p>I was in the sky,  everywhere around me was white clouds, infront of me was Buddha Shakyamuni(He look exactly the same as the one at S'pore Buddhist Lodge main hall)    if i am 1cm tall, Buddha Shakyamuni will be around 20cm bah. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddha Shakyamuni then talk to me, i couldnt hear what he was telling me, all i know is i saw his lips moving, but i cant hear anything.  After which the dream stop.  When i awoke i still can remember the dream clearly.</p>

              <p>I know in science will explain, u just visit the temple, when u think too much, u dream of it. Very normal.  But what i can say is a dream cannot change a person thinking and character.</p>

              <p>Reason simple,  i was so afraid of ghost then, hafing this obstacle with gf then, was in total fear.  Buddha gave me courage and knowledge in the dream, when i awoke, my fear is gone and i understand the sufferings of spirits and whats karma. Prior to the dream i am a taoist.</p>

              <p>I agree wholeheartedly. Whether anyone's experience is good or bad, real or false, as long as they are willing to share, we should develop a sincere and calm attitude in listening.</p>
              <p>Next we would use the Buddha's teachings to guide us on how to interpret the different lessons to be learnt from each sharing.</p>
              <p>To interpret stories in ways that would help each and everyone of us to see the reality of karma, the 4 Noble Truths and the 8 fold Noble Paths.</p>
