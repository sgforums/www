                  <p>There are three bodies of a body: Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya.</p>
                  <p>Dharmakaya refers to the eternal truth body of the Buddha, which means it is the nature and essence of reality/ourselves/the universe. Anyone who becomes enlightened realises what Dharmakaya is. Even today, even in this forum, there are people who have become enlightened and 'seen the Buddha'.</p>
                  <p>The Buddha said those who sees dependent origination sees the dharma, those who sees the dharma sees the Buddha. Those who realises dependent origination/emptiness becomes awake to the nature of the Buddha and is known as having seen the Buddha.</p>
                  <p>Other than that, there is the Sambhogakaya, which is the celestial body of the Buddha of much greater majesty than a physical manifestation. However a Sambhogakaya can only be seen by a realised Bodhisattva, ordinary people do not see it. My Buddhist Master (Ven Shen Kai) have talked about how he met Amitabha which I believe is a clear description of a Sambhogakaya vision. He even returned with a dharma taught by Amitabha and developed one of the Buddha's 32 major mark which is a white curled hair between the forehead. The story is here: <a href="/forums/1728/topics/169512#post_4132828">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/169512#post_4132828</a></p>
                  <p>As for the Nirmanakaya, which is the physical manifestation of Buddha with the 32 major marks and 80 minor marks, there is only one such major Nirmanakaya appearing at any particular time, in other words, as long as the dharma teachings still exists in the face of Earth, there will not be another Nirmanakaya Buddha appearing. The Buddha has prophecised that the next Buddha to appear is Maitreya Buddha, he will appear a very very long time in the future, millions or billions of years later. Maitreya Bodhisattva is currently residing in the Tushita Heaven's court yard, teaching the celestial beings, and will take birth with his celestial students only when the time has come.</p>
                  <p>We will not see a Nirmanakaya Buddha (i.e. a physical manifestation of a Buddha), because the current age's Buddha, Shakyamuni Buddha's body has been self-cremated in a fire of samadhi 2500+ years ago, leaving only the amazing and miraculous shariras or relics which are not mere bones but multi coloured, jewel like, indestructible relics which have miraculous features like being able to multiply on its own which I have discussed in my first reply in the thread <a href="/forums/1728/topics/366959">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/366959</a></p>
                  <p>As for people seeing Buddhas: be careful of people claiming to see Buddhas in meditation etc, unless they are high level Bodhisattvas, it is very easy to be deluded about such visions. In Zen there is a saying: if you see the Buddha, kill the Buddha. It means kill off your attachment to any hallucinatory experience. If the Buddha appears to unenlightened people and cause more confusion and attachment, that is not the real Buddha but one's illusions or maybe a manifestation of a demonic origin (i.e. from the spirit realm or from the 6th heaven where maras stay). If a person is fascinated by such experience and visions, it means he is not spiritually mature enough and is probably experiencing delusory states. He should be adviced to let them go and not be attached to such experiences.</p>

                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">It is stated
                                   in the 
                                          Diamond Sutra, “He who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in 
                                          sounds is on a heterodox path and cannot see the Tathagata 
                                  (Buddha).” 
                                          It further states that, “All forms are but illusions, in seeing 
                                          that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata”. It is only
                                   
                                          when we have attained a certain advanced level in the learning 
                                  and practising 
                                          of Buddhism that we will be able to understand the profound 
                                  meaning of 
                                          these verses. If you were to tell a person who has just started 
                                  to learn 
                                          Buddhism that learning Buddhism is like these verses, then he 
                                  would find 
                                          them too profound. He would not be able to make out what Buddha 
                                  is like. 
                                          Of course, he knows what human beings are like and quite 
                                  naturally he 
                                          will assume that only those who are similar in form to human 
                                  beings are 
                                          Buddhas. We can say that this is correct, but we can also say 
                                  that this 
                                          is wrong. For example, kindergarten teachers may use drawings of
                                   an old 
                                          man and old woman when teaching the young children about 
                                  grandfathers 
                                          and grandmothers. Thereafter, when the children see other old 
                                  folks in 
                                          such resemblance they know that they are someone else’s 
                                  grandparents. 
                                          But, to university students it would be inappropriate for 
                                  professors to 
                                          use the same approach when talking about such blood 
                                  relationships. <br> <br> It is the same in learning Buddhism. When we encourage a new 
                                  student of 
                                          Buddhism to pay respect to the Buddha in the temple or 
                                  monastery, he will 
                                          not be frightened when he sees that the Buddha is the same as a 
                                  human 
                                          being. At the same time, when he sees that the Buddha and 
                                  Bodhisattva 
                                          images are so dignified and compassionate, it will give rise to a
                                   feeling 
                                          of joy and reverence and lead him to learn Buddhism.</span></p>

                                  come across 
                                          people who have been learning Buddhism for a long time saying 
                                  that they 
                                          saw this Buddha or that Bodhisattva in their dreams. Initially, 
                                  when we 
                                          do not know about their level of understanding of Buddhism, we 
                                  may praise 
                                          them by saying, “Oh! You have such good affinity with Buddha and
                                   
                                          Bodhisattva that you can even see their images!” But it is wrong
                                   
                                          if we always praise them like this. If they report dreams like 
                                  this for 
                                          more then 3 times, you have to tell them, “The Mara is here, you
                                   
                                          have seen the Mara! All the Zen masters advise to obliterate the
                                   Buddha 
                                          when the Buddha appears, and obliterate the Mara when the Mara 
                                  appears 
                                          [1].” We cannot praise them any more because they have already 
                                  developed 
                                          an attachment to forms. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In the same 
                                  way, when 
                                          we are dealing with people who are already advanced in Buddhism,
                                   we should 
                                          use the method of the Diamond Sutra rather than the kindergarten
                                   method: </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: normal;">“He 
                                          who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in sounds is on a 
                                  heterodox

                                  one sees 
                                          the Tathagata.” </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">At this 
                                  level, people 
                                          will realize that Buddhism is the only religion that eradicates 
                                  superstition 
                                          and attachment to all forms. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Critics 
                                  often say 
                                          that the Buddha image is an idol. They criticize that Buddhism 
                                  worships 
                                          idols. In reality, the cross, the Jesus Christ image and Mother 
                                  Mary, 
                                          they are also idols. In this sense, is there a religion that 
                                  does not 
                                          worship idols? Therefore, we cannot say that Buddhism is the 
                                  only religion 
                                          that worships idols. The fact is that only Buddhism does not 
                                  worship idols. 
                                          The Diamond Sutra states, “All forms are but illusions, in 
                                  seeing 
                                          that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata.”! </span></p>

              of numerous causes and conditions comprising four elements: earth, 
              water, fire and wind. As such, they do not have independent natures of 
              their own. A tree, for example, is the result of a combination of 
              nutrients, water, sunlight and air. Thus, they are in fact empty because
               when the conditions that created and sustained them are no longer 
              present, these objects will return to emptiness. However, we don't see 
              them in this light. We think they are real, absolute and permanent. But 
              they are not. They are dependent upon other conditions. We need to truly
               comprehend and awaken to this fundamental truth of emptiness.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The phrase 
              'all form is non-form' is from the Diamond SÅ«tra. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha said,
               "SubhÅ«ti, what do you think? Can we use our ordinary flesh-eyes to see 
              the TathÄ�gata’s physical form and thus believe we are seeing the true 
              TathÄ�gata ?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">SubhÅ«ti 
              replied, "No, World-honoured One. We cannot look upon the unreal form of
               the TathÄ�gata’s manifestation and think we have perceived the 
              non-arising and non-ceasing true body of the TathÄ�gata."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">How is that?
               The 16-foot physique of the TathÄ�gata is a bodily form produced by an 
              aggregation of causes and conditions. When life ends, that body decays 
              and eventually vanishes. It is not the truly pure Dharma-kÄ�ya  of the 
              TathÄ�gata because the Dharma-kÄ�ya has no form to be seen; it is empty 
              and tranquil. How could flesh-eyes of sentient beings see the true form 
              of the TathÄ�gata’s Dharma-kÄ�ya?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha told 
              SubhÅ«ti, "Not only is the TathÄ�gata’s bodily form a false form produced 
              by the aggregation of causes and conditions, which does not have real 
              substance, so is any kind of thing in the universe, in this world as 
              well as beyond this world. All living and non-living things, shapes and 
              colours are merely formed by aggregations of causes and conditions. They
               are impermanent and will change as causes and conditions disperse. They
               are as illusory as the flower in the mirror or the moon in the water!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"If looking 
              at appearances of objects, sentient beings are able to lucidly awaken to
               its aggregation of causes and conditions, and understand impermanence, 
              their arising and ceasing; and if at that very instant, distinguishing 
              does not arise, then without discrimination, they can enter into deep 
              stillness. In stillness, pure wisdom reveals itself. With supreme 
              wisdom, they realise that all worldly form is created by causes and 
              conditions. Its nature is empty; it is not reality. In this way, they 
              will directly perceive the TathÄ�gata’s Dharma-kÄ�ya."</span></p>

              the Arahat who best understood emptiness. Thus, with regards to 
              emptiness, he had profound realisation. We see this in a story:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Once, Buddha
               went to the heavenly palace of TrayastrimÅ›Ä�s to preach Dharma to his 
              mother. He only returned to earth after having been gone for a few 
              months. All of his disciples missed him. When he returned, they rushed 
              to welcome him, each hoping to be the first to pay their respects to 
              him. Being the most advanced in supernatural ability amongst the 
              Buddha's female disciples, BhiksunÄ« Lián-huÄ�-sè (è“®èŠ±è‰²) used her 
              supernatural powers and transformed herself into the image of Saint-king
               CakravartÄ«. Then, with great poise, she went to stand right up in 
              front. She very happily paid her respects toBuddha and said, "Disciple 
              Lián-huÄ�-sè is the first to pay respects to Buddha today. Oh, I’m 
              overjoyed!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha 
              replied with a smile, "Lián-huÄ�-sè, the first to see the TathÄ�gata 
              wasn’t you. It was SubhÅ«ti!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">BhiksunÄ« 
              Lián-huÄ�-sè was astonished! SubhÅ«ti had not joined in the queue to 
              welcome the Buddha. How could he have been the first to meet the Buddha?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha then 
              said, "The bodily form of the TathÄ�gata is not seen by our perceptions. 
              He who sees   the Dharma, sees the TathÄ�gata." </span></p>

               out, when Buddha returned to earth, SubhÅ«ti had been in the meditation 
              hall sitting in stillness, deeply observing the emptiness of all things 
              and phenomena, clearly understanding the reality of inherent emptiness, 
              and thus realising the formless Dharma-kÄ�ya of TathÄ�gata. Even though he
               had not been there in the queue, he had in fact truly seen the 
              TathÄ�gata.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha has 
              three bodies (TrikÄ�ya). One is 'NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya'(åŒ–èº«), or the 'Emanation 
              Body'. According to the sentient beings' capacity for understanding, 
              Buddha manifests the illusory forms of physical bodies in numerous 
              worlds. Because of their heavy karmic hindrances, some disciples were 
              only able to see the 16-foot golden body of the Buddha, but were unable 
              to see the 32 physical characteristics and 80 accompanying physical 
              features of a great person (i.e. DvÄ�trimÅ›advara-laksana and 
              Anuvyañjana).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Another body
               of Buddha is 'Sambhoga-kÄ�ya' (æŠ¥èº«), or the 'benefiting body', of which 
              are two kinds: one is the 'body which benefits oneself', and the other 
              is the 'body which benefits others'. The former is the Buddha's own 
              attainment and awakening to his meritorious intrinsic pure 
              Buddha-nature, in the state of Dharma joy. The latter is the appearance 
              of enlightened, liberated Bodhisattvas to guide beginner-Bodhisattvas 
              (i.e. sentient beings who emulate Bodhisattvas and practise the 
              Bodhisattva Way) according to prevailing causalities, enabling these 
              beginner-Bodhisattvas to benefit from the teachings of Greater Vehicle 
              (MahÄ�yÄ�na) with Dharma joy. Both NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya and Sambhoga-kÄ�ya are 
              physical forms which are visible. However, the perfect Sambhoga-kÄ�ya of 
              Great Bodhisattvas is a form that is infinite and of awesome majesty. It
               is not something that ordinary sentient beings like us can see. What 
              ordinary people see is the NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya form.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The third 
              body of Buddha, named 'Dharma-kÄ�ya'(æ³•èº«), is the Truth Body of the 
              TathÄ�gata, and also the reality of all phenomena. It permeates all of 
              space and is omnipresent. An ancient sage said, "Green bamboos are 
              entirely Dharma-kÄ�ya, luxuriant chrysanthemums are all PrajñÄ�; each 
              grass, each tree, all in the ocean of Buddha-nature. Green bamboos are 
              used for expressing the state of Dharma-kÄ�ya, but bamboos are by no 
              means Dharma-kÄ�ya. Luxuriant chrysanthemums are used for displaying the 
              function of PrajñÄ�, but chrysanthemums are by no means PrajñÄ�."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The myriad 
              of things and phenomena in this world are formed by aggregations of 
              numerous causes and conditions comprising four elements  and five 
              skandhas , arising by causality and ceasing by causality; their nature 
              is inherently empty. And everything in the world is as such. They do not
               exist as individual entities. Hence, the nature of all things and 
              phenomena is empty, tranquil and all pervasive. However, people are 
              unaware of this and are grasping on to their belief that the numerous 
              forms in the universe truly exist. But if you can truly comprehend this 
              and awaken to the realisation that the nature of all forms is emptiness,
               then instantaneously you perceive the pure Dharma-kÄ�ya of TathÄ�gata.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>

              <p>Just a note: What I have understood so far is, the Jesus Christ and Mother Mary image applies in the context of Catholic practitioners. For protestant Christians, there is no Jesus Christ image, but a Cross made of wood or metal. The Cross serves to remind Christians of God's great love for them in the form of sending Jesus, his heavenly son, to die on the cross to liberate all human beings from the burden of their sins.</p>

              Like I said I was seeking sincere answer to my question. I have plenty questions from your answer but seeing how Laurence and Rooney who are well known trolls in eternal hope can't help themselves not to troll here either I better end here.

              <p>My Master used to be a Christian pastor who insulted Buddhism (claiming it is superstitious and demonic which is due to a gross misunderstanding of what Buddhism is) wherever he go because of the pressure by other Christian pastor friends who did the same thing.</p>
              <p>When his university lecturer asked him to stop his blatant insult and do something more professional like researching on what Buddhism is about to write a proper thesis on the faults of Buddhism that he actually went to the libraries to find out what Buddhism is about.</p>
              <p>After he read through the books, he converted to a Buddhist monk.</p>

              <p>Sages appear only to help us realise our true nature and let go of all self attachment, not to cause further attachment, and that is the point. If we mistake the finger for the moon, then we fail.</p>
              <p>In Christianity, the highest goal is to achieve union with Christ. It is realising in direct experience what Christ is, without a dualistic relationship (I and God) but rather, the dissolving of the 'me' into Christ - <em>I have been crucified with <em>Christ</em>; it is <em>no longer I who 
                      live</em>, but <em>Christ lives</em> in me. (Galatians 2:20)</em></p>
              <p>The cross is the symbol of such a crucification, but if they do not 'crucify with Christ' but instead treat the cross as some special symbol to attach to or wear on their necks or whatever, then that's mistaking the finger for the moon.</p>
              <p>There is something by Eckhart Tolle which I think is good, even though it is not Buddhist, it can lead to an important realisation.</p>
              <p>From 'The Power of Now', Eckhart
                                                      Tolle<strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Christ: The Reality Of Your Divine 
                              Presence</strong></p>
              <p><br> Don't get attached to any one word. You can 
                              substitute "Christ" for
                                                      presence, if that is more meaningful to you. 
                              Christ is your God
                                                      essence or the Self, as it is sometimes called 
                              in the East. The
                                                      only difference between Christ and presence is 
                              that Christ refers
                                                      to your indwelling divinity regardless of 
                              whether you are conscious
                                                      of it or not, whereas presence means your 
                              awakened divinity or
                                                      God-essence.</p>
              <p>Many misunderstandings and false beliefs about 
                              Christ will clear if
                                                      you realize that there is no past or future in 
                              Christ. To say that
                                                      Christ was or will be is a contradiction in 
                              terms. Jesus was. He
                                                      was a man who lived two thousand years ago and 
                              realized divine
                                                      presence, his true nature. And so he said: 
                              "Before Abraham was, I
                                                      am." He did not say: "I already existed before 
                              Abraham was born."
                                                      That would have meant that he was still within. 
                              the dimension of
                                                      time and form identity. The words I am used in a
                               sentence that
                                                      starts in the past tense indicate a radical 
                              shift, a discontinuity
                                                      in the temporal dimension. It is a Zen-like 
                              statement of great
                                                      profundity. Jesus attempted to convey directly, 
                              not through
                                                      discursive thought, the meaning of presence, of 
                              self realization.
                                                      He had gone beyond the consciousness dimension 
                              governed by time,
                                                      into the realm of the timeless. The dimension of
                               eternity had come
                                                      into this world. Eternity, of course, does not 
                              mean endless time,
                                                      but no time. Thus, the man Jesus became Christ, a
                               vehicle for pure
                                                      consciousness. And what is God's self-definition
                               in the Bible? Did
                                                      God say "I have always been, and I always will 
                              be?" Of course
                                                      not.That would have given reality to past and 
                              future. God said: "I
                                                      AM THAT I AM." No time here, just presence.</p>
              <p>The "second coming" of Christ is a 
                              transformation of human
                                                      consciousness, a shift from time to presence, 
                              from thinking to pure
                                                      consciousness, not the arrival of some man or 
                              woman. If "Christ"
                                                      were to return tomorrow in some externalized 
                              form, what could he or
                                                      she possibly say to you other than this: "I am 
                              the Truth. I am
                                                      divine presence. I am eternal life. I am within 
                              you. I am here. I
                                                      am Now."</p>
              <p>Never personalize Christ. Don't make Christ into
                               a form identity.
                                                      Avatars, divine mothers, enlightened masters, 
                              the very few that are
                                                      real, are not special as persons. Without a 
                              false self to uphold,
                                                      defend, and feed, they are more simple, more 
                              ordinary than the
                                                      ordinary man or woman. Anyone with a strong ego 
                              would regard them
                                                      as insignificant or, more likely, not see them 
                              at all.</p>
              <p>If you are drawn to an enlightened teacher, it 
                              is because there is
                                                      already enough presence in you to recognize 
                              presence in another.
                                                      There were many people who did not recognize 
                              Jesus or the Buddha,
                                                      as there are and always have been many people 
                              who are drawn to
                                                      false teachers. Egos are drawn to bigger egos. 
                              Darkness cannot
                                                      rec-ognize light. Only light can recognize 
                              light. So don't believe
                                                      that the light is outside you or that it can 
                              only come through one
                                                      particular form. If only your master is an 
                              incarnation of God, then
                                                      who are you? Any kind of exclusivity is 
                              identification with form,
                                                      and identification with form means ego, no 
                              matter how well
                                                      disguised.</p>
              <p><br> Use the master's presence to reflect your own 
                              identity beyond name
                                                      and form back to you and to become more 
                              intensely present yourself.
                                                      You will soon realize that there is no "mine" or
                               "yours" in
                                                      presence. Presence is one.</p>
              <p><br> Group work can also be helpful for intensifying 
                              the light of your
                                                      presence. A group of people coming together in a
                               state of presence
                                                      generates a collective energy field of great 
                              intensity. It not only
                                                      raises the degree of presence of each member of 
                              the group but also
                                                      helps to free the collective human consciousness
                               from its current
                                                      state ofmind dominance. This will make the state
                               of presence
                                                      increasingly more accessible to individuals. 
                              However, unless at
                                                      least one member of the group is already firmly 
                              established in it
                                                      and thus can hold the energy frequency of that 
                              state, the egoic
                                                      mind can easily reassert itself and sabotage the
                               group's endeavors.
                                                      Although group work is invaluable, it is not 
                              enough, and you must
                                                      not come to depend on it. Nor must you come to 
                              depend on a teacher
                                                      or a master, except during the transitional 
                              period, when you are
                                                      learning the meaning and practice of presence.</p>
