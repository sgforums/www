              <p>Shall just answer a bit of your questions here, as a spiritual free-thinker:</p>
              <p>yes, it's possible to do Past Life Regression, to find out more about one's past lives. There are experienced <strong>Past Life and Spiritual Regressionists in Singapore (</strong><a href="http://www.livinglightuniverse.com/quantum_healing.html"><strong>http://www.livinglightuniverse.com/quantum_healing.html</strong></a><strong>)</strong> who specialise in helping people access their past life memories to help them resolve their current life issues, as most people's current life situations and problems are the result of unresolved past life issues.</p>
              <p>For some people, they can do it themselves without external therapist's help, but not many people are able to unlock their past life memories themselves. However, it may take more attempts and greater effort for people with difficulty relaxing their mind, as their physical mind (Self Ego) refuses to release control of the mind to allow the subconscious mind to surface. Most people are operating using their physical minds all the time when they are awake, so have little/no connection with information from the spiritual realm and soul level consciousness, where past life information is available.</p>
              <p>There can be various reasons that prevent one from getting his past-life info, and one of them is: People with negative/foreign entities/implants in their physical/energetic bodies can also be prevented from accessing their past life information.</p>
              <p>My personal tip (not representative of Buddhism): You may want to meditate more and try to get more details about your past-life relationship, since you're obviously already getting bits of the info.</p>
              <p>Generally, souls will need to experience physical lives of both sexes when they are 'younger', ie. in their earlier stages of Universal existence, until all the required lessons relevant to gender are completed. If outstanding karmic issues need to be resolved, it may also be necessary to experience the opposite sex of a previous life. </p>
              <p>This is an accelerated period of karmic re-balancing for the world. From your description, there are issues that you need to resolve with your current classmate (your past-life husband). Try to keep your emotions in check, and from a 'detached perspective', assess how's your current relationship/situation with her, and how you can improve it. When you've realised and understood the karmic issue between both of you, and learnt what you need to learn from your links with her, you should intuitively feel at peace when with her. :)</p>

              <p>Hi Cutepanpan,</p>
              <p>Past life regression session is quite expensive. Costing hundreds or more... I never use them but there are 2 that i know of. One is in Far East Plaza, i think it is on level 2. The other is my ex-clients'  ( I do and teach design) employer... I need to dig the contact... if you need.</p>
              <p>Or you can DIY... via meditation. But you must be able to relax down quite abit.</p>
              <p>You point out an interesting issue in your post.. that is that in your past life you are of the opposite sex. Yep... from my experience, one can have past life with a different sex and race from the current one  :)</p>

              <p>IMO, meditation to get more details about your past-life relationship is not proper and is not encouraged. Knowing your past without a solution is not helpful as well. Buddhism's 'advice is that you are Buddha, and seek to become a Buddha through various methods of meditation such as focus on sutra recitation, reading sutra, chanting of O mi Tuo Fo among others. Well! if you would like to acquire some kowledge, you may explore this sutra <a href="http://www.drba.org/dharma/earthstore.pdf">http://www.drba.org/dharma/earthstore.pdf</a>.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I'm also very curious about my past life. I remembered about 20 years ago when I was at Bright Hill temple when Ven. Hong Choon ï¼ˆå®�èˆ¹æ³•å¸ˆï¼‰was still alive, he was quite old then, I was standing among a group of Buddhists, he stopped right in front of me and looked at me for a few minutes. He did not say anything and I was very young then that I did not even know how to greet him. After that, I understand that he was an enlightened monk with supernatural power. Till today, I was wondering why he looked at me and what he had seen, may be my past life. Sometimes I tried not to think about this incident but can't help it.</p></div>

              <p>Hi Cutepanpan,</p>
              <p>I feel that, just from the example you brought up, you can try to switch perspective to self-examine what your character traits are like?  Are you a very clinging person, possessive or self-centred?  Do you think a lot about what you want, or what you need only, without thinking more for others?</p>
              <p>If that is so, then you have the choice in your hands to change your future.  Just change your attitude.  People are attracted or repulsed by your attitude.  People are always very attracted to someone who has compassion/bodhichitta... not only people, even animals and all manners of beings.</p>
              <p>Seeing your past-lives or not, understanding your past relationships or not, if you don't try to change yourself now, nothing in the future can improve.  Although the past affects our present, but the present affects our future.  Don't let the past be a hindrance to you... sometimes, knowing too much can tie you up even more... through your own attachments... and especially if you are not emotionally ready to know.</p>
              <p>Milarepa, a very realised master,  said, if you want to see your past, look at your present life situation; if you want to know your future, look at your present life actions/thoughts."</p>
              <p>Your future lies in your hands.  You can change it, it's up to you. No need to find out why, just change it from now on...</p>
              <p>My own opinion... hope it helps!</p>

Till today, I was wondering why he looked at me and what he had seen, may be my past life. Sometimes I tried not to think about this incident but can't help it.</p>

              <p><br>i agree, as it does help in some way of "seeing" is believing. as if people can't see, it's difficult to believe in past lives. hence i heard of Ven Jing Jieå‡€ç•Œæ³•å¸ˆ mentioned some masters/Rinpoche propose to practice spiritual power of seeing past lives of be it their own or other peoples' so as to better help them what are their affinities etc.</p>

              <p>yea, i was about to add that regarding spiritual powers. if mature enough, they won't show it off, like Buddha himself using it to see sentient beings' yuan ç¼˜(affinity). so He will know what kind of method/teaching to teach them toward enlightenment. like if some people are more toward knowledge seeking, He'd use school of Tientai or Mind-only. or if too dull, He'd use Pureland. or which people can take hinanyana and which people can take mahayana etc. like a doctor giving the specific medicine to different illness per se.</p>

              <p>Hi Cutepanpan</p>
              <p>When one mind is unclear, everything is unclear. When one mind is pure, everything is pure.</p>
              <p>It is good that you have begin to reflect on life. You have learn to take cautious step in order to preserve the relationship around. Sometime, one need not look into the past life in order to get answer for the present dilemma. In fact, one's atitude and life outlook will determine whether people want to be around him or her. Therefore, learn to count the blessing even for the little things you have then people will feel your thankful heart.   </p>
              <p>Secondly, it would be wise not to dart too much into the past life. Who you are today is what you have done in the past. What future will hold depend on what you will do now. So what, if during the hypnosis make you realise that the someone is really your ex life husband. It will not make any different to that "someone" in this life. A karma ripen due to the right cause and condition. Beside, be aware of fake therapist and holy men who conduct such session that led one to spend thousand of dollars. Of course, I won't deny there are some accomplished people who is able to see the past. However, most of the time, they chose not to reveal much as it may not benefit the person.</p>
              <p>Finally, I hope that you will go back to the rich basic teaching of buddhism. It will elevate your suffering in time to come.<a title="the mustard seed" href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/btg/btg85.htm">http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/btg/btg85.htm</a> Try meditation to calm your mind so that you can see yourself in a clearer light. Alright enjoy the sunshine, studies, friendship and etc. Being youth is the best time of one life.</p>

              <p>I would like to ask if those on the higher or lower realms can come to visit our realm of existance.</p>
              <p>I am reading something on the net that seems to say that such a thing can happen.</p>

              <p>When beings have progressed spiritually to the higher realms, they no longer have attachments to deceased relatives, as all beings in higher dimensions/realms can come and go and visit each other, or communicate with anyone with ease. Deceased people merely means they are in another dimension or have already taken on another reincarnation, but they are still around, somewhere. Life, Death and length of lifespan in the higher dimensions/realms no longer matter to their level of Consciousness.</p>
              <p>Even within this 3D world now, as long as we can think and break free of 3rd dimensional limitations, we can all live very fulfilling and happy lives without the many fears of death, sickness and what-nots. If we think we cannot fly, even when we have wings, we'll still be unable to fly, because either we still don't believe we can fly, or we are afraid of trying something new. :)</p>
