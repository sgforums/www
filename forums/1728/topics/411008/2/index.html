              <p>When beings have progressed spiritually to the higher realms, they no longer have attachments to deceased relatives, as all beings in higher dimensions/realms can come and go and visit each other, or communicate with anyone with ease. Deceased people merely means they are in another dimension or have already taken on another reincarnation, but they are still around, somewhere.

              <p><br>It's not appropriate for me to answer your questions fully here, as the process of the Cycle of Life taught in the various mainstream religions exclude much actual explanation of the (could be lengthy) time people/souls spend in the spiritual realm, in between lives/incarnations, or about lives of non-famous people who have completed their reincarnation cycles.</p>
              <p>Basically, when we are in our physical incarnations on the current Earth dimension, we are at our lowest level of Consciousness, and so most people (not all) cannot remember anything (or just remember very little) about their past lives and time spent in the spiritual realm. Once we've progressed to higher dimensions/realms or returned to the spiritual realm, we have full Consciousness, and remember all about our entire existence. :)</p>
              <p>It's hard for people in this current Earth realm to let go of attachments to deceased loved ones, as they will somehow feel that they won't see them ever again, forever, and hold on to that feeling of loss. But once in the higher realms, it's possible to be anywhere, anytime. Nothing is lost; only more is gained.</p>
              <p>Once we've regained higher Consciousness, the real process of Life/Death/Rebirth will be extremely clear to us, and earthly emotional attachments such as sorrow/grief over death will no longer be necessary. Life on Earth is really just a temporary period for people to learn about duality. Everyone can choose to continue learning forever in this realm, lifetime after lifetime, or choose to complete their learning as soon as possible and leave this realm/dimension of duality forever.</p>
              <p>Because most people cannot remember enough of their past lives, many people are stuck in infinite loops, repeating mistakes of past lives lifetime after lifetime, and end up being stuck in this illusionary Earth dimension/realm.</p>

              <p><br>i think lost all memories it's when reborn back as human or animal realm, could be at the womb period. womb period is so painful that they forgot their previous lifes. that say when the mother drink cold water, they suffer something like cold hell, and when the mother take hot stuff, they suffer hot hell etc.</p>
              <p>heavenly being are not womb born èƒŽç”Ÿ, they are transformation born åŒ–ç”Ÿ. ghosts are also  very much attached to their previous human life.</p>
              <p>i'm not sure i can equal <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heavenly</span> realm and Rainbow Jigsaw's reference of "higher" realm, but perhaps seem like Buddhism's Four Noble realms and above. heavenly realm is still below the four noble realms. beings from four noble realms do can see all their previous existences and travel freely and no more attached to their relatives. there are more to the Four Noble realms in Buddhadharma though.</p>

              <p>Honestly, it's a very sensitive topic to talk about in full here. It starts by accepting that there's far more truth to our Universe than what has been written about in this world. The past does not represent the present or the future. If one can accept that, naturally, things will fall into place, for one to find the answers to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">know</span></strong> the way. :)</p>
              <p>Even if people cannot accept this now, there'll be opportunities to realise this in a couple of years' time. But of course, time is a factor to consider, especially for people with a great deal of outstanding karmic issues. Resolving past life burdens/issues is not fun, and can be very painful (emotionally) for some people. If anyone thinks that there's no need to resolve outstanding past life issues in this current life, he/she needs to be prepared for a very tough journey ahead, when all the outstanding issues surface together.</p>
              <p>It takes great effort, determination and mental strength, but if one is truly intent on leaving this illusionary realm of duality for good, it will all be worth it. No one can leave this realm permanently with a baggage of past and present life issues.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Beautiful951,</p>
              <p>If a person has taken rebirth in say, a heavenly realm, then as gods, they can see their past lives as their minds are in what humans will call a kind of 'meditative state', their clarity and clairvoyance surpasses humans... and so they can see the reason why they reborn in heaven and past lives etc. </p>
              <p>If a person takes rebirth in Amitabha's pureland, similarly he can see his past family etc.  That's why in the aspiration prayer to take rebirth in Amitabha's pureland, it is aspired that after taking rebirth in pureland, the person will also be able to bring all his family, disciples, retinue etc into the pureland together with him.</p>
              <p>In the higher realms, as long as they are not out of samsara, there is still attachment. For eg, some gods like people to make offerings to them.  They can get angry too.  Anger also belies attachment somewhere.  As long as you are still in samsara, no matter how high a realm you reborn into, there will be attachment, whether subtle or gross, and this will cause suffering that will continue on until one reaches full liberation.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps</p>

              <p><br>Many descriptions of higher realms and 'gods' written about in this world, are really from the perspective of Man, and not what really is. :) It's like all the supposedly expert reports and descriptions from NASA about Mars and the other planets, studied by all the scientists and mankind alike. People take them to be true, but they are written from the perspective of Man who are observing Mars and the planets from afar.</p>
              <p>Even when Man is able to land on Mars, what they see is not what really is, because Man is currently still in 3rd dimension, while the other planets in our solar system are already in higher dimensions. The truth of the Universe is far from what is written about. The same applies to why some people can see ghosts and non-physical entities, while other cannot. Those who cannot see (eg. almost all the horror film directors) tend to imagine all sorts of untrue stuff, yet so many movie goers take those movies' depictions of ghosts to be true.</p>
              <p>Wanting to bring all of one's family, clan members, followers, teachers, friends, relatives, etc together into the after-life itself is a common humanly attachment, that exists only in this Earth realm. The need for physical togetherness is projected into the higher realms from the perspective of Man. For those who have progressed into the higher realms/dimensions, such humanly attachments no longer exist, as all are One, and feelings of separation and loss no longer exist. When we are free of duality, we no longer feel emotional conflicts of separation and loss (from Death), good vs evil, etc. </p>

              <p>to what i know, the gods or heavenly beings refered in buddhism cannot be detected by mere machinces. that which can be detected like we saw in the movies, beings from outer space or aliens which have a solid body form are still consider in the realm of human. as mentioned, gods or heavenly beings refered in buddhism are transformation body, sort of like dream like, consciousness-based.</p>
              <p>however the 4 noble realms are out of the 6 realms of samsara.</p>

              <p>it's known as ç„¡æ˜Ž AvidyÄ� in Buddhism. u can also call it delusion or lack of knowing.</p>

              <p>we are all trying to realised this original mind. no word can explain it, u have to taste the water to know if it's warm or cold. which mean u have to realise it yourself.</p>
              <p>Huineng glimpsed it when He said:-</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>ä½•æœŸè‡ªæ€§æœ¬è‡ªæ¸…æ·¨ã€‚True Nature is Originally Pure.</em></p>

              <p>why i say it's difficult to get rid of ignorance is because there are 42 layers of ignorance and after one has realised one piece of ignorance, one witness just one fraction of Dharmakaya, the rest has to be realised slowly automatically without any method or practice. it'll take 3 great asankhyeya kalpa! <em>The Abhidharmakosa states that an asankhyeya is a period of time equal to 1 followed by 59 zeros number of great kalpas. </em></p>
              <p>it's sort of like after u had learned of some skill, u need to practice through experience to get the hang of it. or u can say it's our timeless <strong>habit</strong> of delusions. we say It's like a wine bottle emptied of the wine but the smell is still there, and it's take time for the smell to go away. old habits takes time to get rid. nothing much can be done, except perhaps it can be done a lot faster in Amitabha Pureland. ;)</p>
