              2016- Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, a pilgrimage site for all the
              people of the world, the fountain of peace and a Unesco World Heritage Site, is
              facing a serious environmental threat due to the proliferation of factories all
              around it. This requires the immediate attention of the government of Nepal, concerned
              ministries and Lumbini Development Trust.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 16.85pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #444444;'>In
              addition to the cement factory which was established despite the Industrial
              Promotion Board’s 2009 decision not to allow any carbon emitting factories
              within a 15-km radius of the sacred site, there are 57 manufacturing plants
              producing bricks, cement, clinker, steel, noodles, paper and flour registered
              in the Lumbini Protected Zone. Among them, 11 cement factories, two steel
              factories, one paper mill and one noodles factory have been identified as being
              the largest polluters. Increased solid waste from tourism and noise and air
              pollution due to the use of generators by hotels, restaurants and even
              monasteries also need to be addressed.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 16.85pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #444444;'>A study
              conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) showed that the air at the
              Lumbini World Heritage Site contained particulate matter amounting to 270
              micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which is 11 times higher than WHO’s
              permissible limit. This level of air pollution is extremely dangerous to the
              health of living beings and exemplifies the urgency of the problem. Noise
              pollution and emission by heavy duty generators are also on the rise. The noise
              pollution level has been found to exceed the Nepal government’s standard of 50
              decibels at daytime and 40 decibels at night-time. Solid waste is also
              increasing at Lumbini. According to Asian Development Bank estimates, garbage
              generation will reach 617 tonnes by 2020 and 1,307 tonnes by 2030 as there is
              no scheme to manage it.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 16.85pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #444444;'>Appeals to
              the government to do something about the pollution at the Buddha’s birthplace
              by the Centre for Public Health Environmental Development (CEPHED) led to a
              number of decisions to address pollution issues in 2013, but they were never
              implemented. The government of Nepal through its line ministries such as the
              Ministry of Population and Environment, Ministry of Industry and the Ministry
              of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation has initiated several legislative and
              institutional frameworks specifically dedicated to environmental conservation,
              preservation and protection of the World Heritage Site. The Lumbini Development
              Trust formed by Lumbini Development Trust Act 1985 for the purpose of restoring
              Lumbini Garden under the master plan is the key institutional strength
              addressing the pollution and development related issues.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 16.85pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #444444;'>Nepal is
              party to the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and
              Natural Heritage 1972 whose objectives are identification, protection,
              conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations of the cultural
              and natural heritage beyond national territories. This convention was accepted
              by Nepal in 1978. Additionally, the Ministry of Population and Environment has
              enacted numerous environmental quality standards for air, water, noise,
              emissions and industrial effluents which need to be effectively implemented and
              complied with. Most importantly, the Industrial Promotion Board of the Ministry
              of Industry decided in 2009 that no carbon emitting industries would be allowed
              to be established within a 15-km radius of the Lumbini Protected Zone. However,
              at least three to four carbon emitting and highly polluting cement factories
              have been set up since this decision was made.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 16.85pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #444444;'>Even
              though numerous such legislative and institutional frameworks and policies,
              plans, decisions and standards are in place, environmental pollution in Lumbini
              is continuing and increasing, putting public health, flora, fauna, the
              environment and culturally important temples, stupas and monasteries including
              the Mayadevi Temple and the 2,000-year-old Ashoka Pillar under severe threat of
              degradation. The construction of a new cement factory named Sri Ram Cement
              Industry is currently moving ahead at Bhaishakhadar, Harnaiya VDC despite
              having been halted several times. The construction work at the proposed factory
              must be stopped immediately to prevent new sources of environmental pollution
              from coming up.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 16.85pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #444444;'>Finally, a
              pledge by the national government and officials as well as individuals and
              organisations to protect and preserve the World Heritage Site of Lumbini
              through effective implementation of all the legislative and institutional
              frameworks dedicated to its protection would be a real contribution during the
              upcoming international Buddhist conference and celebration of the 2,560th
              Buddha Jayanti in Nepal.</span></p>
