              <p>"Monks, <a id="guilds" name="guilds">there are these</a> three 
              sectarian guilds that — when cross-examined, pressed for reasons, &amp; 
              rebuked by wise people — even though they may explain otherwise, remain 
              stuck in [a doctrine of] inaction. Which three?</p>
              <p>"There are priests &amp; contemplatives who hold this teaching, hold 
              this view: 'Whatever a person experiences — pleasant, painful, or 
              neither pleasant nor painful — that is all caused by what was done in 
              the past.' There are priests &amp; contemplatives who hold this 
              teaching, hold this view: 'Whatever a person experiences — pleasant, 
              painful, or neither pleasant nor painful — that is all caused by a 
              supreme being's act of creation.' There are priests &amp; contemplatives
               who hold this teaching, hold this view: 'Whatever a person experiences —
               pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful — that is all 
              without cause &amp; without condition.'</p>
              <p>"Having approached the priests &amp; contemplatives who hold that... 
              'Whatever a person experiences... is all caused by what was done in the 
              past,' I said to them: 'Is it true that you hold that... "Whatever a 
              person experiences... is all caused by what was done in the past?"' Thus
               asked by me, they admitted, 'Yes.' Then I said to them, 'Then in that 
              case, a person is a killer of living beings because of what was done in 
              the past. A person is a thief... unchaste... a liar... a divisive 
              speaker... a harsh speaker... an idle chatterer... greedy... 
              malicious... a holder of wrong views because of what was done in the 
              past.' When one falls back on what was done in the past as being 
              essential, monks, there is no desire, no effort [at the thought], 'This 
              should be done. This shouldn't be done.' When one can't pin down as a 
              truth or reality what should &amp; shouldn't be done, one dwells 
              bewildered &amp; unprotected. One cannot righteously refer to oneself as
               a contemplative. This was my first righteous refutation of those 
              priests &amp; contemplatives who hold to such teachings, such views.</p>
              <p>"Having approached the priests &amp; contemplatives who hold that...

               greedy... malicious... a holder of wrong views because of a supreme 
              being's act of creation.' When one falls back on creation by a supreme 
              being as being essential, monks, there is no desire, no effort [at the 
              thought], 'This should be done. This shouldn't be done.' When one can't

              dwells bewildered &amp; unprotected. One cannot righteously refer to 
              oneself as a contemplative. This was my second righteous refutation of 
              those priests &amp; contemplatives who hold to such teachings, such 
              views.</p>
              <p>"Having approached the priests &amp; contemplatives who hold that... 
              'Whatever a person experiences... is all without cause, without 
              condition,' I said to them: 'Is it true that you hold that... "Whatever a

              speaker... a harsh speaker... an idle chatterer... greedy... 
              malicious... a holder of wrong views without cause, without condition.' 
              When one falls back on lack of cause and lack of condition as being 
              essential, monks, there is no desire, no effort [at the thought], 'This 
              should be done. This shouldn't be done.' When one can't pin down as a 
              truth or reality what should &amp; shouldn't be done, one dwells 
              bewildered &amp; unprotected. One cannot righteously refer to oneself as

              <p>"Sustained by/clinging to the six properties, there is an alighting 
              of an embryo. There being an alighting, there is name-&amp;-form. From 
              name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media. From 
              the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact. From contact
               as a requisite condition comes feeling. To one experiencing feeling I 
              declare, 'This is stress.' I declare, 'This is the origination of 
              stress.' I declare, 'This is the cessation of stress.' I declare, 'This 
              is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'</p>
              <p>"And what is the noble truth of stress? Birth is stressful, aging is 
              stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, 
              &amp; despair are stressful; association with what is not loved is 
              stressful, separation from what is loved is stressful, not getting what 
              is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are 
              stressful. This is called the noble truth of stress.</p>
              <p>"And what is the noble truth of the origination of stress?</p>
              <p>"From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. From 
              fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness. From

              name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media. From 
              the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact. From contact
               as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite 
              condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes 
              clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition

               birth as a requisite condition, then old age &amp; death, sorrow,

               comes the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of 
              consciousness comes the cessation of name-&amp;-form. From the cessation
               of name-&amp;-form comes the cessation of the six sense media. From the
               cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact. From 
              the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling. From the 
              cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving. From the cessation 
              of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From the 
              cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. From 
              the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the 
              cessation of birth, then old age &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,
