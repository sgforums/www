The first part, their conviction in their faith, is admirable, but it is what follows that is so wrong.

Just take Christianity, Judaism and Islam for example, they can't even get along enough to see that they are praying to the same God.

              <p>Your criticism is unfair because it is rather superficial and sweeping statement. Though Judaism and Christianity worships the same God, their ways departs on other significant issues, notably on the Messiah. As for Islam, even Muslims themselves do not think that we are praying to the same God. But I do not wish to go much further than this comment.</p>

              <p>"believe" is not the word. clarify is more suitable.</p>
              <p>there's two kind that Buddhism mention. one is Brahma, the first being who first appeared in our universe, who have the great power to create using his freewill. but he's also subjected to death after a very very long eon.</p>
              <p>the second is about the ultimate source. clear light, but it need to be accompanied by more explaination, so that Buddhists will not be misleaded.</p>
              <p><em>"We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein. But we must be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual level.</em>  "--Dalai Lama</p>
