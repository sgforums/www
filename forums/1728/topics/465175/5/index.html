              <p>Because none of these things places an obligation upon us. We don't owe them anything. They are THINGS created by us to be used for our enjoyment and pleasure.</p>
              <p>Consider our parents. They gave birth to us. Without them we do not exist. If that does not create an obligation on our parts to honor them and provide for them, then it shows how unfilial we are. How much more so when we are talking about God our Creator? God made us. Without Him we do not exist. God is not just the centre of our lives. He is the REASON we are alive. If that does not create an obligation on our parts to worship Him, then it shows how reprobate we indeed are.</p>

              <p>By contingent is it means that the entity need not have existed or the event need not have happened. But just because things/events are contingent it does not mean they are illusions. The problem would be in mistaking that which is contingent as necessary, which is what I think the Buddha was addressing. Where I think he went wrong was in saying that therefore ALL things are contingent and thus illusion. But if everything is an illusion, does that apply to that statement itself? If so, it self-refute. If not, then that statement is false.</p>
              <p>I have no idea what this ultimate source it is that you refer to. Basically you would deny that it is God but somehow it is being reified or deified to be like God.</p>
              <p>Anyway, movies are movies, take them as pure entertainment. God is Spirit, and thus any physical manifestation of Him (a theophany or even the incarnation) should not be idolised. God has no physical attributes because He is an invisible spirit. The God of the Bible is thus transcendent yet immanent. He is distinct from His creation but yet can act within His creation.</p>
              <p>We only know of one universe which is the one we live in. It is not scientific to speak of multiverses or prior universes at all.
