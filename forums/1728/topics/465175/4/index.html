              <p>The Buddha had observed that life is suffering. Before He could find a solution

              symptoms and identifies the cause of the illness before prescribing a cure. The

              <p>Re...direct causes of suffering are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">desire or craving, and ignorance.</span> commonly are this :-</p>
              <p>5) <em>The Suffering of Being Apart from Those You Love</em>. Love is the feeling you have toward someone or something you like. When you love someone or something, you want to be together with that person or object all the time. You never want to part from them. However, sometimes circumstances arise in which people must be parted from those that they love and this brings on an acute kind of suffering.</p>
              <p>6) <em>The Suffering of Being Together with Those You Hate</em>. For example, there is a person whom you absolutely can't stand; you find it so hard to be around such a person that you want to leave him. However, when you deliberately go to another place to be away from him, you run into another person who is exactly like the person whom you couldn't stand. And so that's the suffering of being together with those you hate.</p>
              <p>7) <em>The Suffering of Not Obtaining What You Seek</em>. Suppose there is something you really want, but circumstances prevent you from getting it for your own. You want it, but you don't get it. No matter what you do, there is no way to fulfill you own wishes. That is the suffering of not obtaining what you seek.</p>

              <p>to me this is a simple question. but funny if u keep don't get it, our stance is.</p>
              <p>Re context depend on the "god" u are refering and one's understanding. if deva god(s)(including the fake Brahma/"creator" god, then the answer is YES. if refering to a real creator god with a unique <span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #000000;">autonomous entity</span> </span>as Xtian understood, then NO. the True Mind we are talking about have to be understood instead. Posted before but never get into the brain, Dalai Lama's answer:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4><span style="color: #888888;">Q: You have said that according to Buddhist philosophy there is no Creator, no God of creation, and this may initially put off many people who believe in a divine principle. Can you explain the difference between the Vajrayana Primordial Buddha and a Creator God?</span></h4>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>A: </strong>I understand the Primordial Buddha, also known as Buddha Samantabhadra, to be the ultimate reality, the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras. However, in the context of your question, the tantric tradition is the only one which explains the Dharmakaya in terms of Inherent clear light, the essential nature of the mind; this would seem imply that all phenomena, samsara and nirvana, arise from this clear and luminous source. Even the New School of Translation came to the conclusion that the "state of rest" of a practitioner of the Great Yoga--Great Yoga implies here the state of the practitioner who has reached a stage in meditation where the most subtle experience of clear light has been realized--that for as long as the practitioner remains in this ultimate sphere he or she remains totally free of any sort of veil obscuring the mind, and is immersed in a state of great bliss. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein. But we must be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual level. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Likewise, when we speak of karma as the cause of the universe we eliminate the notion of a unique entity called karma existing totally independently. Rather, collective karmic impressions, accumulated individually, are at the origin of the creation of a world. When, in the tantric context, we say that all worlds appear out of clear light, we do not visualize this source as a unique entity, but as the ultimate clear light of each being. We can also, on the basis of its pure essence, understand this clear light to be the Primordial Buddha. All the stages which make up the life of each living being--death, the intermediate state, and rebirth--represent nothing more than the various manifestations of the potential of clear light. It is both the most subtle consciousness and energy. The more clear light loses its subtlety, the more your experiences take shape. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">In this way, death and the intermediate state are moments where the gross manifestations emanating from clear light are reabsorbed. At death we return to that original source, and from there a slightly more gross state emerges to form the intermediate state preceding rebirth. At the stage of rebirth, clear light is apparent in a physical incarnation. At death we return to this source. And so on. The ability to recognize subtle clear light, also called the Primordial Buddha, is equivalent to realizing nirvana, whereas ignorance of the nature of clear light leaves us to wander in the different realms of samsaric existence. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">This is how I understand the concept of the Primordial Buddha. It would be a grave error to conceive of it as an independent and autonomous existence from beginningless time. If we had to accept the idea of an independent creator, the explanations given in the <em>Pramanavartika, </em>the "Compendium of Valid Knowledge" written by Dharmakirti, and in the ninth chapter of the text by Shantideva, which completely refutes the existence per se of all phenomena, would be negated. This, in turn, would refute the notion of the Primordial Buddha. The Buddhist point of view does not accept the validity of affirmations which do not stand up to logical examination. If a sutra describes the Primordial Buddha as an autonomous entity, we must be able to interpret this assertion without taking it literally. We call this type of sutra an "interpretable" sutra.</span></p>

              <p>Not all desires or craving or ignorance leads to suffering.</p>
              <p>A Buddhist desires to attain nirvana yet it leads to suffering? Sometimes ignorance is bliss.</p>
              <p>So the question is, did the Buddha correctly identify the cause? In a sense I believe he did. Let me explain. In the Bible we read that the devil tempted Eve. Eve saw the fruit and desired to be made wise by it, to be like God. Her desire for the forbidden fruit led her to sin, and suffering, and death. She was led to believe that she was ignorant without the knowledge of good and evil granted by the fruit. She wasn't contented to know the God who knew everything. She wanted to be like God when in her perfect unfallen state she was already like God. And since the fall man has tried all kinds of ways to return back to that state of things.</p>
              <p>At present the problem with man is not ignorance, but sin. It is sin that causes and brings about suffering and death. Every man knows that he is not morally perfect. I don't think any person would dare to honestly say that if he would die that instant he would be confident and assured to qualify for heaven. He knows deep within that while there is some good in him there is also a lot of bad in him, enough to keep him from going to heaven. But while man can be aware of how sinful he is, he can also be ignorant of the way to heaven. And I believe that's where the Gospel, the Good News, comes in.</p>

              <p>Re...direct causes of suffering are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">desire or craving, and ignorance.</span> commonly are this :-</p>
              <p>5) <em>The Suffering of Being Apart from Those You Love</em>. Love is the feeling you have toward someone or something you like. When you love someone or something, you want to be together with that person or object all the time. You never want to part from them. However, sometimes circumstances arise in which people must be parted from those that they love and this brings on an acute kind of suffering.</p>
              <p>6) <em>The Suffering of Being Together with Those You Hate</em>. For example, there is a person whom you absolutely can't stand; you find it so hard to be around such a person that you want to leave him. However, when you deliberately go to another place to be away from him, you run into another person who is exactly like the person whom you couldn't stand. And so that's the suffering of being together with those you hate.</p>
              <p>7) <em>The Suffering of Not Obtaining What You Seek</em>. Suppose there is something you really want, but circumstances prevent you from getting it for your own. You want it, but you don't get it. No matter what you do, there is no way to fulfill you own wishes. That is the suffering of not obtaining what you seek.</p>

              <p>Losing the one you love, or being in the company of the one you hate, or not getting what you want. Yes, I agree with you that all such circumstances will be suffering in some sense. But I think you would also agree that these feelings are real because they are experienced and felt by you and I.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <h4><span style="color: #888888;">Q: You have said that according to Buddhist philosophy there is no Creator, no God of creation, and this may initially put off many people who believe in a divine principle. Can you explain the difference between the Vajrayana Primordial Buddha and a Creator God?</span></h4>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>A:</strong> I understand the Primordial Buddha, also known as Buddha Samantabhadra, to be the ultimate reality, the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras. However, in the context of your question, the tantric tradition is the only one which explains the Dharmakaya in terms of Inherent clear light, the essential nature of the mind; this would seem imply that all phenomena, samsara and nirvana, arise from this clear and luminous source.

              <p>simply because one had got through <em>logical </em>examination. to me Buddhism had great wisdom, fit the universal puzzle and not magical. although in the beginning one needed faith at first, then when one had studied further and practice(meditations, as a form of witnessing and opening of its true wisdom), it'll become more logical and more convincing. i guess, u only study a few months, and never practice meditation, <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">moreover u are also scare of god's punishment to disobey him or believe other thing,</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">hence no </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">examination of Buddhism to say it's not logical. in ur term, u are not "touch" by Buddhadharma. but i was touched. :)</span></p>

              <p>A lack of details does not render the information invalid or false. At most one can only say the information is insufficient. On the other hand, providing details also does not mean it is true. The issue isn't whether there is enough information to satisfy you, the issue is whether the information given is true.</p>
              <p>In any case, the Bible already stated that Eve was created from Adam's side. We are talking about the first chapter of the first book of the Bible, why would that be considered unexplained? God put the tree there, in fact you ought to have read Genesis 1 and know what is written there. Things came into existence because God called them into existence.</p>
              <p>As to where the devil comes from, the information is supplied elsewhere in the Bible. Basically the devil is a fallen angel, another creation of God. I believe Satan's fall from heaven took place sometime after creation week in the spiritual realms.</p>
              <p>Lastly, the issue is not about whether Buddhists hold up the hope of being enlightened in the next few rebirths. The issue is that the Buddhist has had COUNTLESS rebirths and still remains in samsara. There will be countless rebirths in the future as well. In other words, you have no hope in this life and in the countless lives to come to escape samsara. Otherwise you would have already been out of it by now.</p>

              <p>The fact that there is a desire and attachment to speak of presupposes the existence of a self. Even if you want to deny such a thing there must be a self to deny a self!

              <dl><dd><em>Pratitya samutpada</em> is sometimes called the teaching of cause and effect, but that can be misleading, because we usually think of cause and effect as separate entities, with cause always preceding effect, and one cause leading to one effect. According to the teaching of Interdependent Co-Arising, cause and effect co-arise (<em>samutpada</em>) and everything is a result of multiple causes and conditions... In the sutras, this image is given: "Three cut reeds can stand only by leaning on one another. If you take one away, the other two will fall." For a table to exist, we need wood, a carpenter, time, skillfulness, and many other causes. And each of these causes needs other causes to be. The wood needs the forest, the sunshine, the rain, and so on. The carpenter needs his parents, breakfast, fresh air, and so on. And each of those things, in turn, has to be brought about by other causes and conditions. If we continue to look in this way, we'll see that nothing has been left out. Everything in the cosmos has come together to bring us this table. Looking deeply at the sunshine, the leaves of the tree, and the clouds, we can see the table. The one can be seen in the all, and the all can be seen in the one. One cause is never enough to bring about an effect. A cause must, at the same time, be an effect, and every effect must also be the cause of something else. Cause and effect inter-are. The idea of first and only cause, something that does not itself need a cause, cannot be applied.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da#cite_note-15">[d]</a></sup></dd></dl>

              <p>Then you should also note that the notion of contingent and necessary beings is taught in philosophy but it is not called emptiness which (as mentioned before) is a rather misleading term.</p>
              <p>That three sticks support each other does not negate that there are three separate sticks. If it was placed there by design and purpose, then it implies that an intelligent cause was behind the arrangement. It was caused by intelligence. You see, the point about causes and effects are not lost on me. But what is inscrutable is the idea that it is turtles all the way down. In the desire to avoid a theistic conclusion or beginning the buddhist ends up biting the bullet of an illogical conclusion. Causes can be multiple or singular, it really depends on what is the case being examined. Causes can also be personal or impersonal.</p>
              <p>That the universe works together as a system or network of interdependency points to intelligence at work. The human body is a work of marvel and intricate interdependency of systems. It didn't and couldn't just happen like that. It reflects intelligent design since all these function to work together. I credit this to God whereas you credit some nebulous and undiscernible causes and effects that stretches back to infinity past.</p>

              <p>From where did you get the idea that God is telling Christians to enforce anything?</p>
              <p>Christians are called to preach repentance and salvation from sin and eternal separation from God. We use words and proclamation to tell people to turn away from sin and towards God. It's no different from calling on people to run away from impending tsunami disaster. The Bible does not teach coercion, neither did Jesus or the early church forced anyone to believe in God. The choice is always yours to make.</p>

              <p>Then you should also note that the notion of contingent and necessary beings is taught in philosophy but it is not called emptiness which (as mentioned before) is a rather misleading term.</p>
              <p>That three sticks support each other does not negate that there are three separate sticks. If it was placed there by design and purpose, then it implies that an intelligent cause was behind the arrangement. It was caused by intelligence. You see, the point about causes and effects are not lost on me. But what is inscrutable is the idea that it is turtles all the way down. In the desire to avoid a theistic conclusion or beginning the buddhist ends up biting the bullet of an illogical conclusion. Causes can be multiple or singular, it really depends on what is the case being examined. Causes can also be personal or impersonal.</p>
              <p>That the universe works together as a system or network of interdependency points to intelligence at work. The human body is a work of marvel and intricate interdependency of systems. It didn't and couldn't just happen like that. It reflects intelligent design since all these function to work together. I credit this to God whereas you credit some nebulous and undiscernible causes and effects that stretches back to infinity past.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein.</span><span style="color: #888888;"> But we must be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual level.</span></p>
