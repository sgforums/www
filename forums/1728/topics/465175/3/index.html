              <p>there's two kind that Buddhism mention. one is Brahma, the first being who first appeared in our universe, who have the great power to create using his freewill. but he's also subjected to death after a very very long eon.</p>
              <p>the second is about the ultimate source. clear light, but it need to be accompanied by more explaination, so that Buddhists will not be misleaded.</p>
              <p><em>"We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein. But we must be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual level.</em>  "--Dalai Lama</p>

              <p>Yet I have not seen an argument from you why our existence does not point to there being a God! You simply assert that.</p>
              <p>I have already given lots of arguments for the existence of God. A painting points to a painter. The universe points to a Creator. Things don't make themselves. Evidence of design is all around us, in fact it is in us! The eye is a marvel of design. It couldn't just evolve by itself. The existence of the universe is already sufficient evidence to show that God exists, just like the existence of a painting is sufficient to prove that a painter exists. I certainly cannot convince someone who refuses to be convinced, but I believe my arguments have been persuasive and compelling. Staunch atheist Anthony Flew saw the evidence for God from the design in living things and finally gave up resisting the conclusion that there is a God. Neither do I agree with you that there are loopholes in my arguments, and you have not demonstrated them either.</p>

              <p>You are right in observing that belief in God is at the core of my faith. The question then is whether God exists or not. If He does, and you decide to ignore that, then all your cultivation of mind and action will come to naught because you failed to find out what God requires of you. But if God does not exist, I won't be any worse off because in Christianity there is also a cultivation of mind and action. The Christian has no objection to the 8 fold path as commendable and good moral values, the only thing I see is that it is impossible to keep them perfectly. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. As for me, the crux of the issue is whether the claims made are true.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Yet I have not seen an argument from you why our existence does not point to there being a God! You simply assert that.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I have already given lots of arguments for the existence of God. A painting points to a painter. The universe points to a Creator. Things don't make themselves. Evidence of design is all around us, in fact it is in us! The eye is a marvel of design. It couldn't just evolve by itself. The existence of the universe is already sufficient evidence to show that God exists, just like the existence of a painting is sufficient to prove that a painter exists. I certainly cannot convince someone who refuses to be convinced, but I believe my arguments have been persuasive and compelling. Staunch atheist Anthony Flew saw the evidence for God from the design in living things and finally gave up resisting the conclusion that there is a God. Neither do I agree with you that there are loopholes in my arguments, and you have not demonstrated them either.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You are right in observing that belief in God is at the core of my faith. The question then is whether God exists or not. If He does, and you decide to ignore that, then all your cultivation of mind and action will come to naught because you failed to find out what God requires of you. But if God does not exist, I won't be any worse off because in Christianity there is also a cultivation of mind and action. The Christian has no objection to the 8 fold path as commendable and good moral values, the only thing I see is that it is impossible to keep them perfectly. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. As for me, the crux of the issue is whether the claims made are true.</span></p>

              <blockquote class="uncited">The Budhha's explanation of the universe was what the present scientists found out to be.  He divided the process of "creation" (for lack of better word) into four stages...formation, existence, degeneration, and destruction. Upon destruction, all the material elements returned to their original base elements, and after a long long time, they began to group together and the process of formation would start again. So you can understand, that the whole process is a cycle, and has no beginning or ending. These forces of "creation, formation, existence, and destruction" are universal throughout the entire cosmic space which has no ending. Time is a non factor, it has no meaning in this cosmic display of life cycle. Space is also a non entity; it is just void.<br> <br>At any point in time there is this incessent cycle of creation, existence, degeneration and destruction of stars, planets, and even galaxies!  Space has no ending, which can be better decribed as void.  The Buddha called our galaxy, Cakkavala. Cakka meaning wheel or spiral.  Our galaxy is spiral in shape.  The whole universe, the Buddha called it Loka Dhatu, meaning, world of elements.  In this endless void, there exists countless galaxies.  The size and distance of these galaxies are beyond our human imagination and understanding!  Our earth world is just an insignificant speck of dust in this whole unimaginable universe of cosmic existence!  <br> <br>this universal cycle of formation, existence, degeration, and ultimate destruction; repeats itself ad infinitum.</blockquote>

              <p>This was in response to the quote that atoms are largely empty space as if to draw the conclusion that the universe is made up of nothing. If you look at a fishing net, it would consist of much "empty space" between the wires/ropes. There is thus more empty space relative to actual material making up the net. But can we draw the conclusion that the net is made up of basically empty space? Empty space is not nothing. There is an equivocation on the term empty.</p>

              <p>1. Yes, I get it that you don't care about the existence of God. But you are not getting it that your apathy towards this question reflects a flaw in your approach to life.</p>

              <p>1. Yes, I get it that you don't care about the existence of God. But you are not getting it that your apathy towards this question reflects a flaw in your approach to life.</p>
              <p>2. Any so-called attempt at liberation from suffering that does not take into account the issue of God would IMO be very flawed.</p>
              <p>3. Yes, your good deeds can amount to nothing ultimately. I am sure you have found yourself in similar circumstances, where you tried to do good but it amounted to nothing because you lacked the information.</p>
              <p>4. Be it precepts of 8 fold paths, it is still impossible, and that's not for lack of trying. You have had countless attempts in the past and you are still here.</p>
              <p>5. And since the issue is about whether truth claims are true, then apathy cannot be the answer!</p>

              <p>1. who says not caring about the existence of god means a flaw in approach to life? Just because you think it is impt to care about the existence of god, doesn't means its right.</p>
              <p>2. Any so-called attempt at liberation from suffering that does not take into account the issue of God would IMO be very flawed --&gt; to you it mayb flawed, that doesn't equate to it essentially being flaw, further more, buddhism and christianity are 2 different realm. What is flawed to you, may not be flawed to us</p>
              <p>The exchanges b/w ppl here and you is like... you asked a open ended question and expect a MCQ answer.</p>

              <p>1. Flawed as in it simply chucks aside a question that is of utmost importance. You will of course deny that it is important at all. Yet this is not what most people think. Why else do you think the new Atheists are so "evangelistic" in their writings? Or that debates on the existence of God are always being staged? Or that philosophers address this question? Perhaps you do not stop to reflect on whether you have treated this issue too lightly and if you ought to continue to do so.</p>
              <p>2. The issue of suffering has two sides to it, a physical side and a moral side to it. If there is no God, then all suffering is just physical and natural. There is no need to ask "Why" at all or feel depressed or even angry at suffering. It becomes just a brute fact and reality to be accepted, not overcome. Yet there is evidently a moral side to this issue. Suffering is seen as something morally not right, an evil even. It is the kind of question posed when people ask why if there is a God that there is so much suffering. So don't you see that the issue of suffering and God is related?</p>
              <p>3. I don't think I asked many open-ended questions. Most of my questions are rather direct and the answers are few, thus an MCQ kind of question indeed!</p>

              <p>the answers are few because you only accept those few as answers! but it is not absolute that those answers that you accept are the only answers/right answers.</p>

              <p>Pray tell what other answers to the question of God's existence do you have besides these three?</p>
              <p>Yes</p>
              <p>No</p>
              <p>Don't Know</p>
              <p>Actually the answer is just either Yes or No, the third answer is actually an admission of ignorance, which is IMO a better and more humble answer than the arrogant stance of apathy displayed by some here.</p>
