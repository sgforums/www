              acknowledging that in us which feels, gets hurts, complains, aspires and is
              motivated for good or bad. We need to spend time enquiring into it, steadying
              it and releasing it from hindrances and afflictions. We can feel slighted or
              welcomed by people’s behaviour, useless or in demand with regard to a work or
              family situation. These felt meanings’ carry a meaning that forms who we seem
              to be – a winner, a no-account, a trusted partner, a loner or whatever. People
              will commit huge amounts of their resources, and even risk their lives to get
              to be a winner with that ‘top of the world’ feeling. And at the other end of
              the spectrum, there are suicides and the self-destructive behaviour of those
              who feel they are hopeless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>These felt meanings are volatile: they
              move our hearts and affect how we act. Yet real as it all these feelings seem,
              they do change; and if I follow them then who I seem to be changes in
              accordance with them. When I am being ‘me, the harassed, overworked’ my manner
              will have a different flavour than when I’m ‘me, welcoming you to my home.’
              Actually, I have quite a few selves, or subsidiary personalities, which take
              centre stage dependent on the situation, pressures and natural conditions like
              health. My world-view and motivation may change between one of these personae
              (these selves that we have within us) and the next – sometimes I can hardly
              believe it when someone reports back to me what I said when I was in a
              difficult mood. In fact, I might comment that ‘I wasn’t quite myself then.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>These ranging personae, of which any one
              can be occupying the ‘me’ space at a given time, are based on felt meanings
              that arise around one’s role, function, and relationship – as well as on physical
              health and current attitude. The most residual ones, the ones that really feel
              like me, are the ones carried in the heart: ‘I am the one who has to do all the
              work (and receives no recognition)’; ‘I am the one who can’t manage and needs
              others to make decisions for me…’ and so on. They direct us through event after
              event, and yet we might not even recognize them as such because the mind will
              imagine that the feeling is being created not from some internal bias, but from
              the situation that’s occurring around us. Or, after a while, as one finds
              oneself in yet another re-run of the damaging relationship or in charge of
              another project that failed because we again underestimated what was needed,
              the assumption can grow that this bias is our true self. The potentially
              crippling reaction can set in that ‘I am weak-willed’ or ‘I’m a complete
              idiot.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>However, there is a wiser and more
              useful way of understanding the personal predicament. It touches into the
              Buddha’s teachings on kamma, and is supported by the meditations that we’ve
              been working with. And it can bring around deep changes for the better.</span></p>

              refers to the cause and effect of our intentions, to action that occurs because
              of intention, i.e. the mind is bent on that action. Such actions leave results
              in terms of memories and habits. This result is called ‘vipaka’ or ‘old kamma.’
              So we live within a continuum of action and result, (kamma-vipaka), in which
              whatever we do while conscious of doing it leaves a result in the mind. These
              results may be experienced as the reactions and responses of others, or as
              effects on our physical well-being, but the deepest result is mental. That is,
              our actions have a psychological and emotional result that shapes our minds.
              After all, this is the way we learn: we do something and from the results –
              from the feedback that other people or our bodies or our own minds give us – we
              notice whether that action gave us well-being or pain. Through contact, that
              feedback gets lodged as a memory, a perception or felt meaning. It’s a detail
              on our psychological road map of how to proceed through life. That detail, a
              memory, or a piece of behaviour becomes one strand in the weave of our
              identity. That’s how your mind gets shaped, for good or for ill. And so one
              result of kamma, good or bad, is the sense of self.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>Now maybe the mapping gets messed up. It
              can be the case that the feedback we received from others was skewed – you
              know, you told the truth, but someone got annoyed. Still on your map, you’re
              cautious about going down that track again. Worse still, somebody gave you a
              hard time, not because of what you did, but because they were having a bad day
              and you got in the way. This happens a lot. We all get affected by other
              people’s kamma and this is very confusing. You weren’t doing anything wrong in
              your own eyes and someone takes a swing at you. Maybe your mother or your
              father was upset at the time. Maybe the kids at school ridiculed your ears or
              your voice or your clothes or your skin colour because they thought it was fun,
              or their parents didn’t like blacks or Jews or Albanians. So you end up hurt or
              bitter and frustrated because of what other people do – and that affects the
              way you are in the world. You have all kinds of dangerous territory on your
              map. The result is you develop a persona accordingly: a ‘self’ with a mental
              bent towards fear, or towards trying to be liked, or towards bitterness and
              violence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>Another problem is that we don’t always
              learn that well: we get a short-term boost and don’t notice the long-term
              results of, for instance, drinking alcohol. Or we get the happy buzz of buying
              new things and don’t take into account the long-term effects on our bank
              account. Our instincts aren’t always based on wise reflection, so confused
              assumptions about other people or a lack of clarity as to cause and effect are
              more common sources of bad kamma than a deliberately harmful intent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>The main point of the teaching on kamma
              isn’t who you were in a previous life – you can’t practise with that. Nor is a
              teaching of predestination, or about divining the future: no Awakening in any
              of that. It’s telling us that what we do while conscious of doing it is
              something we need to be clear about and work with. If we are consciously
              motivated by compassion, or by aversion, or by fear (even if someone else has
              planted that fear in our minds) then those qualities get established in our
              minds. And every time you act from a felt meaning and mental inclination, the
              persona that goes with it takes a bigger position in your mind and heart. As
              you act, so you become. That’s kamma, cause and effect. And that’s what
              ‘not-self’ implies – what we seem to be, our self, is a dynamic of causes and
              effects and not some unchanging entity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>Two clear messages come through from
              this teaching: one is to get clear about action and especially to look into the
              motivations behind it. Whether we are motivated by anxiety, affection,
              bitterness or just plain unknown random reaction, these give rise to an
              anxious, affectionate, bitter or confused personality trait. Continue along
              those lines and that’s who you sense yourself as being. Therefore meditate, get
              to know what’s going on under the lid, what makes you tick. Be mindful and
              allow the immediate impulse to be witnessed, let pass, be questioned, or
              enhanced. That’s the first message.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>The second is to know what is good, what
              you want to live with, what you want to base your life upon. Because any day
              that life may end, and you don’t want to be dying with grudges and anxieties in
              your heart. If you take the Buddha’s word on it, those tendencies that are
              dominant in your mind when you die will dictate the way another ‘you’ comes
              into being in the future. This seems reasonable to me, as it’s what happens in
              this life. But if you don’t accept that, still, you’d sooner live in this life
              without anxiety and regret.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>Perceptions are old kamma</span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '></span></p>

              keen on getting clear as to why we act and what’s really going on with all
              those split-second assumptions of feeling trusted or nervous, the focus is on
              two strands of mental behaviour. One is felt meaning or perception, the other
              is the mental activity that informs and responds to that, both of which we’ve
              touched on before. So: the broad term ‘perception’ (saññÄ�) refers to both the
              initial impression of a sense-object, and the felt meaning that is our ‘take’
              on what that thing is. So we might both agree that a stretch of sparkling
              flowing stuff is the sea – that’s the initial reference; but the felt meaning
              is subjective. One person might see it as dangerous, while another sees it as a
              lovely place to bathe: the mapping is in accordance with each person’s previous
              experience. Both maps have some truth in them, but holding on to one generates
              conflict with the other.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>It’s the activity called ‘contact’
              (which has both a sensory impression aspect and a heart-based meaning aspect to
              it) that establishes perceptions. So where there’s a lot of heart-involvement,
              the felt meanings get very subjectively mapped. This is very much the case with
              perceptions of people. When we meet other people, many value judgements and
              personal biases are bound to occur – this is someone I can trust, need to win
              over, can help, better be on guard against, etc. Any of these may be so – all
              perceptions have some truth in them – but can we suspend and reflect on the
              habitual interpretation, the one that first leaps to mind, before acting on it?
              Can we check the map in the light of mindful awareness? Maybe that impression
              is pointing to an aspect of another person to bear in mind, or maybe it’s
              telling us something about our own standpoint and bias.</span></p>

              heart-biases is living in our own body, speech and heart: good old me –
              whatever I have decided I am, will never be, and deserve to be. And of course
              there’s also the ‘me’ sense that arises dependent on how I’m seen by others. As
              meditators, we watch and feel these felt meanings and personae. We sense them
              as transient and in process. We sense them as things that occupy consciousness,
              but not as belonging to or defining some true and lasting self. If any one of
              them were really me, then who is the self that’s watching them? That reflection
              offers us the opportunity to respond to perception, to calm it, accept it, or
              look into it rather than to keep following or repressing it.</span></p>

              world or the self we seem to be right now. We don’t have to make more habitual
              kamma out of what’s happening, or what others do. One of the memorable sayings
              of the Buddha is: ‘<em>We live happily, friendly even amongst those who are
              hostile</em>’ [Dhp. 197]. In other words, when we’re among people who dislike
              us, we can sense that their attitude is their kamma and leave it there. Their
              bias doesn’t have to take over our own hearts and minds. And we might feel
              after a few moments (or hours or years) that we could make some good kamma
              around such impressions. We could clear our own fear and anger. Then, once
              we’ve seen how reactive and edgy our own minds can get, we could make peace
              with, be compassionate and generous – even to people who’ve hurt us. Why not?
              We’re not being asked to approve of others, just to finish with the grudges and
              start afresh. This is a big step, but it is what is most truly grand and worthy
              about humans. We can step out of history and we can step forward in a different
              way. And in ourselves there’s the joy: ‘Oh, that mean feeling, that
              twenty-year-old surge of blame or guilt or vengefulness – it’s gone.’ We’ve
              ended a piece of old kamma and the mind feels spacious, settled and agile. So
              the encouragement is to Awaken to kamma, to end old kamma rather than try to
              sort out whose fault it is. This is the ongoing process of liberation.</span></p>

              get a useful handle on the second strand of mental behaviour, <em>sankhÄ�ra</em> –
              ‘activities’ or ‘formations.’ They’re activities because they’re the agents of
              kamma. Intention is the leader of these, but it’s not on its own. Activities
              are everything that causes or is liable to cause, action. What this means is
              that all those qualities that seem to be ‘I’ as an agent (as in ‘I do, I speak,
              I feel’) are not, and aren’t issuing from, a solid being but are repeated
              activities; programs if you like. But when these programs get established, they
              have solidity: hence ‘formations.’ Furthermore all those moods and states that
              seem to be ‘me’ or ‘my self’ as an object (as in ‘my real self is a tragic
              romantic’, or ‘a misunderstood genius’) are formed programs of sorrow,
              frustration or self-importance. Heart-contact (classically called ‘designation
              contact’) will etch these on our personal map and thereby establish the
              perceptual references that we judge current experience by. So a mishap gets
              read as ‘Life is tragic’; or ‘No one understands me.’ True enough in a way, but
              no-one understands anyone all of the time; and life is also comic, resilient,
              and the optimal occasion for Awakening. So the perception is a truth of our own
              mapping, and the mistake is turning it into an activity.</span></p>

              contact, play a part in this, because attention frames an experience, and
              contact establishes the perception of it as an accurate impression. So, with
              regards to attention – if you’re not attending to something the contact doesn’t
              happen; you don’t get a perception, and you don’t get a corresponding
              intention. (As when you’re watching a movie: you don’t notice that your leg’s
              going numb, so you don’t get the impulse to move.) Also if contact doesn’t
              place something accurately in terms of your store of perceptions – if you see
              someone who reminds you of a friend from childhood, when they’re not – you get
              an inappropriate response. To take another example: say you’re out walking in
              the country with a friend, and she suddenly stops dead in her tracks, points
              ahead and comes out with a Latin name. What you see is a pretty bird sitting in
              a bush. So you think the name refers to the bird, when in fact it’s the name of
              the bush. You both ‘saw’ the same thing, but because your respective attentions
              framed different details of the scene, you had different sense-contact
              experiences. As it turns out she is a botanist, and gets very excited at the
              sight of this rare plant, it means a lot to her. But you’ve seen birds like
              that many times and think ‘So what.’ So the designation contacts differ,
              dependent on personal history. To take it a step further: her utterance came
              from an eager (though misguided) intention to share her joy. You think, ‘Why
              not call it a yellowhammer, like everybody else does? Who’s she trying to
              impress!’ So here the intentions get skewed and misinterpreted; she wonders why
              you’ve gone dismissive – which triggers things in her, and you think she’s
              being highfalutin or showing off, and that triggers things in you.</span></p>

              driver (intention) has their own ideas and latent tendencies. This is not good

For
              starters, it’s good to remember that all this is not-self; and to take to heart
              the practice whereby you can witness and shift intention, attention and
              contact. First of all, take intention. What you may notice about those
              responses and impulses is that they arise dependent on perceptions. Some are
              re-runs of basic programs and personal history. Somearise through accessing states
              of tension or numb-ness in the bodyrather than through particular thoughts or
              present-day scenarios. (These embodied states can carry a large amount of
              ‘kammic mapping,’ therefore one should work around such areas with
              sensitivity.) Some are directly disagreeable, such as anger, depression or
              grief. Emotion can be stimulating and lift us up, but it also uses up huge
              resources of energy. The search for happy feelings can get us into some
              addictive pastimes and impair our capacity for responsibility and
              fellow-feeling. And yet, our life is structured around these activities; and
              carrying out intentions is what a meaningful life is all about. Indeed so. So
              we can and do intend towards the clear, the compassionate, the generous.
              Through wise intention there’s the possibility of shifting our activities into
              a better program.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>Meditative training is about doing just
              this; it’s about using activities skilfully. So we cultivate intentions of
              clarity and kindness. And we cultivate deep attention. These allow us to
              con-template contact, perception and any intentions that consequently arise in
              terms of good, bad, suffering, or well-being. In this way the twofold
              meditative activity of calm and insight (<em>samatha-vipassanÄ�</em>) comes into
              play.</span></p>

              activities operate through three channels – body, heart and thought. With some
              practice we can notice how one affects the others and we get some perspective
              on their very convincing and compulsive programs. Especially the clutching one
              that keeps creating a sense of self. That’s the one to work on for the release

              activities, and so is the release from kamma. For this, in the meditative
              process, we discern and work with activities in all the channels. First there’s
              the bodily activity, which gives rise to the sense of ‘where I am.’ It’s the
              activity, governed by breathing, of having a vital and grounded body, a sense
              of being located in a physical context. That means there will be many ‘fight,
              flight, feed on this’ reflexes ready to fire. Secondly, there’s the
              mental/heart activity that presents us with moods, feelings, perceptions and
              intuitions. This tells us ‘how I am.’ And finally, there’s the ‘what I’m going
              to do (or should do) about all this’: a bubbling energy of thoughts and
              attitudes. This is our ‘head sense’, our ability to conceive and articulate,
              the verbal activity. When these <em>sankhÄ�ra</em> are running, they form our
              habitual and habituating responses with corresponding thinking, mood and body
              tone. So: we recognize a task that needs to be done – and our thinking system
              starts whirring; we see someone we are fond of – and a surge rises up in our
              hearts; there is a sense of threat or danger – and our bodily sense tenses up.
              Whether the intention behind them is good or bad, confused or wise, they
              manifest in a dynamic way and we can witness them in terms of body, heart and
              thought.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>Of the three activities, the heart
              activity is the most crucial, because this is where conscious action, fresh
              kamma, originates. Every action originates with a felt meaning, a mental
              perception that contact places in the heart and which may trigger verbal or
              physical action. Designation contact places us on our kammic map. Actually it’s
              more like landing on a trampoline of cause and effect: something touches the
              heart and we bounce into a reaction. However we can get off the thing. If we
              get the heart to discern, to restrain, and to step back from its habits, we can
              first of all adjust our bounce, and have some choice in terms of what kamma we
              create. And that initial non-involvement gives us another choice: to
              investigate a perception and impulse and stop bouncing up and down.
              Sense-contact doesn’t have to dump us on our kammic trampoline. ‘<em>From the
              ceasing of contact is the ceasing of kamma</em>’ as the Buddha puts it [A.6.63].</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>So the cycle of <em>kamma-vipaka</em> can
              be changed, or stopped altogether through releasing the heart from the grip of
              activities. Towards this end, using the body is great because although you may
              have run out of the capacity to feel much patience and compassion for a boss
              who’s been surly and demanding for ten years, or with a three-year-old who’s
              throwing his breakfast at the wall and screaming while you’re trying to get his
              sister dressed…you can still breathe in and out. And know ‘this is where I am,
              right now.’ It doesn’t seem to resolve the situation, but it takes you out of
              the bounce of felt meanings and emotions and ‘fix it, do something’ programs to
              a place where you can gather your resources. From there, you can witness and
              not take the whole scene so personally. This kind of thing has happened and
              will happen to others; this too will pass and you’re not obliged to solve the
              situation or make it work. Know the feeling as a feeling, be with that urge to
              scream and lash out – as an activity rather than as me and mine. Let it arise
              and pass. You don’t have to be a character in someone else’s movie – or even in
              your own. You don’t even have to take on the ‘I should be capable, assured, in
              charge and able to master this’ program and persona. You can put aside the maps
              and act, or wait, with mindfulness and clear comprehension. You’ve started
              freeing up a bit of old kamma.</span></p>

              with not letting the old pattern trap you into becoming its stooge. You just
              feel the activity for what it is. In meditation you can contemplate the
              activities that move the heart through feeling them in the body – just think of
              your pet love or hate and feel the flush that happens. And as you feel it, let
              it move and pass. You’ll probably feel yourself becoming charged up, tight or
              hot or bristling, you may even recognize the mood of the persona who arises
              with that activity. Do you need to be/want to be bounced into that
              person…again? Well, sometimes we do. Much of the time we either want to become
              the loved and enriched person that floods our nerve endings, or we feel we have
              no choice but to be weighed-down loser that the world seems to make us. However
              we can choose to contemplate these possibilities. Stepping back into mindful
              awareness, you can feel how that person is going nowhere but round and round.
              That’s what we call ‘<em>samsÄ�ra</em>’ – happy or unhappy, it’s the business of
              going round and round. Then know that for what it is. When you get the point
              that there’s only a virtual self in that round, an appearance that doesn’t
              arrive at anywhere final, maybe the momentum pauses. There may be an emotional
              shift, or a sense of relief. Subsequently you can act with clarity with a
              clearer view.</span></p>

              really just exploring how it is, rather than trying to find something, the only
              mental kamma that you add is that of mindfulness and investigation. This is the
              kamma that leads to the end of kamma, in that it doesn’t establish a new
              perception of, ‘He is one of those’ or, ‘I am an obsessive person.’ Mindfulness
              and investigation helps us to experience the storehouse of perceptions,
              impressions and felt meanings as programs that run through the body-mind
              system. Other factors of Awakening follow on the deeper you penetrate the
              activities. Applied persistent energy keeps you engaged with the process, and
              keeps your inner hero alive. Its vigour builds up the power of the mind so that
              we can stand back from habitual activity. This results in the three factors
              that provide vitality and firmness – rapture, calm and concentration. When the
              mind is firm and calm, then there is the factor of equanimity directed towards
              activities; even the good and useful ones you can know are just that, not
              something to make into a person. That means you can have a good idea without
              having to shout it from the rooftops. And you can have a helpful insight, or a
              state of concentration, without getting conceited and obnoxious about it all.</span></p>

              not solid three-dimensional realities, they aren’t me or mine. Every place
              where there’s a grip around an activity, it feels like ‘me’ and the basis for
              stress is established. So there’s a deep learning that has to be done that
              affects our way of being. In a nutshell, the point is to relax the activity
              that clings to activities…even to the good ones. Because of course, we’re not
              trying to ultimately get rid of activities, and just sit there like a turnip.
              Just as we need to have perceptions to get some sketch of what things mean, we
              also have to come up with an activity as a response. The key point is to get
              free of the clinging, because it’s that which blindly binds perceptions to
              activities in a habit-forming way. That’s kamma.</span></p>

              problem, but kamma has an addictive quality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>Kamma is addictive because we’re used to
              <em>sankhÄ�ra</em> showing and telling us who we are. Even if our self-view is
              wretched, the hunger to be something is such an ingrained reflex that we
              operate around it. Just like a junkie ordering his/her life around getting the
              next fix: it’s never going to be enough, it costs us and we should really snap
              out of it, but it takes some doing. Beyond what we like to be, there is a
              reflex to be something solid and permanent that kicks in by itself. This is the
              reflex of ‘becoming.’ It provides the support for and is the result of
              grasping. It wants to be something, some self – and whether that is a
              millionaire who has far more money than they need, or an athlete who runs their
              body to rags, or a depressive who has a much darker view of themselves than is
              balanced and true, that instinct pushes us along into self. The rarest
              experience for a human being isn’t bliss, but feeling that they (and life) are
              ‘good enough.’ Becoming is insatiable: it always wants more, a new success, a
              bigger deal, another future. The Buddha said this can go on for lifetimes: he
              called the process ‘further becoming’ – which is about as interesting as
              chewing the same piece of meat for a thousand years. It’s only ignorance that
              keeps us at it!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>The subtle aspect of this from the
              spiritual seeker’s point of view is that it’s not possible that ‘I can get
              enlightened.’ From the position of a solid ‘me’ trying to gain something, we
              can’t experience full liberation – because that view of self is an activity. It
              too is a reflex and an addiction. However, we can come out of the addiction by
              being filled with the deep potential of the factors of Awakening. These provide
              the inner stability and richness that means the mind doesn’t have to keep
              leaning on the activities, and identifying with feelings, energies and
              attitudes for support. It doesn’t have to be solid thing; when balance is
              established, the mind can be a process, and one that leads off the bouncy
              trampoline of kamma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 22.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #333333; '>So generating these factors is the kamma
              that leads to the end of kamma. Therefore, mindfulness and investigation are
              crucial. Applied energy and patience are also necessary because some activities
              have very convincing and compulsive patterns. There’s ‘righteous me, stuck in
              an unfair world.’ Then again there’s the inner tyrant who gives us scathing
              indictments and endless naggings over our laziness, stupidity, weakness and all-round
              hopelessness. These are important pieces of mental kamma to get free of – and
              you do so through contemplating the activities with the firmness,
              bright-heartedness and enthusiasm that comes from non-involvement. Yes, vigour
              is needed: just sitting there going through the same mental pattern time and
              time again isn’t going to bring release. It can even etch the program deeper.
              So when you’re getting stuck, stay out of that place, regroup around your
              skills with breathing or get the assistance of another person’s mindful
              awareness. That’s what teachers and spiritual friends are for.</span></p>

              can get, equanimity arises. This is a very spacious kind of love that neither
              approves nor disapproves, but offers all the empathic space that we need to
              allow us to sense our kammic programs without attachment. Then our apparent
              winning and losing selves can march through without judgement and be seen for
              what they are. This view offers a life-changing opportunity: when you
              experience your passions, nagging anxieties and defence strategies as just old
              kamma, you can step out of them. You don’t have to keep offering board and
              lodging to hungry ghosts that leave the place in a mess. Instead, in the
              process of releasing old kamma, you live in a fuller, more spacious and assured
              way – just because you’re not carrying so much stuff around.</span></p>
