              Terror War</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Prashanth Parameswaran November 02, 2017 The Diplomat</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The move reveals growing alarm about the Islamic State threat
              and lingering challenges states face in addressing it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Earlier this week, the Singapore government said that it
              would not allow two foreign Islamic preachers to enter Singapore as part of a
              religious-themed cruise set to take place in late November. The move is just
              the latest in a series of steps that Singapore is taking to crack down on
              radical ideology, and it also exposes both the city-state’s growing alarm at
              the terrorism threat as well as the lingering challenges states face in
              addressing it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As I have noted repeatedly in these pages, Singapore
              officials have long been warning about the Islamic State threat in Southeast
              Asia, not just as another security problem but as an existential threat that
              could tear the country’s harmonious, multiracial society apart. In response,
              the city-state has been taking a series of steps to both contribute to
              confronting the challenge abroad as well as strengthening its response at home
              (See: “Singapore Warns of Islamic State Base in Southeast Asia”).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Domestically, policymakers have been undertaking a wide range
              of measures including boosting surveillance, investing more in rehabilitation
              programs, boosting public awareness, adjusting the way it conducts homeland
              defense and security operations, and using various means including drills to
              assess their responses (See: “Singapore Reveals New Military Facility Amid
              Rising Islamic State Threat”). Singapore’s officials have also been keen to
              emphasize both at home and abroad that the fight against terrorism requires not
              just a series of kinetic measures in response to the threat, but proactively
              preventing potential infiltrations and limiting the spread of radical ideology
              through various means.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This includes not just legal moves like bans on select foreign
              preachers or reviewing regulations like the Maintenance of Religious Harmony
              Act to deal with segregationist teachings, but also others such as the building
              of an Islamic College that can train more religious teachers attuned to the
              country’s context and making it mandatory for existing and aspiring Islamic
              religious and Islamic education centers and providers to register before they
              can teach Islam in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But the headlines have been largely focused on restrictions
              on foreign preachers. Singapore Home Affairs Minister and Law Minister K
              Shanmugam in particular has been suggesting that the city-state needs to
              tighten the access of select foreign preachers who can threaten the country’s
              religious harmony. Indeed, in early October, Shanmugam showed videos in
              parliament of two preachers – Mufti Ismail Menk from Zimbabwe, who had been
              banned from Singapore two years ago, and Zakir Naik based in Mumbai – arguing
              that such speech should not be allowed in Singapore. Several other preachers,
              including Christian ones who had made Islamophobic comments, have recently been
              banned as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">So it was no surprise when Singapore’s Ministry of Home
              Affairs (MHA) announced that it would not allow two foreign preachers, Menk and
              Haslin bin Baharim, who often preaches in Malaysia, to enter Singapore for a
              religious-themed cruise later this month. As MHA noted, both individuals have
              in fact already had their Miscellaneous Work Pass applications to preach in
              Singapore rejected, and this move prevents them from circumventing that earlier
              ban by preaching on cruise ships operating to and from the city-state. Details
              of the cruise itself remain unclear, and Haslin has refuted the charge against
              him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">MHA’s move speaks to the level of alarm among Singapore’s
              officials about the threat posed by not just terrorist acts, but segregationist
              and divisive teachings. Shanmugam revealed earlier this month that though the
              government may not publicize the full extent of the threat, over the past
              couple of years, the number of Singaporeans detained under the Internal
              Security Act has increased, dozens of foreign workers and maids have been
              radicalized, and the government has been thwarting potential copycat attacks.
              In this context, as the MHA said in its statement, the government’s concern is
              that these divisive views can “breed intolerance and exclusivist practices that
              will damage social harmony and cause communities to drift apart.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But moves like the preacher ban also reveal the challenges
              that the terrorism threat poses for regional states, including Singapore.
              Though banning foreign preachers who spread divisive messages and separating
              religion from politics may be a prudent move in the interest of national
              security in a diverse country, it also has been read by some as restricting free
              speech, especially given the other sorts of measures the Singapore government
              has instituted on this score.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Shanmugam, for his part, makes no apologies for the tradeoff
              that the city-state has made and continues to make between security and
              freedom. In his address to parliament in early October, he noted that Singapore
              had always believed that it had to adopt what he characterized as an “activist”
              approach of fostering interreligious and interracial harmony, whether it be in
              its integration of ethnicities in housing or using English as the medium of
              instruction in national schools. He referred to the challenges faced by
              countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany as reminders
              that Singapore had to continue to be activist in its approach.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But as Shanmugam has noted before, some of Singapore’s
              neighbors face their own challenges that make it more difficult for them to
              take as hard a line and makes for a tougher neighborhood for the city-state to
              operate in when it comes to transnational threats like terrorism. Unlike
              Singapore, whose population is mostly ethnic Chinese with Malay Muslims being
              only a minority, Malaysia and Indonesia are Muslim-majority nations, so the way
              in which they manage religion and politics also tends to be different. In both
              countries, we have seen cases where parts of the government and the opposition
              have used religion for political gain, at times at the expense of broader
              social cohesion and stability (See: “The Trouble with Indonesia’s Ahok Test“).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Meanwhile, in the Philippines, a democratic,
              majority-Christian nation with a Muslim minority in the South, even imposing
              basic law and order has been a far more complex exercise for the government,
              and Manila has had much less success in integration. As I have pointed out
              before, though the focus tends to be on the terrorism threat itself, with a
              Muslim insurgency rooted in decades-old governance issues with deep political
              and socioeconomic roots, the fact remains that the breeding ground always
              exists at a certain level for future militancy of some kind (See: “ASEAN’s
              Post-Marawi Islamic State Challenge“).</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">So even as Singapore itself undertakes tougher measures to
              counter the terrorism threat like the preacher ban, the city-state not only
              faces its own challenges domestically in managing the tradeoffs associated with
              security and freedom, but does no with a realization that its own neighbors
              face their own problems – some of them far more basic and acute – that makes
              for a far more dangerous neighborhood than it would like.</span></p>
