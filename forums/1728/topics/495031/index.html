              Ruling</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tom Allard and Jessica Damiana Nov. 7, 2017 U.S. News &amp;
              World Report</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's Constitutional Court on
              Tuesday affirmed the rights of devotees of faiths outside the country’s officially
              recognized religions, in a move activists welcomed as a "new chapter for
              religious freedom". Against a backdrop of rising intolerance toward
              minorities in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, the court said
              Indonesians would not be required to identify as either Muslim, Catholic,
              Protestant, Hindu, Buddhist or Confucian on their national identification
              cards. The ruling reviewed by Reuters followed a legal challenge by followers
              of some of Indonesia's indigenous faiths.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Bonar Tigor Naipospos from the Setara Institute, a group that
              advocates for religious harmony, said Indonesians who refused to embrace one of
              the regulated religions on their identity cards had limited access to
              education, restricted employment opportunities and were denied legal marriage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Court recommended that a seventh, catch-all category be
              created - "Believers of the Faith" - for ID cards. "This is a
              new chapter for religious freedom in Indonesia for both government and
              followers of indigenous religions," Naipospos said. "This is a door
              for the government to recognize their rights. "A spokesman for Indonesia’s
              president Joko Widodo could not immediately be reached for comment. Indonesia's
              founding constitution says the state is based on the belief in the "One
              and Only God" but guarantees "each and every citizen the freedom of
              religion and worship". However, blasphemy laws passed in 1965 stipulated
              only six religions would be protected. Subsequent regulations and laws
              effectively enshrined those as the only religions recognized by the state. "The
              ruling (on Tuesday) means the end of Indonesia recognizing only six
              religions," said Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch. In the 2000
              census, about 400,000 people identified as holding beliefs outside the six main
              religions, although Harsono said this probably underestimated the extent of
              believers in non-recognized faiths. Across Indonesia's vast chain of islands,
              more than 200 distinctive native faiths, such as the Sundanese people's
              Wiwitan, the Dayak's Kaharingan and the Torajan's Aluk To Dolo survived even as
              Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam dominated during different eras. Its people also
              blended elements of the major religions over time and infused them with animist
              and mystical beliefs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The court ruling should also apply to followers of
              non-indigenous religions such as Baha'i and Judaism that are not formally
              recognized in Indonesia, said Nia Sjarifudin of the Unity in Diversity
              Alliance.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In recent decades, Indonesia's reputation for tolerance has
              been tarnished as its unique syncretic form of Islam has been challenged by
              more fundamentalist interpretations imported from the Middle East. In the past
              year, an alliance of Islamist hardliners pushed successfully for the
              imprisonment of then Governor of Jakarta Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic
              Chinese Christian, for insulting Islam under the 1965 blasphemy laws. Atheism
              is not legal in Indonesia, and non-believers have also been charged with
              blasphemy.</span></p>
