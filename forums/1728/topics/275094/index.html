I don't practise third eye meditation, and I usually just ignore it. Some experienced practitioner said it's nothing serious and nothing to be concerned about, some other experience practitioner said I'm 'awakening my third eye', but honestly I don't care.<br><br>Why? Because all these have nothing to do with enlightenment. Buddha does not teach anyone to focus on the eyebrow for the development of spiritual powers, and is against all such special yogic methods for the purpose of developing these powers. One of my experienced friends also warned before that practising focusing in between eyebrow without some experienced person as a guide, can lead to undesirable outcomes such as opening up to the ghost realm's interferences. One should never practise these things without proper guidance, especially as a Buddhist one should avoid all these altogether.<br><br>Next, you said 'visualising having nothing around you and you are in empty space'. I am not sure where did you receive such meditation instructions, but if you are being absorbed in a state of 'empty space', that is a form of Shamatha meditation that leads to Shamatha jhanas. I have experienced certain characteristics of shamatha jhanas before. However, one will not attain enlightenment from these practises.<br><br>You experienced lightness of your body. It is dropping certain bondage during strong meditation absorption/concentration. It is normal. As Thusness said in an old post commenting on someone's experience: "The Â“densityÂ” and Â“lightnessÂ” is the weight of Â“losing her identification with certain aspect of the selfÂ”. The power of this Â“identificationÂ” cannot be underestimated.<br><br>However, this identification can only be temporarily dropped in Shamatha meditative states and jhanas, only through Enlightenment and insights into Reality can "Mind-Body-Drop off" be made permanent, particularly after the realisation of Non-Duality. The experience of complete 'mind-body-drop-off' is more than just lightness of the body, the entire bond is gone, the entire sense of a doer and body dissolves.<br><br>2 cents from an inexperienced practitioner.. hope other experienced ones can comment <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oh and... I really think you should find a qualified, experienced and enlightened teacher to guide you in proper meditation, and practise Insight practices (i.e from vipassana, zazen, dzogchen, etc, all traditions have their form insight practices) to develope penetrating Insights into Reality, i.e Enlightenment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About supernatural powers, I once wrote:<br><br><blockquote>Regarding psychic and supernatural abilities, I must first say that Buddhism discourages the seeking or cultivation of psychic powers.. Supernatural powers in Buddhism should only comes as a side effect of our Buddhist practise.. if we try to seek or develop these supernatural powers before gaining insights and wisdom, they can even lead us astray and deviated from the path of the Dharma as we will become attached to many of the paranormal phenomena and therefore not be able to develop true spiritual wisdom. Therefore it must be emphasised that though non-locality activities may be experienced such as the 5 powers, one may still not necessarily realise the non-locality of our true nature.<br><br>Also to try to develope these supernatural powers may be just a waste of time... one better cherish our precious lifetime as a human being and devote our entire energy to the practise of the Dharma that leads to wisdom and liberation. Therefore there is a Buddhist story, <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=183053" rel="nofollow">amazing abilities by concentration</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">One day the Buddha met an ascetic who sat by the bank of a river. This ascetic had practised austerities for 25 years. The Buddha asked him what he had received for all his labor. The ascetic proudly replied that, now at last, he could cross the river by walking on the water. The Buddha pointed out that this gain was insignificant for all the years of labor, since he could cross the river using a ferry for one penny!</span><br><br>Regarding supernatural abilities, generally speaking in Buddhism there are six kind of supernatural abilities, the first 5 being able to be developed by any one -- not necessarily Buddhists, non-Buddhist yogis that practise any form of shamatha, and many other religions also develope these abilities, or even through occult practises and so on. Only the sixth supernatural ability is restricted to those who have attained enlightenment, those who have transformed consciousness to wisdom. With regards to the six supernatural powers, you can read yourself: <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/tinhla01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/tinhla01.htm</a><br><br>That URL also states: <span style="font-style: italic;">...It must, however, be understood that the Buddha did not consider every trance to be necessarily good, for it must aim at the right end. He, however, realised that there were those who devoted to yogic exercises to acquire supernatural powers. So the Buddha refined the practice by telling them that even such powers could be acquired only through the practice of righteouaness and wisdom. ( Akankheyya Sutta, S. B. E. Vol. XI, ) Acquisition of supernatural powers does not confer any spiritual advantage. It was for this reason that the Buddha forbade his disciples to work miracles for display...</span></blockquote>My taiwanese teacher (even before he had met my Master he was very strong in the area of supernatural powers) had first hand experience of the really bad situation he got himself into by misusing his supernatural powers. He almost lost his life as a result, and was reprimanded by my Master.<br><br>Now, he does not allow his students to try developing supernatural powers prior to attaining Wisdom.</div>

However, for me, i personally feel that my meditation will only only allow me to relax and visualise and think very clearly on issues when in a deep meditative state.</blockquote>Not really. I have many teachers and friends who attained enlightenment without going to retreats. My taiwanese teacher attained enlightenment a few days after meeting my Master -- he didn't go for whatever retreats. My enlightened forum friends too I haven't seen them going for retreats whatsoever. But usually to deepen one's enlightenment experience is a longer process, and of course if one has retired and has the time to dedicate more time to practise it will be good, as many practitioners and my taiwanese teacher has done so.<br><br>But it'll be a totally wrong idea that to gain enlightenment you have to give up your jobs, retreat into the mountains etc. Lots of enlightened people have jobs and families, as are my dharma teachers who are lay persons as well as some of our forummers. And BTW, there are lots of enlightened people today.<br><br>Most important is to have a consistent practise. Consistent meditation have two aspects -- first it's good that you be consistent in your sitting meditation practise, but most importantly be consistent in practising in daily living. Meditation is not just in sitting. Not only should one practise sitting meditation, one must practise the dharma in daily lives. Enlightenment is truly possible. We should know the Dharma and practise it every moment. Then it is very possible to attain enlightenment.<br><br>One should not just aim for some little peace in life through meditation. Because if you just practise meditation it can give you a little peace sometimes, but you will not be able to retain peacefulness in the midst of situations and troubles. Therefore if you just practise like that it's not going to be of much help. There will not be much wisdom and results.<br><br>Practise should be every moment in our lives, not just 30 minutes or an hour every day.<br><br>BTW, hope you can read this, cultivation explained in very simple terms: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm</a></div>

I tried another third eye meditation and the forehead does not heard that bad now. I even feel that the focusing on the forehead is really good as you can really go into deep meditation easier even though you are in a rather crowded and noisy place.</div>

Buddhism doesnt teach these things.<br><br>Enlightenment and the true third eye can only come from insight practise leading to the opening of the Wisdom Eye....<br><br>All those practises such as third eye meditation etc do not lead to enlightenment.<br><br>I suggest you receive proper instructions from a qualified and experienced teachers... then your meditation will be fruitful..<br><br>p.s.

Some meditation techniques are not safe.<br><br>Also, meditation often has been miscontrued to include all kinds of esoteric connotations. This is not true. Certain meditation is really a skillful art in relaxation. Because deep relaxation is not easy at all.<br><br>Having said that I did practice 'esoteric' meditations before.<br><br>regards</div>

Third eye meditation is meditataing by visualising and focusing on the supposedly third eye area. How do you feel after doing this meditation for like 3 minutes?<br><br>In my case, my forehead starts having a pain and i feel wierd all over. I wonder if this is called deep meditation where eventually, i can visualise having nothing around me and i am in empty space. Furthermore, i also feel my body is very light. Is this normal?</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jackal33:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey<br><br>Thanks for the advice. Well, i was not told by anyone to feel the empty space around me. Its just that i suddenly felt that when i visualise myself in an empty space, my body just seem to be like that as well.<br><br>Btw, do you actually feel afraid when you feel so light in the body and mind? I guess i also wouldnt try third eye meditation though i still dont understand the pain on my forehead, is it really my body trying to open a so called third eye or is it that i focus too hard on a particular area of my body?<br><br>I believe enlightenment will come slowly over years of meditation in retreat.
