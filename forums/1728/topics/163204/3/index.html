Wudang as its birthplace, this sect was called the Wudang Tradition. Mt. Wudang, also called Mt. Taihe, was a sacred site of Daoism, and even before the Ming dynasty was honoured as the birthplace of the Great Perfect Warrior Emperor of the Mysterious Northern Heaven. Historically, Daoism on Mt. Wudang was affiliated to the Orthordox Oneness sect in earlier times, and to the Complete Perfection sect in later times. During emperor Zhengzong's era ([b]AD 998-1022</span></strong>), the Orthodox Oneness sect spread to Mt. Wudang and developed into the main power of Daoism on Mt. Wudang, under which the Elder Mao sect, the Three Mao sect and the Lay Daoist Priest Tradition emerged. The Complete Perfection spread to this area 200 years later. During the Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty (AD 1368-1398 AD), Qiu Yuanqing, the fourth generation patriarch of the Dragon Gate branch, became master of Jade Dragon Temple on Mt. Wudang. In the middle of the Ming dynasty, the Dragon Gate had replaced the Orthodox Oneness sect, becoming the main power of Daoism on Mt. Wudang. During the Yongle ear of Ming emperor Chengzu (AD 1403-1424), Zhang Sanfeng, a Daoist of the Complete Perfection sect, founded the Wudang Tradition, a new Daoist sect which differed from the Complete Perfection sect in religious theories and rules as well as sectarian style. The Wudang Tradition attributed its origin to Cheng Tuan's Daoist sect, but then the government put it under the Complete Perfection sect. The Wudang Tradition was characterized by its worship for the Great Perfect Warrior Emperor, its practice of Chinese Inner School Boxing, its advocacy of the Integration of the Three Doctrines and its emphasis on Cultivation and Refinement of Inner Alchemy and Spiritual Nature. It was a new sect of the Complete Perfection Tradition which emerged between the Yuan and Ming dynasties. According to the General Summary of Perfect Men and Sects, the Wudang Tradition had as many as eight branches, among which the Spontaneity sect, the Sanfeng sect, the Renewal sect and the Penglai sect lasted until modern times. <br><a href="http://eternalway.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://eternalway.blogspot.com/</a><br><br>/\<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I was thinking it in the form of the Early founder of Taoism<br><br>Lu Chong Yang<br>Tao Hong jin<br><br>and the 3rd one is Lu dong bin ....</div>

Fu Hsi was dated 2852 BCE Â– 2738 BCE(going hand in hand with Egypt thinking). this show that the 'raw' Tao concept (rather than the religion Taoism) or Dharma is a natural phenomenon rather than one's invention.  actually, like Moses(prince of Egypt ),  Fu Hsi also tapped or seek the supernatural or divine power for insights. their so called 'genius ' is unlike that of Einstein.<br><br>btw i did read about the DNA stuff long time ago....have no command.<br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes.  Â‘IÂ’ Ching ranks the highest in the 4 books and 5 doctrines.  Its status to the Chinese is equivalent to that of Bible in the West and Bhagavat Gita or Vedas of Hinduism. Â‘IÂ’ Ching affects almost every aspect of the Chinese life -- religion, martial arts, calendar, medicine, philosophy and astrology.  Unfortunately nowadays, it is commonly misunderstood as a book of divination.<br><br>The Chinese word Â‘IÂ’ (yi) means Change.  If Heaven and Earth did not change, the power would penetrate nowhere.  Everything is in a state of perpetual flux at different moment as a result of interaction and interdependence.  I see it as a great complement for understanding the further meaning of change.

A group of monks received permission from the Lord to meditate in a distant forest during the period of Buddhist Lent. Each of the monks took shelter under a big tree as a temporary residence and an engaged themselves intensively in the practice of meditation.<br><br>On account of the spiritual power of their meditation, the tree deities could not stay in their trees-abodes above the monks, so they had to come down to the ground. Realizing that the monks would spend the whole rainy season there, the deities were much annoyed. So they tried to scare the monks away during the night by harassing them in various ways.<br><br>After living under such impossible conditions for sometime, the monks could not bear it any longer and rushed back to the Buddha and informed him about their difficulties. So the Buddha advised them to recite the text of loving kindness (Metta Sutta) and to radiate the spirit of love to all beings. On the full-moon day of Wagaung, the Buddha taught the monks the Metta Sutta. From that day till now, the full-moon day of Wagaung has been called as the 'Great or Grand Occasion of Metta.<br><br>Encouraged by this discourse, the monks returned to their respective places. They practised in accordance with the instructions given them to permeate the entire atmosphere with radiant thoughts of love, The tree-deities were much pleased to be affected by the power of love, and so let the monks (meditators) stay without any further disturbances.</blockquote></div>
