              <p>Everyone is responsible for their own karma. No one can suffer for your karma. The great compassionate Kwan Yin could have take away all our bad karma isn't it ? There are venerable who can alleviate some suffering but ultimately we are responsible for our karma. - actually i got this from someone else</p>
              <p>AEN says that we can clear karma by chanting and repentance.</p>
              <p>Updated: the rationalte is if you dedicate merits ur merits can play a positive impact on the person's bad karma.. if if you do good deeds, your good karma can offset bad karma in a way.</p>

              <p>In this releam, I do not think buddha or bodhisavatta can clear away anyone's karma..its the invidividual effort to resolve bad karma...</p>
              <p>Chanting n repentance may or may not clear bad karma..and it greatly depend on what å›  seeds you have plant to haverst what fruits...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not think there is a karma bank that a person can transfer, or maybe you are referring to bodhisavatta way of practise, making vows??..but in toasim there might have such karma bank practise in it...If you know someone who is quite negative and doing some bad things...if you can use your wisdom to enlighten this person to go into the positive side, you gain this good fruits from karma..and if the person whom has enlighten by you continue to spread his enlightenment to others..he too will gain...so watch what we are doing and what we are saying...speech can also score points in bad karma...</p>

                      day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the 
                      realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. 
                      Her throat was as small as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was 
                      impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. 
                      Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme 
                      state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and 
                      with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, 
                      she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal 
                      before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what 
                      was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered 
                      his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. 
                      He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into 
                      pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, 
                      your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of 
                      cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha 
                      and insulted the Sangha [1], had no respect 
                      for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled 
                      with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed 
                      many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she 
                      is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and 
                      your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save 
                      a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, 
                      Maudgalyayana wept in pain. </strong></span></p>

                      Buddha continued to console him, "It is impossible to rely solely 
                      on your own effort to save your mother from the realm of the hungry ghost. 
                      The only way is to use the combined merits of the Sangha. The 15th day 
                      of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". 
                      This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because of the 
                      purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised cultivation, 
                      many attain the Bodhi [2]. The merits that 
                      they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha is most 
                      delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this time, you 
                      can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the suffering of 
                      the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) through 
                      their immense merits. If the parents are still living, then they shall 
                      be blessed with good health, happiness and a life of abundance. This is 
                      the truly marvellous method of giving salvation to the deceased." 
                      Maudgalyayana was delighted to hear this, and carried out the Buddha's 
                      advice accordingly. Thus, on the 15th of the 7th month after the offering 
                      to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the suffering 
                      of the realm of the hungry ghost.</span></strong></p>

                      give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 'Ullambana' method. 
                      After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very 
                      grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. 
                      He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th 
                      of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express our gratitude 
                      and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, the passage 
                      of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, so much 
                      so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to the Dharma. 
                      Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter 
                      of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The original act 
                      of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for feasting and 
                      making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to invite 
                      the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the 
                      compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had 
                      advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;">When 
                      we refrain from killing and protect all lives, we actually accumulate 
                      the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to kill other 
                      living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit 
                      from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their 
                      action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to all forms 
                      of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the tradition of 
                      offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be changed, 
                      the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of meat with 
                      vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are not able 
                      to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we could invite 
                      them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the deceased. In 
                      this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.</span></strong></p>
