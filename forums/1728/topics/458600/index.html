I’d like to address both questions in one article, because they tend to roll into one another in conversations.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.1pt;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>What is a Secular Buddhist?</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '></span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>To define a secular Buddhist is not easy, and anything we come up with that may fit one person is not going to apply to many others. One thing we can say with accuracy is that secular Buddhists are a diverse bunch. People are coming to secular Buddhism from many walks of life from Christianity and Judaism, from Atheism and Humanism, to many of the various established Buddhist traditions.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Secular Buddhism is new on the block compared to our sister traditions, and secular Buddhists’ approaches to practice is almost as varied as the people themselves. Yet, I would like to take Gotama’s approach to <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>self</span></em> and say what secular Buddhists are <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>not</span></em>:</span></p>

Not all secular Buddhists know about Stephen Batchelor, and while many do, not all are in 100% agreement with him on every aspect of Buddhism. And while many of us like him immensely, he is not our god, he is not our Buddha, and we do not aspire to be Stephen’s twin.</span></span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.1pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;    "><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">We do not all approach practice the same way, nor do we all view the suttas in the same light, and many of us don’t even agree on Gotama himself (more on this in beliefs below).</span></span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.1pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;    "><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Secular Buddhists do not feel the need to erase the colorful rich, history of Buddhism, nor do we want to destroy traditions, their practices, their rituals, or their beliefs. Most secular Buddhists do not consider traditional Buddhism as “wrong” and secular Buddhism as “right”.</span></span></li>
              </ul>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>It’s impossible to say a secular Buddhist is <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>this</span></em>. In doing so, we’d create a stereotype that simply wouldn’t fit many secular Buddhists and frankly secular Buddhists and Buddhism does not exist in and of itself any more than anything else. However, we do have some commonalities but again these are not going to apply to all secular Buddhists:</span></p>

However, there is much variation on how they define these teachings and put them into practice. In fact, we have a lot of healthy discussion and disagreement on these topics with each other.</span></span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.1pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;    "><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Many secular Buddhist approach the sutta translations enthusiastically, skillfully, and skeptically.

Many Buddhists, if they have worked with meditation and mindfulness much, get to the point where they are good at discovering their own beliefs, dissecting them, and letting go of them where appropriate. Belief, after all, is simply an idea that one clings to, in some cases with compelling evidence and in other cases with no evidence at all. We all have beliefs. It’s how human beings form world views, but this Buddhist practice is wonderful in helping us examine them.</span></p>

The one thing we do share is an interest in Buddhism, the practice, and we want to suffer less or not at all. We agree we are practicing or learning about Buddhism on some level, even if it’s just an interest in mindfulness.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.1pt;"><em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Secular</span></em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '> is a controversial word that is gaining a variety of definitions. Secular is sometimes defined as <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>not</span></em> religious or <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>not</span></em> supernatural; concerning this world and this single lifetime; or allowing for <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>all</span></em> traditions and religions and not adhering to any single one in particular.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Additionally there are other Buddhist group names: Natural Buddhism, Pragmatic Buddhism, and Non-Buddhism. Frankly, all these names are just labels. They help on a conventional level, but they are not worth arguing about, certainly not worth clinging to. If you feel more comfortable calling yourself a Pragmatic Buddhist, go for it. If Secular Buddhist appeals to you, then have at it. If you call yourself a Zen practitioner and are enjoying the content on this site, awesome!</span></p>

As soon as you say, secular Buddhists believe such and such, you’ll come across a person who doesn’t believe that. If you define secular Buddhists in one particular way, you’ll come across someone else who defines it another way. Better to refer to yourself regarding these labels by saying something like: For me and my practice secular Buddhism is . . . Or saying: I call myself a secular Buddhist because. . . . Define yourself if you wish, but be careful about defining others. And be mindful of what that definition means to you and how tightly you wear the label.</span></p>

What we all have in common is we are human beings who suffer, who want to be free of suffering. Let’s just start from that foundation, have compassion for one another, enjoy healthy disagreements, the sharing of information, and enjoy the benefits of this practice.</span></p>

              actually is the next world, when he is resolved that 'There is no next 
              world,' that is his wrong resolve. Because there actually is the next

              next world, when he persuades another that 'There is no next world,' 
              that is persuasion in what is not true Dhamma. And in that persuasion in
               what is not true Dhamma, he exalts himself and disparages others. 
              Whatever good habituation he previously had is abandoned, while bad 
              habituation is manifested. And this wrong view, wrong resolve, wrong 
              speech, opposition to the arahants, persuasion in what is not true 
              Dhamma, exaltation of self, &amp; disparagement of others: These many

              <p>*I think* I do not have any experience of past life rebirth, but there's enough stories going around that are just plain hard to dismiss as fantasies. Same with karma that affects many lives.</p>
              <p>If anyone asks me if I know for sure if the above two points exist, I can only go by my lack of experience and say "I don't know, but buddha said there is, and I believe that guy".</p>
              <p>I do wonder at times though, what relevance some of these "issues" have to actual practice. It's a great belief to have to remind you that you've been suffering for eons and will continue to do so unless you practice, but if you're the kind who doesn't need to be constantly reminded of this to actually practice, then if you get the fruits of practice then the issue sorts itself out. And if you don't get any fruit, then it doesn't matter what you believe isn't it.</p>
              <p>Same with the whole "multiple-yanas and mine is the best" problem (heck, don't you think it's a great coincidence that theravada vs mahayana vs vajrayana feels like judaism vs christianity vs islam?). Why pick a side and argue instead of actually trying them out, or just recognising that there are people who benefited greatly from the "other" teachings.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it's simply because people are inherently lazy and want to rest/cling to a definite truth and are willing to argue until the sky falls down instead of actually trying to see whether the other viewpoints are valid.</p>
              <p>Personally though, I believe that a very high, if not complete, freedom from suffering can be gotten from practicing what the buddha taught within this very lifetime. The buddha said something more that is useful to take this as far as possible? Great, let's try that out. And if I'm lazy? Then eh, I'm lazy. My loss. :P</p>

              the <em>Dhammapada verses</em> 190-192 did state the importance of
              taking refuge in the Triple Gems as follows:</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><em><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He who has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the
              Teaching and his Order, penetrates with transcendental wisdom the
              Four Noble Truths — suffering, the cause of suffering, the
              cessation of suffering, and the Noble Eightfold Path leading to the
              cessation of suffering.</span></em></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><em><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This indeed is the safe refuge, this is the
              refuge supreme. Having gone to such a refuge, one is released from
              all suffering.</span></em></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13pt;">Bikkhu Bodhi stated that there

              dharma</span></a><span style="color: #333333;">. One is the
              teaching of the Buddha, as can be found in the Suttas and other
              discourses. The other is the path, the cessation of suffering,
              Nibanna itself.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13pt;">For a secular Buddhist,
              meditation,</span> <span style="font-size: 13pt;">the Four Noble
              Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path leading to the cessation of
              suffering are the mainstay of their beliefs and practices. Whether
              they are considered by others as Buddhist would be quite
              immaterial. It would be for the individual to decide for themselves
              if such label is of any importance at all. After all, Buddhism is
              not a religion of commandments.</span></span></p>

              <p>I see... well i can't fully agree with it... if secular buddhists want to benefit from Buddha's Teachings, taking refuge should be necessary... It marks the faith and inspired one to learn and apply in their daily life seriously. I may look rigid in this case but there are some fundamental basics we should practise it and carry on.</p>

              <p><em>No one can prove that the Tipitaka contains any of the words actually 
              uttered by the historical Buddha. Practicing Buddhists have never found 
              this problematic. Unlike the scriptures of many of the world's great 
              religions, the Tipitaka is not regarded as gospel, as an unassailable 
              statement of divine truth, revealed by a prophet, to be accepted purely 
              on faith. Instead, its teachings are meant to be assessed firsthand, to 
              be put into practice in one's life so that one can find out for oneself 
              if they do, in fact, yield the promised results. It is the truth towards
               which the words in the Tipitaka point that ultimately matters, not the 
              words themselves. Although scholars will continue to debate the 
              authorship of passages from the Tipitaka for years to come (and thus 
              miss the point of these teachings entirely), the Tipitaka will quietly 
              continue to serve — as it has for centuries — as an indispensable guide 
              for millions of followers in their quest for Awakening.</em></p>
