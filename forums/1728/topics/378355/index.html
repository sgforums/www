              <p>People
                  do contemplative practice for different reasons. Some people want to be
                  free from suffering. Some people want to have interesting experiences.
                  Some people want to find out what is true. For me, the best reason to
                  practice is to find the happiness that is not dependent upon
                  conditions. When happiness becomes your baseline, it frees up a lot of
                  energy to be free, have interesting experiences, and find out what is
                  true. In actual practice, all of these things are likely to happen to
                  anyone who commits to contemplative practice, so you get to have your
                  cake and eat it too.<br><br>Below is a prescription for the happiness
                  that is independent of conditions. I call it the 3-Speed Transmission.
                  It's like driving a car; when you are cruising along and everything is
                  fine, third gear is the place to be. But sometimes the going gets rough
                  and you know that if you stay in high gear you'll stall out. That's
                  when it's useful to be able to downshift.<br><br>In pedagogy (the
                  science of teaching and learning) there is a concept called
                  "scaffolding." It means offering students a way to build their
                  understanding step by step, so that each new understanding fits into
                  what they've already learned. It's like building a scaffold around a
                  house; you can climb up the scaffold to reach the high places you
                  haven't finished building yet. If learning is carefully scaffolded,
                  there will always be something to hang each new bit of learning on as
                  it comes in. This association of each new bit of understanding with
                  what has gone before helps you to retain knowledge better because
                  anything you learn within a larger context is hard to forget or
                  confuse. Later, as we shall see, the understanding we are most
                  interested in is not related to knowledge in the usual sense. And it
                  doesn't need anywhere to hang. All of the scaffolding is only a
                  temporary device to help you find the confidence to abandon the
                  building project entirely and find that you already are the happiness
                  you seek.<br><br>The most gifted among you may find that you can just
                  stay in third gear nearly all the time. For you, the happiness that
                  does not depend on conditions may become second nature as soon as it is
                  pointed out to you. For many of us, though, the conditioning to live in
                  our thoughts is very strong. In that case, it's helpful to have 2nd and
                  1st gear so that when things get tough or confusing we can still do a
                  practice that is accessible and that doesn't leave us feeling
                  overwhelmed.<br><br>So, without further ado, here is the 3-Speed
                  Transmission: (First I'll present the thumbnail version, then elaborate
                  on each theme.)<br> <br> <strong>3rd gear:</strong> If you can just <strong>let it be</strong>,
                  understanding in your heart and in your bones that the happiness and
                  peace you seek are your own true nature, then let it be. This is known
                  as recognizing buddha nature or dwelling in buddha mind.<br> <br> If you are distracted and unable to rest in buddha mind, downshift to:<br> <br> <strong>2nd gear:</strong> Ask "Who am I?" until awareness turns back on itself. Cultivate<strong> the "witness,"</strong> becoming absorbed in the perspective of awareness taking itself as object.<br> <br> If, for whatever reason, dwelling as the witness isn't feasible, downshift to:<br> <br> <strong>1st gear:</strong> <strong>Balance investigation (vipassana) and </strong><strong>concentration</strong><strong> (samatha).</strong> Use mental noting until the noticing is automatic, then just
                  concentrate and notice. The genius of vipassana is that there is never
                  a time when it can't be done. So it's the ultimate safety net and 1st
                  gear practice. It also has the feature of being effective all the way
                  to arahatship (the Fourth of the Four Paths of Enlightenment as
                  described in Theravada Buddhism). So, it's by no means a low-grade or
                  substandard practice. Quite the opposite, it's a very sophisticated
                  technology of enlightenment. Used correctly, together with the other
                  practices listed in this recipe, it's a rocket ship to the moon.<br><br>For

                  you embark upon a program of study, it's a good idea to have goals; if
                  you decide to practice the 3-Speed Transmission, it will be helpful for
                  you to know where you hope to end up. Do you want to be free from
                  suffering? Do you want to be a meditation master? Do you want to know
                  what all the fuss is about? Do you want to experience altered states of
                  consciousness? Do you just want to be happy?<br><br>May I be so bold as
                  to tell you my view on this? Nothing you can get or become will
                  satisfy. I set out twenty-seven years ago to get enlightened and to
                  become a meditation master. I feel that I have achieved both of those
                  goals; the Four Paths of Enlightenment of the Theravada Buddhists all
                  make sense to me now. I can access all sorts of wonderful jhanic states
                  whenever I want to. I can manifest an astral body and fly through the
                  air and dive into the earth. It's all very nice, and if you dedicate
                  yourself to this practice, you'll be able to do it too. But the
                  happiness that is independent of conditions has nothing to do with any
                  of that, and the happiness that is independent of conditions is what I
                  would most like to share with you. So, here are some goals for each of
                  the 3 Speeds, understanding that in the end you can do no better than
                  to surrender to what is already the case in this moment.<br><br>I will
                  suggest some goals that I believe make sense at each level of the
                  3-Speed Transmission and you can accept or reject them and come up with
                  goals that make sense to you.<br><br><strong>1st Gear Goals: Balancing Concentration (samatha) and Investigation (vipasssana).</strong><br><br>There
                  are two distinct but intimately interrelated aspects to this practice.
                  One is to master a number of altered states and the other is to
                  progress along a continuum of physio-energetic development until you
                  reach the point where you feel you are no longer a slave to this
                  developmental process. With that in mind, the goals I suggest for 1st
                  Gear are:<br><br>1. Become familiar with the samatha jhanas, including
                  the four rupa (material) jhanas, the four arupa (immaterial) jhanas,
                  the Pure Abodes (suddhavasa), and Nirodha Samapatti.<br><br>2. Move
                  progressively through the Four Paths of Enlightenment until you reach
                  Arahatship (Fourth Path), at which time you will not longer feel that
                  there is anything more to be done in this regard. You won't stop
                  developing after that, but you will feel that you are off "the ride"
                  that began with your first spiritual opening.<br><br><strong>2nd Gear Goals: Dwelling as the Witness</strong><br><br>The
                  "Witness" is both a transitional practice designed to help you attain
                  3rd gear and a way to maintain a connection with what is truer than
                  your thoughts as you go about your daily life activities. As such, the
                  goal here is simply to identify the "I" sense in your own experience,
                  learn to become absorbed in this apparent witness and continue to
                  practice in that way. Eventually, even the Witness dissolves, leaving
                  only pure non-local awareness, which pervades and is not other than the
                  entire manifest universe. Even after gaining unfettered access to 3rd
                  Gear, however, you may find the witness to be an extremely empowering
                  tool for remaining sane during all the waking hours of your day. This
                  is because 3rd Gear, the non-dual experience of primordial awareness,
                  is best done when you don't have any other cognitively demanding tasks
                  to attend to. For those of us who live as householders, balancing
                  awakening and family life, the Witness can serve as a bridge between
                  ordinary dualistic consciousness and the unborn.<br><br><strong>3rd Gear Goals: Be as you are.</strong><br><br>The
                  goal at this level is the happiness that is not dependent upon
                  conditions. This means that no matter what is going in your life, be it
                  good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant, there is deep, abiding happiness.
                  This comes from realizing, in this moment, things as they really are.<br><br>May you come to know the happiness that is independent of conditions.<br><br>Kenneth Folk<br>July 2009<br></div>

                  first spiritual opening came in 1982, when I was 23 years old. It was a
                  glimpse of what I now call "the Witness" otherwise known as 2nd Gear in
                  the 3-Speed Transmission. This first, powerful awakening to the fact
                  that there was a deeper reality than my habitual way of seeing the
                  world completely changed my life; having had a taste of this deeper
                  reality, all I wanted to do was "get it back." I began reading
                  everything I could find about meditation, enlightenment, and
                  spirituality, hoping to find a way back "home." All of the authors I
                  was reading said that one should meditate, so I did. But the models of
                  enlightenment I learned about in the books did not satisfy me. It
                  seemed that there was some nebulous, airy-fairy kind of wisdom that Zen
                  masters had, but that couldn't be explained. If you did Zen meditation,
                  maybe it would happen to you too, but there was no guarantee, and in
                  fact the odds were against it.<br><br>So, when I met a Theravada
                  Buddhist teacher named Bill Hamilton in 1990 and learned about another
                  way of modeling enlightenment, I was immediately hooked. According to
                  Theravada Buddhism, enlightenment is a clearly mappable, linear process
                  that is reproducible from one practitioner to the next. "Insights"
                  arise in an invariable order, and it is possible to place yourself on a
                  map of attainment and see where you have been and where you are going.
                  This was just what my rational mind wanted to hear! Having grown up in
                  a culture that sees everything as having a beginning, a middle, and an
                  end, I could easily wrap my mind around this map of progressive
                  development and get to work. My new teacher was honest with me about
                  where he believed himself to be on the map and spoke of the meditation
                  techniques and the fruits of the practice in such clear terms that I
                  had no doubt I would be able to succeed within this system.<br><br>Theravada
                  Buddhism describes four Paths of Enlightenment, each of which builds
                  upon one before it. When I met Bill Hamilton in 1990, he let it be
                  known through broad hints that he considered himself to have attained
                  2nd Path and was working toward 3rd. The more I practiced the vipassana
                  (insight meditation), the more my faith in this system was verified.
                  The insights into suffering, impermanence, and no-self came fast and
                  furious, just as my teacher and the old texts said they would. The main
                  point I want to make here about vipassana meditation is that it
                  performs as advertised and a diligent yogi truly can progress through a
                  series of stages that were already clearly described and mapped over
                  2,000 years ago. This is an exciting and dynamic process that brings
                  benefits much too numerous to describe here.<br><br>Each of the four
                  Paths of Enlightenment unfolds through a series of sub-stages, called
                  the Progress of Insight. Once you have completed all 16 stages of the
                  first Progress of Insight, you have, by definition, attained to the
                  First Path of Enlightenment, at which time your understanding of your
                  relationship to yourself and your experience is permanently altered in
                  subtle but profound ways. This new understanding further deepens during
                  the 2nd Progress of Insight, which looks and feels similar to the 1st
                  and culminates in 2nd Path. After this, the Progress of Insight speeds
                  up and cycles repeatedly. Eventually, 3rd and 4th Path are attained,
                  resulting in what the Theravada Buddhists consider "full
                  enlightenment." The kind of thumbnail sketch I've provided here makes
                  this all sound fairly straightforward and perhaps even easy, but most
                  people will not find it so. To reach the highest levels of
                  enlightenment within this system requires a tremendous amount of
                  concentration, which in turn requires great dedication and for most
                  people many years of dedicated effort and considerable sacrifice.
                  Nonetheless, it is possible and well worth doing; balancing
                  concentration and insight brings about what I call "physio-energetic"
                  development, a kind of human development that seems to be optional. In
                  other words, the majority of people on Earth will not develop their
                  potential in this arena and many will not even believe that such a
                  possibility exists.<br><br>For more on the Progress of Insight and

              Gear in the 3-Speed Transmission is "dwelling as the Witness." The
              first thing to know about the "Witness" is that it isn't what it
              appears to be. In other words, although there is, in every moment of
              conventional experience, a sense that there is an "I" who knows the
              experience, this "I" is actually a fiction, a fabrication of mind. One
              way to see through this apparent watcher is to become absorbed into it,
              understanding that it will eventually collapse of its own accord.
              Ramana Maharshi referred to the Witness as "the stick that stirs the
              fire and is eventually consumed by it." When the Witness dissolves, you
              will find that you have naturally arrived at 3rd Gear, the direct
              apprehension of buddha nature in your own being.<br><br>With this in
              mind, dwelling as the Witness is seen as a transitional step. It could
              be said to lie halfway between 1st Gear and 3rd Gear, halfway between
              the object-oriented practices of concentration/insight and the complete
              surrender to what is, also known as non-duality. Since it takes a great
              deal of concentration to become absorbed into the sense of "I," this
              practice kills two birds with one stone; it serves as a transition to
              recognizing buddha nature while at the same time strengthening your
              ability to concentrate. As concentration is essential to progress
              through the Insight Knowledges (ñanas) and Realms of Absorption
              (jhanas), this technique of dwelling as the Witness is a very
              streamlined way to both Realization of what is always already the case
              (3rd Gear) <em>and </em>developmental enlightenment (1st Gear).<br><br>How to dwell as the Witness:<br><br>As
              you go about your daily life and as you sit on the meditation cushion,
              ask yourself the question, "Who am I?" Don't try to answer it with
              trivialities like "I am Joe," etc. The question is just a pointer to
              get you to notice who it is that seems to be having this experience. As
              you ask this question, "Who am I?" you might get a flash of something
              like "I" as an answer.<br><br>"Who am I?"<br><br>"I, that's who! I am I!"<br><br>OK,
              that's what we're looking for. You don't have to go beyond that. That
              sense of "I" is the very Witness we are seeking. You don't need to
              debunk the Witness. This is a self-debunking practice; all you have to
              do is become absorbed into this sensation of "I, I" and enjoy it. You
              will find that it is very enjoyable indeed, as this apparent "I" has no
              stake in anything that goes on; it is just an impassive witness.
              Continue to become ever-more-deeply absorbed into this sense of "I",
              understanding that someday it will dissolve of its own accord, leaving
              only pure, non-local awareness. At that point, you will have arrived at
              3rd Gear.<br><br>One of the things I most want to communicate to people
              is that when we talk about the witness we aren't being poetic or
              metaphorical; the "witness" is a clear, discreet, recognizable, and
              reproducible state that can be mastered with practice. Once mastered,
              it becomes one of the most empowering tools in a yogi's toolbox. Not
              only does it pave the way to direct realization of the non-dual, it is
              valuable in its own right as a way to maintain a connection with
              awareness while going about daily life activities.<br> <br>I think of
              an hourglass, turned on its side. On one side of the hourglass is the
              non-dual. If all of the sand has gone to that side, there is only the
              perfection of primordial awareness, which pervades, includes, and gives
              rise to all things. This is the most precious jewel of all the Buddhas,
              but does not lend itself to productivity or even functionality in
              modern daily life; we can only practice the non-dual when we don't have
              any other cognitively demanding tasks to attend to. On the other end of
              the hourglass is duality; when all the sand has moved to that side of
              the glass, the apparent self has completely lost touch with the greater
              reality and sees itself as cut off and separate from the whole.
              Although it is possible to be extremely productive in terms of daily
              life activities while isolated in this way (indeed, most people will
              spend their entire lives in the thrall of duality), the price to be
              paid for such a productive life is a horrendous amount of suffering. In
              the middle, in the narrow part of the hourglass, is the Witness.
              Experience is somewhat limited here, consistent with the narrowness of
              the glass; everything is seen as self. There is only pure subjectivity.
              All of the usual objects of consciousness are present, but they are not
              seen as Other. As such, the Witness is upstream from suffering. In
              other words, suffering, which is part and parcel of our ordinary
              dualistic condition, has not yet arisen during the witness state. And
              yet, unlike the full experience of non-duality, it's possible to do
              most daily tasks while dwelling as the Witness. Tasks that require
              dualistic thinking (writing this message, for example) can be
              effectively accomplished from the witness state, and with practice it
              gets easier and easier. The flexibility of the witness state, lying as
              it does halfway in between the dual and the non-dual, makes it possible
              to remain functional in daily life while staying poised at the very
              gates of primordial awareness, ready to tip over at a moments notice
              into what the Dzogchen masters call The Great Perfection. Because of
              its ability to serve as a bridge between the unborn and the manifest
              along with the practical value that goes along with that bridge status,
              I can scarcely imagine a more useful or empowering tool for those of us
              who have chosen to pursue awakening while living as householders.<br><br>Kenneth Folk<br>July 2009<br></div>

              <p>3rd
                  Gear in the 3-Speed Transmission is the moment of recognizing buddha
                  nature in your own being. From this point of view, there is nowhere to
                  go and nothing to get. The happiness you seek is your own true nature
                  and it is only your attempt to become or to create or to investigate
                  that distracts you from seeing this.<br><br>You can stop now. Stop
                  trying to figure it out. Stop trying to get enlightened. Stop
                  concentrating. Stop investigating. Stop meditating. Stop trying to stop.<br><br>Be as you are.<br><br>Your
                  true nature is not "you." Neither is it other than you. It is not the
                  "Witness." It's not your True Self, or a Big Self that subsumes your
                  small self. Your true nature is the true nature of everything. Your
                  sense of self arises and simultaneously vanishes within this simplest
                  of realities, as does the entire manifest world. The simplest "thing,"
                  that which cannot be further reduced is pure, empty awareness without
                  time or location. It has no shape or size. It does not change or
                  diminish. Its only characteristic is awareness. It is empty of self,
                  inherently existing and intrinsically aware. Let's call it Primordial
                  Awareness.<br><br>There is nothing outside of this. Primordial
                  Awareness pervades and gives rise to and is not other than the entire
                  manifest Universe. You don't have to do anything to be it; nothing you
                  could do would make you other than it. You can't mess it up or tarnish
                  or stain it. You've never been apart from it. In order to recognize it,
                  you have only to stop adding "yourself" to it. To even refer to this
                  most fundamental of realities as "it" or to call it anything at all,
                  including "Primordial Awareness" is to risk reducing it to a concept
                  and thereby missing it. Nonetheless, having once discovered it and
                  learned to trust it, we feel compelled to share, so we do our best to
                  point using the words we have.<br><br>Nothing you can <em>do </em>will
                  lead to this. Nothing you can do or not do will lead you away from
                  this. No amount of meditative attainment or achievement will get you
                  any closer or any farther away. The very act of doing or intending
                  anything is something you are adding to this moment; when you are
                  actively doing something, even something so seemingly innocuous as
                  investigating your experience, you are "compounding" or adding
                  something extra to your experience The Awareness we are pointing to is
                  said to be uncompounded and unconditioned. It's what is revealed when
                  you stop adding to this moment. Recognizing buddha nature in this
                  moment is enlightenment. Failing to recognize buddha nature in this
                  moment is ignorance. To recognize buddha nature in this moment and to
                  train in this recognition and gain stability in it is the happiness
                  that does not depend upon conditions. May you recognize buddha nature
                  now.<br><br>May you be happy.<br><br>Kenneth Folk<br>July 2009</p>
