              Myanmar’s Monastic Schools</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Shuyin Buddhistdoor Global
              | 2017-05-19 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              is no gate or decorated signboard at Phaung Daw Oo Integrated Monastic
              Education School (PDO) in Mandalay, and its entrance obscured by advertising
              billboards, tuk-tuks, and motorcycles. A pedlar stands guard at the corner,
              enticing passing students to try their luck at a game of spin-the-wheel, while
              vendors line the alley leading up to the school, selling Burmese noodles,
              snacks, and other daily items and oddities. For the moment, the area is
              relatively clear, but when the bell rings to mark the end of the school day,
              everything becomes a blur as a sea of bicycles and students in white and green
              sweeps across the compound. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              is Myanmar’s largest monastic school, with close to 10,000 students and 500
              teachers and staff. It is one of the few monastic schools accredited to offer
              education from kindergarten to high school, and is perhaps also the most
              progressive in the country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">PDO
              was founded in 1993 by its principal, Sayadaw U Nayaka, and his brother Sayadaw
              U Jotika, who were both inspired by Christian missionary schools and their idea
              of free education, a legacy of Myanmar’s colonial past. From its humble
              beginnings, PDO has had only one mission: to provide free tuition to students
              from impoverished backgrounds, orphans, neglected and abandoned children, and
              those otherwise unable to attend government schools.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Children
              are admitted regardless of religion, race, or gender. Free room and board is
              provided for about 1,000 students and staff. Many of the resident students come
              from remote areas where there is no school, or where civil war or natural
              disasters have made access to education difficult. In addition to the majority
              Bamar people, there are several ethnic minorities attending the school,
              including the Akhar, Kayin, Larhu, Pa-oh, Palaung Kachin, Shan, and Wa. There
              are also 400 orphans housed in one dormitory, and a full-time health clinic
              providing free medical treatment for the students and staff alike, treating an
              average of 150 students a day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">PDO
              is also home to some 700 young Buddhist novice monks and nuns. While only a few
              of these will enter religious life full-time, for now their day begins with the
              ritual collection of alms from the neighborhood. After breakfast, they attend
              classes together with the other students. Pali language and Buddhist studies
              lessons are conducted after regular school hours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              distinguishes PDO from traditional monastic schools in Myanmar is its rejection
              of the traditional emphasis on rote learning and memorization that has retarded
              Myanmar’s education system for decades. Instead, PDO stresses a holistic and
              child-centred approach (CCA) to education.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> “I first heard about CCA when I started this
              school,” U Nayaka explains. “I found that this teaching method involves
              continuous assessment, active learning, and critical thinking. This is what is
              needed if we are to develop the strong leaders that will lead Myanmar into a
              new era.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">With
              the help of donors, U Nayaka sought foreign teachers to conduct training at
              PDO, and many of the school’s young teachers have themselves gone through the
              CCA system as pupils. As such, they are better able to grasp its pedagogy
              during the intensive training and have little difficulty applying the
              methodology in the classroom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">CCA
              is used in kindergarten and primary classes, while the middle and high school
              levels use the Reading, Writing, and Critical Thinking (RWCT) method. Classes
              are taught mainly in Burmese, although many students speak other languages at
              home. There are special programs, such as Fast Track, Bridging, Pre-College,
              and New Teacher Training, which are taught in English, and students are also
              encouraged to attend classes in life skills, leadership training, health,
              hygiene, gender, and citizenship. Sunday Dhamma school, which teaches basic Buddhism
              and ethics, is optional and open to all children in the neighborhood.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Although
              CCA is highly valued, its emphasis on creative and critical thinking is
              ill-matched for Myanmar’s existing examination system, which is still based on
              textbook memorization and regurgitation. As a result, students trained through
              CCA do not always stack up against students from government schools in
              examinations. Only 30 per cent of PDO’s students passed the matriculation exams
              in the 2014–15 academic year, and only 185 obtained distinctions. Those who do
              pass the final examinations face an uphill battle to gain entry into
              university, with places usually awarded according to examination marks. Once
              admitted, many cannot find places in preferred subjects such as medicine, engineering,
              or information technology, which require very high total examination scores.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              of U Nayaka’s main concerns is what will happen to the children after they
              leave PDO. “Most of them come here because they can’t afford tuition fees. Some
              of them can’t go to those universities because of their marks, but they are
              smart enough to become professionals,” he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              provide opportunities for these students to further their education, PDO is
              experimenting with pre-college classes aimed at preparing students and teachers
              who will go overseas to study. On a more practical level, students can opt for
              vocational training, which includes carpentry, tailoring, computer studies,
              horticulture, and catering. Many of these classes also help to lower the
              school’s expenditure and even generate income. For example, school uniforms are
              made in the sewing classes, while the carpentry class builds furniture and
              undertakes much of the construction work at the school that would otherwise
              have to be outsourced. Produce from the horticulture program, meanwhile, is
              used to feed the multitude of students through the school’s dining program.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">With
              Myanmar’s rapid economic development, the need for educational reform has come
              into sharp focus. In Yangon, the number of international schools, seen by the
              elite as a pathway to prestigious foreign universities, rose from 25 in 2012 to
              43 by November 2016. Despite soaring tuition fees, enrollment increased by more
              than 75 per cent in the same period, from 6,700 to 11,800, with locals making
              up 80 per cent of the intake.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              the privileges of this elite education are reserved for only a tiny fraction of
              Myanmar’s 54 million people. The tuition fees of US$5,000–10,000 per semester
              forked out by the rich are well beyond the reach of the 70 percent of the
              population who live in rural areas and the 25.6 per cent subsisting below the
              national poverty line.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Education
              can be a great equalizer in lifting poor and disadvantaged communities out of
              poverty. For most, their options lie in the government or monastic systems. The
              latter, in particular, plays an important role in providing education for many
              unable to access government schools.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yet
              it is not only access, but the quality of education that matters. To achieve a
              more egalitarian society, no single factor is more important than investing in
              quality education. Sadly, too many government and monastic schools remain stuck
              in a bygone era, providing a low quality of education and working with
              inadequate resources. Very few abbots and teachers have experience in school
              management, and hold only a basic understanding of education principles and the
              developmental needs of children.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              are an estimated 1,579 monastic schools with 7,500 teachers nationwide to meet
              the needs of some 275,000 students. To improve monastic education throughout
              Myanmar, the Monastic Education Development Group (MEDG), led by U Nayaka under
              the umbrella of the PDO, was established in 2012. With his influence, U Nayaka
              successfully lobbied for recognition of monastic schools at the policy level,
              such as the inclusion of monastic schools in the Ministry of Education’s school
              grant policy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since
              2015, PDO has embarked on various IT initiatives with foreign partnerships to
              develop and position itself as the Centre of Information Technology for
              Monastic Education. The aim is that through the e-learning solution program,
              more children in remote regions will be able to access high-quality education
              through distance learning.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Our
              education system has been spoiled for many years so that our children can’t
              catch up to international levels,” U Nakaya noted. “My belief is that with
              better education, with smart and well-educated people, we can create a better
              community, a better country.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">U
              Nakaya’s broad vision and dedication has placed him in the top 50 finalists for
              the 2016 Global Teacher Prize,**** the only Burmese to make the list and an
              endorsement of PDO’s success. At 73, U Nayaka is still not quite ready to slow
              down. His latest project is building a new campus in the foothills of Taung
              Kyun Forest, and a monastic school convention to be held in May 2018 for more
              than 2,000 delegates from across the country at this new campus is already on
              his calendar. At the moment, with only a single bamboo hut, no electricity, and
              no proper road access to the site, this is, as one volunteer puts it, “an
              ambitious plan by any stretch of the imagination.” Given U Nayaka’s optimism
              and his unwavering resolution, almost nothing seems impossible!   </span></p>
