              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">On Consciousness</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">11/25/2017 Matthieu Ricard Huffpost</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism speaks of six, seven, or eight aspects of
              consciousness. It speaks first of the ground or basic consciousness, which has
              a global, general knowledge that the world is there and that I exist. Then
              there are five aspects related to the five sensory experiences: seeing,
              hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching. The seventh aspect is mental
              consciousness, which associates abstract concepts to the first six aspects.
              Sometimes there is considered to be an eighth aspect of conscious-ness that is
              related to afflictive mental states that distort reality (hatred, craving,
              etc.). But even more fundamental than all these states and aspects is primary
              consciousness, what is called the continuum of the luminous fundamental
              consciousness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In Buddhism, the matter/consciousness duality, the so-called
              mind-body problem, is a false problem given that neither of them has an
              intrinsic, independent existence. According to some Buddhist teachings that
              analyze phenomena at a more contemplative level, the primordial nature of
              phenomena transcends notions of subject and object or time and space. But when
              the world of phenomena emerges from primordial nature, we lose sight of this
              unity and make a false distinction between consciousness and the world. This
              separation between the self and the non-self then becomes fixed, and the world
              of ignorance, samsara, is born. The birth of samsara did not happen at a
              particular moment in time. It simply reflects at each instant, and for each of
              our thoughts, how ignorance reifies the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism’s conception is thus radically different from
              Cartesian dualism, which postulates on one side a truly existing solid material
              reality and, on the other side, a completely immaterial consciousness, which
              cannot have any real connection with matter. The Buddhist analysis of phenomena
              recognizes the lack of intrinsic reality of all phenomena. Whether animate or
              inanimate, they are equally devoid of autonomous, ultimate existence. Thus, a
              merely conventional difference exists between matter and consciousness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Because Buddhism refutes the ultimate reality of phenomena,
              it also refutes the idea that consciousness is independent and exists inherently,
              just as much as it refutes that matter is independent and exists inherently.
              This fundamental level of consciousness and the world of apparent phenomena are
              linked by interdependence, and together they form our world of thought and the
              exterior physical reality is a mere illusion. There’s only one reality or,
              rather, only one lack of intrinsic reality! Buddhism does not adopt a purely
              idealist point of view or argue that the outer world is a fabrication of
              consciousness. It just points to the fact that without consciousness, one
              cannot claim that the world exists because that statement already implies the
              presence of a consciousness.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "Calibri",sans-serif;         '>This might sound puzzling, but it resembles the
              answer given by some cosmologists when asked what was there before the Big Bang.
              They say that this question does not make sense because time and space began
              with the Big Bang. Likewise, anything we can ever say about the world, the
              brain, and even consciousness begins with consciousness. Even the question,
              “But couldn’t a world totally deprived of life and sentience exist on its own?”
              as well as any answer that you might like to give to this question—all of this
              presupposes consciousness. Of course, it would be foolish to deny the existence
              of lifeless worlds because most planets are indeed lifeless, but without
              consciousness, in a way, there is no question, no answer, no concepts, no
              “world” as an object of experience.</span></p>
