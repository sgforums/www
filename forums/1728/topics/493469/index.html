              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Dr Upul Wijayawardhana
              February 3, 2017, The Island.lk  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Wishing
              for more seems to be an ingrained human characteristic but at other times it
              may simply be an expression of dire need, like Charles Dickens’ character
              Oliver Twist asking for more; for a bit more of the thin gruel that kept hunger
              pangs away but slowly starved to death young boys in 19th century workhouses in
              Britain. Oliver was chosen to plead on behalf of all but ended up with a knock
              on the head with the ladle and was put up for sale!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Unfortunately,
              wishing is notorious for continuing incrementally. One who walks wishes to have
              a cycle, the one riding a bicycle wishes for the convenience of a motorcycle
              and the one with the motorcycle wishes for the luxury of a car. When you get a
              car you want more than one; basic one for driving to work, another more flashy
              for leisure and, perhaps, yet another extravagant one to demonstrate your
              wealth, accrued legally or otherwise. This invariably leads to greed which, in
              turn, leads to attachment. Some of us believe in doing good to accrue merit, so
              that what we wish for, will be ours, if not in this birth but in a subsequent
              one at least. This cannot be bad, some may argue, as it gives hope and is
              certainly better than for fear of eternal damnation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Acquiring
              merit is purported by many to be a Buddhist concept. If merit is acquired
              wishing for better prospects, surely, it leads to attachment. The first Noble
              Truth, the Buddha preached, is ‘Dukka’, a lack of satisfaction due to clinging
              to impermanent states and things which makes acquiring merit rather
              paradoxical. In fact, the complete misunderstanding of the concept of ‘Karma’
              has led many in the West to believe that Buddhism is a ‘Religion of Insurance’.
              To clear my doubts, I turned to my favourite booklet ‘Satyodaya’ (Dawn of
              Truth) by Venerable Walpola Rahula, one of the most erudite Buddhist scholars
              of our time whose words of wisdom, giving true interpretation to the teachings
              of the Buddha, have been disregarded for over three-quarters of a century.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              a chapter titled ‘Meritorious deeds and Wishing’ (C5, P37-51) he explains these
              concepts lucidly which makes interesting reading for Buddhists and
              non-Buddhists alike. It is a great shame that an English translation of this
              little gem is not available. Doing anything with the hope of collecting merit
              is unwholesome and even ‘wishing’ to attain Nibbana is not compatible with the
              teachings of the Buddha, he contends. I will make an attempt to summarise his
              arguments, to the best of my limited ability.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
              seek truth, one has to be unattached, discuss openly and analyse facts
              intelligently. To assume that what you read in books or what your teachers
              taught is the whole truth is a misconception which limits your own thinking,
              thus preventing the realisation of the truth. Free thinking is the most
              important thing and the Buddha is the first, perhaps the only, religious leader
              that encouraged freedom of thought.The Buddha went to the extent of insisting
              that His words be accepted only after due consideration and verification.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">People
              do trade in goods &amp; services and offer it to all irrespective of
              nationality, caste, creed or race, as long as there is a profit. This is not
              considered a meritorious deed as it is done for personal gain. Similarly, if
              one helps the poor with the intention of getting fame and praise in this life,
              then that too becomes a business as it is done for gain. Even if your are not
              interested in the present but do so with the hope of acquiring merit, which
              could be used as currency for a good next life, there is no significant
              difference as the good action gets tainted with a selfish motive. Whether you
              expect benefits now or in a future life amounts to postponement of profit.
              There is no difference between depositing money in a bank to get interest and
              doing meritorious deeds with the hope of reaping benefits in a future life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">‘Karma’
              is a much misunderstood concept. It simply means that every action has an
              effect and the Buddha enunciated this long before Isaac Newton came up with his
              third ‘Law of motion’. Doing something wishing and hoping for a benefit is an
              attachment. It is a business venture. Though helping the poor is a good deed,
              if it is done with the intention of reaping benefits, it becomes unwholesome.
              It should not be made a path to heaven. It should be done with the sole
              intention of helping a less fortunate, even at the expense of your losing out;
              that then becomes a noble deed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Even
              observing the five precepts should be like that. You should not kill an animal
              not because you are scared of the karmic backlash but because you have kindness
              and compassion for that animal. Avoiding doing nasty things because you are
              scared of ill effects is better than doing the nasty thing but the best is not
              to do it because you realise it is bad. The real noble action is doing it with
              no expectations. What matters is the proper understanding.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              is a fact that many ordinary people may not understand this in the correct
              perspective. In fact, the Buddha stated that his Dhamma is not for those
              lacking knowledge. Truth cannot be changed so that ordinary people may
              understand. Truth is truth and it cannot be simplified though some attempt to
              do so resulting in false-truths. What should be done is to educate people so that
              they reach a standard where they can understand the truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Though
              the ultimate liberation is Nirvana, craving to achieve that,itself, is an
              attachment. You can achieve Nirvana only by giving up all attachments. Priests
              often mislead by stating that Nirvana could be achieved only by attaining
              Buddhahood or by becoming a Pase-Budu or an Arahant or that you should wait for
              Maitriya Buddha’s time. Though there are numerous stories as to how various
              individuals attained enlightenment, they are simply stories told by story
              tellers and these should not defy the truth. Greatest of all the difficulties
              is putting into words the truths enunciated by the Buddha and quite a lot of
              misunderstandings arise as a result of this.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              was humbled and gratified to note,what Venerable Rahula states keeps in with
              what I have stated in the past; that though ‘Folk Buddhism’ served a purpose in
              the past and preserved Buddhism for us, in a world with an explosion of
              knowledge with easy accessibility, it is only the truths of Buddhism that will
              stand the test of science which, I am sure, it will do, considering the
              increasing world-wide interest in Buddha’s concepts like mindfulness.</span></p>
