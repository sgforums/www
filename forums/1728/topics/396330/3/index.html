              <p>i thought about this a long time ago and i believe it all adds up over the lifetimes...........meaning you won't ''backtrack'' in the next lifetime, you can only go forward and accumulate more buddhist wisdom...............so when enough ''spiritualism'' has built up................PRESTO !</p>

              <p>as for this no-self, we humans think far too much and highly of ourselves becoz of ego.............maybe we're just like the characters in a computer game..............we really are no-thing..............</p>
              <p>in short, maybe a buddha is one that finally figured out exactly that but the people back in those days wouldn't have been able to understand him so he used the words he used to explain..................i'm quite sure there are a lot more that the Buddha didn't teach becoz there's no practical point in doing so............</p>

              <p>as for this no-self, we humans think far too much and highly of
                  ourselves becoz of ego.............maybe we're just like the
                  characters in a computer game..............we really are
                  no-thing..............</p>
              <p>in short, maybe a buddha is one that finally figured out exactly
                  that but the people back in those days wouldn't have been able to
                  understand him so he used the words he used to
                  explain..................i'm quite sure there are a lot more that
                  the Buddha didn't teach becoz there's no practical point in doing
                  so............</p>

              <p>Buddhism is a science. Science is something which the results are reproducible upon investigation. In Buddhism, through meditation we can directly realise the truth about Emptiness, No-Self, etc, upon investigation. We can realise directly, through our experience, not theoretically but seeing for oneself that this is the case. And not only one, but countless practitioners have seen long past till today done the experiment and have consistently realised the ultimate nature of reality as luminous and empty for themselves. They are enlightened.</p>
              <p>The experiential understanding of No-Self and Emptiness is very different from a theoretical understanding.</p>
              <p>I suggest you read carefully what our our moderator Thusness wrote based on his own experience of enlightenment/awakening.</p>

              <p>As for whether Hui-Neng is Buddha, I don't know. I would say it is likely he is a Bodhisattva. There are many stages of enlightenment before Buddhahood. Realising Emptiness does not mean immediately you become Buddha. You have to be perfect in virtues, merits, wisdom, skillful means, etc etc... before you are ready to be Buddha.</p>
              <p>Buddhas are very rare and I am not so sure if there has been any appearance of a Buddha since Shakyamuni Buddha. Shakyamuni Buddha is the only Nirmanakaya manifestation of a Buddha in this age. However there are countless people who become liberated from all sufferings, the cycle of rebirth in samsara and so on.. within that one life. Even within Buddha's lifetime, thousands of his disciples attain awakening and liberation. They are known as Arhats.</p>
              <p>Arhats are liberated but they are not going to continue their path to Buddhahood, they simply cease after death. Bodhisattvas who realised emptiness and attained liberation however continue to work for the welfare of sentient beings, guiding them to enlightenment and cultivating their way to Buddhahood for the sake of all beings. Mahayana Buddhism (including Zen) focuses on Bodhisattva path, while Theravada generally focus on attaining Arhatship.</p>

              <p>In Vajrayana it is said you can attain Buddhahood in this lifetime, though you will not manifest in a Nirmanakaya form complete with all the virtues powers etc - there is only one Nirmanakaya manifestation of Buddhahood at any age.</p>

              <p>Many basic things remain consistent.</p>
              <p>There is suffering in life, a cause of suffering (ignorance, grasping, desires), there is however a way to end suffering, and a path to end suffering. - basic summary of 4 noble truths.</p>
              <p>Ending suffering means realising the nature of reality, the union of luminosity and emptiness, in direct experience. This ends all ignorance and sufferings and uncontrolled cycle of rebirth.</p>
              <p>Arhats, Bodhisattvas (especially after 6th or 8th bhumi), Pratyekabuddha, Buddhas, ended suffering.</p>
              <p>All traditions accept the existence of arhats, bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas (though these <em>solitary buddhas</em> do not exist not in our age but in the gap between two buddhas' appearance where there is no dharma teachings or rather it has been forgotten. solitary buddhas do not have the ability to teach dharma, or rather it is very limited as compared to a complete buddha), and buddhas, and the possibility to attain liberation in our life.</p>
              <p>However there are some controversies about the definition of full Buddhahood (as contrasted to simply arhatship or bodhisattvahood), how fast it can be attained, etc. Especially since Buddhas are known to be omniscient, have special qualities, powers, virtues, skillful means, and so on. No one as far as I know have all these qualities of a Buddha today (but maybe they do have <em>some</em> of these qualities, just not all). But I know of many who are today, liberated and awakened to the nature of reality. I am aware that arhats and bodhisattvas continue to exist till today.</p>
              <p>Some traditions just focus on attaining Arhatship, or personal liberation, without a wish to attain Buddhahood or practice the Bodhisattva way. This is the Theravada tradition.</p>
              <p>Other traditions aim for Buddhahood, though the means are different.</p>
              <p>Basically there are more similarities - especially on the fundamental level, with all traditions. The emphasis however is different - for example one tradition may emphasize liberation for themselves, others may emphasize on maximising their capacity to not only liberate themselves but all others.</p>

Buddha did not differentiated this. he said to each his/her own, whether the person has aspirations to be a buddha, or arhat. I concurred with his views. all these theravada or mahayana, are like terms or labels.  just like what nagasena had said, axles, pole of a chariot are like names, and no chariot can be found. similarly eyes, ears, noses all consituted to person like nagasena, which in actual fact doesnt exists.</p></div>
