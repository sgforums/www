              <p>This is not a matter of anger and forgiveness. This is about facts. Buddhists must put the facts straight and correct wrong perceptions. If you are a Buddhist, I will encourage you to correct wrong perceptions of others instead of keeping quiet, thinking that is forgiveness.</p>

              <p>Don't talk as if that peaceloving is not preached in Christianity, you want point fingers point at yourself and the ill behaved christians in EH first.</p>
              <p>Jesus is an example, the saviour of Christians for them to follow instead they follow the ways of Satan to "kill" non christians.</p>
              <p>I asked decent questions in bother Eternal Hope and Buddhism forums.    ONly the buddhists in buddhism forum bother to be kind to answer it.  The christians in EH not only did they not reply but they bash me.    So if you do not get facts right, you are no different from those evil christians in EH.    IN fact, you are most likely a clone of one of them like SomebodyinSG, and so on.     </p>
              <p>In fact, people who are level headed, mature, objective, kind and sensible can tell that the people in buddhism forum are the ones who are peaceloving, sensible and kind.</p>
              <p>So if you are all the way to destroy this forum, no way.  God is forgiving and loving, waiting for you to go to him to acknowledge your sin of attempting to bring harm here, if you acknowledge your sins and repent God will forgive you.  If not you will be judge jialat jialat on judgment day.</p>

              <p>Hi Oneness</p>
              <p>You were right rather right about the trend. I supposed they were hurt by the strong remarks directed at their faith which is Buddhism. Of course, most mature buddhist will be brushed off those remarks as lack of understanding. Beside, it also imply that they were ready to stand and defend their faith. In the Christian circle, such people were known as apologetic. Among this group of apologetic, there are some who are well versed in the Buddhism Scripture and teaching but some who is out to defend and put down due to the emotion outburst.</p>
              <p>Personally, I would encourage the latter group to follow Eternal Now and Wisdom Eye recommendation. I am reminded of a story. When CiñcÄ�-MÄ�navikÄ� accuse Buddha of impregnanting her due to an illict affair, he was silent. Although most of the disciples reacted knowing that the Buddhism community reputation will be affected. However, Buddha always remind them that the truth will be reveal in due time. True enough, one fine day, Cinca stumbled and fall. People discovered that her pregnancy was a hoax. It was actual a wooden disc which she has been tying around her body.</p>
              <p>Well, the story did reveal 2 things EQ and maturity. Neither Buddha nor the community is wrong. It just the way we handle things. Thats make the difference between Buddha and us. Thankfully, we have the Buddha nature is within us and we can always change to  be more like him.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I would like to conclude by quoting from the bible<em> <strong>Luke 6:31,"Do to others as you would have them do to you"</strong></em><strong> and Confucius analect , " Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself. "</strong> Perhaps is good for all us(Christian, Buddhist, Atheist etc) to reflect if we are applying this GOLDEN RULE our life in the midst of our posting.  </p>

              <p>In general, when others criticise one's own beliefs, the main impulse to respond roots partially from a sense of insecurity in one's own faith which is really lack of faith or confidence.  If something is true, it remains true no matter the amount of averse opinions against it.  One does not feel in the slightest threatened.  Suppose i shd insist that you are blind, when you can perfectly see, then it doesn't become much of an issue for you.  You know you can see, that's all that matters. Would you engage in a lively debate on it?</p>

              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>Generally most Buddhists do not behave in such ways; not just because of their faith in the Buddha's teachings, but they also believe in self-discipline, self-respect and respect for others.</p>
              <p>Most Buddhists also do not react aggressively when others (religious members or not) are harsh or fierce towards them.</p>
              <p>If you are a Buddhist, then it would be in your best interest to remind yourself about what anger does to oneself and others using the Buddha's teachings. And then take the opportunity to understand the nature of anger and strive to transform it into something equally strong but yet positive and truly beneficial - compassion and equanimity.</p>
              <p>Speak up and quote relevant teachings from wise people of ancient and modern time about anger and how it affects peace and harmony whenever it is appropriate to defuse the tense situation at that time.</p>
              <p>If you are a non-Buddhist, then you can also understand anger from a secular perspective - it raises your blood pressure, creates unnecessary mental and emotional disturbance in oneself and/or in others, etc.</p>
              <p>But take note, even Buddhists are humans. Not all are saints or enlightened people. Even I can make mistakes of saying things that make fellow Buddhists feel uncomfortable even though I don't have the real intention to...</p>
              <p>To sum up, we can only keep on learning how to deal with our emotions (through self-reflection for example), and how to respond with peace and love when experiencing the raw negative emotions from others, online or otherwise.</p>
              <p>It is very hard to do, no doubts about that. I had failed many times, and am still making mistakes. But hey as long we are truly willing to learn to understand our emotions and the real consequences that have come to us or will eventually come to us, we will know what we should really do to enjoy real peace and harmony with all fellow human beings, one day.</p>

              <p>As I said before, I was surrounded by Christians, my relatives used to say I ä¸­æ¯’å¤ªæ·±ã€‚I always tell them I know better whether I am "poisoned" or not. When it is time to rebut, we have to rebut. I don't need their apologies, I just need a fair statement. What facts they have to say Buddhism is not true ?</p>
              <p>There is a saying that most of the broken families are Buddhists or Taoists. I heard that many times from Christians. They remind of the story "Frog in the Well". I always tell them that  it is general knowledge that the divorce rates in western countries (e.g. UK. European countries, U.S. etc.) are very much higher than here. They were kind of shock when they heard that, as if they suddenly realised what I said was true.</p>
              <p>At the end of every chanting, we used to recite :ä¼—ç”Ÿæ— è¾¹èª“æ„¿åº¦ If we don't speak up, how toåº¦ ? </p>

              <p>Being aggressive itself does not mean that the idea will beconveyed across properly and accepted by people. It can just put people off. I don't think one should judge a religion based on someone's behaviour in a forum. I have never heard of a religion without its black sheeps admist the rest. So why associate a religion and someone's behaviour when we cannot really see there someone can be representation of the person's particular religion.</p>
              <p>I think in singapore... we emphasis on racial and religious harmony because we learn from the past how much bloodshed disharmony racial riots can be..</p>
              <p>I don't think we can say for our religion but we learn from the Buddha - his compassionate and wisdom in dealing with life. relying on his teaching to become a better person.</p>

              <p>Soka Gakkai is not recognised as mainstream Buddhism locally and in Japan for several reasons. As I explained in <a href="/forums/1728/topics/362888">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/362888</a>:</p>
              <p>From my <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/351694">previous
                   discussion with an SGI member</a>, I sense
                                          that Soka Gakkai has very little about walking 
                  the eightfold path,
                                          about attaining liberation, realising our true 
                  nature and
                                          enlightenment. Their teachings is very skewed 
                  towards humanism and
                                          their idea of Buddhahood is also warped. There is very little emphasis on teaching the core Buddha's teachings.</p>
              <p>Buddhism isn't about morality, humanism, 
                  etc.. but about
                                          awareness, ending the cycle of birth and death 
                  and attaining
                                          liberation from all sufferings. Humanism helps 
                  the world to become
                                          a better place but does not solve the root 
                  ignorance in human being
                                          that is perpetuating the cycle of rebirth and 
                  suffering.</p>
              <p>Those looking into Buddhism, I would advise 
                  them to look into
                                          mainstream Buddhism teachings, understand them 
                  first.</p>

                                          Buddhism:<br></a></span></p>
              <p>Dear all,<br> <br> Nichiren Buddhism has been in the mainstream 
                  Buddhist circle as
                                          seen in the website of Japan Buddhist Federation
                   (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jbf.ne.jp/">http://www.jbf.ne.jp/</a>)
                                          where Nichiren Buddhist schools are members with
                   exception to
                                          Nichiren Shoshu &amp; Soka Gakkai.<br> <br> Probably what needs to be banned from this forum
                   is actually
                                          "Nichirenism". Well, I'll make a summary 
                  explanation of this.<br> <br> In Japan, Buddhism is almost exclusively of the 
                  Northern tradition
                                          (Mahayana). The lineages are mainly from Tiendai
                   (Tien-tai),
                                          Shingon, Jodo (Pure Land), Zen, Nichiren &amp; 
                  Nara schools. Due to
                                          the sectarian nature of Japanese Buddhism, each 
                  lineage consists of
                                          subsects together with the main sect.<br> <br> For Nichiren Buddhism, the main sect will be 
                  Nichiren Shu with
                                          subsects such as Kempon Hokke Shu, Honmon 
                  Butsuryu Shu, Honmon
                                          Hokke Shu &amp; 3 offshoots of Hokke Shu. There 
                  are 2 sects that
                                          advocates "Nichirenism" instead &amp; they are 
                  Honmon Shoshu,
                                          Nichiren Shoshu &amp; its one-time lay 
                  organisation Soka
                                          Gakkai.<br> <br> Here's the brief difference between Nichiren 
                  Shu, Nichiren Shoshu
                                          &amp; Soka Gakkai:<br> <br> 3 Treasures of Buddhism<br> - Buddha<br> - Dhamma<br> - Sangha<br> <br> 1) Nichiren Shu<br> - Buddha : Eternal Sakyamuni Buddha<br> - Dhamma : Mahayana Tripitaka with the Lotus

              <p>Actually pure land buddhism did not originated from Japan.</p>
              <p>It is taught by Buddha in Amitabha Sutra which is from India, which led to the Pure Land sect focusing on this dharma door in China, before it was imported into Japan later on.</p>
              <p>I am not aware of Buddha saying he cannot create such places. Buddha is all powerful. It is just an expedient, skillful means. Pure land is also not the same as heaven, as heaven is a samsaric plane.</p>
              <p>Others can answer better than me because I am not a pure land Buddhist.</p>

              <p>but pureland is not Nirvana. when one attained enlightenment, they realised the truth. when they die, they pass into Nirvana. if pureland is no longer in samsara, then it must be Nirvana. This is what the Buddha taught isnt it. some contradictions here.</p>
