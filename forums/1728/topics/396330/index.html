              <p>There appears to be quite a few learned and wise Buddhists in this forum. But I noticed something strange when I found regular Buddhists in this forum behaving so aggressively on a daily basis in another SGforum: Eternal Hope (<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381</a>). I'm not sure if such behaviour also appears in other similar forums elsewhere.</p>
              <p>I'm sure other regular and peace-loving readers of this forum will also like to know: what's Buddhism's views about aggression towards people of other faiths and religions?</p>
              <p>Will the moderators or learned Buddhists in this forum like to share your views, and provide relevant quotes to support or condone such aggressive behaviour towards people of other faiths?</p>

              <p>However,it would  be kind of you to define the acts of aggression, and maybe directly correspond with the person or persons whom you feel has acted out of step in accordance to what you feel Buddhism behaviour should be? Awareness is key!</p>
              <p>There must be some subliminal issues bothering these lay Buddhist that their actions are deemed aggressive, perhaps you have some suggestions for them and shed some light ! </p>

              <p>There appears to be quite a few learned and wise Buddhists in this forum. But I noticed something strange when I found regular Buddhists in this forum behaving so aggressively on a daily basis in another SGforum: Eternal Hope (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381</a>). I'm not sure if such behaviour also appears in other similar forums elsewhere.</p>
              <p>I'm sure other regular and peace-loving readers of this forum will also like to know: what's Buddhism's views about aggression towards people of other faiths and religions?</p>
              <p>Will the moderators or learned Buddhists in this forum like to share your views, and provide relevant quotes to support or condone such aggressive behaviour towards people of other faiths?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: I am a regular reader of SGforums, and I didn't feel the need to post, until now, as it's a pretty disturbing situation, especially for new Buddhists.</p>

              <p>Forumers who post here may not be Buddhists, some are atheists or Buddhists to be who are trying to find some answers at WB. Thus, I wonder how you differentiate who are the Buddhists and who are the atheists. Sometimes, I also can't tell.</p>
              <p>This is an open forum which is meant for open discussion. I guess those who come here have to be mentally prepared to take the heat. I agree that Buddhists today are more vocal but most of them speak on facts. No matter how we still can't compare with Christians especially people like Rony Tan because Buddhists are mindful of karma. I think you also have seen what ironfist had written but he is kind enough to apologise though not from the heart.</p>
              <p>There are many Christians out there like ironfist and Rony Tan.</p>

              <p>Dear I-am-oneness,</p>
              <p>The Buddhist view is always one of non-aggression, love/compassion &amp; wisdom.  Buddha did exhort us not to criticize other faiths and religions.  However, i think if there are practices conductd by other faiths or denominations that are harmful to beings in general then it shd be ok to denounce the practice itself. An eg is animal sacrifice.</p>
              <p>this world has a wide variety of people with varying conduct, character and so forth.  We can't expect everyone to conform to some ideal, no matter how wonderful it is.  Trying to impose one's own expectations on others will generally lead to disappointment and perhaps create even more animosity.  So dun create war in the name of peace, dun kill in the name of love.</p>
              <p>A unique characteristic of Buddhism is the absence of dogmatism and fanaticism.  We do not cling to extremes whether in material or ideological terms.  In the teachings, it is said "If there is grasping, there is no view."  Which means, our view is one of no grasping to any view ultimately.  Thus, in Buddhism, trying to adamantly establish a so-called perfect view-pt and then to impose one's views on others shows a lack of understanding.</p>
              <p>In general, when others criticise one's own beliefs, the main impulse to respond roots partially from a sense of insecurity in one's own faith which is really lack of faith or confidence.  If something is true, it remains true no matter the amount of averse opinions against it.  One does not feel in the slightest threatened.  Suppose i shd insist that you are blind, when you can perfectly see, then it doesn't become much of an issue for you.  You know you can see, that's all that matters. Would you engage in a lively debate on it?</p>
              <p>The only reason why we wish to respond to any misstatements in the Buddhist forum shd be to prevent a misunderstanding of the teachings for those who wish to learn.  Any negative motivation from pride, anger and jealousy will only be a cause for negative repercussions in the future.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><span style="color: #339966;">(p/s: having said 'dun kill in the name of love' , sometimes, there may be exceptions... there are also such examples in Buddhist history, but guided by completely authentic motivation of wishing to benefit others, heehee... sorry, as i said, views are not fixed.)</span></span></p>
