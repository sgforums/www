              <p>Actually the purpose of Buddhism is not to climb to a higher realm. In Buddhism we recognise that *all* conditioned existence is bound up by suffering, birth and death, that even if he entered into the highest jhanic and formless dimension of existence and absorption, which natural lifespan can be billions of years, eventually one will drop back to other realms. In other words one has not overcome the uncontrolled cycle of rebirth.</p>
              <p>Thus Buddhism actually seeks to *end* uncontrolled rebirth, rather than a rebirth in a higher realm of existence.</p>
              <p>Also, Buddhism recognise the existence of gods, but we do not worship them because they are still beings in samsara. ('Buddhists' that worship gods are usually not Buddhists but Chinese tradition worshippers) Buddhists do pay their respects to Buddha, but not exactly the same as 'worship' - we treat Buddha as our greatest teacher.</p>
              <p>As for whether liberation is achievable in 1 lifetime, I say it is possible. I personally know of people today who have achieved this. Is it easy? Well, it is not exactly easy, but not unachievable. Many people that I know today have reached various stages of enlightenment, and a few of them have indeed achieved liberation. These are just those that I know, there are many more that I do not know.</p>
              <p>In Theravada, those who achieve liberation simply enters into cessation. In Mahayana, such liberation is not the end and the Buddhas will eventually 'wake' such beings back to continue their path to full Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. In Mahayana, bodhisattvas are liberated from samsara, freed from all sufferings, yet continues their path in samsara to guide beings to liberation.</p>

              <p>It could well be possible that these beings have followed a 
                                  spiritual path from their past life, but I am also saying that it is 
                                  definitely possible to attain liberation if one follows through the 
                                  instructions.</p>
              <p>Learning dharma is just like any subject like learning piano, you learn from those that gone 
                                  through before, you practice time tested spiritual techniques, there will be a predictable pattern in how the insights unfold for 
                                  those who follow a spiritual path, and by following the instructions you will attain the expected results. Whether someone is a natural talent 
                                  and thus learning piano is no kick for him, or that someone does not 
                                  have a natural talent but ascends at a slower rate, what is certain is 
                                  that eventually they will 'master' it. Thus we cannot say that we will 
                                  not be able to attain liberation in one life, it is certainly possible.</p>
              <p>The Buddha himself assured that by practicing the 4 foundations of mindfulness, one can gain liberation or the 3rd stage of anagami in 7 days to 7 years time (though I suspect this is in a retreat setting). Personally the examples I witnessed... full liberation takes around 10 to 20 years (though I'm not saying it could be slower or faster than that, totally depends, just like whether you can graduate grade 8 in piano very quickly also depends).</p>
              <p>There will be no future lifes for those liberated (unless they 
                                  are in the Bodhisattva path).</p>
              <p>Also if one attains the 1st stage of Sotapanna, one is assured full liberation in no more than 7 lifes (that is, if he dies before completing his path). If one attains 2nd stage of Once Returner, one is assured full liberation in no more than 1 life (that is, if he dies before completing his path). If one attains 3rd stage of Non Returner, one is assured that one will be reborn in the 4th jhana and attain arhatship there, if one dies before completing his path. And the 4th stage arhat of course, has transcended rebirth.</p>
              <p>So what this means is that even if one does not attain full liberation, even to attain the first stage of enlightenment one is already 'in the conveyer belt' so to speak - irreversible.</p>
              <p>Similarly in the Bodhisattva path, even though you cannot attain Buddhahood, even to attain 1st Bhumi Bodhisattva ensures one is in the conveyer belt.</p>

              <p>Actually, in Buddhism, each of us have infinite past lives. Our samsaric existence is beginingless. There is no origin and beginning, we just roll on and on according to dependent origination, karma, causes and conditions.</p>

              <p>Actually this is where Buddhism differs from new age, because we do not believe we have to 'learn all the lessons' in order to be liberated. By perceiving the luminous and empty nature of reality, we allow all our experiences and tendencies to self-liberate on its own accord.</p>
              <p>As longchen (who used to be in new age so he knows these stuff), who I dare say is already highly enlightened (oh and btw just for your curiosity: based on his own past life memories he has been on the spiritual path for his past 3 lives, one as a tibetan monk, one as a european mystic, and now as a buddhist. He has remembered many other past lives, but not so much spirituality prior to the 3 lifetimes. Though this is the first life where he realised emptiness), says:</p>

              <p> Hi Yunhaier,</p>
              <p>Firstly, i would like to state that this is 
                                      not definitive and
                                                              it is impossible to fully describe this 'higher

              <p>This 'state' seeks the resolution of 
                                      fulfillments. Because of
                                                              awareness of past lifes of the being, at that 
                                      state there is the
                                                              understanding of deathlessness. Therefore, death
                                       is not a concern
                                                              at that level of consciousness. At that level, 
                                      the seeking of
                                                              resolution of 'unfinished business' drives the

              <p>Let me describe an example. In my previous 
                                      life, I was a
                                                              european soldier who participated in WW1. The 
                                      war left a fearful
                                                              imprint about the pain of war. 'High self/alaya'
                                       state seeks to

                                      the process of
                                                              reborning in an  environment where a similar

              <p>Hi RJ,</p>
              <p>Thank you for writing and sharing. I 
                                      perfectly understood what
                                                              you are talking about. Karmic lessons, cycle of 
                                      life and lifeplans,
                                                              these are what I have meant by 'Higher self' 
                                      level purposes. As
                                                              said, this are the 'seed intentions' for the 
                                      reincarnation. As
                                                              mentioned above, this level is not really 
                                      concerned about physical
                                                              deaths of individual lifetimes, it is more 
                                      concern about learning
                                                              karmic lessons, resolution, completion of life 
                                      plans and so on so
                                                              forth.</p>
              <p>There is no right or wrong. This is one 
                                      perspective from a
                                                              specific level.</p>
              <p>However, may i also  invite you to take a 
                                      deeper evaluation
                                                              of Buddhism, especially its  teaching about
                                                              no-self/non-duality and emptiness. We need not 
                                      discard what we
                                                              already know, but insights into non-duality and 
                                      emptiness will give
                                                              us a new perspective that may not be 
                                      incompatible with what you
                                                              already know. :)</p>
              <p>I hope the other forummers are not too 
                                      protective of what is
                                                              Buddhism or is not. This is just my sharing with

              <p><br>Maslow's theory is more suited for management studies than for spiritual growth, as we can concurrently develop different aspects of ourselves, instead of having to learn/satisfy 1 need first before proceeding to the next.

              <p>Which is why a person's chosen path and actions (in current lifetime) can determine to a great extent how long (as in how many lifetimes) he/she needs to mature spiritually.</p>

              <p>Though Maslow studies is highly used in Management, but it dealth with human behaviour, which human behaviour is a daily basis, not just too restricted to Management, it is a more general guidelines towards the daily life our emotinon.</p>
              <p>Agreed, that spiritual path is many lifetimes, that also depending on which religion are you refering to, for Buddhism, yes. Our mind consist of the phsycial activities, mental activities and the spiritual activities, greatly if the later two could be balance, one could not achieve spiritual growth as well.</p>

              <p>Actually it is not true that an enlightened person cannot declare his enlightenment. (though in our culture, enlightenment is still quite taboo, so usually only close students were being informed) The Buddha declare his enlightenment, and in Buddha's times all his students' attainments are well known.
                                  
                                  As for Longchen, there is a qualified lineage teacher from the Mahasi Sayadaw tradition from who mentioned which stage of enlightenment he is at. I will not divulge the details.</p>
              <p>Btw, it is also wrong to say that enlightened beings cannot say the word 'I'.</p>
              <p>Enlightened beings continue to use the word 'I' for conventional uses. The Buddha said this before. So it is perfectly fine to say 'I am awakened' while simultaneously understanding that there is no self.</p>
              <p>Rather than shrouding enlightenment in a mist of taboos, I hope people can become more open on the topic of enlightenment.</p>

                  you wanted to learn, like playing piano or mathematics. You studied with
                   people who were not afraid to tell you what they were capable of, you 
                  practiced techniques that everyone expected to work, you talked honestly
                   with your fellow dharma adventurers about what was going and helped 
                  each other to progress, you attained to the expected results, and when 
                  you did so, you were not ridiculed or made to shut up about it, but 
                  instead were viewed as one more successful practitioner of the art who 
                  was there to support those coming up and also still learning from

              <p>The subtle 
                  spiritual pitfall of psychological work is                         that 
                  it can reinforce certain tendencies inherent in the                     
                      conditioned personality: to see ourselves as a doer, to always look 
                                          for the meaning in experience, or to continually
                   strive for                         “something better.” Although 
                  psychological reflection can certainly                         help 
                  people move forward in important ways, at some point even the           
                                slightest desire for change or improvement can interfere 
                  with the                         deeper letting go and relaxation that 
                  are necessary for moving from                         the realm of 
                  personality into the realm of being, which is only                      
                     discoverable in and through nowness – in moments when all            
                               conceptualizing and striving cease.</p>
              <p>When we let experience be as it is, instead of seeking 
                                          to alter it in any way, the focus of inner work 
                  shifts in an                         important and powerful way. No 
                  longer is our experience something                         apart from us
                   that we need to change or resolve; instead, the focus                  
                         widens to a larger field: <em>how-we-are-with-our-experience.</em> And when we relate to our experience in a more 
                  spacious, allowing                         way, it becomes less 
                  problematic, because we no longer exist in an                         
                  I-It, subject-object tension with it.</p>
              <p>Although the main aim of psychotherapy is to reduce            
                               psychological distress and increase self-understanding, 
                  rather than                         to overcome divided consciousness, I
                   nonetheless felt a need to                         practice therapy in a
                   way that was more congruent with the nondoing                         
                  quality of meditative presence. I was also inspired in this vision      
                                     by moments in my own personal work when opening to my
                   experience                         just as it is has brought me into a 
                  fuller sense of presence – a                         kind of 
                  “being-without-agenda,” which led to a powerful sense of                
                           stillness, acceptance, and aliveness. Such moments afforded a  
                                         glimpse of what lay on the other side of divided 
                  consciousness:                         being at-one with myself in a new
                   and deeper way.</p>

              <div id="post-body-9718140" class="body">
              <p>While having a conversation with a friend 
                  yesterday I noticed
                                          something.</p>
              <p>There is just one thought happening 
                  spontaneously, one action
                                          happening spontaneously at every moment.. but 
                  the sense that a 'me'
                                          led to a thought or action is actually an 
                  illusion... is also just
                                          an arising thought... therefore any effort or 
                  action to control
                                          thoughts or do anything is also the result of 
                  the illusion, theres
                                          actually just a presently arising thought. There
                   is always only
                                          presence and spontaneous arising... theres 
                  nothing 'we' can ever do
                                          or have ever done.</p>
              <p>The sense that theres something that must be 
                  done to experience
                                          presence is also really just story, actually 
                  there is always just a
                                          thought, an action arising in presence.. only in
                   concepts do we
                                          create a sense of distance and a need and a 
                  'doer' to fulfill
                                          certain<br> things like getting rid of certain thought or 
                  feeling to 'reach'
                                          presence.. in direct nonconceptual looking one 
                  sees there is just
                                          always just presence and spontaneous arising.</p>
              <p>(seeing that there is no 'doer' really has an effect in surrendering to the present moment/'what's spontaneously happening' instead of seeking resolution to issues/situations by 'doing')</p>

              <p>1) I actually see 'goal oriented' in a positive light. In fact that is one of the good things of making enlightenment less obscure: so that people know its possible, that people have done it, that ordinary people like me can do it too. Competitiveness can also become a positive force - that is, if it is a friendly healthy competition, and not one that turns relationship sour. I actually see this as good - we must use whatever emotions we have to steer us to enlightenment. Nothing wrong. If let's say my wife is becoming more enlightened than me, I will want to buck up in my practice and realise what my wife has realised! lol.. Incidentally, Daniel Ingram and others have in fact encouraged "competitive team sport" dharma friendship.</p>

              <p>3) I am not aware of any obstacles, apart from possible controversies it may cause (especially when there are all kinds of people, not everyone may be that spiritually mature, some may even be doubtful that enlightenment exists)</p>

              <p>Many people think that practice is a very private, personal matter, and while there is some points to it, I also see otherwise.</p>
              <p>As Daniel Ingram points out, <em>"Keep the company of other friends who are good practitioners and 
                  teachers and talk with them regularly and honestly about your thoughts 
                  on the dharma, your own practice, teaching, your relationships with 
                  students, and the rest: external reference points help a lot to keep us 
                  real and down-to-earth. Dharma should be a team sport, and teaching even
                   more so."</em></p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p><em>It is interesting that my first really inspiring teacher who was open 
                  about attainments and really down to earth about talking about real 
                  practice was a woman: Subhana Barzaghi. Her simple "you can do it and we
                   can talk about it like anything else" style was part of my early 
                  inspiration for going in the direction I did with my book and this 
                  place. Of all the people I sat with since, she still remains one of the 
                  most inspiring of the bunch. She is also the only person I know who 
                  holds dual Vipassana and Zen lineages, and this an inspiration for me to
                   read across traditions and a confirmation that they must be talking 
                  about the same thing.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddha also in many occasions adviced his students to have strong spiritual friendship and openly discuss and help each other on the spiritual path. We can share and gain insights from each other in this way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among 
                  the <a id="sakya" name="sakya">Sakyans</a>. Now there is a Sakyan town 
                  named <a id="sakkara" name="sakkara">Sakkara</a>. There <a id="ananda" name="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, 
                  having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting
                   there, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "This is half of the holy 
                  life, lord: admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable 
                  camaraderie."<a id="t-1" class="noteTag " name="t-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.002.than.html#n-1">1</a></em></p>
              <p><em>"Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Admirable friendship, 
                  admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of 
                  the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions,

              <p>Many people think that practice is a very private, personal matter, and while there is some points to it, I also see otherwise.</p>
              <p>As Daniel Ingram points out, <em>"Keep the company of other friends who are good practitioners and teachers and talk with them regularly and honestly about your thoughts on the dharma, your own practice, teaching, your relationships with students, and the rest: external reference points help a lot to keep us real and down-to-earth. Dharma should be a team sport, and teaching even more so."</em></p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p><em>It is interesting that my first really inspiring teacher who was open about attainments and really down to earth about talking about real practice was a woman: Subhana Barzaghi. Her simple "you can do it and we can talk about it like anything else" style was part of my early inspiration for going in the direction I did with my book and this place. Of all the people I sat with since, she still remains one of the most inspiring of the bunch. She is also the only person I know who holds dual Vipassana and Zen lineages, and this an inspiration for me to read across traditions and a confirmation that they must be talking about the same thing.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddha also in many occasions adviced his students to have strong spiritual friendship and openly discuss and help each other on the spiritual path. We can share and gain insights from each other in this way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the <a id="sakya" rel="nofollow" name="sakya">Sakyans</a>. Now there is a Sakyan town named <a id="sakkara" rel="nofollow" name="sakkara">Sakkara</a>. There <a id="ananda" rel="nofollow" name="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "This is half of the holy life, lord: admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie."<a id="t-1" rel="nofollow" name="t-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.002.than.html#n-1">1</a></em></p>
              <p><em>"Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; comrades, he can be expected to develop &amp; pursue the noble eightfold path.</em></p>
              <p><em>"<a id="eightfold" rel="nofollow" name="eightfold">And how</a> does a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; comrades, develop &amp; pursue the noble eightfold path?

              <p>my personal view: whatever we're all learning or trying to achieve, at the end of the day, do we hope to also help others around us, with our increased knowledge, awareness or enlightenment? or is it purely a personal goal and hence personal victory at the end of the day? I truly hope everyone can agree honestly that it's the first case.</p>

              <p>wow, well said! though I don't know who your teachers are, but if you can feel such love from them, they must be truly worthy teachers. though the postings and articles in this forum seldom talk about love for people, it's really an extremely important aspect that needs to be learnt and felt, if spiritual growth is to occur. Although I'm not here to intentionally irritate any Buddhists, and I keep getting reminded that Buddhism is not about learning life/karmic lessons, and more about about losing attachments and achieving emptiness and awareness, wisdomeye's (a Buddhist) words above express much of what I've been trying to say.</p>
              <p>How many of you truly feel that the day when you lose all attachments to this world, and no longer have 'normal human feelings' like love or feelings for people or situations around you, is the day you've finally achieved enlightenment? I know this question may not be very well phrased, but it's hard to express everything in written words.</p>
              <p>I'm just giving my observation as an 'outsider' in this forum: when you have true compassion and love for others (people, animals, environment, etc), you don't need to say anything and others will just naturally feel it from you, and naturally want to learn from you and be like you, so that they can in turn love and help others. Though I can explain this phenomenon in terms of how positive energy works in the Universe, and its positive effects on people, but it's not appropriate for me to share it here. Anyhow, this is the case with wisdomeye's teachers' positive effect on their students. This is the true mastery of spirituality, regardless of what religion or faith (including free thinkers) someone has.</p>

              <p>We or "I" is the cause of our own suffering and very often the cause of suffering of others. When "I" disappears, phenomena of selflessness emerges.  Because I am at ease with myself and others, loving kindness and compassion naturally arises, only it does not have a name! </p>
