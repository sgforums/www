              <p>But for most people we do not see the nature of reality as it
              is, so finally by reading sutras or meditation, we finally see the
              nature as it is, for us, the subject and object reunify, because it

              unification of subject and object, is just a "plain english"
              way to say non duality of subject and object, <br> Nonduality is not the goal but the path to achieve ultimate
              joyfullness and peacefulness, see reality as it is, even see
              reality as it is, is not the top concern, as like some pop star,

              never mind , we just want to be entertained. I think the ultimate
              goal of practising buddhism is to maximize the joyfullness,minimize
              the suffering, just like 4åœ£è°›ï¼Œè‹¦ ç�­ é›† é�“ï¼Œis it?  We pratise

              <p>When the person realises non-duality, it's not that subject and object reunify, it's that they see it has never been separated all along. All along the sense that subject and object are separate is false -- there never has been a subject and object! So what is there to unify? The false is seen to be false, that's all. Nondual reality presents itself in every moment effortlessly as an insight into what 'Always Is So'.</p>
              <p>Non-duality is neither the goal nor the path, it is what Always Is. The insight into the 'Always Is' is necessary to end all sufferings.<br><br>It is the subject-object split, the separation that causes suffering as well the arising of desire. Without the insight that there is no-split, the mind continues to divide. Desire is an inner deficiency of the mind created to bridge the gap of separation. Aversion is the inner deficiency of the mind created that negatively reacts with or seeks to escape from a perceived object due to falsely projecting reality on 'external objects'.<br><br>When Anatta and Anicca is fully seen, it is seen there is no phenomena graspable nor is there a separate subject/self that can pursue or reject appearance, because there is in reality only transient appearances, with no experiencer/no one at its center that can escape or have a relation with appearances or be at the mercy of pain. Hence freedom from suffering is achieved, illusion of separation and split ended. The three poisons of desire, aversion, and ignorance is ended.</p>

              <p>'Already no self' is not applicable only to enlightened persons -- it is applicable to everyone's experience. <strong>It is a fact of our experience at all times and can be experienced. It is a Dharma Seal. (æ³•å�°)</strong> It's like saying everything is already impermanent! è¯¸è¡Œ is already æ— å¸¸, è¯¸æ³• is already æ— æˆ‘. In fact, what the Buddha taught is to observe in our direct experience the fact of no self in our every moment of experience. It is simply to re-discover a fact of existence that we have not understood. It is not about achieving a stage of egolessness, enlightenment is not a stage, it is only a 'rediscovery' of a fact that was all along so but we have never noticed due to our ignorance. The practice to re-discover this through observation of our moment-to-moment experience is called Vipassana or 'guan1'. Heart Sutra say,</p>
              <p>è§‚è‡ªåœ¨è�©è�¨ è¡Œæ·±èˆ¬è‹¥æ³¢ç½—èœœå¤šæ—¶<br> ç…§è§�äº”è•´çš†ç©º åº¦ä¸€åˆ‡è‹¦åŽ„.</p>

Everyone can and should become è§‚è‡ªåœ¨è�©è�¨.</p>
              <p>So there is this saying, </p>
              <p>ä¿®è¡Œè¦�è¯€<br>ä¸€ä¹�å››â—‹å¹´å¤§æ„šæ³•å¸ˆç»™é•¿å¥³ä»ªåº„ç•™è¯—ä¸€é¦–<br><br>å¯‚ç…§ç…§å¯‚ã€€åˆ‡å¿Œç”¨åŠ›<br>æˆ�ä½›ä½œç¥–ã€€æ— ä»–ç§˜å¯†</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next, the fact of non-duality of subject and object has also nothing to stay away from self.</p>
              <p>In the first place is there a 'self' to stay away from? Nothing to stay away! There is really only thoughts, sensations and feelings, there is no self -- no thinker, experiencer, doer, watcher, etc.</p>
              <p>So there is only thoughts, sensations, feelings, and no separate self, and non-duality does not ask you to stay away from thoughts, sensations and feelings.</p>
              <p>In the first place, there is no 'self' that can 'stay away' from thoughts, sensations and feelings.</p>
              <p>Thoughts, sensations, and feelings will arise whenever there is condition for them to arise -- whether you want it to! There is no 'you' at the center who can escape from these appearances even if you wanted to. There is no escape because there is no self to escape, there is only what is arising according to conditions.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">"There is only
                                                                                      ever the present appearance of life, with no individual at its core who
                                                                                      could ever escape even if they wanted to. </span>Indeed, all attempts to

              <p>In fact the practice of Buddhism has nothing to do with escaping anything -- but rather become totally intimate, to feel and experience in clarity everything that is arising. This is the practice of Mindfulness. It's like è§‰ç…§ï¼Œè§‚ç…§. It is bare, naked, non-conceptual awareness. Trying to escape, trying to push away thoughts and experience is counter-productive -- åˆ‡å¿Œç”¨åŠ›. Through total mindfulness of our bare experience, we can then begin to penetrate its nature: impermanence, suffering, no-self. It's nature is empty. Then insight can arise in that way, leading to liberation.</p>

              <p>Seems that illusion of subject-object split, so we seems have to
                                          take suject and object to be one, same thing, so if say apple is
                                          same thing to orange, so you mean apple is not a non existence,
                                          it's same thing to orange, so why need the two different name? As a
                                          result of the Nonduality of orange and apple, there seems no
                                          necessity to use the two name refering the same thing, if they are
                                          exactly the same thing. IT's confusing, that's go back to the
                                          topic, if you and the world are non dual, taking you as object and
                                          the world as subject, you become the world, then there is two world
                                          you disappear, or another way, the world become you, then there is
                                          two you, the world disappear. But the world is out there it cannot
                                          change, so probably you change to world, so you disappear,</p>
              <p>Is that a proof of the non existence of self, when nonduality of
                                          subject and object is achieved</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>No, non-duality is not about apple being same as orange. The non-duality I'm talking about is strictly the non-duality of subject (self/perceiver) and object (perceived).</p>
              <p>Apple and orange are different manifestation, due to different conditions.</p>
              <p>Vision of apple as red and orange as orange in colour appear as our awareness.</p>
              <p>We are able to distinguish that there are differences in colour -- one is red, one is orange. This is because Awareness is always manifesting in the Manifold according to specific/varying conditions, and never stays the same even for one moment, completely empty.</p>
              <p>What is Non-Duality/No-Self saying?</p>
              <p>There is no watcher/seer that is looking at the apple. When seeing a red apple, the 'seeing' and the 'colour' cannot be separated -- the seeing is the colour. Seeing and colour is in fact 'one thing', but due to the limitations of our inherently dualistic system of language, we speak as if they are two separate things. In actuality there is no seer apart from seen! We can't meaningfully speak of seeing apart from colour, or colour apart from seeing -- in the act of seeing colour, there is just colour, the manifestation. The closest we can describe verbally is, there is just Isness, Thusness, Suchness. This is the meaning of çœŸå¦‚æœ¬æ€§.</p>
              <p>In other words, all sensations/feelings/thoughts are aware where they are, and there is nothing/no separate self split off from that sensation, watching that sensation. The sensation/feeling/thought is self-aware, self-luminous, and also empty. That is itself Buddha-Nature. The sense of a center/agent/Self that is apart from that sensation, watching that sensation, is an illusion all along, that needs to be seen through by deep insight into Anatta (No-Self).</p>
              <p>But this is just part of the story. This is talking about No-Self. The next aspect is Emptiness, and is even deeper. You cannot understand Emptiness properly without first understanding No-Self.</p>
              <p>What does Emptiness mean?</p>
              <p>When you are looking at a red apple, All you see is all there is -- <strong>Empty</strong> of inherent redness of the apple, or orange-ness of orange, apple and orange are empty of inherent existence. It's only because of your specific karmic conditioning that produce the vision/appearance of redness -- not everyone sees the same shapes and colours. Dogs are colour blind, and other realm beings can see something totally different. If you look from quantum perspective it's mostly (99.9999%) void. Hence all perceptions/consciousness is inseparable from conditioning -- and thus <strong>Empty</strong> of inherent/objective reality 'out there' apart from this moment's arising perception, complete as it is. There is no apple/orange out there with inherent shapes and colours and attributes. Nothing observed has a separate reality apart from the observer, and no observer has a separate reality apart from the observed. Because the observer and the observed cannot be separated, it's meaningless to even speak of an observer or (something) observed -- there is just a nondual reality of What Is, which is pure appearances/awareness.</p>

              <p>There is no 'me' and 'world', nor a me to become one with universe, there is only what Is, there is only çœŸå¦‚.</p>
              <p>There is no 'world' out there -- just like there is no red apple out there (explained in previous post), but the <strong>Appearance</strong> of red apple manifest according to conditions.</p>
              <p>There is no 'me' in here watching either. There is no watcher, only experiencing without an experiencer. In hearing the sound, there is just the sound, no hearer. And these sounds, scenery, thoughts, all appear according to conditions, they are inseparable from conditions... when causes and conditions meet, the sensations/feelings/thoughts 'can't help' but manifest as our awareness. Pristine Awareness is inseparable from conditions.</p>
              <p>There is only Appearances of the Manifold, appearing as red flower, appearing as orange, as words appearing on screen, all that is As It Is, all that is self-luminous and empty Awareness, Buddha-Nature.</p>

              <p>You have an altruistic view and tried to link no-self with morality.</p>
              <p>However you have to understand that in Buddhism, No-Self is not related to morality, non-attachment to self, non-egotism, selflessness, or any of such notions. All these are important, but are not the teaching of No-Self in Buddhism, and these practices do not lead to liberation or enlightenment, though they can build up good karma and thus good rebirths.</p>
              <p>So we <strong>should not misunderstand that No-Self is good conduct -- it is not a conduct, it is the nature of reality at all times. And it is only the arising of insight into the ever-present nature of reality that liberates.<br></strong></p>
              <p>In Buddhism, No-Self is one of the ä¸‰æ³•å�° (Three Dharma Seals/Three Characteristics of Existence).</p>
              <p>The implication that No-Self is a Seal of Reality means that at all times, all phenomena and at all times our experience exhibits the characteristic of No-Self.</p>
              <p>This means that all along, there never was a self, even if you are un-enlightened, or if you are selfish, or egotistic, etc, there is still no self. Not a moment is there actually a 'separate self'...</p>
              <p>Ordinary unenlightened beings think that there is a fixed self, an observer. But in actuality this is not the case. Our experience is momentary and does not constituted a fixed and inherent self or soul.</p>
              <p>As Thusness wrote before:</p>
              <div><em><strong>Life (Self) is nothing other than the continuous flow of the Now Moment.<br>The Now Moment ceases as it arises. This moment must completely ceased<br>and serves as the CAUSE for the next moment to arise.<br>Therefore Self is a process of series Self1, Self2, Self3, Self4, Self5, Self6...etc<br>A fixed entity 'Self' does not exist, what really exists is a momentary Self.<br>Under deep meditation, one is able to observe and sense the karmic and mental factors from moment to moment,<br>it is these factors that are succeeded from moment to moment and life and life but not a fixed entity.</strong></em></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, there is no separate agent/self/observer/doer apart from moment to moment manifestation. That means in Hearing, there is just Sound, just the Tonggg -- no Hearer or Bell ringing.</p>
              <p>All these are not just a concept. If we can observe our experience at all moments we can realise/discover the fact of no-self in all our every moment experience, as a seal of reality, not to be mistaken as an altruistic state of egolessness.</p>
