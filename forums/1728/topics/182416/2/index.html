Buddhists recognises that the quality of spiritual practice is greatly influenced by one's associates. monks and nuns separate themselves from the world is to avoid worldly people and distracting influences.<br><br>spiritual energy is healing energy; when any group gathers with a dedication to something greater than one's finite, individual self, the accumulated energy is almost palpable.<br><br>in larger sense, Sangha refers to a great deal more than a particular group of people who wear yellow orange or red robes. the Sangha signifies cooperation, collaboration, inclusiveness and interbeing - being connected with others.<br><br>this includes the entire community of all beings, seen and unseen, human and otherwise - the entire boundless circle.<br><br>internal Sangha is your own personal practice and the internal energies and experience practice evokes that of receiving positive energy from spiritual experiences in an esoteric way with personified energies that are archtypical representations of Dharma Protectors.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(personally i also agree with what Buddha taught as shown in the next paragraphs conveyed by Lama Surya Das)<br><br>the Buddha taught that the spiritual seeker could expect to be confronted with some classic hindrances on his way. as you walk the inner path of awakening, recognise that it is most definitely a heroic and mythic journey. like all heroic journeys, yours will be filled with awe-inspiring mysteries, fearful difficulties, outstanding adventures.<br><br>but you must be prepared to meet and overcome obstacles; you must be prepared for roadblocks; you must be prepared to go places at first seem frightening and incomprehensible. you must be prepared to make sacrifices and be prepared to change.....<br><br>just as the caterpillar must shed its familiar cocoon in order to become a butterfly and fly, we must be willing to change and shed the cocoon or hard armor of self-centered egotism.<br><br>as compelling as the inner journey is, it can be difficult because it brings you face to face with reality; it brings you face to face with who and what you really are. trying to embody the Dharma and live truly must have its perilous moments because there will always be challenges to meet, leaps and stretches to be made and obstacles to overcome.<br><br>a spiritual journey inevitably includes low valleys as well as high mountains, dense forests as well as seemingly barren deserts, plateaus and plains. this is the landscape and territory of your own being. it is all-revealing and it all needs exploration.<br><br>everything you experience along the way can be a way of helping you awaken the Buddha within.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>using a mantra to find your own voice</strong><br><br>mantras are sacred words of great power and blessings. the word "mantra" is literally translated as "something to lean the mind (manas) upon". and that's what a mantra can do.<br><br>mantra practice can be relied upon as a quick, effective, powerful way of focussing, stabilising and freeing the mind. mantra practice can help inculcate constructive states of mind; reinforce mind-training. it enhances our basic intelligence, wakefulness, concentration and present awareness.<br><br></div>
