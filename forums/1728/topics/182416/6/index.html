            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gentle Ananda's Awakening</strong><br><br>a Buddhist story about spiritual effort involves Buddha's devoted disciple, Ananda. by the time Buddha became ill and died, he had been teaching for forty-five years and many of his disciples had become enlightened. one who had not was Buddha's ever-present attendant, Ananda. this might be considered peculiar because of all the disciples, Ananda had heard every word that the Buddha taught and memorised them all.<br><br>But Ananda, who had the kind of demanding daily schedule many of us can identify with, had been so busy accompanying the Buddha wherever he went and assisting the sangha members that there had been little time for his own solitary meditation practice.<br><br>several months after the Buddha's death, there was a reason why it suddenly became imperative for Ananda to become enlightened. the First Council of Buddhist Arhants was to take place in order to recite and codify all the teachings spoken by the Buddha. Ananda was essential to this meeting because he more than anyone else would be able to speak and verify the sutras. however because he wasn't enlightened, he wasn't qualified to attend.<br><br>Ananda did the only thing he could do under the circumstances: almost as if he was cramming for exams, he went into retreat - a meditation marathon - striving round the clock for enlightenment. finally it was the morning of the day before the First Council meeting and Ananda was still meditating.<br><br>then midnight, 2am, 3am, on the day of the meeting and Ananda was still striving for enlightenment, sitting in his small monastic cell. at 3.45am, 15 minutes before the 4am wake-up call on the very day of the meeting, Ananda finallly just gave up and thought, "well, that's that. i am not an arhant."<br><br>exhausted, he began to tip over from meditation into a sleeping position. Ananda stopped trying to be something he wasn't; and then before he hit the pillow, in an instant he was a liberated arhant - totally awake. Ananda became enlightened finally by letting go, simply stopping and seeing things just as they are.<br><br>it was the end of the struggle. no more trying to become an Arhant and Ananda became an arhant. in surrendering and giving up, Ananda got what he was looking for. by being just who he was, Ananda woke up.<br><br>Ananda had behind him a lifetime of pure effort and virtuous dedication, personally assisting the Buddha. his selfless personal service, in itself, didn't bring him to enlightenment; neither did round-the-clock meditation.<br><br>without his service or the meditation, he would not have accomplished his goal. yet it was in letting go and surrendering to effortlessness that he finally reached enlightenment.<br><br>as a Japanese Zen master recently said during an intensive meditation retreat known as a sesshin, "the perfect way is without difficulty. strive hard. we are all perfect and yet we can perfect ourselves endlessly."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>nothing in pure Buddhism encourages blind faith or cultlike environments.</strong><br><br>people cling to tired dogma.... all the time. <strong>but that is not Dharma.</strong><br><br>the Buddha wisely challenged his followers to open their minds and <strong>think for themselves rather than believing in anything just because it had been said by authorities, including himself, or written down in books.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the Buddha warned about the five primary <strong>hindrances</strong> on the path to awakening. one of them, <strong>spiritual laziness</strong>, is a direct challenge to the vigor and energy necessary for Right Effort.<br><br>spiritual laziness - sloth, torpor, apathy, lethargy, indolence, complacency, depression.....<br><br>with the hindrance of torpor, we also have to discuss the spiritual crisis known as depression and the lethargy that accompanies it. fatigue of depression robs the energy away from walking the spiritual path or even to keep living. depression overwhelms with negativity and lethargy, it is as though you have lost your way and nothing you do can possibly matter.<br>depression typically carries an overwhelming sense of feeling abandoned, alone, exhausted and disconnected - profoundly weary from the difficult business of living.<br><br>when you are working on depression and other difficult life situations, it is important to summon your faith, fall back on soulful inner practices and go for refuge where you can find spiritual solace.<br><br>try to remember to <strong>have faith in your own Buddha-nature, your own inner light and seek guidance from a reliable teacher or Bodhisattva-like mentor who inspires spiritual wisdom and energy. go for refuge to the Dharma by staying true to yourself and your sense that you are on the right path. and look to your friends and your sangha or spiritual group of any denomination for support.</strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when you are feeling low or lethargic, place some trust in physical activity to mobilise your energy. practice yoga, tai-chi, breathing exercises and self-inquiry.<br><br><strong>dynamic meditation gives back far more energy than it takes.</strong> even when we are heartbroken, a meditation retreat can help us to take heart. although meditation seems to take time and energy, it gives us back even more time, as well as a sense of spacious ease and clarity. the same can be said for the spiritual life. you truly do get back much more than you give. this is something you can see for yourself.<br><br>if you are in the middle of a depression, you may want to try more active spiritual activities like chanting, breathing, singing, praying or yoga. meditative arts like gardening, calligraphy, tea ceremony or martial arts are often very helpful activities. even vigorous walking, jogging or dancing can be beneficial. there is nothing in Buddhism that is incompatible with psychotherapy.<br><br><strong>we have to remember NOT to use meditation as a spiritual bypass to avoid our psychological and daily life issues.</strong><br><br>and don't forget to find spiritual strength by reaching out to a spiritual community or some kind of support group.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we see pictures of lamas and monks in maroon robes prostrating themselves on the ground. what they are doing is a foundational practice of Tibetan Buddhism called <strong>Nondro.</strong><br><br>monks, nuns and lay yogis all complete these foundational practices, sometimes several or even many times. consider the discipline these preliminary practices require and the level of effort and energy required for meditational practice in the Tibetan tradition.<br><br><strong>Nondro</strong> is referred to as preliminary or foundational practice because these practices provide a firm foundation for undertaking the higher Vajrayana (tantric) practices, which then culminate in Mahamudra and Dzogchen.<br><br><strong>Nondro</strong> emphasises the ideal of all beings - friends, relatives, animals, insects - entering into the joy of Dharma, all becoming enlightened together. it is a very joyous, boundless, all-inclusive, spiritual practice.<br><br></div>
