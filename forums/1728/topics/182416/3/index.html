            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Eight Worldly Winds That Blow Us Off Course</strong><br><br>the Eight Worldly Winds are actually four pairs. each pair representing opposite poles on a desire-aversion axis - in other words, what we want and what we don't want. two different yet totally inter-related <strong>forms of desire.</strong><br><br><strong>pleasure and pain<br><br>gain and loss<br><br>praise and blame<br><br>fame and shame</strong><br><br>concern about and attachment to pleasure, gain, praise and fame are powerful forces that can sometimes seize us with hurricane ferocity.... blowing us about like leaves in the wind.<br><br>we've all seen people jeopardize life, limb, ethical considerations and contentment for the briefest of pleasures, the possibility of financial gain, the right kind of praise or for 15mins in the winner's circle of fame.<br><br>it's easy to respond to these driving forces with knee-jerk reactions and loss sight of our inner goals. we are distracted for only a second; nonetheless we get blown off course.<br><br>like a weight watcher slogan says, "a moment on the lips, a life-time on the hips." this is <strong>Dharma wisdom</strong>, the practical <strong>ethics of conscious restraint.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>true spiritual masters are so centered and inner-directed that no matter what is happening in the outer world, they don't lose touch with their innate Buddha-nature. they are guided by their own principles instead of merely reacting according to momentary conditions and temporary circumstances.<br><br>going through life with their hands on the steering wheel of awareness, they are paying attention; they understand karmic causation, how things actually work. many of the rest of us, of course are still gripping the rearview mirror and wondering why we so often end up lost or in the ditch.<br><br>it's easy to become so enmashed in our worldly goals that we lose sight of the bigger picture. the ups and downs of office politics and interpersonal dynamics will overly affect the untrained mind. one minute you can feel like a winner, the next you're in a slump.<br><br>when gods in the celestial realms use up their accumulation of good karma, even they must come back to earth; even superman can fall from the sky.<br><br></div>
