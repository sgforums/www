            <div class='col-md body'>i'd like to share with everyone some contents of Lama Surya Das' book, "Awakening The Buddha Within".<br><br>this is the actual first book on Buddhist teachings i randomly bought off the shelf that opened real wider doors to my spirituality to Buddhism. i wasn't aware who Lama Surya Das was although i just found his contents to be inspiring motivating and seemed to be a conducive guideline for me to step in deeper into Buddhism. i do not have any personal master to guide me till today. i learn from everyone of you including myself going through within myself. it's too early to say.... the moment i received his teachings in the book, unknowingly he had been my spiritual master all along from the beginning at the book shelf. as i mentioned before in other post, i know when the time is right, i will meet my teacher. a teacher need not be present in front of me, but the spirit of his teachings is the essence of being with the master and his teachings. just as i'd always looked upon Buddha Shakyamuni to his words and guidances.<br><br>and it is only now i started to flip the webpages trying to find out the lama behind this book. and..... i still didn't know exactly the reasons why i would wish to post a thread on one of his recommended books, except with the basic thought of sharing.<br><br>may him be well and blessed and continue to pass on the teachings of the Buddha Dharma to all students out there ready to cultivate and absorb.<br><br>a brief introduction to Lama Surya Das:<br><br>his name is Jeffrey Allen Miller (Sheldon?.... as he mentioned in his book, it could have been Sheldon.) he was brought up in the suburban Long Island town and Bar Mitzvahed. His parents were long-time members of a synagogue; they were a middle-class Jewish family. he was always a regular guy, wanting to be a ballplayer as he grew up. what was he doing meditating and chanting Buddhist mantras and prayers on a mountaintop in the himalayas?<br><br>he left home for college in the 1960s; went to Woodstock; marched in anti-war rallies in Washington; graduated Phi Beta Kappa from SUNY, Buffalo. he first discovered the ancient wisdom traditions as a college student at Suny, Baffalo, when he attended a Zen retreat in Rochester, New York in the late 1960s. as he travelled from London to France, across europe, to Greek, to Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and through the Khyber Pass on to India with the farthest route to Kathmandu wading his way through the rice paddies climbing the Kopan Hills where he came to meet his 1st Tibetan Lama, Lama Thubten Yeshe. Til date, Lama Surya Das doesn't consciously know what drew him to Nepal, except that he was following his heart as it was pulling him east.<br><br>Lama Surya Das is one of the foremost Western Buddhist meditation teachers and scholars, one of the main interpreters of Tibetan Buddhism in the West, and a leading spokesperson for the emerging American Buddhism. The Dalai Lama calls him "The Western Lama ".<br><br>Surya Das has been featured in numerous publications and major media, including including ABC, CNN, MSNBC, NPR, The Boston Globe, Boston Herald, New York Post, Long Island Newsday, Long Island Business Journal, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, The Jewish Free Press, New Age Journal, Tricycle Magazine, Yoga Journal, and has been the subject of a seven minute magazine story on CNN. One segment of the ABC-TV sitcom Dharma &amp; Greg was based on his life ("Leonard's Return" ).<br><br>Surya has spent thirty five years studying Zen, vipassana, yoga, and Tibetan Buddhism with the great masters of Asia, including the Dalai Lama's own teachers, and has twice completed the traditional three year meditation cloistered retreat at his teacher's Tibetan monastery. He is an authorized lama (priest and spiritual master teacher) in the Nyingmapa School of Tibetan Buddhism. He is the founder of the Dzogchen Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and its branch centers in New York City, New Jersey, California, Portland, and Texas. Founder of the Western Buddhist Teachers Network with the Dalai Lama, he is also active in interfaith dialogue and social activism and regularly organizes its international Buddhist Teachers Conferences.<br><br>Surya Das is a sought after speaker, and teaches, lectures, and conducts retreats around the world. Lama Surya Das is a published poet, translator, and chantmaster (see Chants to Awaken the Buddhist Heart CD, with Stephen Halpern). He is the author of many books, including Awakening the Buddha Within: Tibetan Wisdom for the Western World, Awakening the Buddhist Heart: Integrating Love, Meaning and Connection into Every Part of Your Life, and Awakening to the Sacred (the three books that comprise his bestselling Awakening Trilogy, the first trilogy of Buddhism for the West). His newest books are Letting Go of the Person You Used to Be: Lessons on Change, Loss and Spiritual Transformation and Natural Radiance.<br><br>Surya Das is a Contributing Editor to Body and Soul magazine, writes regularly for Tricyle and other magazines, and is a founder and board member of many Buddhist monasteries, centers and charitable projects in refugee camps in Asia. He writes a regular Ask The Lama column online at Beliefnet.com and is in demand as a speaker at conferences and symposia.<br><br>You can ask him questions via e-mail at surya@surya.org.<br>Lama Surya Das<br>Dzogchen center<br>P.O.

Buddhism on the other hand, is a profound philosophy that has developed a systematic method of shaping and developing the heart and mind: a method of awakening the Buddha within.<br><br>the problem is that most of us are sleeping Buddhas. to reach enlightenment, our only task is to awaken to who and what we really are - to become fully awake and conscious in the most profound sense of the word. "when I am enlightened, all are enlightened," Buddha said. help yourself and you help the entire world.<br><br>awaken from what? awaken from the dreams of delusions, confusion, sufferings; awake to all that you are and all you can be. awaken to reality, to truth, to things just as they are.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.surya.org/images/cert_english.gif"><br><br><br><img src="http://www.surya.org/images/cert_tibetan.gif"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lama Surya Das' own training is as a Tibetan Lama. his lineage is called the Rime or nonsectarian practicing lineage of Tibet. his personal teachers came from all four of the major schools of Tibetan Buddhism (Nyingma, Saka, Kagyu and Gelug). so a nonsectarian approach resonates with life experience as well as understanding of contemporary Dharma. his root gurus were manly Nyingma-Kagyu; that's where his greatest devotion lies. Lama Surya Das' spiritual heritage is Dzogchen - consummate practice or secret teachings of Tibet. his masters called Dzogchen self-secret, meaning that the truth may be hidden but it is always there for those ready to perceive it.<br><br>Dzogchen is a tradition that believes one can become enlightened within one lifetime - even within a decade. the direct path of Dzogchen was first practiced and taught in Tibet by Padma Sambhava 1300years ago (actually it's much older than that).<br><br>"don't follow past thoughts, don't anticipate the future, and don't follow illusory thoughts that arise in the present; but turning within, observe your own true nature and maintain awareness of your natural mind just as it is, beyond the conceptual limitations of past,  present  and future."<br><br>Dzogchen is a naked awareness practice. it doesn't depend on cultural forms. nowness - awareness - is the true Buddha. it is particularly meaningful for spiritual living and conscious dying.<br><br>"no one can die fearlessly and in complete security until they have truly realised the nature of mind. for only this realisation, deepened over years of sustained practice, can keep the mind stable during the molten chaos of the process of death............."<br>- Contemporary Tibetan teacher, Sogyal Rinpoche (The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lighting a candle is just a symbolic, ritualised way of offering light in the darkness. the candle symbolises the inner light and luminous wisdom that guides each of us through the darkness of ignorance and confusions. the candle's shinning flame is an outer reminder of inner luminosity and clarity - the living spiritual flame burning within....<br><br>total awareness is perfect enligtenment. enlightenment means an end to directionless wandering through the dreamlike passageways of life and death. waking up your inner Buddha and staying awake requires extraordinary self knowledge and presence of mind. it means paying close attention to how you think and how you act, and it means making an ongoing commitment to searching inward for answers. INWARD. deeper. beneath the surface of things. not just inside yourself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just like everyone does, this isn't how we have been conditioned to think. we keep looking outwards outside for answers. we look for lovers friends parents authorities and even children to answer need that they can't possibly fulfill. we have fantasies about career romance friendship and intimacy. we are so full of fantasies or ideals about the past present and future. often we don't want to let go of them because we fear that doing so means giving up on life. but that's not how it works. in truth, UNREALISTIC expectations (as such) tarnish our appreciation of life and weigh down the buoyancy of the present moment.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we take this kind of logic even further when we reduce life to an ongoing competition. trained and conditioned to believe that life is about achievement about winning losing and self assertion, we put much of our energy into momentary solutuions. it's no wonder so many of us feel alienated, alone, exhuasted, cynical and disheartened.<br><br>Buddhism turns these attitudes about winning and achieving upside down and inside out. Buddhist emphasis is not on new ways to conquer outer space, cyberspace. the wisdom traditions tell us that we can afford to slow down, take a breather and turn inward. to master ourselves is to arrive home at the center of being - the universal mandala. what we seek, we already are. everything is available in the natural state, so why should we look anywhere else?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>intrinsic awareness is the common denominator of all sentient beings. conscious living, contemplative self-awareness is the means to becoming all that we are. awareness is curative. knowing ourselves and learning to let go is the method, the most skillful means. spirituality is a matter of self-discovery, rather than of becoming something else.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the Buddha was an actual historical person. although he is among the leaders of the world's great religions, he did not claim that he was in any way divine or otherworldly. Buddhism teaches that the Buddha was born a man, not a god. because of his inquiry into the nature of reality, of self and the world, he achieved enlightenment. this enlightenment did not come about through the intervention of outside, mystical or otherworldly forces.<br><br>the Buddha Way is the way of clear-seeing rationality; it is the way of reality; it is the way of critical examination and sustained inquiry into the nature of life. the Buddha himself taught that blind faith and devotion alone do not lead to freedom and enlightenment, useful as they might be at a certain stage.<br><br></div>
