            <div class='col-md body'>meditation is a matter of focusing and calming the mind and later develops much more into panoramic awareness.<br><br>begin by breathing in through the nose, concentrating on the feeling sensation of air coming in through the nostrils; then breathing out through the nostrils - again while concentrating on the feeling sensation of air going out of the nostrils.<br><br>simply observe breathing and focus on nothing else....<br><br>whatever happens - people moving, mosquitos buzzing, radio blarring......, focus on nothing else.<br><br>if you have a physical sensation - cramped foot, an itch on your shoulder, just try to let it go and focus on the breathing.<br><br>if you have a thought, a memory, a yearning, use your breath to give your mind a gentle tug back...... and continue to focus on your breathing.<br><br>it sounds so simple but as we try to do this, we begin to notice how unruly our minds are and how difficult it is to focus on only one thing. however, with effort, mindfulness and concentration, meditation will work for even the most unruly mind.<br><br></div>
