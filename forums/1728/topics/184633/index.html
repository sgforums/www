            <div class='col-md body'>was reading Commentary on "A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment"<br>Khunu Lama Rinpoche.<br><br><blockquote>One thing that really helps us complete these two collections is the ability to foresee the future; therefore, we should try to acquire clairvoyance. Without it, we are like a baby bird whose wings are undeveloped and has not yet grown feathers and remains stuck in its nest, unable to fly. Without clairvoyance, we cannot work for other sentient beings.<br><br>36-37. The person who has achieved the psychic power to foresee the future can create more merit in a day than a person without this ability can create in a hundred years. Therefore, to complete the collections of merit and transcendent wisdom quickly, it is necessary to acquire the psychic power to see past, present and future.<br><br>38. In order to do this, it is necessary to achieve single-pointed concentration [Skt: samadhi; Tib: ting-nge-dzin]. For this, we must understand the details of the method of attaining samadhi, such as the nine stages, the six powers and the four mental engagements.5<br>39. In order to practice samadhi meditation properly, we must ensure that the conditions are perfect. If they are not, then even though we try practicing it hard for even a thousand years, weÂ’ll never achieve it. Therefore, we should find a perfect environment, remain quiet and avoid having to do work such as healing the ill and making astrological predictionsÂ—any activity that keeps us busy.<br><br>40. The way to meditate to attain single-pointed concentration is to focus our mind on a virtuous object, such as an image of the Buddha. We visualize such an image in front of us and simply concentrate on that. As we focus our mind on the object again and again, weÂ’ll be able to hold it for increasingly greater periods of time, and through the continuity of such practice will eventually attain calm abiding [Skt: shamatha; Tib: shi-nÃ©] and single-pointed concentration. Thus we will gain Â“higher seeingÂ” [Tib: ngÃ¶n-she], the psychic power to see the future and so forth.<br><br>41-43. But that is not the point. Next we have to practice penetrative insight [Skt: vipashyana; Tib: lhag-tong]. Without it, our samadhi cannot remove our delusions. In order to eradicate our two levels of obscurationÂ—the obscurations of delusion [Skt: kleshavarana; Tib: nyÃ¶n-drib] and the obscurations to knowledge, or omniscience [Skt: jneyavarana; Tib: she-drib]Â—we must achieve the wisdom realizing the non-self-existence of the I. Doing so also depends upon achieving method, such as compassion and so forth. ItÂ’s a mistake to practice only wisdom and not method. This can lead us to fall into individual liberation, or lower nirvana. Similarly, practicing only method and not wisdom is also a mistake and causes us to remain in samsara.<br><br></blockquote>and also been wondering if there's a good fortune teller who can see past lifes? feel like wanting to try the method as quoted.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

I have never heard of any astrological prediction on past life either...<br><br>Khunu Lama Rinpoche did not mention about astrological prediction on past life, he said, if you are doing meditation, AVOID doing astrological prediction, and do it in a secluded and quiet place...<br><br>Anyway, if you want to see past life, dont need to rely on books... the best way is to SEE for yourself... even if you make prediction using book, it is still doubtable, it may not be 100% accurate. If you see for yourself, it is doubtless! You don't doubt you drank coffee this morning, you don't doubt you ate dinner just now. Meditation is able to access memories with even greater clarity than as mentioned. But of course, we shldnt practise meditation just for the purpose of retrieving memories, and even if we remember past life, Thusness have warned, many will not be able to understand the full meaning of it, and cope with it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have come across few people could tell your past lives by just focussing on your auras or i don't know what they call it. but franky i'm sceptical about this, i mean truthfully. untill i experience it personally myself, will i only know who is more true. to see it for yourself is more worth and accurate than by other people seeing for you. its good to have an open mind all the time without expectations and without clinging onto anything.<br><br>about people predicting your future lives is like you lose control of your own destiny. it becomes self-prophesized life when it actually may not 100% happen, but you think and cling on too much to it that it becomes true.<br><br>perhaps i might not even be able to understand the meaning if one day i manage to meditate and travel back in time recalling past events.... i don't know....<br><br>my purpose of meditation is mainly to purify my mind and reach a higher state of awareness and in luminosity of being. whether i'll have clairvoyance or not or able to go back to past lives or not, i just take it a step at a time and if they come, i'll accept them just as they are.<br><br></div>

If they are not, then even though we try practicing it hard for even a thousand years, weÂ’ll never achieve it. Therefore, we should find a perfect environment, remain quiet and avoid having to do work such as healing the ill and making astrological predictionsÂ—any activity that keeps us busy. </blockquote>so, 30 min a day or a quiet room might not work so easily.  one even have to stop working and keep away from activities such as tv, internet, radio, newspaper etcs. Some thing like 'da fo-qi' (7 days Buddha recitation retreat), but a lot more than 7 days.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>
