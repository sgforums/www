At one time the Buddha was in Bamboo-Grove Park in the city of Rajaghira. Accompanying Him were five hundred leading monks. Many of the monks are afflicted with malignancies. They were emaciated and suffering in pain and agony for days and nights. Venerable Ananda observed this situation and went to seek out the Buddha. After prostrating before the BuddhaÂ’s feet, Ananda stood up and spoke, Â“World-Honored One, many monks now residing in Rajaghira are afflicted with malignancies. They are emaciated and suffering in pain and agony all day and all night. World-Honored One, how can they be helped?<br><br>At that time, the Buddha spoke to Ananda, Â“Listen to this Cancer-Healing Sutra. Read it, memorize it, recite it and propagate it far and wide. There will be a healing of cancers, including those caused by wind, heat, and yin elements, combinations of these three elements, and healing of cancers found in blood, abdomen, nose, teeth, tongue, eyes, ears, head, limbs, spine, rectum, and joints. All these cancers will dry up, fall off, and be eradicated. Healing will occur undoubtedly. Thus, read and uphold this spiritual mantra. This is the mantra:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Da-Zhi-ta, E-lan-di, E-lan-mi,<br><br>Shi-li-bei, Shi-li-Shi-li, Mo-jie-shi-Zhi,<br><br>San-po-ba-dou, Suo-ha. </span><br><br>Ananda, north from here is a huge snowy mountain where the great Brahman tree known as Hard-to-Conquer grows. The tree has three kinds of flowers. The first is New Growth, the second Maturity, and the third Dry and Withered. Like the flowers that dry and wither, and fall off, so too will be the fate of cancers suffered by our monks. There will be no more bleeding and no more pus formation. Pain will be uprooted, and the cancer will dry up.<br><br><strong>Furthermore, those who frequently chant this sutra will gain the knowledge of recollecting their past seven lives</strong>. Such is the accomplishment of the mantra, svaha. This is another mantra:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Da-zhi-ta,<br><br>Zhan-mi-zhan-mi,<br><br>She-zhan-ni, She-mo-ni,<br><br>She-zhan-ni, So-ha. </span><br><br>On hearing this dharma, Venerable Ananda and the entire assembly was extremely happy. They faithfully accepted and respectfully practised it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet An Eternal Now &amp; All,<br><br>Well I would like to give my last piece pertaining to the previous topic that others bring up as i feel a need to bring your attention to these. An Eternal Now, thanks for your co-operation, it will be greatly appreciated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I do not encourage others on keeping child spirits or procuring child spirit, using them to increase own intuition &amp; so on, Borrowed Power is never True Power. I detest people who make use of child spirits for their own temporary personal gains &amp; means. Why so? Its at the expense of these poor souls that have failed to come to this Earthly plane, unscrupulously retain them in this plane using spells of darker means so that they can be use to aid their owner to fulfill their selfish desires. Whether it incurring Merits or creating more Bad Karma, its very subjective, its very individual, your own free will. I do not seek to impose my perspectives or experiences on others as sooner or later they will have their own perspective of them. What you borrowed will have to be returned in a way or another with interest, the only issue is just the time. Thats the Universal Law.<br><br>For those who had abortion, its already seriously wrong, you have already incurred Negative Karma, you have deprived a soul's chance to be born into this Earthly Plane. Do you think you have the right to seek forgiveness from these Souls? You can try to irregardless whether to have a peace of mind, fear of retribution or simply to stop negative events that are occurring in your live. whichever it may be, it doesn't mean by engaging a "Master" to create an abode to house these little poor soul &amp; keep them will atone your sins. Yes, its possible by doing these for them, they may have a chance to reborn to this world again however only if its done by a Reliable "Master", whether they will be able to reborn again or not you still have the Bad Karma, its not as simple as 1-1=0. You are only advisable to do so if you are their parent, its your affinity &amp; fate that these souls can be your child in this life however perhaps due to unforseen circumstances, you deprived them of this chance, a majority of these souls have resentments, grievances &amp; hatred, many will become vicious &amp; create Havoc in their supposedly parent's lives. With these resentments, grievances, hatred in them they can never be reborn or reincarnate. The best you can do is get a Reliable "Master" to perform a Rite to redress their grievances, releasing their resentments &amp; hatred so they may move on to the other Realm in peace, you should not have expectation that they will forgive you.

An Eternal Now, thanks for your co-operation, it will be greatly appreciated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I do not encourage others on keeping child spirits or procuring child spirit, using them to increase own intuition &amp; so on, Borrowed Power is never True Power. I detest people who make use of child spirits for their own temporary personal gains &amp; means. Why so? Its at the expense of these poor souls that have failed to come to this Earthly plane, unscrupulously retain them in this plane using spells of darker means so that they can be use to aid their owner to fulfill their selfish desires. Whether it incurring Merits or creating more Bad Karma, its very subjective, its very individual, your own free will. I do not seek to impose my perspectives or experiences on others as sooner or later they will have their own perspective of them. What you borrowed will have to be returned in a way or another with interest, the only issue is just the time. Thats the Universal Law.<br><br>For those who had abortion, its already seriously wrong, you have already incurred Negative Karma, you have deprived a soul's chance to be born into this Earthly Plane. Do you think you have the right to seek forgiveness from these Souls? You can try to irregardless whether to have a peace of mind, fear of retribution or simply to stop negative events that are occurring in your live. whichever it may be, it doesn't mean by engaging a "Master" to create an abode to house these little poor soul &amp; keep them will atone your sins. Yes, its possible by doing these for them, they may have a chance to reborn to this world again however only if its done by a Reliable "Master", whether they will be able to reborn again or not you still have the Bad Karma, its not as simple as 1-1=0. You are only advisable to do so if you are their parent, its your affinity &amp; fate that these souls can be your child in this life however perhaps due to unforseen circumstances, you deprived them of this chance, a majority of these souls have resentments, grievances &amp; hatred, many will become vicious &amp; create Havoc in their supposedly parent's lives. With these resentments, grievances, hatred in them they can never be reborn or reincarnate. The best you can do is get a Reliable "Master" to perform a Rite to redress their grievances, releasing their resentments &amp; hatred so they may move on to the other Realm in peace, you should not have expectation that they will forgive you. Things would not turn out to be this way if you never done an abortion or had miscarriage due to negligence in the first place. Its the Cause &amp; Effect of your own doings.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>[b]The Power of Now; Eckhart Tolle</strong>, Excerpt:<br><br>All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry - all forms of fear - are caused by to much future, not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, not enough presence.<br><br>Most people find it difficulty to believe that a state of consciousness totally free of all negativity is possible. And yet this is the liberated state to which all spiritual teachings point. It is the promise of salvation, not in an illusory future by right here and now.<br><br>You may find it hard to recognise that time is the cause of your suffering or your problems. You believe that they are caused by specific situations in your life, and seen from a conventional viewpoint, this is true. But until you have dealt with the basic problem-making dysfunction of the mind - its attachment to past and future and denial of the Now - problems are actually interchangeable. If all your problems or perceived causes of suffering or unhappiness were miraculously removed for your today, but you had not become more present, more conscious, you would soon find yourself with a similar set of problems or causes of suffering, like a shadow that follows you wherever you go. Ultimately, there is only one problem: the time-bound mind itself.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I cannot believe that I could ever reach a point where I am complete free of my problems.</span><br><br>You are right. You can never <span style="font-style: italic;">reach</span> that point because you <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> at that point <span style="font-style: italic;">now</span>.<br><br>There is no salvation in time. You cannot be free in the future. Presence is the key to freedom, so you can only be free now.<br><br><strong>Finding The Life Underneath Your Life Situation</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I don't see how I can be free now. As it happens, I am extremely unhappy with my life at the moment. This is a fact, and I would be deluding myself if I tried to convince myself that all is well when it definitely isn't. To me the present moment is very unhappy; it is not liberating at all. What keeps me going is the hope or possibility of some improvement in the future.</span><br><br>You think that your attention is in the present moment when it's actually taken up completely by time. You cannot be both unhappy <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> fully present in the Now.<br><br>What you refer to as your "life" should be more accurately be called your "life situation." It is psychological time: past and future. Certain things in the past didn't go the way you wanted them to go. You are still resisting what happened in the past, and now you are resisting the <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>. Hope is what keeps you going, but hope keeps you focused on the future, and this continued focus perpetuates your denial of the Now and therefore your unhappiness.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It is true that my present life situation is the result of things that happened in the past, but it is still my present situation, and being stuck in it is what makes me unhappy.</span><br><br>Forget about your life situation for a while and pay attention to your <span style="font-style: italic;">life</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What is the difference?</span><br><br>Your life situation exists in time.<br><br>Your life is now.<br>Your life situation is mind-stuff.<br>Your life is real.<br><br>Find the "narrow gate that leads to life." It is called the Now. Narrow your life down to this moment. Your life situation may be full of problems - most life situations are - but find out if you have any problem at this moment. Not tomorrow or in ten minutes, but now. Do you have a problem now?<br><br>When you are full of problems, there is no room for anything new to enter, no room for a solution. So whenever you can, make some room, create some space, so that you find the life underneath your life situation.<br><br>Use your senses fully. Be where you are. Look around. Just look, don't interpret. See the lights, shapes, colours, textures. Be aware of the silent presence of each thing. Be aware of the space that allows everything to be. Listen to the sounds; don't judge them. Listen to the silence underneath the sounds. Touch something - anything - and feel and acknowledge its Being. Observe the rhythm of your breathing; feel the air flowing in and out, feel the life energy inside your body. Allow everything to be, within and without. Allow the "isness" of all things. Move deeply into the Now.<br><br>You are leaving behind the deadening world of mental abstraction of time. You are getting out of the insane mind that is draining you of life energy, just as it is slowly poisoning and destroying the Earth. You are awakening out of the dream of time into the Present.<br><br>[Pause and meditate]<br><br><img src="http://home.wxs.nl/~brouw724/images/tolle2.jpg">[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>[b]All Problems Are Illusions Of The Mind</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It feels as if a heavy burden has been lifted. A sense of lightness. I feel clear... but my problems are still there waiting for me, aren't they? They haven't been solved. Am I not just temporarily evading them?</span><br><br>If you found yourself in paradise, it wouldn't be long before your mind would say "yes, but...."<br><br>Ultimately, this is not about solving your problems. It's about realizing that there <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> no problems. Only situations - to be dealt with now, or to be left alone and accepted as part of the "isness" of the present moment until they change or <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> be dealt with. Problems are mind-made and need time to survive. They cannot survive in the actuality of the Now.<br><br>Focus your attention on the Now and tell me what problem you have at this moment.<br><br>[Pause and meditate]<br><br>I am not getting any answer because it is impossible to have a problem when your attention is fully in the Now. A situation that needs to be either dealt with or accepted - yes. Why make it into a problem? Why make anything into a problem? Isn't lifechallenging enough as it is? What do you need problems for? The mind unconsciously loves problems because they give you an identity of sorts. This is normal, and it is insane. "Problem" means that you are dwelling on a situation mentally without there being a true intention or possibility of taking action now and that you are unconsciously making it part of your sense of self. You become so overwhelmed by your life situation that you lose your sense of life, of Being. Or you are carrying in your mind the insane burden of a hundred things that you will or may have to do in the future instead of focusing your attention on the one thing that you can do now.<br><br>When you create a problem, you create pain. All it takes is a simple choice, a simple decision: no matter what happens, I will create no more pain for myself. I will create no more problems. Although it is a simple choice, it is also very radical. You won' t make that choice unless you are truly fed up with suffering, unless you have truly had enough. And you won't be able to go through with it unless you access the power of the Now. If you create no more pain for yourself, then you create no more pain for others. You also no longer contaminate the beautiful Earth, your inner space, and the collective human psyche with the negativity of problem-making.<br><br>[Pause and meditate]<br><br>If you have ever been in a life-or-death emergency situation, you will know that it wasn't a problem. The mind didn't have time to fool around and make it into a problem. In a true emergency, the mind stops; you become totally present in the Now, and something infinitely more powerful takes over. This is why there are many reports of ordinary people suddenly becoming capable of incredibly courageous deeds. In any emergency, either you survive or you don't. Either way, it is not a problem.<br><br>Some people get angry when they hear me say that problems are illusions. I am threatening to take away their sense of who they are. They have invested much time in a false sense of self. For many years, they have unconsciously defined their whole identity in terms of' their problems or their suffering. Who would they be without it?<br><br>A great deal of what people say, think, or do is actually motivated by fear, which of course is always linked with having your focus on the future and being out of touch with the Now. As there are no problems in the Now, there is no fear either.<br><br>Should a situation arise that you need to deal with now, your action will be clear and incisive if it arises out of present-moment awareness. It is also more likely to be effective. It will not be a reaction coming from the past conditioning of your mind but an intuitive response to the situation. In other instances, when the time-bound mind would have reacted, you will find it more effective to do nothing - just stay centered in the Now.<br><br><strong>A Quantum Leap In The Evolution Of Consciousness</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I have had glimpses of this state of freedom from mind and time that you describe, but past and future are so overwhelmingly strong that I cannot keep them out for long.</span><br><br>The time-bound mode of consciousness is deeply embedded in the human psyche. But what we are doing here is part of a profound transformation that is taking place in the collective consciousness of the planet and beyond: the awakening of consciousness from the dream of matter, form, and separation. The ending of time. We are breaking mind patterns that have dominated human life for eons. Mind pat-terns that have created unimaginable suffering on a vast scale. I am not using the word evil. It is more helpful to call it unconsciousness or insanity.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This breaking-up of the old mode of consciousness or rather unconsciousness: is it something we have to do or will it happen anyway? I mean, is this change inevitable?</span><br><br>That's a question of perspective. The doing and the happening is in fact a single process; because you are one with the totality of consciousness, you cannot separate the two. But there is no absolute guarantee that humans will make it. The process isn't inevitable or automatic. Your cooperation is an essential part of it. However you look at it, it is a quantum leap in the evolution of consciousness, as well as our only chance of survival as a race.[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">[b]The Joy Of Being<br><br>To alert you that you have allowed yourself to be taken over by psychological time, you can use a simple criterion. Ask yourself: Is there joy, ease, and lightness in what I am doing? If there isn't, then time is covering up the present moment, and life is perceived as a burden or a struggle.<br><br>If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does not necessarily mean that you need to change what you are doing. It may be sufficient to change the how. "How" is always more important than "what." See if you can give much more attention to the doing than to the result that you want to achieve through it. Give your fullest attention to whatever the moment presents. This implies that you also completely accept what is, because you cannot give your full attention to something and at the same time resist it.<br><br>As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out of present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love - even the most simple action.<br><br>[Pause and meditate]<br><br>So do not be concerned with the fruit of your action - just give attention to the action itself. The fruit will come of its own accord. This is a powerful spiritual practice. In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bhagavad Gita</span>, one of the oldest and most beautiful spiritual teachings in existence, non-attachment to the fruit of your action is called Karma Yoga. It is described as the path of "consecrated action."<br><br>When the compulsive striving away from the Now ceases, the joy of Being flows into everything you do. The moment your attention turns to the Now, you feel a presence, a stillness, a peace. You no longer depend on the future for fulfillment and satisfaction - you don't look to it for salvation. Therefore, you are not attached to the results. Neither failure nor success has the power to change your inner state of Being. You have found the life underneath your life situation.<br><br>In the absence of psychological time, your sense of self is derived from Being, not from your personal past. Therefore, the psychological need to become anything other than who you are already is no longer there. In the world, on the level of your life situation, you may indeed become wealthy, knowledgeable, successful, free of this or that, but in the deeper dimension of Being you are complete and whole now.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In that state of wholeness, would we still be able or willing to pursue external goals?</span><br><br>Of course, but you will not have illusory expectations that anything or anybody in the future will save you or make you happy. As far as your life situation is concerned, there may be things to be attained or acquired. That's the world of form, of gain and loss. Yet on a deeper level you are already complete, and when you realize that, there is a playful, joyous energy behind what you do. Being free of psychological time, you no longer pursue your goals with grim determination, driven by fear, anger, discontent, or the need to become someone. Nor will you remain inactive through fear of failure, which to the egois loss of self. When your deeper sense of self is derived from Being, when you are free of "becoming" as a psychological need, neither your happiness nor your sense of self depends on the outcome, and so there is freedom from fear. You don't seek permanency where it cannot be found: in the world of form, of gain and loss, birth and death. You don't demand that situations, conditions, places, or people should make you happy, and then suffer when they don't live up to your expectations.<br><br>Everything is honored, but nothing matters. Forms are born and die, yet you are aware of the eternal underneath the forms. You know that "nothing real can be threatened."<br><br>When this is your state of Being, how can you not succeed? You have succeeded already.[/b][/quote]<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>Source: Page 50-58, The Power of Now</strong></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what u read and what you believe in have psychological effects. If you are influence by fortune-teller who tells you ur fortune and you believe in it, partially or fully, your mind can gravite towards it cos u keep or occasionally think about it.. achieving self-fulfilling prophecy..<br><br>For example, i did my own astrology chart and i had miscalculated my own birth chart and i had believed these moon signs etc describe me but after afew years, i discover my mistakes and the signs are different.. so it was actually another traits. some traits of the charts are quite different. So what am i now??<br><br>i wear purple shirt and i notice other people wearing purple shirt today. Sometime your mind have a tendecy to seek things out unknowingly.. though maybe if u haven't wear a purple shirt today, you couldn't be so aware that there are so many people whom wear purple shirt today.<br><br>I believe in karma and probably fortune-chart can tell you some traits and life.. karma caused by previous lifetimes. Nevertheless, never forget there is no such thing as permanent, things are ever-changing.. so we shldn't get too attached to what fortune-tellers are saying about.<br><br>anyway i saw from a website.. zi wei dou shu has 80-90% of accuracy.. and aso this depends on the skills of the fortune-tellers.. don't take things blindly,<br>investigate...<br></div>
