Even an arhant cannot completely see all their past lives - only a Buddha can.<br><br>And also - just because we are now very well, live a happy life, doesnt mean we did not do anything bad before. We should understand that rebirth is just like dreams appearing out of our alaya consciousness. Sometimes we have nightmares sometimes we have sweet dreams. Our karma stems not only from one or two lifetimes ago, but can also be thousands or even aeons of lifetimes ago. It is deep in our alaya consciousness. That is why it can be rather 'scary' for someone unenlightened like me. We can never be certain what's next!<br><br>Which is also why it is very important to liberate - at least to 'Enter the stream' (stream-enterers do not enter the 3 lower realms and is destined to attain Arhantship within 7 lifetimes) or enter the Path of Seeing (1st Bhumi Bodhisattva).</div>
