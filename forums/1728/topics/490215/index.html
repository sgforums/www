              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/10/how-david-hume-helped-me-solve-my-midlife-crisis/403195/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In a fascinating piece in this month’s issue of </span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: blue;">The Atlantic</span></em></a><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, </span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">UC
              Berkeley professor Alison Gopnik details her four-year journey out of a
              mid-life crisis via David Hume and Buddhism. The just-turned-50 Gopnik begins
              reading Buddhism, connects the religion’s ideas to those of the 18th century
              philosopher, and then launches an ambitious research project driven by the
              question of how Hume came up with his philosophy that was “so profoundly at
              odds with the Western philosophy and religion of his day.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Hume is most famous for his rejection of the idea of
              an inherent self. He also had gone through a psychological crisis. To help calm
              his nerves, he moved to a small town in France and finished what would become
              one of the most substantial works of Western philosophy — <em>A Treatise
              of Human Nature</em>. Relying on the hunch that Hume would have had to have
              known something about Buddhist philosophy in order to write <em>Treatise</em>,
              Gopnik digs through archives and travels to Europe to discover that the Jesuit
              priests in that provincial French town had indeed heard of Buddhism and
              possibly even had copies of certain Tibetan texts. Although she admits that she
              can’t be certain, she determines that “Hume could indeed have known about
              Buddhist philosophy” at the time he wrote <em>Treatise</em>.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #eb6005;">Finding direct links between Buddhism
              and Western philosophy is a difficult task, but they do play out in strange
              loops.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If true, this discovery would be remarkable because
              it’s widely assumed that Buddhism didn’t make it to the European continent
              until the 19th century. That said, Buddhism’s contributions to modern Western
              philosophy and religion </span><a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/logic-of-buddhist-philosophy/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">have often been downplayed</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">. Friedrich Nietzsche admired the religion’s complex
              morality while it’s been argued that </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bUa8ctgqeC8C"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Martin Heidegger may have been influenced by Zen texts</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">. Even </span><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1399616?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Arthur Schopenhauer</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> playfully called himself, at times, "a Buddhist."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Finding direct links between Buddhism and Western
              philosophy is a difficult task, but they do play out in strange loops. For
              example, in 1879 another 50-year-old was in the midst of a personal crisis —
              Leo Tolstoy. The Russian novelist began reading widely and grew to reject his
              literary success (</span><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/facing-death-with-tolstoy"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">he even called </span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: blue;">Anna Karenina</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> “an
              abomination”</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> ). He greatly admired
              Buddhist texts as well as the works of Schopenhauer and began writing </span><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/tolstoy/a-confession/"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Confession</span></em></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">,
              a short book premised on the question, “What is the meaning of life?” He
              developed meaning in his later years by embracing a hybrid Christianity — even
              synthesizing the Gospels with Zen-like clarity. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #eb6005;">[A]s the Buddha says, “All that we are
              is a result of all that we’ve thought.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tolstoy’s <em>The Gospel in Brief</em> would later
              have an immense influence on the 20th century philosopher </span><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9205.00033/abstract"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ludwig Wittgenstein,</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> who carried the book with him in the trenches during World War I.
              During that time, he began to write another extremely important book in Western
              thought — <em><a href="http://people.umass.edu/phil335-klement-2/tlp/tlp-ebook.pdf"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</span></a></em>.
              In short, the book argues that the world can be infinitely analyzed and broken
              into smaller parts to the point of losing perspective of any perceived whole;
              then at the end, Wittgenstein tells his readers that if they have understood
              him, they will understand what he has written is rubbish. Or, as the Buddha
              says, “All that we are is a result of all that we’ve thought.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The real takeaway from Gopnik’s <em>Atlantic </em>article
              is not that Hume relied on Buddhism to write <em>Treatise</em> so much as
              it suggests the implications of the opportunity that he may have had to access
              it. It is no less impossible that a 25-year-old Scot would encounter Tibetan
              thought in an obscure French village than it would have been for a 25-year-old
              Austrian to happen upon Tolstoy in the midst of a world war. We are always more
              connected than we’d like to believe. There’s even evidence that the early
              Church’s missions in China </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Meacham-t.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">attempted to blend Buddhism philosophy with Christian
              doctrine</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As Christian historian Diarmaid MacCulloch notes in
              his masterwork <em>Christianity, The First Three Thousand Years</em>, seventh
              century missionary Bishop Alopen wrote a Christian sutra that seems to be “a real
              attempt to suggest that the teachings of Buddhism are in a literal sense
              inspired by the Holy Spirit.” What if some of that thought trickled back into
              the European continent? Drawing parallels between Buddhism and Western
              philosophy does not diminish any one writer’s contributions to our culture;
              rather it opens us up to understanding who we think we are beyond the arbitrary
              distinctions of East and West.</span></p>
