              <p>Indeed not easy to become vegetarian. The writer became vegetarian based on hearsay and reading instead of the enlightenment understanding such as Zen Master <span id="main" style="visibility: visible;"><span id="search" style="visibility: visible;"><em>å®�å¿—å…¬ . Gradually the writer will enjoy the benefit and blessing thereon :)<br></em></span></span></p>

              <p>EATING FLESH: PROS AND CONS<br>By the Venerable Master Hsuan Hua</p>
              <p>http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/BuddhismAnimalsVegetarian/eatingflesh.html<br>Just now, someone asked me, "Is it good to eat meat or not good to eat meat?" I said, "There is good in eating meat and there is not good in eating meat." What's the good about eating meat? Well, "It's delicious and nutritious, too," you think. And why is meatâ€‘eating not good? The worst thing about it that's not good is that after you digest it, it smells worse than any other type of food, It makes your body stink.</p>
              <p>Second is that you also form a company with whatever kind of meat you eat. Cows set up condi­tions with cows, pigs congregate with other pigs â€‘â€‘you form a big corporation with whatever type of animal you eat. For example, if you eat a lot of pork, you'll become tied up into a company of pigs. So, you figure it out: in the future will you or will you not have to become a pig? The same applies to cows, chickens, sheep, fish and so forth, You get involved in the karma that those creatures create when you eat their meat; you get all mixed up together with them. The karma you create as a person gets all mixed up with the pig, and the karma the pig creates gets all mixed up with you. In a few years you have a big corporation on your hands. And so obviously the next step that follows is that you will eventually become the type of animal whose flesh you were most fond of eating. If you ate pig meat, you will have to become a pig. If you ate cow meat, you will have to become a cow. And it won't be a simple matter of replacing the meat you ate. True enough, you will have to pay that back, but not as a personâ€‘â€‘you yourself will have to become a cow, you'll have to be a pig, in order to pay back those debts.</p>

                  latest indications we have suggest that Einstein was vegetarian only for the
                  last year or so of his life, though he appears to have supported the idea for
                  many years before practising it himself.</span></p>

                  vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian

                  most beneficially influence the lot of mankind." Translation of letter to

              <p>The worst thing about it that's not good is
              that after you digest it, it smells worse than any other type of
              food, It makes your body stink.</p>
              <p>Second is that you also form a company with whatever kind of
              meat you eat. Cows set up condi­tions with cows, pigs congregate
              with other pigs â€‘â€‘you form a big corporation with whatever type of
              animal you eat. For example, if you eat a lot of pork, you'll
              become tied up into a company of pigs. So, you figure it out: in
              the future will you or will you not have to become a pig? The same
              applies to cows, chickens, sheep, fish and so forth, You get
              involved in the karma that those creatures create when you eat
              their meat; you get all mixed up together with them. The karma you
              create as a person gets all mixed up with the pig, and the karma
              the pig creates gets all mixed up with you. In a few years you have
              a big corporation on your hands. And so obviously the next step
              that follows is that you will eventually become the type of animal
              whose flesh you were most fond of eating. If you ate pig meat, you
              will have to become a pig. If you ate cow meat, you will have to
              become a cow. And it won't be a simple matter of replacing the meat
              you ate. True enough, you will have to pay that back, but not as a
              personâ€‘â€‘you yourself will have to become a cow, you'll have to be a
              pig, in order to pay back those debts.</p>

              <p>What in the name of cheese is he saying? Does that mean if he eats lots of vegetables he would become one as well? Do lions become the very prey they eat?</p>
