              <p>Awakening is the word translated as enlightenment, but imo best left simply as awakening.</p>
              <p>Awakening is not nirvana, but nirvana can only be brought about through awakening.</p>

              <p>yes AEN, i meant during <strong>before </strong>Buddha was around. no arahants yet. but many very good meditators. they didn't did it by themselves.</p>
              <p>and,
               that's also what i'm rejecting, that it's not easy to do it solo 
              without any reference from Buddha's texts. if they read Buddha's texts, 
              then we cannot say they do it by themselve.</p>

              <p>i see it this way. there are two parts of it.</p>
              <p>Enlightment or "knowing" is one part, while craving
                                          and clinging habits is the other part that also need to be remove not really in one shot, but some what gradually. hence these slowly removal of habits can say got different percentages/"levels".</p>
              <p>even Hui Neng after his "enlightenment", he had to stay in some bandits lair to do his practice. we think enlightened already no need to practice what u learnt and commit more karma?</p>

              <p>what do you mean i'm still 'unable to realise the difference'. what..i just said i have read Eckhart Tolle's book and buddhist books, and u say that? why do you assume so much. Lol.</p>
              <p>Who is this fellow Thusness/PasserBy. this same moderator in this forum? His so-called "7 stages of enlightenment" are just his accounts of 'experiential realisation'(if i may put it that way), that's all. doesn't mean u ask people to read them and people will naturally understand his experience or what he had gone through. i read it and it doesn't mean anything to me.</p>

              <p><em>by the way, since u said there are certain aspects which are
                                              different, why r u telling me now to go read that book? why r u
                                              leading people onto this path taught by all these spiritual
                                              teachers whose teachings may not be buddhist-ic in
                                              nature? </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me, the experiences they present are very important, even though they do not have the right view. The realizations they had, the experiences they had, are very precious.</p>
              <p>Just that once you get that realization and experience, you must have right view in order to move forward, to progress.</p>
              <p>That is why their books are still valuable because they point to true, valuable, and precious realizations and experiences. Just that they are not ultimate.</p>
              <p>What Eckhart Tolle leads to is a direct realization of mind's unconditioned luminous clarity, so called the I AMness. There is a lack of understanding about anatta and emptiness.</p>

              <p>To be able to 'see the difference' between the teachings of some teachers and what the Buddha taught requires a practitioner to realise the essense of both teachings. </p>
              <p>This is not achieved through conceptualising the meaning of what we read, but through habituating the mind to release the incessant flow of thoughts, so that the mind is able to realise Itself. </p>
              <p>Although some of the teachings are not labelled 'Buddhism', essentially they lead to the same realisations that come along with Buddhist meditation, in particular vipassana. What is important, as the moderators here have already mentioned, is establishing the Right View and not hold any experiences as ultimate.</p>
              <p>Right View points to different aspect of our experiences depending on the depth which one is able to cut through delusions. The mind is multi-faceted, and with the different obsessions that are habituated it is not meaningful to assume that all delusions are wholly removed when Right View is established. There is, at some point, the realisation that Right View is the view and embodiment of Anatta, and that the Eightfold Path really only just started with this view of Anatta. When a practitioner starts out, taking on this view is mostly conceptual, based on what we read and understand about Anatta, and this is usually tainted with our opinions. With realisation, there is a radical shift in perception which is no longer conceptual, and previously meaningless phrases like 'who is it that is dragging this corpse along?' can be understood meaningfully. </p>
              <p>Are there levels of awakening? I would say there are, while there are not; it all depends on which angle one is looking. However what is true is all sentient beings already Are Buddha nature, and perfect in this imperfect world whether we realise it or not.</p>
