              <p>to me, refuge is not just the apparent taking refuge/believe in the image of Buddha, Dharma and sangha.</p>
              <p>i like Master Hui Neng taught that refuge in Buddha represent Awarenessè§‰, Dharma represent Properæ­£, and Sangha represent Purityå‡€. so its the quality that one take refuge in. all and all it's a form of practice in itself.  if a person without knowing Buddhism yet can meet the requirement of the Noble eightfold path, which is not so easy, can also attain Enlightenment. i think that person is a Buddha already.</p>

              <p>why  dont have Arahants during Buddha's time? got what...the direct disciples of Buddha when they convened at a council meeting or something, when Ananda attained Arahant-hood when he was about to lie down on bed in the wee hours. He was the only 1 left to attain Arahant-hood and the rest of the people at the meeting had already all attained Arahant-hood. </p>
              <p>What u talking about "u think that person is a buddha already." U're going against the authenticity of Pali Canon, cos it says theres only 1 fully-enlightened Buddha during at any 1 era. duh.</p>
              <p>Just like all these angmoh 'teachers' this AEN always mentions about, and the people these teachers lead them to, they all may not be buddhists who have taken refuge but are interested in the path of spirituality. who is to deny they cannot make it to attain Anagami or even Arahanthood? </p>

              <p>Read the followings.</p>
              <p>Therefore one must begin by becoming aware of the qualities of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, and by understanding exactly what they are. By means of that, one will give rise to faith in them. One will be able to feel one's faith and go for refuge to them. <span style="color: #ff0000;">It is necessary that this occur as a basis for the practice</span>, but beyond that, the going for refuge must be something that is continually practiced and renewed in one's daily practice; this is extremely important.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The reason why the taking of refuge is so important is that at present we are immersed in samsara, which is an experience of suffering, an experience of impermanence, and an experience of constant change. If we wish to free ourselves from this, we cannot do so simply by ourselves. However, we can travel the path to liberation by relying upon the compassion of the Three Jewels. That is why it is necessary to go to them for refuge.</span></p>
              <p>As ordinary beings, we do not know or understand the methods that we must engage in to obtain Buddhahood. For that reason we need a guide or a companion on the path to Buddhahood. This is something that can be explained by an example that is easily understood by Westerners. If one wanted to get from here to New York City and one tried to walk, one would either not get there at all or it would take a very long time. However, if one were to stand by the side of the road and put out one's thumb, then eventually some good minded individual would stop their car; one could get in and one would reach the city. It's the same way if we want to reach the City of Enlightenment. We have to hitchhike or take refuge in the Three Jewels</p>
              <p> The Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha are beings or things that are separate from us, distinct from us. We are individuals and we are quite a distance from them. One might ask how it is possible to establish a connection. First of all, all phenomena arise through interdependence through the actions of causes and conditions. In the case of the path, what must occur is the coming together of the conditions of one's own faith, and the compassion and blessing of the Three Jewels. If these two come together, then the connection is established and one can travel the path.</p>
              <p>The presence of the faith on one's own part and the compassion and qualities on the part of the Three Jewels is sufficient to create the connection. It does not depend on distance, like a television station that is sending out a TV program. If one has the box and the set, one can see the program. If the TV station isn't sending it out, then even if one has the TV set one can't see it. If the TV station is sending it out but one does not have the TV set, then one also can't see it . But in either case, if these two things are present, then regardless of the distance that separates the two, although there is no direct physical connection that one can see, the TV program still arrives somehow. In the same way, the actual blessing and compassion of the Three Jewels can be received, and one can enter through one's faith.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Another example is that the compassion, blessing, and power of the Three Jewels is like a hook, and one's faith is like a ring. If these two are present and connect one with another, then the hook will lead the ring and oneself, held by the ring, from suffering to happiness and finally to liberation</span></p>

              <p>Their teachings are helpful, but they are not Buddhism. Even so, Buddhists can read their stuff, just that they must be able to differentiate between dharma and advaita vedanta.

              <p>Eckhart Tolle is Stage 1 and 2 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a>, Jeff Foster is Stage 4.</p>
              <p>Anatta is Stage 5, Dependent Origination and Emptiness is Stage 6.</p>
              <p>I do not consider someone as even a Sotapanna until they have at least Stage 5 realization.</p>
              <p>The realization of the twofold emptinesses (emptiness of self/anatta, plus the emptiness of objects) is the attainment of 1st bhumi bodhisattva.</p>

              <p>To put things simple,with no playing with words and quoting long articles,There is only one enlightenment with all the defilments removed.</p>
              <p>To say how many level of enlightenment are they is quite misleading instead its will be better to put "stages towards enlightenment".Depending on the time and personally of people thus there are prefectly self enlighten buddhas(who are the first to rediscover the truth in a period where no similar teaching is known) slient buddhas(who rediscover the themselves but dont really teach due to the limitations of their enviroment and their ability) arahants(who will only arise when a samasambuddha arises to teach them).</p>
              <p>In terms of enlightenment they are all they same but they arise at different period of time and with different qualities other than having their defilements removed.</p>
              <p>To take refuge is only a symbol that one believe in the teachings,however they are people who have taken refuge after arahantship depending on their understanding/willingness to take up and aknowledge the buddhas teachings.Thus its a issue of whether you are willing to practice according rather than to take refuge but not doing much.</p>
              <p>Pure abodes are only for people who have understand the 5 aggregates in terms of the 3 characteristiscs,those who have power and deep meditation ability will go somewhere else not here,becos this realm is a realm base on understanding of the dharma not just diligent practice.The doctrine is not contradict in anyway becos these people still have certain residue in them and unfortunately before they can fully reach enlightenment their life span ended thus they will carry on with rebirth to a place where they will finish off their remaining dusts and gain enlightenment there.</p>

              <p>A stream enterer has entered into the irreversible conveyer belt towards Nirvana, has entered the noble path towards Nirvana. Precisely because of this, it is called 'stream entry'.</p>

              <p>First and second is synonymous.</p>
              <p>However!</p>
              <p>Awakening is the word used by Buddha.</p>
              <p>The word 'enlightenment' does not exist in Buddha's dictionary, nor the language of their times, as far as I understand... or even if it does, it is not the word used by Buddha.</p>
              <p>'Enlightenment' is a western word, and somehow in the western world they have used 'awakening' and 'enlightenment' synonymously.</p>
              <p>I prefer awakening because the word captures the essence more: because precisely, awakening means awakening from our delusions into the true nature of reality: the no-self, the dependent origination, impermanent, and unsatisfactory nature of all experiences.</p>
              <p>It is this awakening, that ends all our ignorance, delusion, craving, clinging, and thus allow us to experience Nirvana.</p>
              <p>What is Nirvana? It means cessation... cessation of what? There are two levels of nirvana.</p>
              <p>Nirvana with remainder means the cessation of ignorance (such as the delusion that there is a self), delusion, mental afflictions like craving, aversion/anger, fear, and so on, and basically all mental sufferings. An Arhat who is still living and have not experienced the death of the body, experiences 'nirvana with remainder' - the remainder being the bodily's sensory functions, the experience of the senses, are still fully intact.</p>
              <p>Nirvana without remainder is that an Arhat experiences the cessation of all bodily and mental formation, and owing to the fact that no more karmas are being produced which could lead to further rebirth in samsara, there is no more further samsaric births for the arahat - therefore it is 'nirvana without remainder'.</p>
              <p>In short, Nirvana is the cessation of suffering, and awakening results in the experience of Nirvana.</p>

              <p>Some just attain enlightenment upon hearing Buddha's speech... only after that did they decide to follow the Buddha's teachings, take refuge, become a monk or whatever... because of course if you hear a teaching as good as Buddha and truly benefit from it, there is no reason you will not become a Buddha's follower.</p>
              <p>For us, if we do not have such great calibres like the ancient arhants, we have to sincerely take refuge first, and vow to practice hard to attain enlightenment.</p>

              <p>Let's see if I can answer this correctly:</p>
              <p>Of course they can be stream-enterer. Enlightenment is enlightenment. The Buddha didn't *create* nor patent enlightenment, he just pointed out the truths and the way to realizing those truths. No one can take your realizations nor attainments away. Unlike certain religions, there's no guy guarding the gates to the pure abodes who's refusing you entry just because you never got to listen to a sutra or meditated. Stream-enterer is just a <strong>term</strong>. If you can achieve it without any help at all from ancient/modern texts and teaching, power to you.</p>
              <p>Realization is realization. The truth doesn't belong to any entity or organisation!</p>
