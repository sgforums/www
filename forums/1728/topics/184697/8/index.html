If they always continue to make offerings with scented flowers, drinks, food, clothing, embroidered scrolls, money, jewels, etc, such women will never be reborn as females for thousands of kalpas after this life.<br><br>If they desire through compassion to be reborn as females again in order to convert sentient beings, they may do so. (if they do not wish to be reborn as females, then through the Infinite powers of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, for millions of kalpas, they will not be reborn as females.)<br><br>Again, Universal Bodhisattva, if there are females who are born with ugly faces or ill health they may simply pay homage to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva by looking at his image for a short time with full respect, and such females will be reborn with beautiful faces for millions of kalpas in the future. If such ugly females do wish to be reborn as females again through their merit of paying homage to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva earnestly, they will receive the happiness of being reborn as queens of countries or daughters of nobles for millions of rebirths and they will have beautiful appearances.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If people can chant the Ksitigarbha Sutra all the above ten "fasting" days of the month, they will not suffer from sickness and will enjoy every comfort in life. That is why, Universal Bodhisattva, you ought to know that Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva has such vividly great power and has accomplished so much to bring benefit to sentient beings.<br><br>Beings in the Jambudvipa world are closely linked to the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, and that is why when those people hear his name or see his likeness, or hear even so much as three words, five words, one stanza or one sentence of his Teaching, will live happily and contentedly in the present birth, and will be reborn into noble families with pleasant complexion in the future for millions of rebirths."</div>

That is why I inquire about his wonderful powers and his activities in following and spreading the Teachings, which I promise to follow and spread by my own efforts.
