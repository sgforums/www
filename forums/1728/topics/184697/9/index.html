Their parents, family and friends ought to perform some benevolence on their behalf when the erring ones are about to depart from this life.<br><br>They can either hang banners bearing sacred texts, or burn oil lamps, or chant the Sutras. Or they may make offerings before one or more Buddha images, or images of Bodhisattvas. It is meritorious for the relatives to chant the names of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Pacceka Buddhas or even to chant one name or one title of the above sacred ones in front of the dying person within his or her hearing. Their sins which may cause them to be cast into the evil realms for suffering will be expiated solely because their families are doing these afore-described pious actions on their behalf.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The whole merit of offering such good deeds will be achieved by themselves personally. Time is transient, and death will come to one at any moment.<br><br>Within the forty-nine days after one's death, one is ignorant of his or her Karma. During the period of judgement of one's past deeds, he or she is unable to know what will be the consequences of the future, and thereby is extremely worried. If one has done some evil deeds during one's life-time, one will certainly be cast into the evil state of suffering.<br><br>Within the period of forty-nine days of one's death, he or she is expecting one's own children or relatives to do good deeds on his or her behalf, and thus be relieved of suffering. After the forty-nine days of one's death, one is bound to receive whatever Karma one should deserve.<br><br>If one has done evil deeds during one's life-time, one is subjected to endure sufferings without any hope of freedom for thousands of years. One's Karma is able to induce one to be cast into one of the five Avici Hells, or in one of the great Hells, and one will continue to suffer for millions of kalpas forever.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just at that time, the Emperor Yama knelt before the Buddha and said, "Honoured of the World, we are immensely indebted to your supernatural powers and valuable assistance of the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva to enable all of us to be here to pay homage and respect at this great assembly. We are exceedingly happy to be blessed with this golden opportunity to gather here and to have your valuable advice. May your attention be drawn to a little problem which is puzzling us? May I have the honour to request you to be kind enough to supply us with a compassionate explanation?''<br><br>The Buddha then told Emperor Yama, "You are at liberty to ask any question freely, and I shall provide you with a proper and detailed answer."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Emperor Yama paid full respect to Shakyamuni Buddha, turned with a look at Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva and said, "Honoured of the World, it is indeed a wonderful gesture by Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva to venture unremittingly, through various ways and means, to relieve the beings from the six Directions of reincarnation.<br><br>But, I wish to know why beings, who have just been relieved from punishment, commit sins again which caused them to be cast into the state of suffering once more?<br><br>Honoured of the World, since the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is so wonderfully compassionate towards erring beings, why must they ignore following his way to lead a virtuous life and gain Salvation forever? If you please, my Buddha, kindly furnish me with the necessary solution."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Honoured of the World then told Emperor Yama, "It is extremely difficult to control and convert the erring beings of the Samsara world. There is no doubt that the compassionate Bodhisattva is striving his utmost to bring erring beings to Salvation through kalpas and kalpas.<br><br>Even though sinful beings have been cast into the great Hells for punishment, the Bodhisattva is trying his best to lead them to live a virtuous life, and to bestow upon them the power of remembering their past deeds. Because erring beings of the Samsara world are prone to commit sins, that is why, shortly after they are relieved from their sufferings, they will commit sins again and thus receive punishment once more.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is, in fact, a great pity for the compassionate Bodhisattva to be working so earnestly through kalpas and kalpas to relieve erring beings from their sufferings. One example of which is:<br><br>A man, having lost his way while returning home, found himself in the dangerous situation where the surroundings were full of Yaksas, fierce animals and poisonous insects. By chance, he met a wise man who happened to know the way of calming Yaksas, beasts and insects.<br><br>The wise man, upon seeing the danger, asked anxiously, "My man, why do you come this way? Do you have any means of controlling these fierce animals?"<br><br>Upon hearing such words, the man realised that he was at that moment walking along a dangerous road. The wise man then caught hold of his hand and led him out of that dangerous road by showing him the way to the path of Peace and happiness.<br><br>Once again, he addressed the man, "Oh, my man, be wise now and never tread this road again as once you get into this way, it is very difficult for you to get out of it and you will surely perish within."<br><br>The erring man was so grateful and rejoiced at being led out of danger. Before his departure, the wise man again said to him, "Whenever you meet any of your friends or strangers, either male or female, tell them that this road is full of danger. If they come to this road by mistake, they will lose their lives. Tell them not to be foolish and not face the danger unnecessarily.''<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The compassionate Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva relieved erring beings from their sufferings and directed them either to Heaven or to the human world to enjoy great happiness.<br><br>These beings were then made to realise how one must suffer according to one's misdeeds, and how one could enjoy according to one's good actions. Then, they would never again commit sins and be cast into the Hell anymore.<br><br>It is very similar to one who had lost his way home, and by mistake found himself on the dangerous road, and was finally taken out of danger by a wise man. He too must remember never to tread such a dangerous road again.<br><br>Whenever he met a friend or a stranger, he advised them not to tread that dangerous path. When one is free from danger, he should have the wisdom of not touching such a risk again. If one enters such a dangerous path once more by mistake, it reveals that he does not have sufficient understanding, and may lose his or her life therein. It is similar to one being cast into the evil realms for suffering.<br><br>The compassionate Bodhisattva tries his best to lead beings out of the Hells and directs them on the way to Salvation, or to be reborn as human beings. They might be ignorant of the results of sins and commit evil again; and according to the Karma, they would be cast into Hell to suffer without any hope of being released."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At that time, the Devil-king of Poison, the Poison of evil actions, words and thoughts, said to the Shakyamuni Buddha respectfully with clasped hands, "Honoured of the World, we innumerable Kings of devils from every corner of the Samsara world are either to bring benefit and happiness to human beings or cause them sufferings according to their deeds.<br><br>We have travelled to all corners of the Universe, and we are convinced that there are more evil than good human beings. We promise you that whenever or wherever we come across a male or female in any part of the world who, though seen practising only a small fraction of good, or making any kind of offerings to the images of Buddhas or Bodhisattvas, or be heard chanting a sentence or poem of the Sutras, my followers and I shall treat such persons respectfully, as if we pay homage to the Buddhas of the present, past and the future.<br><br>We shall instruct our followers and the spirits from different places to protect such virtuous beings. We shall never allow any unhappy occasions, disease or any undesirable events to happen, not only to their homes, but also in places close to their residences."<br><br>Shakyamuni Buddha was highly delighted and said, "Well, well, since Emperor Yama and your followers are ready to protect such virtuous beings, I shall also instruct the Ruler of Brahmaloka and the Emperor of the thirty-three Heavens to protect you all."<br><br></div>
