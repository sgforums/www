            <div class='col-md body'>After being told by the Arahat, the girl disposed of her precious belongings, and with the money she had an image of the Exalted Buddha drawn and paid homage to it. Again, she begged to know where her mother was. Suddenly, one night, she saw the Buddha in the midst of a bright golden light as big as Mount Sumeru, telling her thus, "Your mother will be born to your family as a son of a servant, and will be able to speak as soon as she can feel cold and hunger." Before long, the servant in her family gave birth to a son. The newly-born child spoke to the girl three days after his birth. This newly-born infant said to the girl who was weeping bitterly, "Whatever evil deeds one has done, one will receive punishment without exception. I am your mother! After my departure from you, I have been cast into a dreadful Hell to suffer severe punishment.<br><br>It was on account of the good deeds offered by you that I am now born as a son of your servant. But, owing to the evil deeds which I committed during my life, I can only live to the age of thirteen, and will again be cast into the Hell. My child, what ways and means can you find to relieve me from my sufferings?" Upon hearing this, the girl was certain that the newly-born infant was her mother.<br><br></div>

The child answered, "I have committed two sins, both by killing lives and speaking evil as well as scolding others.<br><br>Without your help, by practising good deeds, I can never be relieved from my sufferings." The girl then asked the infant, "What kind of suffering were you subjected to in Hell?" The mother replied, "The sufferings were so numerous that I can not fully relate them, even if given a thousand years to do so." Upon hearing this, the girl then wept bitterly again, "May my mother be relieved from Hell forever after?" Later, the child died at the age of thirteen.<br><br></div>

After that, she will be reborn in the Universe, where she will not suffer anymore, and there she will enjoy life for kalpas and kalpas, until she finally achieves Buddhahood.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva was noted for his compassion and sympathy through kalpa after kalpa by making innumerable vows to lead the erring world to Salvation. If any male or female of the future, through ignorance, does not practise good deeds, but commits sin through actions, words and thoughts, or ignores the law of Cause and Effect, they will always suffer in any one of the States of Suffering.<br><br></div>

After this promise Isavaradevaraja returned to his seat with hands clasped in adoration.<br><br>The Maharaja Deva Kings of the four quarters rose reverently from their seats and said to Shakyamuni Buddha, "Honoured of the World, since Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva has made such great vows kalpas and kalpas ago, why are there still unconverted beings and why was it necessary for Ksitigarbha to renew his vows?" Shakyamuni Buddha told the four Deva Kings, "Very well, your question is very good. For the welfare of the four Deva Kings, devas and beings of the Heavens or the worlds, at this time and for the future, I shall tell you how Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva with great compassion, relieved erring beings of the Samsara world from the ocean of birth and death, leading them to emancipation".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The four Deva Kings replied, "We will listen most attentively to your words." Shakyamuni Buddha continued, "Although Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva has converted erring beings through the kalpas, he is still not satisfied. He has great pity for those who wander in sin, knowing that no matter how hard they try, they will fall back into erring actions again and again. They are like link-grass which spread far and wide. Therefore, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva has renewed his vows again and again. He has unceasingly tried to find upaya (devices) suitable for saving the sinful and converting them to the Eternal Truth ."<br><br></div>

If he encounters thieves and robbers, he will lead them to understand that such evil actions will bring suffering and poverty to those who commit them. When he meets adulterers, he tells them that they will be reborn as pigeons which are inseparable. He tells those addicted to harsh language that they will be born into quarrelsome families. If scandalmongers are met, then he warns them of the danger of being born without tongues or with horrible boils in their mouths. He assures those with hot temper that they may risk being reborn with ugly faces and deformed bodies. Misers will not be successful in gaining their wishes, greedy beings will suffer hunger and thirst, and sickness of the throat. When he encounters hunters, he warns them that they are in danger of dying by violence. Those who are guilty of disrespect for their parents will die in warfare. Those who burn forests will die mentally unbalanced.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is the <strong>mantra that Ksitigarbha heard from Buddhas</strong> equaling the number of sand grains of the river Ganga. He made offerings to them and then received this mantra. This mantra is to be used for any difficulties, problems; it is the best one to do for any problems in any situation. Even reciting four or five times, just a few times, it is very powerful. It is powerful to recite or just to think of the name of the bodhisattva.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ksitigarbha has a deep relationship with beings of the earth Â– humans, and especially with the hungry ghosts and hell beings. Because these are the most difficult to raise into a more fortunate condition due to their previous unwholesome actions, and because of his past vow to save them all, Ksitigarbha has been known as the Teacher of the Dark Regions.<br><br><strong>"If I do not go to hell to help them, who else will go?"</strong><br><br>is the famous declaration popularly crime or the karma, he is willing to have a connection with any being, and to help free them from suffering. After he had practiced the perfections of the bodhisattva for many lifetimes, he was ready for the attainment of Buddhahood. However, he chose to remain among sentient beings in this period before the coming of Maitreya Buddha because of his compassion for all suffering beings. According to his vow, he will not become a Buddha unless all the sentient beings in the hells are relieved of their suffering. Ksitigarbha's patient support of sentient beings in the realms of hells is similar to the earth's support of all forms of life. Based on this comparison, he bears the name <strong>Ksitigarbha which means "treasure of the earth".</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Praise by Buddha to Ksitigarbha:</span><br>You have generated stability of thought and pure thought  (altruism / bodhicitta) and eliminated the sufferings of immeasurable sentient beings. I see (sentient beings) receiving happiness like the wish granting jewel, and like the vajra you cut the nets of the doubt (of others). You offer the Destroyer, Qualified-Gone-Beyond-Ones holy offerings with great compassionate thought and perseverance. You liberate the sentient beings from the sufferings with oceans of wisdom. Because you have no fear (delusions), you have gone beyond samsara.<br><br>This is especially beneficial for those who have heavy problems, serious health problems, big projects or financial difficulties.  I will suggest it is extremely powerful to recite every day at least four or five times or more, depending on how crucial it is also, for protection.  Even to grow crops well and to protect land and crops.<br><br>It explains in the sutra the extensive benefits and qualities, like the sky, of the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, like skies of benefit to all beings. There have been experiences, similar benefits received by those who practice Ksitigarbha.<br><br>(from http://www.medicinebuddha.org/ksitigarba.htm)<br><br></div>
