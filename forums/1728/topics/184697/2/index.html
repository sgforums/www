Avici Hells means Hells reinforced with iron surrounded by iron walls, eight millions miles wide and one million miles high.

Also, there is an iron bed and when one is cast there, he can see his own body filling it. Therefore, all beings are subjected to punishment according to their sins.<br><br></div>

Long nails are pierced into the sinnersÂ’ limbs, their tongues are pulled out by iron thongs, and their intestines are sawed up. Molten steel is poured into their mouths. Hot iron wires are used to bind their bodies. Sinners suffer according to their evil actions by encountering innumerable births and deaths for kalpas and kalpas without any hope of escape.

            <div class='col-md body'>"When he was the daughter of a Brahman"<br><br>Again, innumerable kalpas ago, there was a Buddha by the name of Pure Lotus Eyes. He lived a long life of forty kalpas. During the semblance of the period of the Buddha, there was an Arahat who worked strenuously to convert beings by propagating the Noble Teachings of the Buddha. There was a girl by the name of Kong MokÂ—the girl with bright eyes. She made offerings to the Arahat, who asked her what her wish was. The girl replied, "I did some good work on the day of my motherÂ’s death in order to relieve her out of her sufferings. I long to know in what state my mother is at present."<br><br>The Arahat pitied her and started to meditate. He came to know that the mother of the girl had been cast into the Hell of great Sufferings. The Arahat asked the girl what her mother did during her lifetime, so as to be cast into the Hell and to receive such severe punishment. The girl replied, "My mother used to be very fond of eating tortoises, especially their eggs, and fishes fried or cooked. She therefore killed countless lives for food.<br><br>Compassionate One, kindly let me know how to relieve my mother." Out of great compassion, the Arahat told the girl to chant the name of the Buddha of Pure Lotus Eyes earnestly and respectfully, and that she should carve images of the above Buddha so that both the mother and herself could benefit from it.<br><br></div>
