Some receive their reward for only one life, some receive their reward for ten lives, and even some receive great bliss for hundreds of thousands of lives. I do not know the reason why it differs in such a great way and hope that you will graciously explain it to me."<br><br>Shakyamuni Buddha replied, "Now, I shall give you the comparison of merits, whether great or small. As rewards for the sentient beings who practise alms-giving in the Jampudvipa, I tell all who are assembled here at the thirty-three Heavens and I hope you will listen to me carefully." Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva said to Shakyamuni Buddha, "I'm quite doubtful about this, and I would like to hear the comparison of merits for alms-giving. "</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shakyamuni Buddha said, "If kings, nobles, honourable elders, Maha Ksatriyas, Great Brahmans in Jampudvipa (the Continent situated at the South of Mount Sumeru, comprising the world we live in), come across people who suffer great poverty, or unreformed beings, if such people as those mentioned give alms to them through great compassion, love and kindness, smilingly, and give gifts to those poor beings with their own hands, or through their representatives, and talk to them in consoling tones, such donors of gifts gain merit as great as the total number of grains of sands in the Ganges River.<br><br>It is because these donors of gifts are practising Infinite Love and Kindness even to the poorest and the lowest births and unreformed beings, that is why for hundreds of thousands of lives they receive their well-earned good merits of the seven jewels of riches. They are well provided for in good food and clothing in those lives yet to come.</div>

If these donors transfer their merit to the beings of the ten quarters of space these donors will become Mahabrahma devarajas, kings of the eighteen Brahmalokas, for ten kalpas continuously.<br><br>Again if in the future, kings, prime-ministers, nobles, honourable elders, Maha Ksatriyas and Brahmans come across Buddhist pagodas and temples or Buddhist Sutras and images which are in bad condition and with determination for their repair, or rebuild them, such generous donors whether they practise alms-giving themselves or persuading others to do alms-giving or charitable acts, whether they persuade one person or many hundreds of thousands of people to practise the same charitable acts, these charitable donors will be reborn as Chakravarti for hundreds of thousands of lives. Those who have been encouraged and persuaded by the above donors to practise alms-giving will be reborn as kings of small countries for hundreds of thousands of lives. If, moreover, they transfer their merit to others in the presence of the Buddhas, pagodas or temples, such great donors of gifts will all attain Buddhahood.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reward for practising such great merit is beyond all description. If, in the future, kings, prime-ministers, nobles, when they see aged ones suffering from disease, women giving birth, if they have but one momentary thought of sympathy, to give them aid, medicines, food and drink, or bathing, so as to assure them some measure of peace and happiness, such merits are inconceivable and donors of these things will always be reborn as a Suddhavasodeva for one hundred kalpas. After this period, they will be always reborn in the Six Deva Lokas (i.e. The Heavens of Desire) for two hundred kalpas. Finally, they will attain Buddhahood, but prior to that, for hundreds and thousands of births, they will never be reborn as dwellers in evil realms, or hear any voice of suffering. If kings of countries or Brahmans in the future can practise such meritorious deeds, they will receive boundless blessings. If they transfer their merits to others, whether great or small merit, they will be reborn as Cakravatis and finally attain Buddhahood.<br><br>That is why, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, you should do your utmost to encourage sentient beings to practise meritorious deeds by following these examples. If virtuous people in the future will practise meritorious deeds even as small as a hair, or a grain of sand, or a dustmote, they will receive blessings and benefits which cannot be expressed by examples, as they will be so great.</div>
