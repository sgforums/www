            <div class='col-md body'>The Five Dhyani Buddhas were originated from the <strong>Adi-Buddha.</strong><br><strong>Adi-Buddha</strong> (Sanskrit, "First Awakened One" ) is the primordial Buddha and the source of all phenomena. Although formless, <strong>the Adi-Buddha is represented by Vajradhara.</strong><br><br><strong>Vajradhara</strong> (Sanskrit, "Thunderbolt-bearer" ) Symbolizes the Primordial Buddha. He is typically represented as sitting in the lotus position with his arms crossed on his chest and his hands holding the bell and vajra.<br><br><strong>Vajrasattva</strong> (Sanskrit, "Diamond Being" ) Viewed as the chief or the union of the five Dhyani Buddhas, Vajrasattva's practice is the most important of the Four Preliminary Practices. This is because Vajrasattva eradicates negative hindrances accumulated since time immemorial. He is typically depicted holding a vajra in his right hand, next to his chest, and a bell in his left hand, next to his left thigh.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The <strong>Five Dhyani Buddhas:-</strong></span><br><strong>Akshobya</strong> (Sanskrit, "Immovable" ) He is usually depicted with his right hand forming the Earth Witness Mudra (the hand is pointed towards the earth and is turned inward). He embodies the Mirror-Like Great Wisdom which takes sense impressions and the idea of individual forms and recognizes the inherent emptiness of them all.<br><br><strong>Amitabha</strong> (Sanskrit, lit. "Boundless Light" ) The embodiment of compassion and wisdom, he is typically depicted as red in color, with his hands held together in the Meditation Mudra(the right hand rests on the left hand with the tips of the thumbs touching).Embodying the Wisdom of Discriminating Vision, he transmutes perception into inner vision.<br><br><strong>Amoghasiddhi</strong> (Sanskrit, "One Who Accomplishes His Goal" ) He is usually depicted with his right hand forming the Fearless Mudra (right palm raised and facing outward). He embodies the All-Accomplishing Wisdom which transforms the will into the egoless activity of the Buddha.<br><br><strong>Ratnasambhava</strong> (Sanskrit, "Jewel-born One" ) He holds his right hand in the Wish-Bestowing Mudra (the right hand is pointed towards the earth, with the palm facing out). He embodies the Wisdom of Equality, by which feelings are transformed into love and compassion.<br><br><strong>Mahavairocana</strong> the Great Sun Buddha, is typically depicted as white in color and holds either the Dharmacakra Mudra (the thumb and index finger of each hand form a circle and are brought together) or the Supreme Wisdom Mudra (the five fingers of the left hand wrap around the index finger of the right hand). Embodying Transcendent Wisdom, Mahavairocana transforms the ego-bound consciousness into universal consciousness.<br><br></div>
