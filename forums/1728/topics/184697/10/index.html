            <div class='col-md body'>After the interesting discourse, the Devil-king, who is in charge of the longevity of people's lives, rose up from the assembly and spoke to Shakyamuni Buddha,<br><br>"My honoured of the World, it is my duty to be in charge of the longevity of human beings in the human world, either during their life-time or after their death. It is my earnest wish to bring benefit and happiness to human beings, but I observe with sadness that many of the human beings do not realise my intention to relieve them. As a result, evil ones are not at peace during their life-time or after their death. When people in this human world are expecting birth of a boy or girl, they should practise meritorious deeds, for such good deeds bring benefit and happiness to the family. My followers and spirits of that place will not only protect both the mother and the newly-born child, but will bestow upon them and their relatives great peace and happiness joyfully.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For this reason, when a child is born to a family, it is desirable not to kill any animals as supplement for any tonic to the mother, or to invite friends or relatives in the child's honour by offering or entertaining them with wine, meat and music. Such ways of celebrating the birth of a child will never bring happiness to both the mother and the child.<br><br>For when a pregnant woman is ready for delivery of her child, there are numerous evil devils seen by the side of the mother to suck her blood. In order to safeguard the mother, I usually order the spirit of that place to come and protect the mother and child and to bring them peace and happiness.<br><br>When the mother and child are at peace after birth, they should make offerings to the spirits to express their gratitude for the protection given. If, instead of offering to the spirits, friends and relatives are entertained by the killing of animals, both the mother and the newly-born child will suffer punishment.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When a person in this human world is nearing death, I always try my best to relieve this dying person, irrespective of whether the being is a good or evil person, from being cast into the evil State. If this dying person has been doing good deeds during his or her life-time, my power of relieving him or her will be successful.<br><br>Even in the case of a person who has done good deeds throughout his life, there may be innumerable evil spirits in the form of their past parents or relatives to tempt the dying person to the evil State of suffering. If the dying person has done bad deeds during his life, these evil spirits will no doubt be successful in arresting him or her to the State of suffering.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honoured of the World, if people in the Samsara world, either male or female, be seen unconscious during their moment of death when they cannot distinguish the good from the bad, and at such a moment they will not be able to see or hear, that is the time for the relatives of this dying person to chant the Sutra and to make offerings to the images of the Buddha, as well as the Bodhisattva, for these good deeds will help to drive away the evil spirits. The Buddha and the Bodhisattva will keep the dying person away from the evil State.<br><br>Honoured of the World, if all dying persons have an opportunity of hearing only the name of one Buddha or one Bodhisattva, or the chanting of the Sutra, or even the chanting of one sentence or one poem of any Sutra, I can assure you that these dying persons will be kept away from the five Avici Hells. If a dying person has committed only small evil deeds which will cause him to be cast into the evil State for punishment, he will be relieved upon hearing the name of the Buddha or Bodhisattva, or even the chanting of the Sutra."<br><br></div>

I earnestly hope that you will try your best to carry out your vow without any retreat, so that you will be able to relieve all these erring beings to Salvation and to bring them everlasting happiness.''<br><br>The Devil-king who is in charge of Birth and Death said,<br><br>"Please do not be worried, for I shall continuously try my utmost to protect the beings in the Samsara world, both at the moment of their birth and at the moment of their death, and thus enabling them to be in peace and happiness. I strongly look forward to the occasion when all human beings will listen to my words so as to achieve real Salvation and to attain great benefit."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At that time, Shakyamuni Buddha told Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, "This <strong>Devil King of Birth and Death</strong> has been a great King of Devils for many thousands of lives. He has done his best to protect human beings at their moment of birth and at their moment of death.<br><br>In fact, he is not a devil, as so supposed to be, but out of compassion and great Infinite Loving Kindness, he transformed himself into the form of a devil. He <strong>will attain Buddhahood</strong> after one hundred and seventy kalpas <strong>by the name of Nirlaksana Buddha.</strong> He will live a long life for countless and happy kalpas <strong>in a world named Purity.</strong><br><br>The story of this great King of Devils is beyond thought or description and persons converted by him are also unaccountable.''<br><br></div>
