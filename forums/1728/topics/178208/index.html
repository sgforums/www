I also know and read of many Thai kings who aspired to be Buddhas. As we all know, Thailand is a Theravada Buddhist country.<br><br>However, it is also undeniable that Theravada as a sect emphasizes and focuses on practising Self-liberation - the path to Arhatship. Therefore in Buddhist history it is known as one of the 18 Hinayana sects - and the last surviving sect.<br><br>Reasons include the lack of teachings on the Bodhisattva ideals, etc etc... teachings of the One-Buddha vehicle, Bodhisattva ways, etc, are lacking or not present. This is the big difference between Theravada and Mahayana traditions.<br><br>But on the other hand, there are also many Buddhists who practise in the Mahayana sects but only attain Arhatship. Anyone - regardless of what sect - who lack the aspirations of the Bodhisattva will simply enter into Nirvana as an arhat after they reach the point of liberation. Whether you become arhat or bodhisattva is very much up to you.<br><br>Those who think 'aiya, after I attain arhatship then I continue to be Bodhisattva la', chances are he will simply attain self-liberation but the will to continue practising to Buddhahood is not there. Thus said by my dharma teacher.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, it depends on the individuals.<br><br>But one thing differentiates between Mahayana and Theravada practises is compassion for sentient beings.<br><br>Because of the vow to be a Buddha to save all sentient beings, he thus embarked the pathway of a bodhisattva to practise the paramittas in every life until he is perfect to be a Buddha.<br><br>Whereas an arahant is to end suffering for himself after so many innumerable existences in samsara, he seeks an end to rebirth and once he attained arahantship, this is his last life as a human, no more in the state of becoming anymore.<br><br>So, if you have accepted and adopted the Mahayana practises, you must ask yourself why you want to be a Buddha. The only reason you want to be a Buddha is to save all sentient beings isn't it. Only a Buddha has the ability to save sentient beings. To have this vow is indeed very great, but how many people can safely say thay want to save his fellow sentient beings by being a Buddha.<br><br></div>

The fastest and most direct way is to walk to Bodhisattva path now. One should have the will to save the inner sentient being and also the outer sentient beings, only then will it be complete.<br><br>I suggest you may want to speak to a Mahayana teacher about this if you have doubts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not everyone likes the same kind of food. When a huge buffet is spread before us, we choose the dishes that we like. There is no obligation to like everything. Although we may have a taste for sweets, that does not mean that the salty dishes are not good and should be thrown away! Similarly, we may prefer a certain approach to the teachings: Theravada, Pure Land, Zen, Vajrayana, and so on. We are free to choose the approach that suits us best and with which we feel the most comfortable. Yet we still maintain an open mind and respect for other traditions. As our mind develops, we may come to understand elements in other traditions that we failed to comprehend previously. In short, whatever is useful and helps us live a better life, we practice, and whatever we do not yet understand, we leave aside without rejecting it.<br><br>While we may find one particular tradition best suited for our personality, do not identify with it in a concrete way: "I am a Mahayanist, you are a Theravadin," or "I am a Buddhist, you are a Christian." It is important to remember that we are all human beings seeking happiness and wanting to realize the truth, and we each must find a method suitable for our disposition.<br><br></div>

The Mahayana (Great Vehicle) tradition, based on the scriptures recorded in Sanskrit spread to China, Tibet, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, etc. Although in the Theravadin practice love and compassion are essential and important factors, in the Mahayana they are emphasized to an even greater extent.

All Bodhisattvas will go through that stage. The only difference is in his aspirations.<br><br>Anyway, in Mahayana Buddhism, a Bodhisattva will no longer need to rely on vows only at the 8th Bhumi level.</div>

But there is no need to rely on it.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.purifymind.com/PureAction.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.purifymind.com/PureAction.htm</a><br><br>Bodhisattvas make vows until they reach the eighth bhumi, or stage, of the Bodhisattva Path -- the position of non-intentionality. At this stage, they help sentient beings spontaneously. Once they attain the eighth bhumi, bodhisattvas no longer need to make vows. Here's an analogy: you may vow to climb a mountain, but you don't have to repeat the vow once you reach the top.</blockquote></div>
