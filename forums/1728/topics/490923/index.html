              to discredit Dalai Lama</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; color: #333333;">By Reuters
              Staff December 23, 2015</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Thousands of Buddhists from all over Britain packed into the
              Aldershot football stadium southwest of London on June 29, quietly waiting under
              a hot sun to see the Dalai Lama.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Just outside the turnstiles, another group of Buddhists awaited
              the Tibetan spiritual leader.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“False Dalai Lama, stop lying, false Dalai Lama, stop lying!” they
              chanted over and over through megaphones, drummers pounding out a rhythmic
              tempo. When he spoke, only snippets of his remarks could be heard above the
              cacophony.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“China must be thrilled at this,” said Gary Beesley, a British
              devotee of Tibetan Buddhism who had travelled from Manchester to hear the Dalai
              Lama. “They really must love it.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The Aldershot demonstration was part of a pattern: Noisy
              protesters are following the globetrotting Dalai Lama almost everywhere he
              goes, denouncing him in terms that echo the invective heaped upon the Nobel
              Peace laureate by China’s ruling Communist Party.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">On the surface, the commotion appears to stem from an arcane,
              centuries-old schism in Tibetan Buddhism. But a Reuters investigation has found
              that the religious sect behind the protests has the backing of the Communist
              Party. The group has emerged as an instrument in Beijing’s long campaign to
              undermine support for the Dalai Lama, a political exile who commands the
              loyalty of millions of Chinese citizens and whom Beijing accuses of plotting
              secession for Tibet.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The protesters are members of a sect that worships Dorje Shugden,
              a deity its devotees revere as a protector. The Dalai Lama discourages the
              practice, advising his followers that Dorje Shugden is a malevolent spirit. The
              Shugden worshippers accuse the Tibetan spiritual leader of persecuting them for
              their beliefs.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">This quarrel was once confined to the temples and monasteries of
              the remote Tibetan plateau and exile communities in India. But it has now been
              exported to the streets and stadiums of North America, Europe and Australia.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Tibetan and foreign protesters say the demonstrations are
              organised by an umbrella group called the International Shugden Community,
              which in the United States is registered as a charity in California. Members of
              this group say they are fighting purely for religious freedom and deny China
              plays a role in the demonstrations.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“There is no connection at all between Dorje Shugden and the
              Communist Party,” said Nicholas Pitts, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for the
              International Shugden Community who frequently appears at its protests.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">But a leaked internal Communist Party document shows that China is
              intervening in the dispute. The party document, issued to officials last year,
              said the Shugden issue is “an important front in our struggle with the Dalai
              clique”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">A monk and prominent former member of the Shugden movement who was
              based in India and Nepal, Lama Tseta, told Reuters that China paid him and
              others to plan and coordinate the activities of the sect’s followers overseas.
              Tseta said officials from the Communist Party’s powerful political
              special-operations unit, the United Front Work Department, control the effort
              and allocate funding. These officials direct the protests through senior
              Shugden monks in China and the Tibetan exile community in India and the West,
              who are the spiritual leaders of the sect, he said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“The Chinese are using them as a tool to make the Dalai Lama look
              fake, to achieve their own ends, to undermine Tibetan Buddhism and to fragment
              Tibetan society,” Tseta said in an interview.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">These senior Shugden monks are treated as honoured guests at
              official functions in China and publicly embraced as patriotic allies in Beijing’s
              campaign to crush support for the Dalai Lama, according to eyewitness accounts,
              reports in China’s state controlled media and postings on Dorje Shugden
              websites.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">A core group of ethnic Tibetans living abroad who follow these
              senior monks spearhead the demonstrations. They travel the world to harangue
              the Dalai Lama. Some attend government functions in China, and have contact
              with Chinese diplomats at Beijing’s embassies and consulates. But they deny
              that China plays any role in the protests. They say they are purely
              demonstrating for religious freedom and pay their own way.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“SERIOUS POTENTIAL THREAT”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The majority of protesters, though, are foreign recruits like
              Pitts, mostly Westerners. Lama Tseta said Chinese officials had instructed
              senior Shugden monks to enlist these foreigners in the demonstrations. Reuters
              has no independent evidence of direct Chinese financing of the protests. But a
              senior Indian Interior Ministry official said Indian authorities are aware that
              the Shugden sect receives funds from China.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“We also keep a close watch on them because they get funding from
              China via Nepal,” said the official, who supervises the activities of India’s
              internal security agency, the Intelligence Bureau, and spoke on condition of
              anonymity.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">In response to questions from Reuters about the Communist Party’s
              support for the Shugden sect, the Chinese foreign ministry said the Dalai Lama
              was practicing “religious tyranny.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“The 14th Dalai Lama has in recent years used all sorts of means,
              including violent terror methods, to force certain people to abandon their
              religious belief,” the ministry said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The office of the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India, said the
              Tibetan spiritual leader was occupied with teaching in Southern India and was
              unable to answer questions for this article.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">How much the campaign will tarnish the Dalai Lama is unclear, but
              the Shugden protesters are having an impact. Coverage of the Dalai Lama’s
              visits in the United States, Europe and Australia now regularly includes
              accusations from Shugden spokespeople that he is a religious bigot with no
              right to speak for Tibet. The protests have become so strident that the Tibetan
              spiritual leader has been alerted by U.S., Indian and other intelligence
              agencies that there is “now a serious potential threat to the Dalai Lama’s
              well-being,” according to a briefing document reviewed by Reuters.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">That assessment is contained in the 18-page briefing prepared for
              the Dalai Lama’s official representative in the United Kingdom, the Office of
              Tibet, ahead of the Tibetan religious leader’s two trips to Britain this year.
              The document, which was provided to the British Foreign Office, also reported
              that the U.S., Dutch and Swiss governments had tightened security during the
              Dalai Lama’s recent visits. The memo makes no allegations of a Chinese
              government role in the security threat.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">A former U.S. official said the State Department’s Bureau of
              Diplomatic Security was aware of the Dorje Shugden group and had to pay
              particular attention to it.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“There’s a lot of passion around this from Shugden practitioners,
              and the Chinese have fostered this Shugden worship as a way to split Tibetans,”
              said Kelley Currie, a senior State Department advisor on Asia and Tibet from
              2007 to 2009. Currie previously worked for the International Campaign for
              Tibet, an advocacy group promoting human rights for Tibetans.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">A State Department spokesperson said the bureau provided
              protection for the Dalai Lama during his visits to the United States but
              declined to discuss operational details.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">China’s effort to neutralise the Dalai Lama is part of a
              systematic and often secretive global campaign to silence criticism abroad and
              bring the world around to its views.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">A Reuters investigation this year exposed how China has used front
              men to set up a covert international radio network that is broadcasting
              pro-Beijing news. A second article revealed how China is using
              government-backed groups masquerading as NGOs to intimidate its critics at the
              United Nations Human Rights Council.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">In the case of the Dalai Lama, Beijing hasn’t just co-opted a
              Buddhist group to challenge the Tibetan spiritual leader. It has also used the
              country’s economic and diplomatic clout with Western governments to marginalise
              its Tibetan foe.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Some Western capitals are acquiescing. British Prime Minister
              David Cameron, former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Norwegian Prime
              Minister Erna Solberg are among the world leaders who have chosen not to meet
              with the Dalai Lama in the past year and a half.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Abbott and Solberg did not respond to questions from Reuters.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">TAILED IN LONDON</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Beijing’s strategy has been especially effective in the United
              Kingdom. Britain, unlike other Western governments, doesn’t provide the Tibetan
              leader with official security during his visits. Ahead of the Dalai Lama’s two

              his entourage say they spotted a car that appeared to be tailing the motorcade.
              Wangdue Tsering, first secretary at the Office of Tibet in London, was in one
              of the vehicles behind the Dalai Lama. “We noticed the car turned out very
              quickly and ran through a red light,” he said. “From that point we suspected it
              was following us.”</span></p>

              Within 10 minutes a patrol car pulled the pursuing vehicle over. Tsering said
              the Tibetan security team recognised one of the two people in the car as a
              Shugden protester. “We know who he is,” Tsering said.</span></p>

              Dalai Lama, Tim Loughton, a pro-Tibet member of parliament in Cameron’s ruling
              Conservative Party, said: “I don’t know, other than kowtowing to the Chinese.”</span></p>

              has been welcomed to the U.K. on many occasions,” Cameron’s office said in
              response to questions from Reuters. “We are robust and consistent in raising
              human rights issues with the Chinese authorities.”</span></p>

              rolled out the red carpet for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s first state visit
              to the country. Britain secured contracts with China worth almost 40 billion
              pounds ($60 billion) during the trip, according to the U.K. government.</span></p>

              India following a failed uprising against Chinese rule. Today, the 80-year-old
              religious leader retains a powerful influence over more than six million ethnic
              Tibetans within China’s borders. He travels the world promoting a message of
              greater autonomy for Tibetans.</span></p>

Now,
              the avowedly atheist Communist Party has thrown its weight behind the worship
              of Dorje Shugden – a spirit depicted in temples and monasteries as a wrathful
              three-eyed figure wielding a sword and mounted on a lion.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">China’s ultimate objective is to entrench its authority over a
              vast, resource-rich and strategically vital region that still chafes under
              Communist rule. More than 140 Tibetans have self-immolated since early 2009.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Some of the Dalai Lama’s leading supporters say his global
              standing remains intact. He still draws large crowds. In February, U.S.
              President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama attended a prayer breakfast in
              Washington, where the president praised the Tibetan as a “good friend.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“It’s unfortunate, but they are not sophisticated things they are
              doing,” said actor Richard Gere, chairman of the International Campaign for
              Tibet, which is based in Washington and is sympathetic to the Dalai Lama. “It’s
              childish denouncing – very much the way the Chinese denounce His Holiness.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Beijing’s strategy on Shugden worship is contained in an internal
              Communist Party document setting out guidelines for officials in Tibet on how
              to deal with the dispute. The document, issued on February 20 last year by the
              Communist Party Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, was leaked this year
              to the International Campaign for Tibet.</span></p>

              dispute over Shugden worship. But they should recognise that the Dalai Lama
              camp is using the schism as a pretext to split the motherland and sow discord.
              The party must “decisively grind into dust” this plot, the document added.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Chinese officials should organise community visits by respected,
              patriotic religious leaders to expose and denounce the Dalai Lama’s “ban” on
              Shugden worship, the document said. And supporters of the Dalai Lama’s views on
              Shugden who attempted to “create disturbances” around the issue in China “must
              be punished according to the law.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“I do not feel you could fairly use this document to say, look,
              this is evidence that the Chinese government is supporting the Shugden issue,”
              said Nicholas Pitts, the Hong Kong-based spokesman of the International Shugden
              Community. He pointed to a section of the document where authorities were urged
              to punish anyone, believer or non-believer, who used the Shugden issue to cause
              “public gatherings and disturbances.”</span></p>

              responsible for dealing with Chinese officials between 1997 and 2006. He left
              the movement in 2008. He identified the Communist Party’s United Front Work
              Department as the lead agency coordinating Beijing’s efforts to undermine the
              Dalai Lama through the Shugden movement in India and the West.</span></p>

              support for the party from influential non-Communists at home and overseas.
              Other Tibetan monks and scholars who study the dispute identify the United
              Front as the key agency in China’s bid to cement control over Tibet.</span></p>

              movement’s anti-Dalai Lama activities in recent years was Zhu Weiqun, Tseta
              said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Zhu, 68, a veteran official, was executive vice minister of the
              United Front while Tseta was active in the Shugden movement. He is now head of
              an ethnic and religious affairs body that advises China’s parliament. Zhu is
              frequently quoted in the official media as a leading government authority on
              Tibet, and mocks the Dalai Lama in speeches and interviews. He holds a rank
              equivalent to a provincial governor. Zhu did not respond to a Reuters request
              for an interview.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Tseta said he and other Shugden monks travelled on multiple
              occasions to Nepal and China, including Tibet, where they met Zhu and other
              Chinese officials. In the interview with Reuters, Tseta produced two of his
              Chinese passports with stamps showing 15 visits to China. Tseta said he was
              last in Tibet in 2006.</span></p>

              Chinese media on another Tibetan monk: Lama Gangchen. Based in Milan, Gangchen
              is the most influential Shugden leader outside China, according to Tseta and
              Western scholars of Tibetan Buddhism. Tseta showed Reuters photographs of
              himself with Gangchen.</span></p>

              Dodin, a French scholar of Tibetan Buddhism and director of the website
              TibetInfoNet. “He’s the most committed one to the Communist Party and the
              authorities in China.”</span></p>

              leaders in India and Chinese officials in 1997.</span></p>

              into exile in India in 1963, according to his personal website, Lama Gangchen
              Peace Publications. He later moved to Europe and has become an Italian citizen.</span></p>

              and is feted at government-sanctioned religious gatherings. China’s
              state-controlled media published photos of his arrival with other Buddhist
              dignitaries at a forum in the city of Wuxi in October. Indiana University’s
              Sperling and Tibet scholar Dibyesh Anand of London’s Westminster University
              said they have both seen Gangchen at government and United Front events in
              China, where he is treated as a VIP.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">A spokeswoman for Gangchen said the monk declined to be
              interviewed for this article. “Lama Gangchen has no role in the Shugden movement,”
              she said. “He is merely a devoted practitioner of this lineage.”</span></p>

              Shugden movement, and by 2006, the Chinese were growing suspicious of him. He
              was detained for 25 days in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, he said, but was
              released after persuading authorities he was a devoted Shugden monk. Reuters
              has no independent confirmation of Tseta’s detention.</span></p>

Tseta
              showed Reuters documents indicating he was granted political asylum in 2007. He
              said he is speaking out now about his role in the Shugden movement because the
              protests against the Dalai Lama are dividing Tibetans.</span></p>

              online video postings and Shugden publicity materials, Reuters was able to
              identify leading ethnic Tibetans involved in demonstrations in Australia, the

Rinchen, 53, a stonemason

              Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about security threats to the Dalai
              Lama, most recently at his home in 2012 while the Dalai Lama was visiting
              Boston. “They wanted to know if anybody paid by the Chinese wanted to kill the
              Dalai Lama,” he said. These were “ridiculous” allegations that the Central Tibetan
              Administration, the Tibetan government in exile, had passed to the FBI to smear
              the Shugden protesters, he said. The FBI declined to comment.</span></p>

              he has lived in the U.S. for almost three decades. “I am sure they are pleased,
              but we do not protest to please China,” he said. “We are interested in getting
              our religious freedom back.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">This year, Rinchen joined the protests in Britain during the Dalai
              Lama’s September visit. He said demonstrators paid their own airfares and hotel
              bills, while the International Shugden Community paid for local transport and
              meals.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“This is the hard part of it,” he said. “It costs so much money.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Not for everyone. In December 2014, the International Shugden
              Community offered 40 free return flights from Manchester to Rome when the Dalai
              Lama was scheduled to attend a meeting of Nobel laureates in the Italian
              capital, according to a notice that was posted on the group’s website. The
              offer included meals and accommodation for protesters.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The International Shugden Community was incorporated as a charity
              in California in 2014, according to corporate records. It listed assets of
              $27,471 and income of $69,235 in its 2014 filings.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The majority of rank-and-file protesters are Westerners who follow
              the New Kadampa Tradition, or NKT. Members say the group plays no role in the
              protests. It doesn’t disclose how many devotees it has, but former members
              estimate there are about 6,000 worldwide.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The NKT’s leader and founder is Kelsang Gyatso, a Tibetan monk who
              moved to Britain in 1977. The NKT, a registered U.K. charitable trust, has
              1,200 centres and branches in 40 countries, according to its website. It had
              21.8 million pounds on its books at the end of 2014, U.K. charity commission
              filings show.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Carol McQuire, a former member of the NKT in the U.K., said many
              of the protesters are unwitting agents of Beijing. “I am sure that having the
              protests done ‘for free’ by ignorant Westerners makes (the Chinese) very
              content,” said McQuire, who became disillusioned and left the movement nine
              years ago.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The protests are attracting attention. On the Dalai Lama’s 2015
              tour of the United States, many media outlets (including Reuters) carried
              reports covering the demonstrators and their grievances. During his 12-day
              visit to Australia in June, the Sydney Morning Herald and Melbourne’s The Age
              published an opinion piece by the International Shugden Community’s Pitts, who
              is also an NKT member.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“He has been the political leader of the Tibetans for decades but,
              unlike virtually every other political leader in the world, no one seems to
              hold him to account or check whether what he says matches what he does,” Pitts
              wrote.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">On the Dalai Lama’s September visit to Britain, the BBC and ITV
              covered one of his engagements amid noisy Shugden protesters. Both outlets
              interviewed Pitts.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">ITV’s report covering both sides – the Dalai Lama’s appearance and
              his chanting critics – showed how the protests are chipping away at the Tibetan
              spiritual leader’s image. “Here in the West, we are used to seeing the Dalai
              Lama portrayed as a very popular, a very respected figure,” said reporter
              Matthew Hudson. “But, this demonstration and the entrenched animosity I’ve
              heard from both sides shows that in our complex world of geopolitical and
              religious affairs, no one is immune from criticism.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Beijing has applauded the shift. On the sidelines of China’s
              annual parliamentary session in March, religious-affairs official Zhu Weiqun
              said the international media was “less and less interested in the Dalai Lama.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Still, because of his popular authority, the Dalai Lama’s
              disapproval of the Shugden deity has sharply reduced the sect’s prevalence in
              Tibetan areas of China and among Tibetan exiles in India, Tibetologists say.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Some Tibetan Shugden devotees complain that discrimination from
              Dalai Lama supporters has seen them ostracized in Tibet and abroad. They say
              they have been dismissed from jobs, refused service in shops and forced to live
              in spiritual ghettos.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Some Dalai Lama supporters acknowledge there have been cases of
              discrimination. But they say it is not systematic and not encouraged by the
              Dalai Lama.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">AN EYE-CATCHING BILLBOARD</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">When the Shugden protests began in 1996, they were low key,
              sometimes even respectful. Now they are vitriolic. At each stop, Shugden
              protesters wait in ambush.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">In the past two years, protesters have penetrated the Dalai Lama’s
              security cordon to confront him personally. In May last year, Shugden Buddhists
              attempted to check in to the hotel where he was staying in the Netherlands,
              according to the security briefing provided to the British government. Hotel
              security staff ejected them, visit organizers said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Days ahead of his two-day visit to New York starting July 9, a
              giant billboard reading “False Dalai Lama Stop Lying” was posted two blocks
              from where he was due to speak. An adjacent billboard depicted the Dorje
              Shugden deity.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Both were taken down on July 8 after Tibetans in the U.S.
              complained to the advertising company, according to Dalai Lama supporters. The
              company declined to disclose who paid for the billboards.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The Dalai Lama spoke to a sold-out crowd at Manhattan’s sprawling
              Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. About 100 protesters gathered across the
              street. Some held up a caricature of the Dalai Lama in military boots, his eyes
              screwed up in fury and hands balled into fists, standing on a pile of helpless
              Shugden monks.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The same poster was on display outside the football stadium at
              Aldershot in June, where Shugden protesters drowned out the Dalai Lama’s
              40-minute address.</span></p>
