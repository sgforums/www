              <p>On one occasion Ven. <a id="sari" name="sari">Sariputta</a> &amp; Ven. <a id="kotthita" name="kotthita">Maha Kotthita</a> were staying near Varanasi in the Deer Park at <a id="isip" name="isip">Isipatana</a>.
                   Then Ven. Maha Kotthita, emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon,
                   went to Ven. Sariputta and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings 
                  with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he 
                  sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Sariputta, 
                  "Sariputta my friend, which things should a virtuous monk attend to in 
                  an appropriate way?"</p>
              <p>"A virtuous monk, Kotthita my friend, should attend in an appropriate
                   way to the five clinging-aggregates as inconstant, stressful, a 
                  disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a 
                  dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. Which five? Form as a 
                  clinging-aggregate, feeling... perception... fabrications... 
                  consciousness as a clinging-aggregate. A virtuous monk should attend in 
                  an appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as inconstant,

                   a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a 
                  virtuous monk, attending in an appropriate way to these five 
                  clinging-aggregates as inconstant... not-self, would realize the fruit

                  nothing to add to what has been done, still these things — when 
                  developed &amp; pursued — lead both to a pleasant abiding in the

              <p>http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/463722<br><br>Posts from my facebook group 'dharma connection'.<br> <br> What is Nirvana?<br> <br> The Buddha described two elements of Nibbana. The Nibbana element
              with residue remaining is the destruction of lust, hatred, and
              delusion attained by a Noble One (arahant), with the residue itself
              being a reference to "his five sense faculties remain unimpaired,
              by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable
              and feels pleasure and plain". The Nibbana element without residue
              remaining is that which “all that is felt, not being delighted,
              will become cool right here” (Iti 44). The common interpretation is
              that the first Nibbana element is attained when the Arahant/Noble
              One is still alive, and the latter comes in the passing away of the
              Noble One.<br> <br> For a long time I thought along this line, but as Geoff mentions,
              there is an alternative interpretation:<br> <br> Geoff:<br> <br> To paraphrase Ven. ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda, it's not that an arahant gets half of
              nibbÄ�na upon awakening, and the other half when s/he dies. Upon
              awakening they have already "gone out," they are "cool," and they
              have reached "the end." Even parinibbÄ�na can be used to refer to a
              living arahant.<br> <br> The dhamma isn't about some sort of thanatos desire to attain
              completion in the grave. It's about realizing "the end" here and
              now.<br> <br> Geoff:<br> <br> http://www.dhammawheel.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=6382&amp;start=320<br> <br> "retrofuturist wrote:some idea as to how consciousness might
              "function" ... i.e. without sankhara as its foundation"<br> <br> I think that there are numerous sutta references to the awakened
              mind which explain what is not the foundation of an arahant's
              experience. Firstly, by way of training: The seen is merely the
              seen (diá¹­á¹­hamatta). The heard is merely the heard (sutamatta). The
              sensed is merely the sensed (mutamatta). The known is merely the
              known (viññÄ�tamatta). Ud 1.10 BÄ�hiya Sutta:<br> <br> "‘The seen will be merely the seen, the heard will be merely the
              heard, the sensed will be merely the sensed, the known will be
              merely the known.’ This is how you should train, BÄ�hiya.<br> <br> When, BÄ�hiya, for you the seen will be merely the seen, the heard
              will be merely the heard, the sensed will be merely the sensed, the
              known will be merely the known, then BÄ�hiya, you will not be that.
              When, BÄ�hiya, you are not that, then BÄ�hiya, you will not be there.
              When, BÄ�hiya, you are not there, then BÄ�hiya, you will be neither
              here nor beyond nor between-the-two. Just this is the end of
              unsatisfactoriness."<br> <br> Secondly, the absence of specific fabrication (abhisaá¹…kharoti) or
              volitional intention (abhisañcetayati) towards either existence or
              non-existence. MN 140 DhÄ�tuvibhaá¹…ga Sutta:<br> <br> "One does not form any specific fabrication or volitional intention
              towards either existence or non-existence. Not forming any specific
              fabrication or volitional intention towards either existence or
              non-existence, he does not cling to anything in this world. Not
              clinging, he is not excited. Unexcited, he personally attains
              complete nibbÄ�na. He discerns that, ‘Birth is ended, the holy life
              fulfilled, done is what had to be done, there is nothing further
              here.’"<br> <br> Cf. Ven. ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda, NibbÄ�na Sermon 04:<br> <br> "What is called the cessation of consciousness has a deeper sense
              here. It means the cessation of the specifically prepared
              consciousness, abhisaá¹…khata viññÄ�á¹‡a. An arahant's experience of the
              cessation of consciousness is at the same time the experience of
              the cessation of name-and-form."<br> <br> And NibbÄ�na Sermon 06:<br> <br> "The more one sees preparations (saá¹…khÄ�ras) as preparations,
              ignorance is dispelled, and the more one dispels ignorance, the
              preparations lose their significance as preparations. Then one sees
              the nature of preparations with wisdom as signless, desireless, and
              void. So much so that, in effect, preparations cease to be
              preparations.... The relation of saá¹…khÄ�ras to ignorance is somewhat
              similar to the relation a drama has to its back-stage preparations.
              It seems, then, that from the standpoint of Dhamma the entire
              saá¹ƒsÄ�ra is a product of specifically prepared intentions, even like
              the drama with its back-stage preparations...."<br> <br> The phrase saá¹…khataá¹ƒ paá¹­iccasamuppannaá¹ƒ (e.g. M III 299), 'prepared
              and dependently arisen', suggests that the prepared nature is also
              due to that contact. What may be called abhisaá¹…khata viññÄ�á¹‡a (S III
              58), 'specifically prepared consciousness', is that sort of
              consciousness which gets attached to name-and-form. When one sees a
              film show, one interprets a scene appearing on the screen according
              to one's likes and dislikes. It becomes a thing of experience for
              him. Similarly, by imagining a self in name-and-form, consciousness
              gets attached to it. It is such a consciousness, which is
              established on name-and-form, that can be called abhisaá¹…khata
              viññÄ�á¹‡a. Then could there be also a consciousness which does not
              reflect a name-and-form? Yes, there could be. That is what is known
              as anidassana viññÄ�á¹‡a, or 'non-manifestative consciousness'.<br> <br> And thirdly, consciousness which is unestablished (appatiá¹­á¹­ha
              viññÄ�á¹‡a). SN 22.53 Upaya Sutta:<br> <br> "When that consciousness is unestablished, not increasing, not
              concocting, it is liberated. Being liberated, it is steady. Being
              steady, it is content. Being content, he is not excited. Unexcited,
              he personally attains complete nibbÄ�na. He discerns that, ‘Birth is
              ended, the holy life fulfilled, done is what had to be done, there
              is nothing further here.’"<br> <br> As for the qualm that this last passage refers to the death of an
              arahant, the phrase: "Unexcited, he personally attains complete
              nibbÄ�na. He discerns that, 'Birth is ended, the holy life
              fulfilled, done is what had to be done, there is nothing further
              here,'" is the standard paricope referring to the time of
              awakening, i.e. a statement of the attainment of arahant fruition
              (e.g. DN 15, MN 105, etc.), and not the time of death of an
              arahant.<br> <br> The above passages referring to the cognition of an arahant are
              succinctly presented in AN 4.24 KÄ�á¸·akÄ�rÄ�ma Sutta:<br> <br> "Thus, monks, the TathÄ�gata does not conceive an [object] seen when
              seeing what is to be seen. He does not conceive an unseen. He does
              not conceive a to-be-seen. He does not conceive a seer.<br> <br> He does not conceive an [object] heard when hearing what is to be
              heard. He does not conceive an unheard. He does not conceive a
              to-be-heard. He does not conceive a hearer.<br> <br> He does not conceive an [object] sensed when sensing what is to be
              sensed. He does not conceive an unsensed. He does not conceive a
              to-be-sensed. He does not conceive a senser.<br> <br> He does not conceive an [object] known when knowing what is to be
              known. He does not conceive an unknown. He does not conceive a
              to-be-known. He does not conceive a knower."<br> <br> Ven. ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda considered the KÄ�á¸·akÄ�rÄ�ma Sutta important enough to
              write a text on it.<br> <br> All the best,<br> <br> Geoff</p>

              isn't visible. There the moon doesn't appear. There darkness is not
              found. And when a sage, a brahman through sagacity, has realized
              [this] for himself, then from form &amp; formless, from bliss &amp;
              pain, he is freed."<br> <br> Some people mistaken that to imply the 'afterlife state' of an
              arahant as being devoid of anything whatsoever.<br> <br> Venerable Nanananda explains however, that what it actually means
              is this: the luminosity of mind, of wisdom, in 'non-manifestative
              consciousness' which is 'lustrous on all sides' far outshines the
              sun (and the sun's lustre already outshines the moon and the stars,
              that's why we don't see the moon or stars in a sunny
              afternoon).<br> <br> He also made clear that the cessation of the six sense bases/name
              and form doesn't mean that we don't see anything, but that we "see
              its voidness" as "an insight", we realized "void is the world",
              that which "worldlings grasp as real and truly existing gets
              penetrated through wisdom and becomes nonmanifest".<br> <br> I'm reminded of my friend Simpo who once wrote an article long ago
              in
              http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2007/03/how-is-non-duality-like.html
              - "in the deeper range of non duality, brightness becomes stronger.
              This brightness is the result of mind's deconstruction which allows
              for intense penetration into consciousness. The Brightness can be
              so intense that it is truly stunning."<br> <br> Anyway, very good explanation of Bahiya Sutta by Ven Nanananda in
              http://www.beyondthenet.net/calm/nibbana15.htm and
              http://www.beyondthenet.net/calm/nibbana16.htm<br> <br> <span>I must say, my understanding of certain
              more difficult points of the Pali Suttas have been 'revised' by
              reading this venerable's works which I think is great. Not very
              easy reading but enlightening.</span></p>

              </p><p>The  Buddha  preached  the  Gospel  of  Immortality  to </p>
              <p>the  world  for  forty  long  years. The  mortal  body,  which  was </p>
              <p>depersonalized by the Bodhisatta, in the process of waking up </p>
              <p>to Buddhahood, was visible to the public, as the body of the </p>
              <p>Buddha, and the public identified the Buddha with it. Though </p>
              <p>this body was not Buddha strictly, the Buddha appeared to the </p>
              <p>world, through this body, and preached the Gospel. When this </p>
              <p>mortal body died, however, no one could identify the Buddha </p>
              <p>as before. The Buddha seemed to disappear from the world, </p>
              <p>when this so called body of the Buddha died, even though the </p>
              <p>Buddha was still visible to one who saw the Dhamma.</p>

              <p>
              </p><p>This  apparent  disappearance  of  the  Buddha  is  called, </p>
              <p>Parinirvana,  meaning  “Complete  Nirvana,”  by  Theravada </p>
              <p>Buddhists today.  This term, however, is misleading because </p>
              <p>it implies that the “Nirvana” that the Bodhisatta achieved at </p>
              <p>the time of “waking” was incomplete. A more meaningful term </p>
              <p>is “Anupadisesa Nirvana,” which means, Nirvana without the </p>
              <p>depersonalized remains.  In contrast, the Nirvana at the time </p>
              <p>of  “waking”  is  called  “Sopadisesa  Nirvana,”  which  means, </p>
              <p>Nirvana with the depersonalized remains.  This usage of terms </p>
              <p>is preferable to the use of the term Parinirvana as “Complete </p>
              <p>Nirvana.”</p>
              <p>Even this usage of terms Sopadisesa and Anupadisesa is </p>
              <p>strictly speaking incorrect because in the Itivuttaka the Buddha </p>
              <p>points  out  that  these  terms  mean  something  else. According </p>
              <p>to this Sutta the Sopadisesa and Anupadisesa are experiences </p>
              <p>to be realized here and now, instead of one being something </p>
              <p>to be experienced in this life and the other to be experienced </p>
              <p>after death. Sopadisesa is the experience of the Arahat in the </p>
              <p>normal life, for example, when going on pindapata or when </p>
              <p>communicating with others. Anupadisesa is the experience of </p>
              <p>the Arahat when experiencing Nirodha Samapatti.</p>

              <p>Interesting... but I've also heard from Geoff that Nirodha Samapatti is not to be equated with Nibbana.<br><br>Geoff:<br><br>The KathÄ�vatthu and the
