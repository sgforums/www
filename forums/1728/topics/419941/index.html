                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Ask yourself
                      this, each moment again: How am I experiencing this moment of being alive?</span></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">It is essential for success to 
                      grasp the fact that this is your only moment of being alive. The past,
                      although it did happen, is not actual now. The future, though it will 
                      happen, is not actual now. Only now is actual. Yesterday’s
                      happiness and harmlessness does not mean a thing if one is miserable and
                       malicious now ... and a hoped-for happiness and
                      harmlessness tomorrow is to but waste this moment of being alive in 
                      waiting. All you get by waiting is more waiting. Thus any ‘change’
                      can only happen now. The jumping in point is always here ... it is at 
                      this moment in time and this place in space. Thus, if you
                      miss it this time around, hey presto ... you have another chance 
                      immediately. Life is excellent at providing opportunities like
                      this.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">What ‘I’ did, all those years 
                      ago, was to devise a remarkably effective method of ridding this body of
                      ‘me’ (I know that methods are to be actively discouraged, in some 
                      people’s eyes, but this one worked). It takes some doing
                      to start off with, but as success after success starts to multiply 
                      exponentially, it becomes automatic to have this question
                      running as an on-going thing (as a non-verbal attitude towards life ... a
                       wordless approach each moment again) because it delivers
                      the goods right here and now ... not off into some indeterminate future.
                       Plus the successes are repeatable – almost on demand
                      – and thus satisfies the ‘scientific method’. ‘I’ asked myself, each 
                      moment again: ‘How am I experiencing this moment
                      of being alive’?</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">As one knows from the pure consciousness experiences (PCE’s), which are moments of perfection everybody has
                      at some stage in their life, that it is possible to experience this moment in time and this place in space as perfection
                      personified, ‘I’ set the minimum standard of experience for myself: feeling good. If ‘I’ am not feeling good then ‘I’
                      have something to look at to find out why. What has happened, between the last time ‘I’ felt good and now? When did ‘I’
                      feel good last? Five minutes ago? Five hours ago? What happened to end those felicitous feelings? Ahh ... yes: ‘He said that and
                      I ...’. Or: ‘She didn’t do this and I ...’. Or: ‘What I wanted was ...’. Or: ‘I didn’t do ...’. And so on and so
                      on ... one does not have to trace back into one’s childhood ... usually no more than yesterday afternoon at the most (‘feeling
                      good’ is an unambiguous term – it is a general sense of well-being – and if anyone wants to argue about what feeling good
                      means ... then do not even bother trying to do this at all).</span></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Ask yourself
                      this, each moment again: How am I experiencing this moment of being alive?</span></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Once the specific moment of ceasing to feel good is pin-pointed, and the silliness of having such an incident
                      as that (no matter what it is) take away one’s enjoyment and appreciation of this only moment of being alive is seen for what it
                      is – usually some habitual reactive response – one is once more feeling good ... but with a pin-pointed cue to watch out for
                      next time so as to not have that trigger off yet another bout of the same-old same-old. This is called nipping it in the bud<a><img src="http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/images/note-icon.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="9"></a> before it gets out of hand ... with application and diligence and 
                      patience and
                      perseverance one soon gets the knack of this and more and more time is 
                      spent enjoying and appreciating this moment of being alive.
                      And, of course, once one does get the knack of this, one up-levels 
                      ‘feeling good’, as a bottom line each moment again, to ‘feeling
                      happy and harmless’ ... and after that to ‘feeling perfect’.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">The more one enjoys and 
                      appreciates being just here right now – to the point of excellence being
                       the norm
                      – the greater the likelihood of a PCE happening ... a grim and/or glum 
                      person has no chance whatsoever of allowing the magical
                      event, which indubitably shows where everyone has being going awry, to 
                      occur. Plus any analysing and/or psychologising and/or
                      philosophising whilst one is in the grip of debilitating feelings 
                      usually does not achieve much (other than spiralling around and
                      around in varying degrees of despair and despondency or whatever) 
                      anyway.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">The wide and wondrous path to an 
                      actual freedom from the human condition is marked by enjoyment and
                      appreciation – the sheer delight of being as happy and harmless as is 
                      humanly possible whilst remaining a ‘self’ – and the
                      slightest diminishment of such felicity is a warning signal (a flashing 
                      red light as it were) that one has inadvertently wandered
                      off the way.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">One is thus soon back on track ... and all because of everyday events.</span></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Ask yourself
                      this, each moment again: How am I experiencing this moment of being alive?</span></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">There is only one person in this 
                      whole wide world that one can change ... myself. This is the most 
                      important
                      point to understand thoroughly, otherwise one endlessly tries to change 
                      the other ... and as there are billions of ‘others’ it
                      would be a life-time task with still no success at the end. If one 
                      grasps that the way to peace-on-earth is by changing oneself
                      – and oneself only – then all of one’s interactions with others will 
                      undergo a radical transformation. You set them free of
                      your graceless demands ... your endless neediness born out of being 
                      alone in the world. The cause of sadness and loneliness is
                      not, as is commonly believed, alienation from others. The single reason 
                      for being alone and lonely is from not being what-I-am. By
                      not being this flesh and blood body just brimming with sensory organs, 
                      but being, instead, an identity within ‘I’ am doomed to
                      perpetual loneliness and aloneness. ‘I’ am fated to ever pursue an 
                      elusive ‘Someone’ or ‘Something’ that will fill
                      that aching void.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">When I am what-I-am, there is no 
                      void. By being what I actually am – this body only – I have no need for
                      others; hence I also have no need to place the burden upon them to 
                      fulfil that what was lacking. Not only do I free myself from
                      that perpetual pursuit, but I also free others in my company from the 
                      task ‘I’ impose upon them. Being this sensual body is
                      actual fulfilment, each moment again. Nevermore will I be needy, greedy 
                      and grasping. Nevermore will I plot and plan and
                      manipulate others. Nevermore will I have to prostitute myself to others 
                      to assuage those main attributes of the identity within:
                      being lost, lonely, frightened and cunning. Being what-I-am is to be 
                      free-flowing, spontaneous, delightful ... and it is fun, for
                      one can never be hurt again.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">One can free the heart and mind 
                      of hurts and slights ... and from succour and compliments as well. This 
                      is
                      important, for the positive is as insidious as the negative when it 
                      comes to holding on to whatever from the past and the future.
                      There must be an attainment of freedom from the past and the future in 
                      whatever form it takes, for ‘I’ am these hurts and
                      compliments ... it is, in part, what ‘I’ am made up of. ‘I’ have a 
                      vested interest in taking offence, for it endorses the
                      very nature of ‘me’ as soul. ‘I’ also thrive on receiving praise for it 
                      feeds what ‘I’ am as an ego. Both hurts and
                      compliments give both ‘I’ and ‘me’ the nourishment ‘I’ need for ‘my’ 
                      survival. By not taking offence or receiving
                      praise, ‘I’ have made a good start in undoing ‘me’. Thus the past and 
                      the future become less and less real as the sense of
                      identity, as an enduring entity continuing over time, is dependent upon 
                      an emotion-backed memory and passionate imagination
                      fuelling the fires of malice and sorrow. ‘I’ am a product of the 
                      emotional and passionate ‘real-world’ affective
                      time-span.</span></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Ask yourself
                      this, each moment again: How am I experiencing this moment of being alive?</span></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Another part of what ‘I’ am made 
                      up of is beliefs: one’s sense of being a social identity is largely
                      made up of beliefs ... beliefs as well as feelings. In fact, a belief is
                       an emotion-backed thought ... passionate imagination. The
                      vast majority of the beliefs that one carries are not invented by 
                      oneself; they were imbibed with the mother’s milk and added to
                      thereupon up to the present day. They are inherited beliefs, put into 
                      the child with love and fear – reward and punishment –
                      and added to as an adult out of awe and dread – the carrot and the stick
                       – that power and authority engenders and thrives
                      upon. It behoves one to examine each and every belief – especially those
                       that pass for ‘truths’ – and watch them disappear
                      out of one’s life forever. It is no wonder human beings are such a 
                      desperate lot. Beliefs and feelings are the bane of humankind
                      ... they have been so instrumental in killing, maiming, torturing and 
                      otherwise causing such pain and suffering since the dawn of
                      human history, that one wonders that they are given any credence at all 
                      these days. It is so liberating to be free of beliefs –
                      of the action of believing itself – and feelings that I cannot recommend
                       their elimination highly enough.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Thus, by asking ‘how am I 
                      experiencing this moment of being alive,’ the reward is immediate; by 
                      finding
                      out what triggered off the loss of the felicitous feeling, one commences
                       another period of enjoying and appreciating this moment
                      of being alive. It is all about being here at this moment in time and 
                      this place in space ... and if you are not feeling happy and
                      harmless you have no chance whatsoever of being here in this actual 
                      world (a glum and/or grumpy person locks themselves out of the
                      perfect purity of this moment and place). And by having already 
                      established feeling good (a general sense of well-being) as the
                      bottom line for moment-to-moment experiencing then if, or when, feeling 
                      happy and harmless fades there is that comfortable
                      baseline from which to suss out where, when, how, why – and what for – 
                      the feeling of being happy and harmless ceased
                      happening ... and all the while feeling good whilst going about it.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Furthermore if, or when, there is a sinking below the bottom line, and feeling bad (a general sense of
                      ill-being) is the moment-to-moment experiencing then, rather than trying to suss out where, when, how, why – and what for –
                      the general sense of well-being (feeling good) ceased occurring, it is far more useful to first get to a stage of being neutral,
                      because, when in the feeling bad position, feeling good can appear to be so, so far away ... indeed, at times, feeling good can
                      seem to but a dream, a fancy, a chimera, a will-o’-the-wisp, from that position, and what’s the point anyway, that method didn’t
                      work either (of course), it’s all stupid, life sucks, and ... and all the rest of those self-pitying, self-justifying, defeatist
                      assertions.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">As the step from being neutral to feeling good is not such a big step then one is soon back on track again.</span></p>

                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Ask yourself
                      this, each moment again: How am I experiencing this moment of being alive?</span></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">These are all feelings, this is not perfection personified yet ... but then again, feeling perfect for twenty
                      three hours and fifty nine minutes a day (a virtual freedom) is way beyond normal human expectations anyway. Also, it is a very
                      tricky way of both getting men fully into their feelings for the first time in their life and getting women to examine their
                      feelings one by one instead of being run by a basketful of them all at once. One starts to feel ‘alive’.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Being ‘alive’ is to be paying 
                      attention – exclusive attention – to this moment in time and this place
                      in space. This attention becomes fascination ... and fascination leads 
                      to reflective contemplation. Then – and only then –
                      apperception can occur. An apperceptive awareness can be evoked by 
                      paying exclusive attention to being fully alive right now. This
                      moment is your only moment of being alive ... one is never alive at any 
                      other time than now. And, wherever you are, one is always
                      here ... even if you start walking over to ‘there’, along the way to 
                      ‘there’ you are always here ... and when you arrive
                      ‘there’, it too is here. Thus attention becomes a fascination with the 
                      fact that one is always here ... and it is already now.
                      Fascination leads to reflective contemplation. As one is already here, 
                      and it is always now ... then one has arrived before one
                      starts.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">The potent combination of attention, fascination, reflection and contemplation produces apperception, which
                      happens when the mind becomes aware of itself. Apperception is an awareness of consciousness. It is not ‘I’ being aware of ‘me’
                      being conscious; it is the mind’s awareness of itself. Apperception – a way of seeing that can be arrived at by reflective and
                      fascinating contemplative thought – is when ‘I’ cease thinking and thinking takes place of its own accord ... and ‘me’
                      disappears along with all the feelings. Such a mind, being free of the thinker and the feeler – ‘I’ as ego and ‘me’ as
                      soul – is capable of immense clarity and purity ... as a sensate body only, one is automatically benevolent and benign.</span></p>

                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">It is really important to understand about the soul (‘me’ at the core of ‘my’ being is ‘being’
                      itself) ... getting into feelings like this – ‘perfect’ feelings – leaves one in imminent danger of the seductive snare of
                      Love and Beauty, and, conveniently ignoring their opposites, becoming enlightened, or at least illuminated. ‘Me’ – that
                      intuition of ‘being’ that I call the soul – sugar coats itself with Love and Compassion and Beauty and Truth and swans along
                      in a state of Blissful Euphoria. Thus one then goes off into some mystical State of Being in some metaphysical world and misses
                      out on the clean and clear and pure perfection of this actual world. It is very, very difficult to get out of the enlightened
                      state and go ‘beyond it’ into this actual world of the senses.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">I found out for myself how difficult it was as I lived enlightenment for eleven years ... the same as the ‘Tried
                      and True’ teachings that all the Saints and the Sages and the Seers, the Messiahs and the Masters, the Avatars and the Saviours
                      and the Gurus and the God-men have been touting as being the cure-all for the ill of humankind for millennia. I found these
                      solutions to be the ‘Tried and Failed’. I found that, in an altered state of consciousness such as spiritual enlightenment
                      which results when the ego dissolves, the sense of identity does a quantum leap from the head to the heart. One realises oneself
                      as being ‘Me’ at the core of ‘my’ being ... one becomes ‘pure being’ (usually capitalised as ‘Being’ upon
                      Realisation). The resultant oceanic state of unitary perception – called by some choiceless awareness – creates the delusion
                      that the illusion of ‘self’ is ended. There is an on-going experience of oneness and wholeness which expresses itself as: ‘I
                      am everything and everything is Me’. For those who go all the way into this delusion, they realise that ‘I am The Self’ or
                      ‘I am Buddha’ or ‘I am God’ or ‘I am That’ and so on.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">It is possible to extinguish this identity – this ‘Me’ which is the second ‘I’ of Mr. Venkataraman
                      Ramana fame – and go beyond enlightenment into an actual freedom. One then lives in this actual world of sensual delight that
                      under-pins both the illusory grim and glum ‘everyday reality’ experienced by 5.8 billion people and the delusory loving and
                      compassionate ‘Greater Reality’ experienced by 0.000001 of the population. Then one is both happy and harmless automatically.</span></p>

                  <hr>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">You need to have a keen sense of humour. This business of becoming free is not – contrary to popular
                      opinion – a serious business at all. Be totally sincere ... most definitely utterly sincere, as genuineness is essential. But
                      serious ... no way. An actual freedom is all about having fun; about enjoying being here; about delighting in being alive. All
                      that ‘being serious’ stuff actively works against peace-on-earth. One has to want to be here on this planet ... most people
                      resent being here and wish to escape. This method will bring one into being more fully here than anyone has ever been before. If
                      you do not want to be here, then forget it.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Your feeling of being – the real ‘me’ – is what is evidenced when one says: ‘But what about me,
                      nobody loves me for me’! For a woman it is: ‘You only want me for my body ... and not for me’. For a man it is: ‘You only
                      want me for my money ... and not for me’. For a child it is: ‘You only want to be my friend because of my toys (or sweets or
                      whatever)’. This intuitive sense of ‘me’ – this being – arises out of the basic instinctual passions that blind nature
                      endowed us all with as a rough and ready ‘soft-ware’ package to make a start in life. These passions – mainly fear and
                      aggression and nurture and desire – appear as a rudimentary animal ‘self’. This is why it is felt to be one’s ‘Original
                      Face’ – to use the Zen terminology – if one is open to ‘what is’.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Being born of the biologically 
                      inherited instincts genetically encoded in the germ cells of the 
                      spermatozoa
                      and the ova, ‘I’ am – genetically – umpteen hundreds of thousands of 
                      years old ... ‘my’ origins are lost in the mists
                      of pre-history. ‘I’ am so anciently old that ‘I’ may well have always 
                      existed ... carried along on the reproductive
                      cell-line, over countless millennia, from generation to generation. And 
                      ‘I’ am thus passed on into an inconceivably open-ended
                      and hereditably transmissible future. Biologically all sentient beings 
                      are – very fundamentally only – identical. The survival
                      instinct (fear and aggression and nurture and desire in some form or 
                      another) is more or less common to all creatures and has been
                      essential to get sentient life to this point in the earth’s history ... 
                      it is what got this body and that body and every body
                      here in the first place. All peoples living today are the end-point of 
                      myriads of survivors passing on their genes ... every body
                      is the product of the ‘success story’ of fear and aggression and nurture
                       and desire.</span></p>

                      and perfection of the infinitude of this physical universal with a pure intent born out of the PCE that one has during a peak
                      experience. Pure intent is a palpable life-force; an actually occurring stream of benevolence and  benignity that originates
                      in the vast and utter stillness that is the essential character of the universe itself. Once set in motion, it is no longer a
                      matter of choice: it is an irresistible pull. It is the adventure of a lifetime to embark upon a voyage of exploration and
                      discovery; to not only seek but to find. And once found, it is here for the term of one’s natural life ... it is an irreversible
                      mutation in consciousness. Once launched it is impossible to turn back and resume one’s normal life ... one has to be absolutely
                      sure that this is what one truly wants.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">One simply needs to look at the physical world and just know that this enormous construct called the universe
                      is not ‘set up’ for us humans to be forever forlorn and feisty in with only scant moments of reprieve. ‘I’ can realise
                      here and now that it is not and can never be some ‘sick cosmic joke’ that humans all have to endure and ‘make the best of’.
                      ‘I’ will feel foolish that ‘I’ have believed for all these years that the ‘wisdom of the real-world’ that ‘I’ have
                      inherited – the world that ‘I’ was born into – is set in stone. This foolish feeling allows ‘me’ to get in touch with
                      ‘my’ dormant naiveté, which is the closest thing one has that resembles actual innocence, and activate it with a naive
                      enthusiasm to undo all the conditioning and brainwashing that ‘I’ have been subject to. When ‘I’ look into myself and at
                      all the people around and see the sorrow and malice in every human being, ‘I’ can not stop. ‘I’ know that ‘I’ have
                      just devoted myself to the task of setting ‘myself’ and ‘humanity’ free ... ‘I’ willingly dedicate my life to this
                      most worthy cause. It is so delicious to devote oneself to something whole-heartedly – the ‘boots and all’ approach!</span></p>

                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">This entails finding the source of ‘myself’ ... and ‘I’ discover that a ‘being’ arises out of the
                      instinctual passions that blind nature endows all sentient beings with at birth. This ‘being’ – the rudimentary self – is
                      the root cause of all the malice and sorrow that besets humankind, and to eliminate malice and sorrow ‘I’ have to eliminate
                      the fear and aggression and nurture and desire that this ‘being’ is made up of ... the instinctual passions. But as this ‘being’
                      is the instinctual passions – there is no differentiation betwixt the two – then the elimination of one is the elimination of
                      the other. In fact, with the elimination of these passions, ‘I’ cease to exist as ‘me’, a ‘being’ in the body, period.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">Psychological/psychic 
                      self-immolation is the only sensible sacrifice that ‘I’ as ‘me’ being 
                      can make
                      in order to reveal that which is actual. And that which is actual is a 
                      clear and clean and pure perfection. Life is bursting with
                      meaning when ‘I’/‘me’ are no longer present to mess things up. ‘I’/‘me’ 
                      stand in the way of the clarity and purity
                      of the clean perfection of the actual being apparent. ‘My’ very presence
                       prohibits this ever-present perfection being evident.
                      ‘I’ as ‘me’ being prevents the very purity of life, that ‘I’ am 
                      searching for, from coming into plain view. With ‘my’
                      demise, this ever-fresh perfection is now manifest. Peace-on-earth was 
                      here in this actual world all the time.</span></p>
                  <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: nromal;">It is all so simple, in the actual world; no effort is needed to meet the requisite morality of society. I
                      have no ‘dark nature’, no unconscious impulses to curb, to control, to restrain. It is all so easy, in the actual world; I can
                      take no credit for my apparently virtuous behaviour because actual freedom automatically provides beneficial thoughts and deeds.
                      It is all so spontaneous, in the actual world; I do not do it – it does itself. Vanity, egoism, selfishness – all self-centred
                      activity has ceased to operate when ‘I’ as ‘me’ being ceased to be. And it is all so peaceful, in the actual world; it is
                      only in actualism that human beings can have peace-on-earth without toiling fruitlessly to be ‘good’. The answer to everything
                      that has puzzled humankind for all of human history is readily elucidated when one is actually free.</span></p>
