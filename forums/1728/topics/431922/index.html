              <p>A dharma sister shared with us her encounters with non Buddhists who were from the heavenly religion. These non Buddhists said Buddha was an irresponsible man because he left his wife and son to seek enlightenment. I believe this thought is being input by their "teachers". It is another misconception that Buddhists need to correct or rebutt.</p>
              <p>Of course Buddha was not an irresponsible man. He was a Great man who had saved countless sentiment beings including his wife and son  from the suffering of rebirth cycle.</p>
              <p>If I meet these people, I will tell them that someone up there was also very irresponsible because he did not keep those forbidden apples out of the reach of humans. Responsible parents will keep dangerous drugs out of the reach of their children.</p>

              <p>beside, Buddha's mother Maya died shortly right after Buddha was born 7 days after. hence the saying that Buddha was unfillial to her cannot stand. Buddha is still a baby.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>According to legend, Suddhodana lamented his son's departure and spent considerable effort attempting to locate him. Years later, after word of Siddhartha's <a title="Bodhi" href="/wiki/Bodhi"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">enlightenment</span></span></a> reached Suddhodana, he sent a messenger with 10,000 companions to invite Siddhartha back to the Shakya land. The Buddha proceeded to preach to the messenger and all 10,000 companions who in turn decided to join the <a title="Sangha" href="/wiki/Sangha"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Sangha</span></span></a> and never return. Suddhodana then sent a close friend of Siddhartha's, Kaludayi, to invite him to return. Kaludayi also chose to become a monk, but kept his word to invite the Buddha back to his homeland. The Buddha accepted his father's invitation and returned to visit his homeland. During this visit, he preached the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Dhamma" href="/wiki/Dhamma"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Dhamma</span></span></a> to Suddhodana.</p>
              <p>Many years later, when the Buddha heard of Suddhodana's impending death, he once again returned to his homeland and preached further to Suddhodana at his deathbed. King Suddhodana attained <a class="mw-redirect" title="Arhant" href="/wiki/Arhant"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Arhantship</span></span></a>.</p>

              <p>You are absolutely correct. They are unrational to the extend that they can bend their religion belief to attack Buddhism.</p>
              <p>These non Buddhists said Guan Yin Pusa and Buddha are transformed from ghosts. ï¼ˆé¬¼å�˜çš„ï¼‰because they were once humans. This saying is very widespread in the heavely religion because their "teacher" told them so. They also use this unrational belief to convert others.</p>
              <p>My question is they believe in only heaven and hell, they don't believe in ghost realm, so where does the ghost logic come from? I wonder why the followers did not think deep enough to question their "teacher".</p>
              <p>Next time, when someone tells you guys this, question them back how do the ghosts come about if there are only heaven and hell.</p>
