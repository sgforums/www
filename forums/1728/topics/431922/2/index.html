              <p>Well, what the heavenly religion point out is true in a certain way from the view point of family. How you defend is from the point of Shayamuni religious work-universal salvation for all mankind.</p>
              <p>However, as we could point out to them that Shayamuni did not leave the family in a state of begging instead they were living in luxury as queen and prince. On the contrary, Shayamuni is living as a beggar. Given a choice for modern woman, I think they will choose the former with tonne of material benefit at their disposal. Secondly, the family did reconcile after a few years which imply that Shayamuni is concern for their well being. As you have point out they become their disciple. In fact, in Lotus Sutra, Shayamuni propheised that they will become buddha.</p>
              <p>Perhaps we as Buddhist can turn around and check with them about biblical stuff. Jesus also leave the family to preach the gospel for 3 years. There is no biblical reference if Jesus provide for them  for 3 years until his death. One thing for sure the family is not well to do. To leave the old folks in order to pursue an idea. Isn't it unfillial and selfish? </p>
              <p>Hence, in comparison of family responsibility, I think Shayamuni has did a better job. At least, the family will not need to worries when the next meal will arrive.</p>
              <p>Finally, if we put both man on par, we can said for sure, both man was born with a mission to save mankinds from self destruction. Sometime in order to accomplished their calling, they will need to sacrifice their family ties.</p>

              <p>There is a Zen story, how a monk keep pouring tea into a disciple's cup when they were having tea. The disciple tell the master, " is everything alrite? can't u see my cup is full." The master answered, " Because your cup is full so when I pour in the tea, it will overflow instead being hold by the cup. Hence in the same manner so is your mind. Because your mind is full of self opinion and ego. Therefore, it cannot accept the thinking of others."</p>

              <p>Yeah, I admire your determination to find the truth and stand by the truth. There are many Buddhists who are in the same situation as you (including me) but we do not give up because it is not easy to be born as humans. Since we are "lucky" to be born as humans in this life, we should cherish and practice hard not to be reborn again. Don't be like others, æ�¥äººé—´ç™½èµ°ä¸€è¶Ÿã€‚</p>

              <p>bro, hinduism older than Judaism de. den why u not in Judaism? Buddhism can say is a 'reform' of hinduism.  hard to say the real age of Buddhism as Buddha never consider time and space as real like Einstein. hence during then they never use date. the chinese calender took it to be 3000++ back.  </p>
              <p>heaven of all religions are temporary. as its sign of ordinary happiness. Nirvana/pureland is "eternal" which is the sign of pure bliss and peace.</p>
              <p>Earth store pusa is not afriad of hell let alone Buddha. He's saving beings in hell show boundless compassion instead of cowardice.</p>
              <p>best u both sides also don't offend and keep quiet rather than anyhow slander. be good can liao. good bye, bro.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Ordinally happiness when ended, suffering occur there after. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Know that suffering is real, and happiness is false. As suffering don't become happiness, but happiness can become suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Example, when eating good food. Eating your favourite food is happiness. But, if you were to continue to eat bowl after bowl of the same food, it becomes a suffering. This is how happiness become suffering. happiness if continuous become suffering. But suffering if continue does not become happiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Example, when hungry, i am experiencing suffering. If one continue to stay hungry for 7 days, one will experience more suffering, not happiness. So suffering is real, and happiness is false.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Now neither suffering nor happiness is a good experience/realm. But one cannot sustain this state as time waits for no man. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Example when we are born, we are already walking towards the deathbed. Who can stop moving? None. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">But it's said that in Nirvanic Bliss(Ulitmate Joy), there's no all above three forms of sufferings. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In this samsara world there's duality. Suffering and joy is Prejudiced view for one side or the other. If Ulitmate Joy has no suffering, then Joy is also gone. As it's<span>  </span>on the same side with suffering. One gone, the other is gone too. It's when both suffering and joy is ended that bring forth the Ulitmate Reality of Nirvana (aka </span><span style="font-family: SimSun; font-size: 10pt;    " lang="ZH-CN">æ¥µæ¨‚</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">, Ulitmate Bliss). Thus called True bliss/joy. If there's joy, then joy is suffering and False. Ulitmate Joy is indeed inconcievable!

              <p>bro, hinduism older than Judaism de. den why u not in Judaism? Buddhism can say is a 'reform' of hinduism.  hard to say the real age of Buddhism as Buddha never consider time and space as real like Einstein. hence during then they never use date. the chinese calender took it to be 3000++ back.  </p>
              <p>heaven of all religions are temporary. as it sign of ordinary happiness. Nirvana/pureland is "eternal".</p>
              <p>Earth store pusa is not afriad of hell let alone Buddha. He's saving beings in hell show boundless compassion instead of cowardice.</p>

              <p>Extract from Di Zang (Ksitigarbha) Sutra:</p>
              <p>The Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha then addressed the Holy Mother, saying, "In southern Jambudvipa, the retribution for various sins is as follows: If someone should fail to fulfill his filial duty toward his parents or, at worst, kill or harm them, he will fall into Avici Hell, where he will remain for thousands of myriads of millions of kalpas without a date for release. <strong>If someone should shed the blood of a Buddha, ridicule the Three Jewels or fail to respect the sutras, he, also, will fall into Avici Hell, where he will remain for thousands of myriads of millions of kalpas without a date for release. (ä¸‡æ­»ä¸‡ç”Ÿï¼Œè‹¦æ— é—´æ–­)</strong></p>
              <p>Lady Maya addressed Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha again, asking him, "What is that hell known as Avici?"</p>
              <p>Ksitigarbha replied, "O Holy Mother, the hells of various worlds are situated inside the great Cakravada (ring of iron-enclosed mountains). There are eighteen major hells. Also, there are five hundred secondary ones with different designations, and there are, in addition, hundreds of thousands of lesser ones, each one having a different designation as well. One of these is the unique hell which is known as Avici. As for Avici Hell, its dreadful walls circumscribe more than eighty thousand miles, are ten thousand miles high and are made entirely of iron. Fiery flames shoot out of these walls, covering them entirely from top to bottom and, again, from bottom to top. Iron serpents and iron hounds spit out fiery flames and chase about, running along the hellish walls in an east-west direction.</p>
