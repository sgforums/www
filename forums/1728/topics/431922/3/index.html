              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">There is a story of a frog and a scorpion who both wanted to cross a river together.<span>  </span>The scorpion promised not to sting the frog if the frog would carry it across the river.<span>  </span>The frog taking the scorpion’s word, carried the scorpion on its back.<span>  </span>Half-way across the journey, the scorpion stung the frog and the frog was paralysed.<span>  </span>The frog asked, “Why did you do that for knowing we are going to die together?”<span>  </span>The scorpion replied,” It’s my nature.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Buddha considered gratitude as a great virtue, yet it is rare in any society.<span>  </span>You cannot always expect others to be grateful for what you have done for them.<span>  </span>People are inclined to be forgetful especially when it comes to remembering favours.<span>  </span>If others fail to show gratitude, learn to accept them as such, then you can avoid disappointment.<span>  </span>You can be happy regardless of whether people are grateful or ungrateful for your kindness or help.<span>  </span>You need only think that you have done your duty as a human being to your fellow beings.<span>  </span>That should be the only reward you should seek.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Remember … In Christianity, Heaven is a gift.<span>  </span>It is not achieved through fanaticism, this I am sure.</span></p>

              <p><br>From your above response to my post, it clearly proves that you don't know christianity well to even condemn other religions.    What I said is the very basic of Christianity that every Christian should know and I am surprised you don't know about it .   To you other than Christianity everything else is satanic.    I deem it you are satanic to even have lustful thoughts.    Lust is a sin.     Again, I see your problem as mental, your priority is to solve your mental problem, religion is not your immediate need now.   Go IMH , they will be able to help you.  </p>
              <p>I can tell you are evil going round condemning others and their religions.    You are just plain empty, very empty as a whole human being including spiritually.   </p>

              <p><strong>Question: "What does it mean that man is made in the image of God?"<br><br>Answer: </strong>On the last day of creation, God said, “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%201.26"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 1:26</span></span></a>). Thus, He finished His work with a “personal touch.” God formed man from the dust and gave him life by sharing His own breath (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%202.7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 2:7</span></span></a>). Accordingly, man is unique among all God’s creations, having both a material body and an immaterial soul/spirit. <br><br>Having the “image” or “likeness” of God means, in the simplest terms, that we were made to resemble God. Adam did not resemble God in the sense of God’s having flesh and blood. Scripture says that “God is spirit” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%204.24"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 4:24</span></span></a>) and therefore exists without a body. However, Adam’s body did mirror the life of God insofar as it was created in perfect health and was not subject to death.<br><br>The image of God refers to the immaterial part of man. It sets man apart from the animal world, fits him for the dominion God intended him to have over the earth (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%201.28"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 1:28</span></span></a>), and enables him to commune with his Maker. It is a likeness mentally, morally, and socially.<br><br>Mentally, man was created as a rational, volitional agent. In other words, man can reason and man can choose. This is a reflection of God’s intellect and freedom. Anytime someone invents a machine, writes a book, paints a landscape, enjoys a symphony, calculates a sum, or names a pet, he or she is proclaiming the fact that we are made in God’s image.<br><br>Morally, man was created in righteousness and perfect innocence, a reflection of God’s holiness. God saw all He had made (mankind included) and called it “very good” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%201.31"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 1:31</span></span></a>). Our conscience or “moral compass” is a vestige of that original state. Whenever someone writes a law, recoils from evil, praises good behavior, or feels guilty, he is confirming the fact that we are made in God’s own image.<br><br>Socially, man was created for fellowship. This reflects God's triune nature and His love. In Eden, man’s primary relationship was with God (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%203.8"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 3:8</span></span></a> implies fellowship with God), and God made the first woman because “it is not good for the man to be alone” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%202.18"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 2:18</span></span></a>). Every time someone marries, makes a friend, hugs a child, or attends church, he is demonstrating the fact that we are made in the likeness of God.<br><br>Part of being made in God’s image is that Adam had the capacity to make free choices. Although he was given a righteous nature, Adam made an evil choice to rebel against his Creator. In so doing, Adam marred the image of God within himself, and he passed that damaged likeness on to all his descendants (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%205.12"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 5:12</span></span></a>). Today, we still bear the image of God (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/James%203.9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">James 3:9</span></span></a>), but we also bear the scars of sin. Mentally, morally, socially, and physically, we show the effects of sin.<br><br>The good news is that when God redeems an individual, He begins to restore the original image of God, creating a “new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ephesians%204.24"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ephesians 4:24</span></span></a>). That redemption is only available by God’s grace through faith in Jesus Christ as our Savior from the sin that separates us from God (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ephesians%202.8-9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ephesians 2:8-9</span></span></a>).

              <p>There is no need to be a psychiatrist to know that a person has mental problem.    Your behaviour pattern obviously tell people who have been observing you that you are having mental problem.     Anyway, many siao lang with the unusual behaviour pattern will not admit they have mental problem, you happen to be one of them.</p>

That redemption is only available by God’s grace through faith in Jesus Christ as our Savior from the sin that separates us from God (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ephesians%202.8-9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ephesians 2:8-9</span></span></a>). Through Christ, we are made new creations in the likeness of God (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Corinthians%205.17"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">2 Corinthians 5:17</span></span></a>).</p>

              <p>There is no need to be a psychiatrist to know that a person has mental problem.    Your behaviour pattern obviously tell people who have been observing you that you are having mental problem.     Anyway, many siao lang with the unusual behaviour pattern will not admit they have mental problem, you happen to be one of them.</p>
