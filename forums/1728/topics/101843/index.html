Penor Rinpoche, will be gracing Singapore again in December during his global trips to bestow teachings and empowerment.<br><br>During His visit here, He will be presiding over The Grand Orgyen Norla Empowerment, which will last for 3 days from 3 December to 5 December, at Yeo's Building.</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>For further programmes information, please go to the following website:<br><br>http://www.palyulsg.org/Orgyen%20Norla_program.htm</strong></span><br><br><img src="http://www.palyulsg.org/pic/hhpr_photo.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong><span class="large">BRIEF HISTORY OF HIS HOLINESS PENOR RINPOCHE<br></span></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>H.H. Drubwang Pema Norbu Rinpoche, also known as Penor Rinpoche, is an emanation of the great Indian Dzogchen adept Vimalamitra, who was born in 1932 in Eastern Tibet.  He was brought to Palyul Monastery, the seat of his former incarnations and was enthroned as the incarnation of the 2nd Drubwang Penor Rinpoche and the 11th Throne-holder of Palyul Monastery at the age of five.<br><br>In 1959, he foresaw the irreversibility of the Chinese Occupation and decided to depart for India in order to keep the flame of Buddha Dharma burning brightly so that sentient beings would not plunge into the darkness and gloom of ignorance. Penor Rinpoche moved to Mysore, southern India, in 1961 together with 600 people and re-established the great Palyul Namdroling Monastery. This was by no means an easy task, as he had only a paltry sum of 300 rupees to rebuild his entire life and that of his monastery. Penor Rinpoche had, however, insurmountable hidden resources Â– his enormous courage and determination.  The inexhaustible energy and commitment that Penor Rinpoche invested has borne him abundant fruits.  Today, the Palyul Namdroling Monastery in India, with over 5000 monks and nuns, can be said to be the largest Nyingma monastery outside of Tibet.<br><br>Despite his commitments at Namdroling Monastery, Penor RinpocheÂ’s compassionate benevolence sees him tirelessly traveling around the world bestowing teachings and empowerments, conducting prayers and establishing Dharma Centres to benefit the local populace in India, the Himalayas, Asia and the West.<br><br>There is no limit to the extent of Penor RinpocheÂ’s selfless, enlightened activities and powerful miraculous deeds.  His efforts for the doctrine and sentient beings are equal only to the limits of space. May his life be firm!</strong></span><br><br></div>
