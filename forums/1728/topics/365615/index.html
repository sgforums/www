              <p><strong>His Eminence Ngor Ewan Phende Rinpoche</strong></p>
              <p>The "Deep Vision of the Non-differentiation of <em>Samsara-Nirvana</em>"
                  is a teaching which His Eminence Ngor Ewan Phende Rinpoche gave when he
                  was in Singapore in 1982. We are grateful to him for so kindly
                  providing us with an English translation of the text for publication in
                  <em>One 
                  Vehicle</em> when he was back in France. Lama Jamguene Ngawang Lepa is the famous author of the following text.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.vajrasana.org/ngawanglepa.jpg" alt="Gaton Ngawang Legpa"></p>
              <p><em>"HERE IS CONTAINED THE ESSENTIAL SUMMARY OF THE VIEW OF
                  NON-DIFFERENTIATION OF SAMSARA-NIRVANA, CALLED THE ESSENCE OF NECTAR
                  FOR GOOD MERIT"</em></p>
              <p><em>  Prostration to Lama JAMPAYANG, who grants us the Wisdom View of Knowledge in all things' Essence.</em></p>
              <p>  If we summarize all the apparently diverse opinions concerning 
                  the Masters of the Middle Path, we obtain the outer and approximate Middle Path and the inner, precise and subtle Middle Path.</p>
              <p>  The first category is the view of the Prasangikas who hold for
                  real everything that is perceived by their senses. At the time when all
                  treatises of the <em>Sastras</em> were explained and during the great debates that ensued this view was held.</p>
              <p>  The second category is the view that considers that all
                  external appearances end up in the mind which is finally placed in its
                  own nature, free of all manifestation. In their training of Yoga, the
                  adepts practise mostly this view in a solitary place.</p>
              <p>  Relating to this, Atisa has said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"During all the contradictory debates with non-Buddhists at 
                  the time of the debates</em> <br><em>concerning the Great Treatises of commentaries, it was said to be the Middle Path.</em> <br><em>And, at the time of the training to the true sense in the practice of Yoga, it is the Subtle</em> <br><em>Middle Path which is practised and constitutes the essential oral Teaching."</em></p>
              <p>  Greater details are to be found in Atisha's <em>dBuma 
                  Rinpoche'i sGronMe </em>along with the sources of his commentaries, as it is 
                  said in the <em>Legs bShad Gon-Ma'i dGons rGyan</em>.</p>
              <p>  Thus, it is said that our own Tradition of the view of non-differentiation of <em>Samsara-Nirvana</em> agrees with the second Tradition.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Concerning the way of meditating:</em></strong></p>
              <p>  First of all, it is indicated in the explanatory Teachings, all the <em>dharmas</em> of the phenomenal world of <em>Samsara </em>(cyclic existence) 
                  and of <em>Nirvana</em>, are only reflections of mind itself.</p>
              <p><em>  </em>This lack of existence of the smallest <em>dharma</em> outside the mind is asserted by:</p>
              <p>  a) references to quotations, 
                  <br>  b) logical deduction, 
                  and
                  <br>  c) the Essential Teachings.</p>
              <p><strong><em>a) THE QUOTATIONS</em></strong></p>
              <p>  It is said in the <em>mDo sDe Sa bCu Pa</em>:</p>
              <p>  <em>"Oh, Sons of Buddhas, in the end the three Spheres are 
                  nothing but 
                  Mind."</em></p>
              <p>In the <em>rDorje Gur</em>:</p>
              <p>  <em>"Outside the Precious Mind, there is neither Buddhas nor 
                  beings, nor any object external</em> <br><em>of consciousness."</em></p>
              <p>In the <em>Chad Ma Rigs gTer</em>:</p>
              <p>  <em>"In truth, appearances are Mind itself and do not exist 
                  outside of it; they are classfied into</em> <br><em>true or false according to tendencies being long-lasting or not."</em></p>
              <p>  It is also explained by numerous other quotations.</p>
              <p><strong><em>b) LOGICAL DEDUCTION</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>  "A unique object able to appear manifoldly is actually devoid of all reality." </em>So it is said.</p>
              <p>  Thus, a cup of water will appear differently to the six types
                  of beings and in that way, we'll know that appearances are devoid of
                  all external reality. It is by experiencing that external appearances
                  are devoid of all external reality that this will come to truth.</p>
              <p>  In the past, a great adept of the 'Path and its Fruits'
                  (Essential Teaching of the Sakyapas) had a sensation of thirst caused
                  by his winds and channels. Unable to find any water in a well, spring,
                  or river, and totally puzzled, he hung his monk's clothes on a tree on
                  the other side of the river and went to sleep. The next morning, waking
                  with his sensation of dryness gone, he realized that water was flowing
                  as it did before in the well, spring and river. He was then forced to
                  use a small craft to get his clothes back.</p>
              <p>  Another time, in India, a son who had a lot of respect for his old mother, left the country to do 
                  business. Upon leaving, he told his wife to please take care of his mother and to be sure to feed 
                  her good and pure food.</p>
              <p>  During the son's long absence, the old lady caught an eye disease which made the rice she was 
                  given appear to be full of hairs. This, in turn, made her very weak due to a swollen stomach.</p>
              <p>  Upon returning, the son asked the old mother if she had been well taken care of.</p>
              <p>  <em>"After you left, your wife never gave me good food, except this rice full of hairs which</em> <br><em>now made me sick with a bad stomach."</em></p>
              <p><em>  </em>The son reprimanded his wife, who in turn answered him:</p>
              <p>  <em>"I have only given her good food, but it seems that she has an eye disease. Go and bring</em> <br><em>her food yourself."</em></p>
              <p>  So, the son brought perfectly clean rice to his old mother who said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"In older days, you had a lot of respect for me, but it seems that now you're under your</em> <br><em>wife's thumb. This rice is full of hair!"</em></p>
              <p>  Understanding that her eyes were bad, he told her to keep the rice and called upon a doctor. 
                  After having been treated, he asked his mother to look at the rice. And since there wasn't any 
                  hair in the rice, the old lady understood that her disease was the cause, and thought:</p>
              <p>  <em>"How can my stomach be sick if I've not swallowed a single hair?"</em></p>
              <p>  Reassured, her stomach problems disappeared as the rainbow vanishes in the sky. So it is told.</p>
              <p><strong><em>c) THE ESSENTIAL TEACHINGS</em></strong></p>
              <p>  Concerning the assertion from the spiritual instructions given by each of the Lineage's Lamas, it is said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"Sickness and disease numb and deceive the mind like a disease veils the eyesight or</em> <br><em>like a blazing point swirling rapidly."</em></p>
              <p>  Having thus thought about this truth which is asserted by the above three quotations, arguments 
                  and spiritual instructions, all appearances will be perceived as Mind.</p>
              <p>  For example, when salt absorbs itself in water, it becomes one with water. 
                  In the same way, we should understand that no existing <em>dharma</em> is different from Mind.</p>
              <p>  And lastly, we'll even doubt an external existence (different from mind) of our own body. But, 
                  concerning the authentic fusion of Mind-Perception, it is said that it does not appear until the 
                  Eighth Land is reached.</p>
              <p>  Although the fusion of Mind-Perception of the preceding Land is not really the authentic one, 
                  it still appears as an experience during the practice of Yoga.</p>
              <p>  Those who wonder if the realization of appearances of Mind-as-such, is not precisely the 
                  Prasangikas' Tradition of the Middle Path, are in fact totally wrong.</p>
              <p>  In fact, Klu-sGrub, 'Phags-Pa Lha and ZLa Ba Grags-Pa have all three asserted that perceptions 
                  are only Mind, and who dares say that they do not understand the Prasangikas' view?</p>
              <p>  The great Savant Mi-Pham rGya-mCho has explained it thus in his <em>dBu-Ma rGyan-'Grel</em>:</p>
              <p>  <em>"To realize that all perceptions are Mind-as-such is the 
                  essential
                  characteristic of the</em> <br><em>Buddhist Path's holders; true situation 
                  of all
                  objects, it is the sacred point of the Essential</em> <br><em>Teachings 
                  relating
                  to meditation. To destroy the illusion of phenomenal existence, it is</em> <br><em>the essential hint, just as it is essential for the butcher to 
                  know the animal's vital point</em> <br><em>in order to kill it, or for the 
                  lumberjack to know where to plant his nail in order to dry</em> <br><em>out the tree.</em></p>
              <p><em>  If we can hold it (the essential point) due to skilful 
                  means, it is
                  also the heart of the</em> <br><em>Essential Teachings pertaining to the 
                  Ultimate rDorje Vehicle."</em></p>
              <p>  And so are the numerous writings praising the realization of perceptions as Mind.</p>
              <p>  To say that appearances are Mind means that they are Mind perceiving itself. In fact, Mind 
                  never perceives an external object.</p>
              <p>  Relating to this subject, the Omniscient dKon-mChog Lhun-Grub has said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"As distinctive object to our own manifold perceiving mind, our own mental investigation</em> <br><em>finds nothing but an illusive being. The chain of interconditioned production of the never</em> <br><em>ceasing duality between 'me' and 'other' (appearing and resting on conditions and causes)</em> <br><em>is empty of an own-self. Look at the own-face of the Sphere of the Inexpressible and</em> <br><em>Spontaneous."</em></p>
              <p>  Therefore, if we investigate mind with mind, we'll experience an unceasing Light which is called 
                  the Mind's characteristic.</p>
              <p>  By its own Essence, this same Light is devoid of birth and empty of primeval cause. In an 
                  intermediary stage, it does not dwell in anything and is devoid of a distinctive essence. Finally, 
                  since it is unceasing, it is empty of the Fruit of annihilation. Mind has no form or color. It does 
                  not dwell inside or outside the body, nor in between. No matter which way we look for mind, 
                  it cannot be found. Whichever way we investigate mind, we cannot find anything in which it 
                  would realize itself (not having any distinctive essence). Although not having any distinctive 
                  nature of its own, the trick of various perceptions nevertheless appears incessantly since the 
                  beginning, therefore we never experience its lack of existence. Since this trick of various 
                  perceptions appears constantly and we cannot find any true nature, neither can we experience 
                  its existence.</p>
              <p>  This nature of Emptiness in which we have never experienced any existence, and this 
                  characteristic of Light in which we have never experienced any non-existence, have 
                  always been dissociable. Mind is Pure Light in its perception of itself, Empty in its own 
                  Emptiness, and Perfectly conscious in its own investigation. All this is only a purpose of 
                  experience for the Transcendental Wisdom of our own investigation.</p>
              <p>  But, in reality, there is no distinctive essence to hold in the Primeval Nature of the Absolute 
                  Truth. Nothing that mind should grasp, nor words to express it. But, nevertheless, in order to 
                  dissipate ignorance, the Absolute Truth is called the relative Truth of language: 'non-dual', 
                  'Union of the Two', 'inexpressible', and 'essence of Primeval Mind'.</p>
              <p>  Although this natural state comprises <em>Samsara </em>and <em>Nirvana</em>, those who ignore their true 
                  essence are said to be in <em>Samsara</em>, while those who know their true essence are said to be in 
                  <em>Nirvana</em>. The designations of <em>Samsara </em>and <em>Nirvana</em> are thus attributed according to the 
                  understanding or the lack of understanding (of their true essence).</p>
              <p>  From the true point of view, there is no bad <em>Samsara</em> that should be rejected nor any good 
                  <em>Nirvana</em> that should be realized. If this is correctly perceived, we have then obtained what is 
                  called the understanding of the view of non-differentiation of <em>Samsara</em> and <em>Nirvana</em>.</p>
              <p>  In brief, there is nowhere to concentrate outside of the non-seizure of Mind's Emptiness-Light. 
                  The relaxed mind should constantly be in this state where there is nothing to meditate upon, free 
                  of quest and artifice.</p>
              <p>  In the Songs of the Venerable Grags-Pa rGyal-mChan, it is said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"How could there be a cessation and a distinctive essence in a mind
                  which is devoid</em> <br><em>of original birth? To think that there is neither birth nor cessation is also an obstructive</em> <br><em>thought; Give it up! You should also renounce the idea of giving up, since giving up is</em> <br><em>also a thought!"</em></p>
              <p><em>  "That which is limitless goes beyond the realm of the expressible. The designations</em> <br><em>'Middle', 'Mind only', etc. . . are only words and manifestations, while their mental</em> <br><em>representations are only conceptualizations."</em></p>
              <p>  However you think of it, if you have not perceived the Natural and Spontaneous State of Mind, 
                  and if you have not trained in the essential Teachings of non-grasping, you'll be caught grasping even with the 
                  thought of non-grasping.</p>
              <p>  Understanding that this unceasing Emptiness-Light is the Natural State of Union.</p>
              <p>  rJe Sa-Pan has also said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"Existence, non-existence, etc. . . ., there is nothing similar in the Natural State of things.</em> <br><em>There is no object to meditate upon, nor a subject who meditates, nor the act of meditating.</em> <br><em>Mind being devoid of a distinctive essence, how could you explain that Essence? By passing</em> <br><em>the realm of the expressible, there is nothing to say."</em></p>
              <p>  Coming out of this equanimous meditation, we'll then realize that all the forms belonging to the 
                  visual field as well as everything that is seen, are, as soon as perceived, Perception-Emptiness, 
                  which is nothing else but the undifferentiation of <em>Samsara-Nirvana</em>.</p>
              <p>  In the same way, all the sounds of the audio field are, as soon as heard, undifferentiation of 
                  Audibility-Emptiness, of <em>Samsara-Nirvana</em>.</p>
              <p>  And, lastly, all the discursive thoughts pertaining to the mental field as well as all that is thought 
                  are, as soon as they appear, undifferentiation of Mind-Emtpiness, of <em>Samsara-Nirvana</em>.</p>
              <p>  Everything that appears is an Activity of the <em>Dharma</em> Body.</p>
              <p>  All perceptions having appeared as expressions of the non-differentiation of <em>Samsara-Nirvana</em> and without having to look anywhere else for a meditation object, like a businessman finding 
                  himself in a country full of gold, it will be possible to leave the mind on everything that appears 
                  without trying to transform it.</p>
              <p>  Some wrongly affirm that appearances, sounds and thoughts, that we have just explained 
                  above as being non-differentiation of <em>Samsara-Nirvana</em>, constitute the meditation and not 
                  the view. In the two texts of the <em>lJon Chin Chenmo</em> and the <em>Dag lDan</em>, the Great rJe-bCun
                  affirms:</p>
              <p>  <em>"The 'holder of dharmas' (phenomena) is Samsara. Dharma itself (its essence) is</em> <br><em>Nirvana and their undifferentiation is the undifferentiated Samsara-Nirvana."</em></p>
              <p>  'Jam-dByans dKon-mChog Lhun-Grub has also said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"That which is devoid of a distinctive essence is only perception; the nature of all</em> <br><em>objects is the Dharma of Samsara-Nirvana; dharmas and 'holders of dharmas' are</em> <br><em>in truth undiffrerentiated. Realize this view of profound meaning free from all limits!"</em></p>
              <p>  Thus, by examining the various quotations, doubts concerning the view of the non-differentiation 
                  of <em>Samsara-Nirvana</em> will disappear.</p>
              <p>  In summary, the <em>Dharma</em> Body at the moment of the path is to put in practice the method 
                  consisting of leaving Mind Itself in its natural and non-transformed state.</p>
              <p>  Thus, we obtain the <em>Dharma</em> Body of the moment of Fruit which is to recognize Mind Itself 
                  free of artifice. And it is That which is called Buddha.</p>
              <p>  If, outside of mind, there were a place where another Buddha could be found, we could not 
                  hold it, and even if we could, the fusion with Buddha would be difficult.</p>
              <p>  In brief, we'll know that those who didn't realize their Essential Nature are called sentient 
                  beings while those who do are called Buddhas.</p>
              <p>  Although we call them View, Meditation, and Action, those different labels take a specific 
                  name in the continuum of the practitioner according to the moment. They are in fact the unique 
                  View of the non-differentiation of <em>Samsara-Nirvana</em>.</p>
              <p>  As the Lamas' Lineage has put it: First obtain the certainty that all perceived objects are summed 
                  up in mind. Then, perceive that all mind's perceptions are illusory and understand that this illusion 
                  only appears because of the supportive links. After having perceived that the meaning of those 
                  supportive links are separated from all expressible limits, realize the certitude not relying on anyone 
                  regarding the Natural State; so is the View.</p>
              <p>  Having first started with the three preparatory <em>Dharmas</em>, we'll remain in the Equanimity of the 
                  Profound View with the help of the three basic <em>Dharmas</em>. Then, we'll meditate by using as final 
                  ornament the three conclusive <em>Dharmas</em>. So is the Meditation.</p>
              <p>  At each moment and without letting go our steadiness of watchful conscience of the View, 
                  we'll meditate on three demons (<em>gDen</em>) of external obstacles, on the three diseases of internal 
                  obstacles, on the three perturbating poisons of secret obstacles, on the eight mundane <em>dharmas</em>; 
                  in brief, on the erroneous thoughts of passion-aversion by applying the vision seal.</p>
              <p>  Just as fire gets higher with the abundance of wood, no matter how violent the mental and 
                  dualistic perceptions of subject-object such as obstacles and bad causes, if we're never 
                  separated from the key of the View, those perceptions will be perceived as the blissful Sphere 
                  of <em>Dharma</em>, just as ice cubes melting in water. A greater advantage will then result concerning 
                  the View.</p>
              <p>  Thus, a correct experience of this Profound View being born in our mind, it will become 
                  the antidote to all our disruptive forces (<em>Klesas</em>).</p>
              <p>  Generally, although our great compassionate Master, the Buddha, taught the aspect of 
                  repulsive meditation as an antidote to desire, the <em>Samadhi</em> of love as an antidote to anger 
                  and hate, the meditation of appearance in relation to the supportive links an antidote to 
                  ignorance, the charachteristics of the varied inclinations and temperaments as an antidote 
                  to pride, the meditation of the similarity between oneself and others as an antidote to 
                  jealousy, and so on . . . the repulsive aspect is only beneficial to stop desire but unable to 
                  appease anger and hate but has no effect on desire.</p>
              <p>  If the unshakable certainty appears towards this Profound View, it then becomes the antidote 
                  to all disruptive forces.</p>
              <p>  For example, just as inside <em>Samsara</em>, the remedy called 'the unique benefactor' is the antidote 
                  o all diseases, if one perceives correctly the perfect meaning of Emptiness, this understanding 
                  will then become the antidote to all disruptive forces.</p>
              <p>  It is said by Kun-mKhyen ChosKyi rGyalpo:</p>
              <p>  <em>"Although the water of repulsion (ugliness) can wash the stains of desire, it cannot</em> <br><em>destroy the rocky mountain of anger; although the fire love can burn the bushes of</em> <br><em>anger, it is unable to wash the stains of passion-desire.</em></p>
              <p><em>  "With the ability to perceive as Unity Emptiness and everything that appears in relation</em> <br><em>to the supportive links, one can totally cut the tree of self's view with its numerous branches</em> <br><em>and leaves of actions and disruptive forces and its fruits of birth (namely, existence)."</em></p>
              <p>  Thus it is explained.</p>
              <p>  If we gathered all the Doctrines of the Way, we'll find that they are all concentrated in the six 
                  <em>Paramitas </em>(six Perfections). And those appear easily to the one who perceives perfectly the 
                  essential point of this View.</p>
              <p>  In the <em>sPyod-'Jug</em>, from the beginning: "abandoning the miserable beings", to the end: "they 
                  wander without a reason", it is meant in those nine <em>slokas</em> (stanzas) that the six <em>Paramitas</em> do not exist by relying on body and external speech but that we must
                  find them relying solely on the inside mind. Thus, the spirit of giving
                  which comes from the heart is Giving; the total victory over the spirit
                  of ill-will is Moral Discipline; the total victory over the spirit of
                  anger is Patience; a mind rejoicing in practising virtue is called
                  Zeal; a mind which remains firmly on any object is called Meditation;
                  the knowledge of the Nature of Mind is Wisdom.</p>
              <p>  Those virtues will be born in the mental continuum of the one who will possess the perfectly 
                  Pure View. Jo-Bo rJe (Atisa) and Milarepa have both said it. The victorious Yan dGonpa has also said:</p>
              <p><em>  "To know the nature of virtue is the most excellent of all virtues. To know the nature</em> <br><em>of non-virtue is the most excellent of all confessions."</em></p>
              <p>  Just as it has already been explained, the wisdom of the nature of virtue being an inexhaustible 
                  virtue, it becomes the cause of Perfect Awakening. The wisdom of the nature of non-virtue is 
                  the most excellent of confessions and it is said in the <em>Tharpa Chenpo Phyogs Su rGyas-Pa'i mDo</em>:</p>
              <p><em>  "If you want purification, firmly contemplate the Pure View. When it appears,</em> <br><em>the Perfect Liberation will also come. This is said to be the most excellent of all</em> <br><em>purifications."</em></p>
              <p>  The Master, Arya Deva, has also said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"Even those who has accumulated little merit will have no doubt concerning this</em> <br><em>Doctrine. If they did, they would have to wander in cyclic existence (Samsara)."</em></p>
              <p>  For it to be born rightfully in our mental continuum, we must exert ourselves with great 
                  strength in Purification and Accumulation.</p>
              <p>  Having understood that the Lama was the Essence concentrating all Buddhas, it is very 
                  important to pray to him with perfection concentration, aspiration and immense veneration.</p>
              <p>  It is said in the <em>rNal-'Byor-Ma Kuntu sPyod-Pa'i rGyud</em> (bDe mChog's commentary <em>Tantra</em>):</p>
              <p>  <em>"Prostration to the Feet of the One whose kindness allows the Great Bliss to appear</em> <br><em>in a flash. Prostration to the Lama whose Body is similar to the Jewel possessing the</em> <br><em>Dorje."</em></p>
              <p>  Sakya Pandita, the Lord of <em>Dharma</em>, has also said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"For the one who faithfully relies on You, that person immediately receives Infinite</em> <br><em>Mercy and becomes in one instant a Perfect Buddha and realizes all the Perfect</em> <br><em>Accomplishments."</em></p>
              <p>  In the <em>Tantra</em>, it is said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"Due to a constant veneration and aspiration, the rank of Dorje Chang can be obtained</em> <br><em>in six months."</em></p>
              <p>  'Brom-sTon once asked Jo-Bo rJe (Atisa):</p>
              <p>  <em>"Have the Doctrines I practised in the past been transformed in the Way or not?"</em></p>
              <p><em>  "Those where you served your Jetsun Lama did, the others, no," </em>answered Atisa.</p>
              <p>  'Brom-sTon asked again:</p>
              <p>  <em>"Although we have many meditations adepts in Tibet, none has obtained the distinctive</em> <br><em>Virtues. Why is this?"</em></p>
              <p><em>  "All the qualities, great or small, of Mahayana can only take birth by relying on the Lama</em> <br><em>and since you, in Tibet, only consider Lama as an ordinary being, how do you expect the</em> <br><em>Qualities to be born?"</em></p>
              <p>  It is said that to see the clean face of the Profound and Natural Situation of all <em>dharmas</em>, there 
                  is nothing more excellent than the practice of Guru Yoga. By practising this Guru Yoga with 
                  regularity, not only with the mouth but also with the heart, an unbearable strength of veneration 
                  and aspiration will burn from the inside, just like a great fire. There is nothing else than to think 
                  and recall the Lama.</p>
              <p>  We'll understand that all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions are incarnated in our 
                  own Lama. And by seeing or hearing the marvellous biographies of holy and realized Lamas of 
                  India and Tibet, we'll also know that our Lama is their Incarnation.</p>
              <p>  Having established the certainty that the Essence of the Lama concentrates without exceptions 
                  the Three Jewels, and in order to honour Him, not even being satisfied with the offering of our 
                  flesh and blood, by thinking of Him, we will pray to Him with veneration songs, pouring tears 
                  similar to a rain shower.</p>
              <p>  If we're able to pray to Him with such great strength, there will be no doubt of reaching the 
                  Perfection rapidly.</p>
              <p>  If we're satisfied by saying a few prayer words such as: "The Lama knows" while only thinking 
                  of Him of time to time, then we'll never obtain the benefits of the Profound Guru Yoga practice. 
                  That is why we must exert ourselves to a pure practice.</p>
              <p>  The most excellent of all incarnation, the Omniscient 'Jam dByans Kun-dGa' Bstan-Pa'i rGyal-mChan has said:</p>
              <p>  <em>"Know that all Refuges are the Essence of the Lama. See all virtuous practices as the</em> <br><em>Way of the Lama, and know that Samsara and Nirvana appear as Manifestations of</em> <br><em>the Lama.</em></p>
              <p><em>  "Grant us Your Infinite Mercy so that the phenomenal world appears as the Lama!"</em></p>
              <p>  If what has just been said is realized, it is said to be the
                  true and faultless practice of the Guru Yoga of the Profound Path.</p>
              <p><em>  This text was composed at the repeated request of Thartse
                  Shab Droung Rinpoche Byams-Pa Nam-mKha' Kun-bZan BStan-Pa'i rGyal-mChan

              <p>Yes. In the Vishesacinta-brahma-pariprccha Sutra, it is said -<br> <br>    <strong> Samsara is Nirvana, because there is, when viewed from the ultimate
                              nature of the Dharmakaya, nothing going out of, nor coming into,
                              existence (Samsara being only apparent):  Nirvana is samsara, when it
                              is coveted and adhered to.</strong></p>
              <p>................</p>
              <p>As Thusness wrote: what dependently originates is empty, unborn, does not come, does not go, does not arise and does not cease.</p>
              <p>This is similar to what Nagarjuna said (but Thusness did not know Nagarjuna said the same thing when he wrote that): “I pay respect to the best among speakers who, having attained Enlightenment, has taught relative origination (PratityasamutpÄ�da) which is no-cessation, no-origination, no-annihilation, no-abiding, no-one-thing, no-many-thing, no-coming-in, no-going-out; being the termination of linguistic description (PrapañcopaÅ›amam), it is the good (Åšivam) [RÄ�m Candra PÄ�ndey &amp; Mañju, 1999, pp.1] .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">And as Nagarjuna says, "Nothing of saá¹�sÄ�ra is different from nirvÄ�á¹‡a, 
                                nothing of nirvÄ�á¹‡a is different from saá¹�sÄ�ra. That which is the limit of 
                                nirvÄ�á¹‡a is also the limit of saá¹�sÄ�ra; there is not the slightest difference 
                                between the two." <a name="%5B1%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#1"></a> And yet there must be some difference between them, 
                                for otherwise no distinction would have been made and there would be no need 
                                for two words to describe the same state. So NÄ�gÄ�rjuna also distinguishes 
                                them: "That which, taken as causal or dependent, is the process of being 
                                born and passing on, is, taken noncausally and beyond all dependence, declared 
                                to be nirvÄ�á¹‡a."<a name="%5B2%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#2"></a> There is only one reality -- this world, right here -- but this world
                              may be experienced in two different ways. Saá¹�sÄ�ra is the "relative"
                              world as usually experienced, in which "I" dualistically perceive "it"
                              as a collection of objects which interact causally in space and time.
                              NirvÄ�á¹‡a is the world as it is in itself, nondualistic in that it
                              incorporates both subject and object into a whole which, MÄ�dhyamika
                              insists, cannot be characterized (ChandrakÄ«rti: "NirvÄ�á¹‡a or Reality is
                              that which is absolved of all thought-construction"), but which
                              YogÄ�cÄ�ra nevertheless sometimes calls "Mind" or "Buddhanature," and so
                              forth.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Zen Master Dogen Zenji also taught:<br> <br>     There are those who say, 'Since
                  the various Buddhas enlighten the whole world, all worldly phenomena
                  express the enlightenment of the Buddhas.  Therefore, since both self
                  and others are encompassed in the enlightenment of the Buddhas,
                  mountains, rivers, earth, sun, moon, stars, the four illusions, and the
                  three poisons are all expressions of their enlightenment.  Furthermore,
                  since nothing is outside the Law, not even the three poisons and four
                  illusions, the Tathagata can be seen in mountains and rivers, just as
                  the whole world can be seen in each of its individual phenomena.  Thus,
                  each individual act is an expression of the ultimate Truth.'  They
                  designate all of this as (the meaning of) 'great enlightenment' and
                  assert that it is 'the directly transmitted patriarchal Way.     In 
                  present-day China those who talk in this manner are as numerous as rice
                  plants, hemp, bamboo, and reeds.  Although it is uncertain whose [Law]
                  descendants they are, it is clear that they have not understood the Way
                  of the Buddhas and patriarchs.  While it is true that mountains,
                  rivers, and earth are encompassed in the enlightenment of the various
                  Buddhas, the way in which ordinary men view them is far different from
                  that  of the Buddhas, for ordinary men have never learned or heard
                  about the true nature of enlightenment . . . If the Way of the Buddhas
                  and patriarchs conformed to their views, neither the various Buddhas
                  nor the patriarchs would have appeared in this world.  Consequently, no
                  one would be able to realize enlightenment.  Attached to such views,
                  they will never be able to realize that birth is [as it is] nonbirth. <strong><br></strong></p>

                                                  that this illusion only appears because of the supportive links.
                                                  After having perceived that the meaning of those supportive links
                                                  are separated from all expressible limits, realize the certitude
                                                  not relying on anyone regarding the Natural State; so is the
                                                  View.</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>My own understanding: first experience deeply the non-dual luminosity/awareness without subject-object division. Experience everything as Mind only. Then penetrate the meaning of dependent origination and emptiness in direct experience and see all Mind's appearance as utterly vivid yet without substance, like an illusion. Experiencing everything as Mind Only is not the same as realising emptiness, but its the first step. The first part corresponds to Thusness's Stage 4 and 5, second part is 6.</p>

              <p>For me personally, it's not a deep vision, it's a deep surrender and
