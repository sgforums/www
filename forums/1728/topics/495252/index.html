              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Vanessa R. Sasson Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-07-28 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I knew very little about Buddhism in Malaysia before I landed
              in that lush green country. My visit was the result of some last-minute changes
              and I did not have much time to prepare. As a faithful academic, I did make a
              quick library dash and pulled out a number of histories, but I only managed to
              skim the surface before it was time to board the plane. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I was whisked off by friends to the Cameron Highlands as soon
              as I landed—a beautiful region in the mountains, famous for its tea estates
              (and the setting for the magnificent novel Garden of the Evening Mists by Tan
              Twan Eng). I was fed at every turn, chaperoned and chauffeured, and entertained
              with the best sights the Highlands have to offer. At each step of the way,
              friends explained histories and pointed out details, providing me with an
              unparalleled introduction to Malaysian culture and love.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The community I shared my time with there was Chinese
              Buddhist. There were Taoist shrines honored with incense and oil lamps,
              references to full moon rituals and Confucian mores, and offerings made to the
              bodhisattvas. I assumed this was what the Buddhist world of Malaysia looked
              like. I was, however, quickly relieved of that assumption. As I was being
              dropped off in Kuala Lumpur, one friend offered me a clue about where to look
              to understand the complexity of Buddhist Malaysian life further: she suggested
              I find a Buddhist shop to see what was being sold.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">She was right. On the shelves of the first shop I found were
              Buddhas of every variety mixed together. Chinese guardians placed with Tibetan
              tantric deities and Buddhas from Theravada lands. There were images from
              Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the Himalayas, and China, all sharing space on the same
              shelf in the most extraordinary combinations I have ever seen. Malaysia’s
              population is 65 per cent Muslim, most of whom are Sunni (but there are Ahmadi
              communities, Shi’a groups, and more). The remaining 35 per cent of the
              country’s population, however, is made up of a much more diverse range of
              non-Muslim communities, most of whom are Buddhist. The Buddhist communities
              interact with each other with extraordinary fluidity and freedom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I was soon whisked away again, this time by another group of
              friends who hosted and fed me in ways that I was beginning to realize were a
              regular feature of Malaysian hospitality. From early in the morning until late
              at night—every night!—we (myself and a colleague, for whom this was a research
              trip) were introduced to the stunning diversity of Buddhist life around Kuala
              Lumpur. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The town of Ipoh (and its surrounding areas) provided,
              without a doubt, the most breathtaking example: in just one relatively small
              area, our hosts drove us to temple after temple after temple, not one of which
              was even remotely the same as the last. We did a marathon 16-1/2hour tour on
              one day, visiting a Chinese cave temple, a Bhutanese Kagyu temple, a Sri Lankan
              temple, a Thai temple, and a Tibetan Sakya temple. There were others too, but I
              eventually lost count (I was admittedly slightly delirious by the end!) I never
              imagined so much Buddhist diversity could exist in one small area. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Even more fascinating, the diversity was to be found inside
              each temple as well, with Thai spirit houses surrounding the Sakya Tibetan
              temple, Kuan Yin sharing an altar with Guru Rinpoche, and so much more. The
              diversity was everywhere and it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I
              kept wondering why there is so little academic (and even popular) attention being
              paid to this community. There seemed to be more happening in one square
              kilometer of Malaysia than in the whole of LA! There were very few tourists and
              there is virtually no research available about the area. How was all of this
              cultural diversity being missed by the greater international community?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">On the one hand, I must admit that it was delightful not to
              be swarmed by tourists. To walk through these temples quietly with friends,
              lighting butter lamps, talking with the people who cared for them, and have
              enough surrounding quiet to hear the insects humming in the background was a
              gift I did not take for granted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But there is a flip side that I became increasingly aware of
              as well: the Buddhist communities of Malaysia are a minority and they do not
              enjoy the same rights and freedoms of their Sunni Muslim counterparts. The
              history is complicated and layered, but regardless of how the country reached
              this point, at this juncture in time Buddhism appears to be facing serious
              obstacles. Every Buddhist I spoke with told me about their mounting concerns as
              further implementation of a restrictive interpretation of Sharia law was being
              debated in government. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Currently, Sharia only applies to Muslims, and only to a
              limited extent (mostly having to do with issues of religious practice and
              marriage and divorce, but each state has its own interpretive range). Few
              people I spoke with doubted that the reach of Sharia would be extended to
              non-Muslims and that criminal law would be added to its domain of authority. I
              was told by a number of a people that it has already become impossible to build
              new Buddhist temples in Malaysia (unless they are labelled “tourist sites”—an
              apparent loophole in the system).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Combined with a number of other logistical obstacles,
              Buddhism may soon be prevented from developing further (despite the fact that
              Article 11 of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia promises freedom of
              religion). One Buddhist monk I spoke with (who is politically active), told me
              that it is not a question anymore of whether Sharia will be extended. Sharia,
              in his words, was already here. He carried his papers with him wherever he
              went, in case he suddenly encountered trouble as a representative in Buddhist
              robes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I am in no place to assess the political situation of Malaysia,
              but I certainly walked away feeling concern about the future of the country’s
              extraordinary Buddhist diversity. I unfortunately did not have the opportunity
              to meet with many members of the Muslim community, and I am sure I would have
              come away with a different impression if I had. I am certain there is debate,
              concern, and a vast spectrum of interpretation that I have missed. It was a
              short (albeit very full) trip, but it was ultimately one-sided. The side I did
              see, however, consistently gave voice to fears about the future of its Buddhist
              communities. The rich diversity and playful interaction between the different
              Buddhist traditions was magnificent, and it certainly spoke to a spirit of
              openness not always available in other parts of the Buddhist world. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I am a bit embarrassed to write on a community I know so
              little about. I welcome corrections with humility, but I thought it would be
              valuable to provide some of my impressions here, given how little attention
              Buddhist Studies has paid to this fascinating part of the world. May others
              pick up the thread and develop the conversation with greater skill.</span></p>
