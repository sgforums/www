            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">The icchantika is, according to some Mahayana Buddhist scriptures, the most base and spiritually deluded of all types of being. The term implies being given over to total hedonism and greed. In the Tathagatagarbha sutras, some of which pay particular attention to the icchantikas, the term is frequently used of those persons who do not believe in the Buddha, his eternal Selfhood and his Dharma (Truth); who seriously transgress against the Buddhist moral codes and vinaya; and who speak disparagingly and dismissively of the reality of the immortal Buddha-nature (Buddha-dhatu) or (essentially the same thing) the Tathagatagarbha present within all beings (including, paradoxically, icchantikas themselves).<br><br>The two shortest versions of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra - one translated by Fa-xian, and the other a middle-length Tibetan version of the sutra - indicate that the icchantika has so totally severed all his/her roots of goodness that he/she can never attain Liberation and Nirvana. The full-length Dharmakshema version of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, in contrast, insists that even the icchantika can eventually find release into Nirvana, since nothing phenomenal is fixed (including this type of allegedly deluded person) and that change for the better and best is always a possibility. Other scriptures (such as the Lankavatara Sutra) indicate that the icchantikas will be saved through the liberational power of the Buddha - who, it is claimed, will never abandon any being.</span><br><br>-----<br><br>sutra that mention a lot on icchantika :<br><br>The "Nirvana Sutra" Continued<br>Chapter Sixteen: On the Bodhisattva<br><a href="http://www.nirvanasutra.org.uk/nirvanasutrah.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nirvanasutra.org.uk/nirvanasutrah.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">1) In our Dharma Ending Age, the icchantikas are extremely hard to detect?<br><br>The six-volume Parinirvana Sutra says, "The extreme is impossible to see.<br>That is, the extremely evil deeds done by the icchantika are all but impossible to perceive."<br>"There are also icchantikas who resemble arhats but who commit evil deeds. There are also arhats who resemble icchantikas but display merciful hearts. The icchantikas who look like arhats spend their time slandering the correct and equal sutras to the populace.<br>The arhats who look like icchantikas, on the other hand, are critical of the voice-hearers and go about preaching the correct and equal sutras. They address the populace, saying, 'You and I are all bodhisattvas. Why? Because each living being possesses the Buddha nature.' But the populace will probably call such<br>men icchantikas."<br><br>2) Unable to perceive and teaches the inappropriate Dharma teaching to the wrong capacity of beings could drive them to become icchantikas?<br><br>In the Mahaprinirvana sutra: Shariputra attempted to instruct a blacksmith by teaching him to meditate on the vileness of the body, and to instruct a washerman by teaching him to conduct breath counting meditation. Even though these disciples spent over ninety days in their respective meditations, they did not gain the slightest understanding of the Buddha's teachings. On the contrary,<br>they took on erroneous views and ended by becoming icchantikas. So the end Buddha came into rescue and swap the teaching in understanding their respective capacity.<br><br>3) Icchantikas are totally hopeless case?<br><br>In Mahaprinirvana sutra description: "dead trees or stony mountains" that can never bring forth growth.<br>They are "scorched seeds that, although they encounter the sweet rain," will not grow. "Bright pearls have the power, when put into turbid water, to change it into clear water. . . . But when thrown into the mud of icchantika, they cannot purify it." They are [like persons without a wound on their hands when the sutra says], "If a person with a wound on his hand handles poison, it will enter his body, but it will not enter the body of a person without a wound." "Just as torrents of rain cannot remain suspended in the sky, [so the rain of the Law cannot remain in the sky of icchantika]."<br><br>In The Great and Vast Buddha Flower Garland Sutra states: "There are only two places where the Great Medicine King Tree, which is the wisdom of the Thus Come One, will not grow and bring benefit to the world. It will not grow in the vast void that is the deep pit into which persons of the two vehicles fall, or in the profoundly distorted and craving-filled waters wherein drown beings unfit for Buddhahood who destroy<br>their own roots of goodness."<br>- Where the Great Medicine King Tree and is the monarch of all the trees that grow in the land of Jambudvipa tree is employed as a metaphor for the Buddha nature, and the fiery pit is used as a metaphor for the mind of persons of the two vehicles, and the watery circle is used as a metaphor for the mind<br>of icchantikas Â¨C for groups of of beings will never attain Buddhahood.<br><br>4) Knowledge without faith turn one into icchantikas?<br><br>From the Daimoku of Lotus Sutra, Nichiren: Â¡Â°The monk Sunakshatra observed the two hundred and fifty precepts, mastered the four stages of meditation, and was versed in all the twelve divisions of the scriptures, while Devadatta memorized the sixty thousand non-Buddhist teachings and the eighty thousand Buddhist teachings, and could manifest eighteen miraculous powers with his body. And yet it is said that these men, because they had knowledge but no faith, are now in the great citadel of the Avichi hell.Â¡Â±<br>Â¡Â°Mahakashyapa and Shariputra on the other hand lacked knowledge but had faith, and the Buddha accordingly predicted that they would become the Thus Come Ones Light Bright and Flower Glow, respectively. The Buddha stated: {If one should harbor doubt and fail to believe, one will fall at once into the evil paths, - Lotus Sutra Chapter 15 }..Â¡Â±<br><br>5) Killing of icchantikas is not a cardinal sins?<br><br>From Mahaparinirvana sutra: "In the past, when the Thus Come One was the ruler of a nation and practiced the way of the bodhisattva, he put to death a number of BrahmansÂ¡Â­..There are three degrees of killings: the lower, middle, and upper degreesÂ¡Â­.. Good men, if someone were to kill an icchantika, that killing would not fall into any of the three categories just mentioned. Good men, the various Brahmans that I have said were put to death - all of them were in fact icchantikas.Â¡Â±<br>Â¡Â°Good men, at that time I cherished the great vehicle teachings in my heart. When I heard the Brahmans slandering these correct and equal sutras, I put them to death on the spot. Good men, as a result of that action, I never thereafter fell into hell."<br><br>6) The Lotus Sutra can cure the Icchantikas?<br><br>Great master T'ien-t'ai ( Chi-I) in his Â¡Â°Great Concentration and InsightÂ¡Â± stated: "Neither the Flower Garland Sutra nor the Larger Wisdom Sutra could cure [the plight of these persons of the two vehicles]. The Lotus Sutra alone was able to produce the roots of goodness in those who have nothing more to learn, and<br>to make it possible for them to attain the Buddha way. Therefore, the sutra is called wonderful ( ÃƒÃ®, sk. Sad, ch. Miao, jp. Myo ). Again, the icchantikas, or persons of incorrigible disbelief, nevertheless have minds,<br>and so it is still possible for them to attain Buddhahood. But persons of the two vehicles have annihilated consciousness, and therefore cannot arouse the mind that aspires to enlightenment. And yet the Lotus Sutra can cure them, which is why it is called wonderful .</span><br><br>/\</div>

Chap 10 talks about Sakyamuni Buddha commissioning (not sure is it the appropriate translation for shou ji) Devadetta in becoming Devaraja Tathagata, despite that he was in avici hell for making Buddha to bleed. Sakyamuni Buddha then went on to talk about how He had benefitted from one of Devadetta's past lives. But we have to keep in mind that in Devadetta's lifetime, he was not sincere in joining the Sangha as well. The Truth was presented to Devadetta but not only did he not believe in it, with ego so bloated that he had blinded himself, plot to take over Buddha's position by branching off to start his own order and the four attempted murder on Buddha.<br><br>Compare to people who don't know Dhamma nowadays, if we are to put them on the icchantika standard, they are really nothing as compared to Devadetta. Despite all these, he still received the commission by Sakyamuni Buddha Himself.<br><br>Prior to the Lotus Sutra, Buddha preached the Sutra of Immeasurable Essence (Wu Liang Yi Jing), if my memory doesn't fail me, Sakyamuni Buddha said that the most important of His Teachings is going to be revealed. Which eventually lead to the Lotus Sutra.<br><br>If you go by Tiantai school of thoughts, they always refer Lotus Sutra as part of the Threefold Lotus Sutra, having the Sutra of Immeasurable Essence as the opening, Lotus Sutra as the core and Sutra of Observing the Practice of Bodhisattva Universally Worthy (Guan Pu Xian Pu Sa Xing Fa Jing, eh I know my translations sound weird haha).<br><br>At least to my understanding, the purpose of the Lotus Sutra, besides revealing that Sakyamuni Buddha is the incarnate of Dhammakaya (Nichiren Shonin greatly emphasized on this), it is a Sutra that is in attempt to side aside the differences among the 3 vehicles (sravaka, pratyaka-buddha, bodhisattva) and it is suppose to inspire and encourage to have the spirit of never-ending practice (in Chapter 16, Sakyamuni Buddha told Matrieya Bodhisattva that the time Sakyamuni Buddha spend on practising the bodhisattva path is double the time of His lifespan) to practitioners of the 'so-call' lesser 2 vehicles. Where Sakyamuni Buddha said that there is only one path He was teaching, no second or third.<br><br>So I think the cure is only that icchantika to take faith in the Triplegem and practice the Dhamma sincerely and with perseverence. In Nichiren Buddhism, the beautiful thing about their Lotus Precept is to practice the spirit of the whole 28 chapters of LS. And probably through this earnest practice in the 28 chapters, we may then transform an icchantika. I'm not sure how Tiantai think. I read more about Nichiren's idea than Tiantai.<br><br>=)</div>

Despite all these, he still received the commission by Sakyamuni Buddha Himself.<br><br>Prior to the Lotus Sutra, Buddha preached the Sutra of Immeasurable Essence (Wu Liang Yi Jing), if my memory doesn't fail me, Sakyamuni Buddha said that the most important of His Teachings is going to be revealed. Which eventually lead to the Lotus Sutra.<br><br>If you go by Tiantai school of thoughts, they always refer Lotus Sutra as part of the Threefold Lotus Sutra, having the Sutra of Immeasurable Essence as the opening, Lotus Sutra as the core and Sutra of Observing the Practice of Bodhisattva Universally Worthy (Guan Pu Xian Pu Sa Xing Fa Jing, eh I know my translations sound weird haha).<br><br>At least to my understanding, the purpose of the Lotus Sutra, besides revealing that Sakyamuni Buddha is the incarnate of Dhammakaya (Nichiren Shonin greatly emphasized on this), it is a Sutra that is in attempt to side aside the differences among the 3 vehicles (sravaka, pratyaka-buddha, bodhisattva) and it is suppose to inspire and encourage to have the spirit of never-ending practice (in Chapter 16, Sakyamuni Buddha told Matrieya Bodhisattva that the time Sakyamuni Buddha spend on practising the bodhisattva path is double the time of His lifespan) to practitioners of the 'so-call' lesser 2 vehicles. Where Sakyamuni Buddha said that there is only one path He was teaching, no second or third.<br><br>So I think the cure is only that icchantika to take faith in the Triplegem and practice the Dhamma sincerely and with perseverence. In Nichiren Buddhism, the beautiful thing about their Lotus Precept is to practice the spirit of the whole 28 chapters of LS. And probably through this earnest practice in the 28 chapters, we may then transform an icchantika. I'm not sure how Tiantai think. I read more about Nichiren's idea than Tiantai.<br><br>=)</div></blockquote>I doubt your idea of cure will work as a icchantika cannot even take faith.</div>

All of the BuddhaÂ’s Arhat students doomed the old man as a prospect, because they thought that he had no connection with Buddhism in his past lives. Shakyamuni then announced that many aeons ago, this old man was a woodchopper. One day when he ran into a tiger on the mountain, he climbed up a tree to escape, calling out, Â“Namo BuddhaÂ” (Homage to the Buddha) for help. With only those few words, the old man planted his good roots. In this life, he became a monk as he had wished and later attained his Arhatship.</blockquote>/\</div>
