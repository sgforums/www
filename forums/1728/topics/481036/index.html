              <p>Sirs,</p>
              <p>I understand to be born in deva world,you need merits. Merits are acquired by giving charity. More charity can be received by giving more. To give more, we need more. This comes from how much we have. Which comes from how much we have now,this comes from the karma which comes from past lives. So it's inherently a loop.How to get out of this loop?</p>

Donating one’s time where needed is even better. It is not necessary that to give more we need more. You can always give away your old textbooks, sport equipment etc to those in need. Being kind to our environment is also a form of charity as it will eventually benefit our future generation. I think there are many charitable way one can perform the act of giving. By the way, acquiring merits should not be the All in one’s religious practice.</span></p>

              <p>Wrote this in 2008:</p>
              <p>For example, the beggar who was so delighted when Maha-arhat
              Mogallana [or Mahakasyapa?] (out of compassion) asked for the
              beggar's 3 drops of gruel in his bowl (he was initially saddened
              when he thought he had nothing to give him), and as a result of
              this pure deed the beggar died like a week later and was reborn in
              the heaven of 33 gods for 90+ kalpas. For the beggar's case, the
              karma arising out of this pure intent is too strong and manifested
              very quickly.<br><br> The beggar that gave 3 drops of gruel to the great arhat Mogallana
              gained rebirth in the celestial realms for 91 kalpas because she
              was sincere and very happy that she had something to give him, when
              Mogallana requested that from her.</p>

              <p>Also if possible, give alms to monks and nuns. Don't have to be expensive stuff - they need food, basic necessities, medicine, clothing, etc. I'm sure most people have some spare change to buy/cook a meal for a monk/nun.</p>

              <p>Saw the video and 3 questions:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>She gained merit because it was a piuos person or would the
              effect have been same if she offered to anyone?</li>
              <li>Since no other person would have accepted it,she would have had
              no possibilities of merits.</li>
              <li>Why didn't Ananda or this monk becomes enlightened as Buddha?
              They were always his disciples.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I don't think it has to do with the piousness... rather it's the intention. I also thought if a person has nothing to offer, he/she can offer his/her kind words, smile etc. Ananda and Mahakasyapa were enlightened.</p>
