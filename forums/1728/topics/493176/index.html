              Surprise You</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Wesley Baines Beliefnet</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Even
              the world's calmest religion has its surprises.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">From
              reincarnation to koans to the the selection of the Dali Lama, Buddhism is a
              fascinating and unique way of life with a few surprises in store for those
              unfamiliar with it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Arising
              from the ancient teachings of the Buddha, it is currently the 4th largest
              religion in the world, with over 495 million adherents, representing 7 percent
              of the global population spread out across nearly every country in the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">While
              Buddhism may seem to be all about meditation, calmness, and quiet monasteries,
              it has just as many interesting quirks as the other major belief systems of the
              world. Let’s explore those quirks by taking a look at 7 Buddhism facts that
              will surprise you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">It was started by a prince.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">The
              title “buddha,” refers to an enlightened person who has awakened from their
              ignorance and achieved freedom from suffering. Hence, there is more than one
              buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">The
              historical figure known as the Buddha—capital “B”—was born near the Ganges
              River basin in ancient Northern India, in what we know today as Nepal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Before
              he became the Buddha, his name was Siddhartha Gautama—his given name meaning,
              “he who achieves his aim”—and he came from a royal family. His life was one of
              luxury, sheltered and protected from the suffering and violence of the world. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Around
              the age of 29, Siddhartha witnessed suffering for the very first time while on
              a chariot ride outside his family palace. This had a profound effect on the
              man, and because of it, he subsequently renounced his wealth and royal ties in
              a quest to find the cause of human suffering, and to put an end to it. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">For
              six years, he sought out the best teachers of meditation, living a life marked
              by the denial of his wants, begging for food in the streets. However, this
              produced in him a feeling of weakness and ill health—he suffered, and so
              concluded that this was not the way. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">After
              this, he sought the truth of suffering in yogic meditation. But in this, too,
              he was unsatisfied. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Eventually,
              he settled on what Buddhists call the Middle Way—a path of moderation that
              steers an individual away from extremes of self-indulgence and
              self-mortification.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Eventually
              Siddhartha sat beneath a pipal tree, where he vowed not to arise until he found
              the truth. But find it he did, and arose enlightened after 49 days of
              meditation, writing down what he learned—writings that became the basis for
              Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">It’s ancient.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Most
              modern scholars agree that the historical Buddha was alive between about 563 to
              483 BCE. That means that the teachings of Buddhism have been passed down for
              over 2,500 years. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">To
              give you an idea of how ancient this is, let’s look at what else happened
              around the time period in which the Buddha was alive. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Around
              this time, the contemporary English city of London found its origins amidst
              marshy waters near the River Thames, in the form of a few dozen huts and a
              small river landing built by the Celtic king, Belin. The catapult had also just
              been invented by the Greeks, and war was breaking out between Sparta and the
              city-state of Elis. Jesus, founder of Christianity, wouldn’t be born for
              hundreds of years. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">With
              this in perspective, it’s hard not to be surprised at how long the Buddha’s teachings
              have been transmitted from teacher to teacher. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">There is no single holy book.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Unlike
              the other major world religions, Buddhism has no single holy book from which
              all of its teachings come. Instead, there is a vast number of texts and
              teachings, but few that are accepted as authentic and authoritative. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Buddhist
              scriptures are called sutras, which means “thread”. This title indicates that
              the work is a sermon given by the Buddha, or by one of his disciples—many,
              however, have other origins. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">There
              is a multitude of sutras, ranging in size from a few lines to that of a large
              tome. And beyond this, there are countless fables, rules for monks and nuns,
              and commentaries. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">To
              complicate matters, Buddhism split into two major schools around 2,000 years
              ago, becoming what are known today as Theravada and Mahayana. Buddhist
              scriptures are divided into canons for each of these schools. And, to go even
              further, the Mahayana canon is split between the Chinese canon and the Tibetan
              canon. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Sound
              a little overwhelming? It is. Better get reading now! </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">There's no Buddhist god.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">One
              major difference between Buddhism and other major religions is the lack of a
              central deity. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Siddhartha
              was just a man, albeit an enlightened one, and made no claims to divinity at
              all. Buddhists follow his teachings and try to live as he did, but they do not
              worship him. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Interestingly,
              the Buddha, in contrast to the gods of other faiths, encourages Buddhists to
              not take his word for anything, but rather to go find out what work for themselves—it’s
              all about exploring beliefs, understanding them, and testing those beliefs
              against experience. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">The
              Buddha, himself, explains this best, when he writes, “Do not be led by reports,
              or tradition, or hearsay. Be not led by the authority of religious texts, nor
              by mere logic or inference, nor by considering appearances, nor by the delight
              in speculative opinions, nor by seeming possibilities, nor by the idea: ‘This
              is our Teacher’. But, O Kalamas, when you know for yourselves that certain
              things are unwholesome and wrong and bad, then give them up… and when you know
              that certain things are wholesome and good, and that the wise believe them to
              be so, then accept them and follow them.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">This
              is Buddhism—it’s more about practice than merely holding a certain set of
              dogmatic beliefs. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">It's closer to psychology than
              religion.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">One
              fact about Buddhism fact that will surprise you the most is that it is closer
              to psychology than religion—it’s really quite practical. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">The
              Buddha could be seen as an early psychologist, teaching his disciples the idea
              of acceptance—that the world is a certain way, and that wishful thinking only
              leads to sorrow. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">One
              of the principal ideas of Buddhism is that suffering comes from craving—mainly,
              from wishing things were different than they are. We all wish that sickness
              didn’t take hold of our bodies. We want money, friends, and lovers. We want
              success and fame. We want and we want, and when the world doesn’t align with
              those wants, we suffer. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">But
              Siddhartha, in his enlightenment, recognized the futility of this. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Buddhism
              fosters a mindset that helps adherents accept the world as it really is, and to
              abolish destructive cravings that lead to anger, sorrow, and suffering. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Doing
              this requires constant mindfulness—a concept that is becoming a huge trend in
              the psychology field. To be mindful is simply to focus your awareness on the
              present moment, while avoiding judging your thoughts and feelings as either bad
              or good. It means to live totally in the present, and it has proven to be incredibly
              therapeutic. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">One of their leaders is found, not
              chosen.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Another
              Buddhism fact that may surprise you involves the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader
              of the Tibetan people. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">The
              Dalai Lama is found rather than chosen. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">The
              Dalai Lama is believed to have the ability to choose the body he is
              reincarnated into, meaning that each Dalai Lama is a reincarnation of the last. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">The
              High Lamas of the Gelupta tradition take on the search for the reborn Dali Lama
              each time the previous leader passes away. This can take years—it took, in
              fact, 4 years to find the current Dalai Lama, Tensin Gyatso. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">When
              the High Lamas have a vision, the search begins. They meditate at central
              Tibet’s holy lake, waiting for signs that may indicate where the new Dalai Lama
              resides. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">When
              the boy is found, the High Lamas enact a series of secret tests to make sure he
              is their actual reincarnated leader—this includes presenting the boy with a set
              of items, one of which belonged to the previous Dalai Lama, and seeing if he
              chooses the correct one. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">If
              chosen, the boy, family in tow, is taken to Lhasa, where he studies the
              Buddhist sutra to prepare for his place as spiritual leader of Tibet. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">They study kÅ�ans.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">A
              Buddhist kÅ�an is a paradoxical statement or question that is used in Zen
              practice to provoke doubt and test progress in Zen practice. Once the solution
              has been found, the kÅ�an is no longer paradoxical, and can be understood for
              what it is—a profoundly meaningful statement produced from the state of
              consciousness it is designed to awaken. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">They’re
              usually just a few sentences in length. A well-known example is Master Hakuin
              Ekaku’s question, "Two hands clap and there is a sound; what is the sound
              of one hand?" </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;  ">Contrary
              to popular belief, these aren’t simply nonsensical statements which suddenly
              bring about “Enlightenment”. They are meant to be creatively solved, although

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There
              are broadly 3 different denominations in Buddhism comprising: The Theravada,
              Mahayana and the Vajrayana. Within these 3 main branches, there are also many different
              subsects as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Is Buddhism a religion or
              a philosophy?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">www.religioustolerance.org</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Lack of standard definition of
              "religion:"</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Whether
              Buddhism is, or is not, a religion depends upon how the word
              "religion" is defined. Lots of people have their favorite definition;
              some think that theirs is the only valid meaning for the term.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Some
              definitions required a religion to include belief in the existence of one or
              more deities; this would classify most expressions of Buddhism as a
              non-religious since it is essentially a non-theistic religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Other
              definitions do not require religion to include belief in a deity; these would
              probably include Buddhism as a religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For example:</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Webster's New World Dictionary</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> (Third College Edition): defines religion as:
              "any specific system of belief and worship, often involving a code of
              ethics and a philosophy."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhism
              would not be considered a religion under this definition, because it is
              basically non-theistic: it does not generally involve worship of a supernatural
              entity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wikipedia</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> once defined religion as: "... a system of
              social coherence based on a common group of beliefs or attitudes concerning an
              object, person, unseen being, or system of thought considered to be
              supernatural, sacred, divine or highest truth, and the moral codes, practices,
              values, institutions, traditions, and rituals associated with such belief or
              system of thought."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhism
              could be considered a religion because its various forms share a system of
              thought that is considered to be the highest truth. It involves moral codes,
              practices, values, traditions and rituals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">More
              recently, Wikipedia have adopted the definition of the late Clifford Geertz, an
              anthropologist from Princeton: Religion is: "an organized approach to
              human spirituality which usually encompasses a set of narratives, symbols,
              beliefs and practices, often with a supernatural or transcendent quality, that
              give meaning to the practitioner's experiences of life through reference to a
              higher power, God or gods, or ultimate truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Here
              again, Buddhism would be considered a religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Anthony F.C. Wallace</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, a North American anthropologist who specializes in
              Native American cultures, suggested a definition as: "a set of rituals,
              rationalized by myth, which mobilizes supernatural powers for the purpose of
              achieving or preventing transformations of state in man or nature.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhism
              would not be considered a religion because it does not usually involve belief
              in supernatural powers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Robert Bellah</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, professor at the University of California, Berkley,
              in a legal declaration concerning the nature of transcendental meditation (TM),
              defined religion as: "a set of symbolic forms and acts that relate man to
              the ultimate conditions of his existence."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If
              the word "forms" is defined broadly, this would seem to imply that
              Buddhism is a religion, along with TM.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">H.L. Menken</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">, 20th century editor, person of ideas, satirist, and Agnostic
              defined religion's "...single function is to give man access to the powers
              which seem to control his destiny, and its single purpose is to induce those
              powers to be friendly to him." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              would imply that Buddhism is not a religion, because it does not presuppose the
              existence of supernatural powers with whom humans can react.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Comments by some Buddhists:</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Drepung Loseling Institute, a center for Tibetan Buddhist studies, practice and
              culture, fully accepts Buddhism as a religion. They state:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Like
              all major religions, Buddhism contains an explanation of the origin of
              existence, a morality, and a specific set of rituals and behaviors. ...
              Buddhism presents a transformational goal, a desire to improve one's situation,
              and a distinct moral code.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Late Ven Dr.K.Sri Dhammananda Nayaka Maha Thera JSM wrote:</span></p>

              impurities'."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">"For
              our purposes, religion may be defined in a very broad sense as a body of moral

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Venerable
              Master Chin Kung of the Buddhist Educational College in Singapore, describes

              religious Buddhism. Originally, Buddhism was not a religion, but now it has
              become one. We can no longer deny that there is a 'Buddhist religion' because
              everywhere we look, Buddhism is displayed as a religion. Unlike the monasteries
              in the past which held eight-hour classes per day and provided another eight
              hours for self-cultivation, today's Buddhist 'temples' no longer uphold such a
              perseverance of the Buddha's Teachings. Today we mainly see people offering to
              the Buddha statues and praying for blessings and fortune. In this way, Buddhism
              has been wrongly changed into a religion”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhism
              is not what we call a "top-down religion" -- one in which a deity
              reveals religious and spiritual truths to humanity. It is a "bottom-up
              religion" created by humans as an attempt to express spiritual concepts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Kerry
              Trembath, former Secretary of the Buddhist Council of New South Wales, in
              Australia writes :</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">"Buddhism
              does not deny the existence of gods or of other worlds, and indeed the
              devotional practices of many Buddhist traditions involve the veneration and
              invocation of special beings such as Avalokitesvara (known as Kwan Yin to many
              Chinese, or Kannon to the Japanese). However, at its core Buddhism is a
              non-theistic religion and, unlike other world religions, Buddhism is not a
              doctrine of revelation. The Buddha did not claim to be the bearer of a message
              from on high. He made it clear that what he taught he had discovered for
              himself through his own efforts."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">"The
              Buddha himself is revered not as a deity or supernatural being but as a very
              special kind of human being. He was a human who achieved the ultimate in
              development of his human potential. The Buddha taught that this achievement is
              within the reach of every human being, and he spent his life teaching a
              practical methodology which, if followed with purity of mind and great
              diligence, would enable others to reach the same objective. In other words, he
              taught a method rather than a doctrine. When questioned about the validity of
              his teachings, the Buddha did not refer to the higher authority of a deity. He
              explained that his teachings were based on his own direct personal experience,
              and he invited all who were interested to test for themselves whether the method
              he taught was effective." </span></p>
