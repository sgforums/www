              <p>In that article, Thusness stated there are two paths: the gradual path and the direct path. The direct path requires you to go through the I AM phase, after which you will be able to have that taste of non-dual presence as a guide, and you will intuitively know that taste is similar in all experiences and states when non-dual insight arises.</p>
              <p>The gradual path like Vipassana leads to non-dual experience and insight. It can be a question of 'How am I experiencing the moment of being alive?' which leads to the experience and insight of what Aliveness (seeing, hearing, touching, etc) is. This is the Actualism (actualfreedom.com.au) approach. There can also be the practice of bare mindfulness with a few pointers like 'in the seen only the seen', 'in the heard only the heard', 'there is sound but no hearer', 'thoughts but no thinker', etc which will lead to insights of non-duality and anatta. This is the case for me and Thusness.</p>
              <p>The direct path like self-inquiry leads to the I AM realization I articulated in the earlier pages in the Certainty of Being thread. It can be a question of 'Who am I?' or 'Without thoughts and labels, how is 'I' experienced?' which leads to the direct experience and insight of what Beingness or Pure Presence in a non-conceptual state is. It gives a sense of conviction having touched the essence of one's Presence/Being.</p>
              <p>If you want to practice self-inquiry, I can recommend the not-too-lengthy online articles by Ch'an Master Hsu Yun, books by Ramana Maharshi, Adyashanti's 'True Meditation', Stephen Bodian's 'Wake Up Now', Ken Wilber's 'The Simple Feeling of Being: Embracing Your True Nature'. There are probably many other good books on self inquiry from Zen and Advaita. My own e-book contains some substantial amount of info and conversations on this practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The latter parts of my e-book emphasize more on Vipassana 
                      practice as a way to enter non-dual insight. The earlier parts of my 
                      e-book emphasize on self-inquiry practice. It is just that different 
                      practice leads to different insights I am having and therefore a 
                      different emphasis at the moment. That said, I believe it is good to go 
                      through self-inquiry to realize the I AM first - however not everyone 
                      has to go through this path.</p>
