              <p>EARTHLINGS is a feature length documentary about humanity's absolute dependence on animals (for pets, food, clothing, entertainment, and scientific research) but also illustrates our complete disrespect for these so-called "non-human providers." The film is narrated by Academy Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix (GLADIATOR) and features music by the critically acclaimed platinum artist Moby.</p>
              <p>With an in-depth study into pet stores, puppy mills and animals shelters, as well as factory farms, the leather and fur trades, sports and entertainment industries, and finally the medical and scientific profession, EARTHLINGS uses hidden cameras and never before seen footage to chronicle the day-to-day practices of some of the largest industries in the world, all of which rely entirely on animals for profit. Powerful, informative and thought-provoking, EARTHLINGS is by far the most comprehensive documentary ever produced on the correlation between nature, animals, and human economic interests. There are many worthy animal rights films available, but this one transcends the setting. EARTHLINGS cries to be seen. Highly recommended!</p>

              <p>Yes, I agree! Earthlings is among the most heart-wrenching "meet your meat" or "meet your fur coat" footage I have ever seen. It is a must watch to see what we are doing to our world.</p>

              <p>hmm I don't think anyone would like to watch these documentaries too and this is probably not the goal of Earthlings... but documentaries such as these are very important to make public.</p>
              <p>Many of us have gone to zoos and circuses with animal performances, see dolphins "play" and "perform" in the dolphin lagoons, eat animal flesh, drink milk and milk products, wear leather and fur, buy shampoos and products tested on animals, take fish omega-3 oil etc.</p>
              <p>But we never make the connection between these activities with the suffering of other sentient beings. For every animal product we take or use we are creating a cause of demand and supply for the animal's suffering - and it is not just restricted to eating meat. Earthlings is the video that bridges these sufferings to the items we eat and use daily, and it is with this educational documentary that awake the compassion in people and allow them to see the connection, such that they can make more compassionate choices in the future.</p>
              <p>This is an example of how a slaughter scene turned an assistant director vegetarian.<br><a href="http://www.imdb.com/news/ni3522593/">http://www.imdb.com/news/ni3522593/</a></p>

              <p><br>I also couldn't stand it, but finished watching the whole documentary... many parts i couldn't really look at the screen, just hear the sounds... but this is reality, and we the consumers are the ones supplying the money and motivation for this to happen. </p>
              <p>I liked this documentary cos it showed something beyond just food. We are affecting other species in many other ways, not only food. And it is all through our greed and selfishness. And it inflicts so much pain.  Does it come as any surprise then that the karma will rebound on us very heavily...</p>
              <p>if we talk about hells, this is already showing you some hell on earth. Created by man...</p>
