              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Is Violation of the First Precept with Minimal Karmic
                  Retribution Possible?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Myanmar’s most revered Buddhist leader gave a
                  speech, which appeared to suggest that the killing of those who are not
                  Buddhist could be justified on the grounds that they were not complete humans,
                  or indeed humans at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Sitagu Sayadaw used the 5th Century CE Sri Lankan chronicle,
                  the Mahavamsa and quote from a notorious passage from the 25th chapter of the
                  Mahavamsa, “The Victory of Dutthagamani” which speaks of an ancient Sri Lankan
                  king who was assured by Buddhist clerics that the countless Hindus he had
                  killed only added up to one and a half lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The monk distanced himself from the characters in the story,
                  saying: “I’m not saying that, monks from Sri Lanka said that.” But he then
                  added: “Our soldiers should bear [this story] in mind.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Fortunately, the majority of the Buddhist in Myanmar are
                  followers of the Theravada tradition and not of the Mahayana tradition.
                  Otherwise, they would have more excuses, ammunitions and justification on the
                  pretext that it is in Buddhist teachings that one can use violence against the
                  minority Rohingya and any others that are deem to be a threat to their
                  survival. Imagine the consequences and the results that would come with it if
                  the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra is one of the major widely read Sutra used
                  in the country and the below quotes are used in isolation on its own to suit
                  the purposes of the moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Here are the quotes from the Sutra on the subject of the
                  Icchantika.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Violating the First
                  Precept without Karmic Retribution</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Chapter 22 of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra states:
                  "O good man! The Buddha and Bodhisattva see three categories of killing,
                  which are those of the grades 1) low, 2) medium, and 3) high. Low applies to
                  the class of insects and all kinds of animals, except for the transformation
                  body of the Bodhisattva who may present himself as such. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">O good man! The Bodhisattva-mahasattva, through his vows and
                  in certain circumstances, gets born as an animal. This is killing beings of the
                  lowest class. By reason of harming life of the lowest grade, one gains life in
                  the realms of hell, animals or hungry ghosts and suffers from the down most
                  “duhkha” [pain, mental or physical]. Why so? Because these animals have done
                  somewhat of good. Hence, one who harms them receives full karmic returns for
                  his actions. This is killing of the lowest grade. The medium grade of killing
                  concerns killing [beings] from the category of humans up to the class of
                  anagamins. This is middle-grade killing. As a result, one gets born in the realms
                  of hell, animals or hungry ghosts and fully receives the karmic consequences
                  befitting the middle grade of suffering. This is medium-grade killing. Top-rank
                  killing relates to killing one’s father or mother, an arhat, pratyekabudda, or
                  a Bodhisattva of the last established state. This is top-rank killing. In
                  consequence of this, one falls into the greatest Avichi Hell [the most terrible
                  of all the hells] and endures the karmic consequences befitting the highest
                  level of suffering. This is top-grade killing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">O good man! A person who kills an Icchantika does not suffer
                  from the karmic returns due to the killings of the three kinds named above. O
                  good man! All those Brahmins are of the class of the Icchantika. For example,
                  such actions as digging the ground, mowing the grass, felling trees, cutting up
                  corpses, ill-speaking, and lashing do not call forth karmic returns. Killing an
                  icchantika comes within the same category. No karmic results ensue. Why not?
                  Because no Brahmins and no five laws to begin with faith, etc. are involved
                  here [Maybe: no Brahmins are concerned with the "five roots" of
                  faith, vigour, mindfulness, concentration, and Wisdom]. For this reason,
                  killing [of this kind] does not carry one off to hell.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Again in Chapter 40 of the same Sutra it is stated; "O
                  good man! Because the Icchantikas are cut off from the root of good. All beings
                  possess such five roots as faith, etc. But the people of the Icchantika class
                  are eternally cut off from such. Because of this, one may well kill an ant and
                  gain the sin of harming, but the killing of an Icchantika does not [constitute
                  a sin]."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"O World-Honoured One! The icchantika possesses nothing
                  that is good. Is it for this reason that such a person is called an
                  "Icchantika"?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha said: "It is so, it is so!"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Who are these Icchantikas where taking their lives does not
                  even incur any karmic returns?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">[The Buddha] said: A monk, nun, male or female lay disciple
                  may be one. One who having rejected the scriptures with unpleasant speech does
                  not, subsequently, even ask for forgiveness has entered into the path of the
                  Icchantika. Those who have committed the four parajikas and those who have
                  committed the ?ve sins of immediate retribution, who even if they are aware
                  that they have entered into a fearful place do not perceive it as fearful, who
                  do not attach themselves to the side of the true teachings and without making
                  any efforts at all think ‘‘let’s get rid of the true teachings,’’ who proclaim
                  even that very [teaching] is blame-worthy - they too have entered into the path
                  of the Icchantika. Those who claim ‘‘There is no Buddha, there is no teaching,
                  there is no monastic community’’ are also said to have entered the path of the
                  Icchantika.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Chapter 39 of the Mahayan Mahaparinirvana Sutra also
                  describes the Icchantika as follows: "O good man! The Icchantika has six
                  causal relations. He falls into the three unfortunate realms and cannot get out
                  of them. What are the six? They are:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">1) His evil mind burns,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">2) He does not see the after-life,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">3) He takes pleasure in seeking defilement,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">4) He walks away from good,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">5) Evil actions hinder his way, and</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">6) He associates with an evil teacher of the Way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This again possesses five things, by which the person falls
                  into the three unfortunate realms. What are the five? They are:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">1) He always says that there can be no karmic results to come
                  about in regard to good or bad actions,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">2) He kills a person who has aspired to Bodhi,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">3) He takes pleasure in speaking about the evils committed by
                  priests,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">4) He says that what is right is not right and what
                  transgresses Dharma is lawful, and</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">5) He gives ear to Dharma just to pick up what goes against
                  [i.e. to find fault].</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Also, there are three things by which the person falls into
                  the three unfortunate realms. What are the three? These are saying that:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">1) The Tathagata is non-eternal, and goes away eternally,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">2) Wonderful Dharma is non-eternal and changes, and</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">3) The Sangha Jewel gets destroyed. For this reason, he
                  always sinks into the three unfortunate realms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The definition of an Icchantika is diverse. It consisted of
                  those who are considered to be spiritual dead such as the skeptics,
                  materialists and the communists. Others who blaspheme the religion and those
                  who do not believe in the Doctrines of the Buddha are also Icchantikas.
                  Basically, this would include all non-Buddhists since the Buddhist teachings of
                  no-self, impermanence, Emptiness, stress and suffering are unique to the
                  religion itself and not found in other Faiths.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The first precept of the Buddhist Faith is - “Do not kill”,
                  with the assumption that Buddhist teaching fundamentally condemns killing. The
                  Parikuppa Sutta listed five acts of deadly sins that will ruin the spiritual
                  cultivation of a person’s present life. They are: One who has killed his/her
                  mother, one who has killed his/her father, one who has killed an arahant, one
                  who with a corrupted mind has caused the blood of a Tathagata to flow, and one
                  who has caused a split in the Sangha. The five grave deeds are also listed in
                  the Mahayana Buddhist literatures as the ‘sins of immediate retribution’; the
                  anantarya karma. These crimes are so heinous that the karmic result will take
                  place immediately with descend into hell after physical death, rather than at
                  some unspecified point in the future as is usual for generic karmic results. One
                  would have notice that four of the five sins involve the taking of lives and
                  acts of violence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Here we should also note that being put under arrest, being
                  sentence to life imprisonment or even punish with a death sentence that
                  accompany the act of killing are auxiliaries of murder in secular life. The
                  effect of the karmic action of killing will still work itself out eventually.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In Nagarjuna Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom, ten
                  punishments on the act of killing are listed as follows:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">1) The mind is always infected by poison from lifetime to
                  lifetime without interruption.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">2) Beings abhor [the murderer] and feel no joy in seeing him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">3) [The murderer], always full of evil intentions,
                  contemplates evil things.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">4) Beings fear him, as though they saw a snake or a tiger.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">5) During sleep his mind is disturbed; when awake, he is not
                  at peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">6) He always has bad dreams.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">7) At the end of his life, he dreads a bad death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">8) He plants the causes and conditions leading to a short
                  life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">9) After the destruction of the body at the end of life, he
                  falls into hell.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">10) If he reappears among men, he always has a short life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Why then are there acts of killing that can be considered so
                  ‘light’ that no karmic retribution would befall a person who committed them?How
                  much of this doctrine which states that the taking of another life without any
                  karmic retribution has in history lend legitimacy to the justification for
                  going to war when the dharma is perceived to be threatened, and it is necessary
                  to fight against such forces of evil threatening the religion? Or as a
                  justification for killing when it comes to the defense of a Buddhist community
                  against enemies from a different faith? Or among Buddhists, disguise as the
                  protector of the true dharma to wage wars against other traditions over issues
                  of ideological supremacy? Or being exploited by monastic leaders who lent their
                  legitimacy to wars that are nothing more than wars of defense or simply for
                  conquest is however, anyone guess.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Although the notion of taking life without the fear of karmic
                  retribution does sound very un-Buddhist in nature, there indeed exists a
                  potential for Buddhist militants to justify the use of force from the quotes in
                  the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana texts. To try and minimize the negative effect of
                  this teaching, the Nichiren Daishonin Buddhists has gone as far as to
                  re-interpret the ‘killing of an Icchantika’ to mean not killing the individual
                  himself but stopping the act of slander and destroying the mind of slender
                  which products it, so that the person can incline toward the good.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As Buddhists, we should guard against any particular bad
                  attempts going too far beyond the underlying Buddhist teaching that
                  non-violence is nearly always preferred to violence, even though the act could
                  be as much a reaction to some outside conditions and circumstances as it is a
                  development of Buddhist doctrine. Violence and acts of killings should always
                  be regarded as an action of last resort.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Acts done out of hatred or anger is morally unacceptable to
                  an act done out of compassion, loving kindness and equanimity. If killing of an
                  Icchantika is meant as an act to accomplish the lesser of two evils, and
                  undertaken with minimal karmic harm and maximizes karmic benefit to sentient
                  beings, and the intent is carried out in a selfless manner that prevent greater
                  harm happening, than the act of taking the life of an Icchantika might be
                  considered as ‘just’ in the Mahayana tradition. But then again, it might not be
                  so for the Theravada, where the doctrine of the Icchantika does not even
                  existed and where the precept - ‘Do not kill’ does not allow for any exceptions
                  whatsoever.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The taking of lives that does not caused karmic retribution
                  may run counter to the concept of Ahimsa that the Buddhist Faith is usually
                  associated with. If one looked at chapter 3 of the Lotus Sutra, it gives a
                  rather detail description of the grave consequences that can befall one who
                  believes in the view of a self; do not have faith and blaspheme its teaching;
                  despise, hate, envy or bear grudges against one who recite, copy, or uphold the
                  sutra.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Maybe the Mahayana Tradition takes a more pragmatic approach
                  when it comes to the protection and preservation of the Buddhist teaching and
                  beliefs. And when the religion is under threat, the preservation of it should
                  takes precedent over many other things.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Nice
                      to hear your comments on the article. I presume what you disapproved of are the
                      passages from the Mahaparinivarna Sutra. The passages are controversial and
                      some experts even considered them as later additions to the Sutra. This sutra
                      originated in the first century CE which means it is already in existence for
                      more than 2000 years. It is a very influential Sutra. What I have quoted are
                      from, what I believe translation of the shorter version of this Sutra.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
                      quotes are not done with any ill intentions to cause trouble or mislead anyone.
                      Try reading it in the context of the situation presently developing in Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Truth
                      can sometime be rather unpleasant to the ears or to know. But I do not believe it
                      is right to sweep what is unpleasant underneath the carpet and hope it will go
                      away. I think it is rather dishonest to do so.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
                      me the 1</span><sup>st</sup><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> Buddhist precept of ‘Do Not Kill’ speaks for itself, and I think any
                      reasonable sane person, whether you belief in a religion or not, knows by
                      simple common sense that it is what you should do - Not to take lives, ideally in all situation and circumtances.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And
                      by the way, this write-up was also published in ‘The Buddhist Channel’.</span></p>

              can find the term ‘I<em>cchantika’ </em>in the
              Mahayana Sutras only - in such sutras as the Tathagatagarbha, Mahaparinirvana
              and the Lankavatara Sutras. The earliest of these Sutras is the Mahaparinirvana
              Sutra which dates back to the first century CE. There is a lot of controversy on
              this subject but since all beings have Buddha nature, they too will eventually be
              saved - if not in this life, in other rebirth.</span></p>

              <p>Hope it can reduce the notion of this Icchantika in the Mahayana sutras</p>
              <p>I don't really know about Buddha nature... it's more like the potential to be enlightened... but all people have their views, and we can't force views on others.<br>Whether they will be eventually saved is another matter</p>
