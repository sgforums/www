              <p>Baby savaged by wild animal captures Vietnamese hearts - again
              					   HANOI - VIETNAMESE toddler Phung Thien Nhan, not yet two years old, is
              a born survivor whose horrific story and cheeky smile have touched
              hearts and drawn offers of support from across the nation.</p>
              <p>Many people here remember reading about Nhan in newspapers back
              in 2006 after he was abandoned after birth by his teenage mother in a
              remote and poor central mountain area.</p>
              <p>Dumped outside the family shack and left to die, hidden under
              papaya leaves and bamboo, the newborn was mauled by a wild animal, most
              likely a dog, that chewed off his right leg and badly savaged his
              groin.</p>
              <p>Villagers found the boy, his pale and bloodied body crawling with ants.</p>
              <p>By the time he was taken by motorcycle to the nearest hospital,
              72 hours had passed and yet, miraculously, the child survived.</p>
              <p>Hospital staff amputated his leg at the hip and stabilised
              his condition, and visiting Buddhist monks named him Thien Nhan or
              'good person.'</p>
              <p> After two months local authorities, inexplicably, sent him back to his family, into the care of his grandparents.</p>
              <p>The case disappeared from the news. Many people presumed the boy had died.</p>
              <p>But Tran Mai Anh, a 35-year-old Hanoi journalist, couldn't stop
              thinking about Nhan, tormented at night by visions of what had become
              of him.</p>
              <p>Her worst fears would turn out to be true.</p>
              <p>When, after months of research, she tracked him down in
              December in his family hut, he was badly neglected, dirty, anaemic and
              suffering diarrhoea.</p>
              <p>She took him to a medical centre and, a month ago, adopted
              him, together with her husband and fellow journalist Phung Quang
              Nghinh.</p>
              <p>They took him back to Hanoi, where Nhan was treated for free at the French-Vietnamese hospital.</p>
              <p>VietCot, a German-funded charity, hand-crafted a prosthetic
              leg, urgently needed to stop further damage to Nhan's body - the first
              of many that he will need as he grows.</p>
              <p>His adoptive parents have contacted international hospitals
              about the plastic surgery and hormone therapy Nhan will need to lead a
              normal life.</p>
              <p>News quickly spread in the media, on Internet forums and in offices.</p>
              <p>Many hundreds emailed and visited the family house in Hanoi's
              Old Quarter, bringing toys, baby clothes and their own children to play
              with Nhan.</p>
              <p>'Many people came just to have a look because they couldn't
              believe he was alive,' said Mai Anh. 'Everyone is offering to help. I
              didn't know there are so many good people.</p>
              <p>'One old woman from the countryside came and insisted on
              giving us the little money she could spare. She wanted to see Nhan
              before her eye operation, in case something happened and she couldn't
              see him afterwards.'</p>
              <p>Friends set up an online diary at <a href="http://www.help-thien-nhan.blogspot.com/">http://www.help-thien-nhan.blogspot.com</a> and an account for donations to help cover the child's surgery and
              therapy bills, expected to run into the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
              <p>At first Nhan hid in corners, cried and only slept sitting up.</p>
              <p>'He ate bananas and cold rice, that's all he knew,' said Mai
              Anh. 'He didn't know what toys were, they were meaningless to him. We
              put him in front of the TV, but it seemed like the television set was
              invisible to him.'</p>
              <p>After a month with his new family, Nhan was cheerfully
              greeting visitors this week, playing with toys, and swaying on his new
              leg to the tune of his new big brother Minh, 8, playing the piano.</p>
              <p>'His emotions still change, but he's so much happier,' said
              Mai Anh. 'Now he eats everything,' she added with mock exasperation.
              'He's getting fat!' -- AFP</p>
