              <p>However, I have read that the academics speculate the Buddha used a wide range of language, speaking differently at different locations. He travelled throughout India, so naturally he had to adapt to the location.</p>

              <p>To answer your question from Theravada POV and literature, yes, the Buddha predicted the split in Buddhism . Schism in Theravada Buddhism is one of the 5 most serious offence (besides wounding of the Buddha, killing of arahants, killing of mother, killing of father) that creates a heavy kamma that guarantees rebirth in Hell in the immediate next life.</p>

              <p>All Buddhas will preach Dharma in Sanskrit as if you ever come across any very old sutras, Je TsongKhaPa's Lamrim. <strong>The Starting statments of Sutras are always in Sanskrit</strong>. Such as statement like Namo Guru VajraBhairaya</p>
              <p>From what i remembered:</p>
              <p>Namo meams to take refuge</p>

              <p>VajraBhaira The Adantinium Terrifer</p>

              <p>Why??? 1) To respect the Dharma's origin, 2) All Buddhas will spread Dharma in Sanskrit 3) to implant our mindstream with the language so that we will meet Buddhas eventually and understand the lauguage</p>

              <p>Languages evolve all the time and rapidly. Look at the English language itself. Within 50 years, it has changed a lot. It's more likely that the Buddha preached in a language understood by his contemporaries.</p>

              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali</p>
              <p>Nobody knows what exact language Buddha used, but Pali is believed to be the closest to the one used by him and his contempararies. Most likely it's derivative of the one spoken by the Buddha.</p>
              <p><br>Sanskrit is the ancient language in India which gradually supplanted the smaller languages/dialects. Hindus use Sanskrit too (correct me if I am wrong). Yes, Sanskrit was a later dominant language but not necessarily the ones spoken by the earlier people.</p>
              <p>The Agama sutras (sanskrit)  of Mahayana have lots of similarity with the Pali Cannon.</p>

              <p>"There are two crucial factors mitigating against the streamlining of "Buddhism" that many readers presumably desire. First, contrary to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, Buddhism is not a "Religion of the book." There is no single volume that contains the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha, in fact, wrote nothing at all. He wandered around a four-hundred-square-mile area of eastern India for forty-five years, verbally clarifying for others the nature of what he referred to as his "awakening" -- this liberating insight into the nature of human existence. Eventually codified by the community of his followers in India and committed to writing in Sri Lanka, China, and beyond (this process is explained later), this nearly half century of teaching amounts to a virtual library of books. The second factor working against an easy solution to the present-day multiplicity of Buddhisms is the fact that although the Buddha became a renowned teacher with a substantial following during his lifetime, he never centralized his authority. Scholars speculate that the Buddha modeled his practitioner community on the power-sharing republican political structure of his own people, the Sakyas of northeastern India (see "Pronunciation of Sanskrit and Pali Words"). In any case, shortly before he died, the Buddha insisted that no one assume the role of authority when he was gone. Hence, without a popelike figure to lay down the law, two predictable results manifested: the community splitered into numerous divergent sects and schools, and doctrinal disputes and variations in practice proliferated. The result of twenty-five hundred years of such diffusion is precisely the confusing cacophony of Buddhist voices beckoning us today from bookshelves and practice centers."</p>
