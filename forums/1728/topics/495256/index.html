              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Eric Weiner 21 February 2018 BBC News</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Circling Boudhanath Stupa each morning at sunrise, I learned
              to slow down, to stop fretting about ‘lost productivity’ and, instead, go in
              circles for a while.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Circles don’t get much respect. They are the pariahs of
              geometry; round pegs in a world of square holes. Western culture has little
              good to say about the circle. If we’re stuck on a project, we’re told to stop
              going in circles. Such criticism makes our heads spin, so we respond, as people
              say in the US, by ‘circling the wagons’.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lines and angles, though, are good. We’re told to travel in a
              straight line, to stand up straight and be a straight shooter – or maybe a
              straight arrow. Either way, it’s imperative that we think straight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For a long time, I, too, bought into this anti-circle bias.
              And while I often strayed from the straight and narrow, I always chalked up my
              circuitous path to personal shortcomings. It never occurred to me that circles
              might be good. Then I discovered Boudhanath.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Literally ‘Buddha place’, Boudhanath (or Boudha, for short)
              is a village nestled within the sprawling Nepalese city of Kathmandu. It is the
              city’s large and generous Buddhist heart, populated by tens of thousands of
              Tibetans and hundreds of Western spiritual seekers. Even though it’s now a part
              of Kathmandu, Boudha retains the self-contained cosiness of a village.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When I first arrived, rolling my luggage over the rocky
              pavement (the wheels going round and round), I was immediately struck by the
              circularity of the place. Everywhere I looked, I saw circles. Life here
              revolves, literally, around a giant marshmallow. Well, that’s what it looked
              like to me. It is, in fact, a stupa, a huge white mound topped with a
              glimmering gold tower and, painted in bright colours, the all-seeing eyes of
              the Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">All stupas represent the Buddha Mind, and circling it is
              believed to bring one closer to enlightenment. At any time of day, hundreds of
              people circle Boudhanath Stupa, chanting mantras, kneading their mala (round
              prayer beads) and twirling prayer wheels, cylinders of metal and wood that
              contain scrolls of Buddhist mantras. With the flick of a wrist, the cylinders
              turn round and round, while the people walk round and round.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhists love round things: the mandala, or circular
              representation of the universe, the prayer wheel, the stupa. Maybe that’s why,
              as one American convert to Buddhism told me, the lamas of Boudha are notoriously
              tardy. If everything is circular, including time, punctuality becomes a matter
              of perspective. You might be very late, or very early. It all depends on how
              you look at it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A central element of Buddhism, as well as Hinduism, is
              samsara, the nearly infinite cycle of birth and rebirth that is only broken
              once we achieve nirvana. Other faiths contain circularity, too. For instance,
              the whirling dervishes of Sufism, who, as they twirl round and round are said
              to get closer to Allah.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Like many Westerners, I view time, and history, as linear. I
              picture a timeline like the ones thrust upon me in secondary-school history
              lessons: a straight line that begins at point A and ends at point B. Many
              cultures, though, don’t see it that way. They view time, and indeed the
              universe, as circular. It’s called the Wheel of Time, or the Wheel of History,
              and it appears in a surprisingly large, and diverse, number of cultures, from
              the Q'ero Indians of Peru to the Hopi Indians of Arizona to the philosophy of
              Friedrich Nietzsche, who posited the notion of ‘eternal recurrence’. Nietzsche
              believed our lives repeat themselves in exactly the same way an infinite number
              of times.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As the days and weeks in Boudha passed, my linear thinking
              began to change, to bend. It wasn’t easy, but thankfully I had help: my friend
              James Hopkins, an investment banker-turned-Buddhist disciple and long-time
              resident of Boudha. One day, over breakfast, I confessed to Hopkins that I have
              trouble going in circles. I’d recently purchased a Fitbit, and progress and
              productivity were on my mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Ultimately, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do,” he
              told me, letting the beguiling words hover in the crisp morning air.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I found this notion simultaneously appealing and terrifying.
              If there is nothing to do, how do I know if I’m doing this nothingness right? I
              also found it odd coming from Hopkins, who is anything but idle. He’s up at
              dawn, meditating, then circling the stupa then working on his non-profit
              project Quilts for Kids. How can you be so busy, so active, yet tell me that
              ‘ultimately there is nothing to do?’. Isn’t that a contradiction?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Not at all, Hopkins said. There is a difference, he
              explained, between outward action and inner stillness. Activity is good, he
              said, especially activity that benefits other sentient beings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">My life in Boudha took on a circularity of its own. Each day,
              I woke at 05:30, splashed water on my face, then stumbled downstairs and out of
              the front door to join the river of people circling Boudhanath Stupa. At this
              hour, there were no tourists. It was just me and a few hundred Tibetans, going
              round and round. It felt good to walk, to sense the ground beneath my feet, to
              take in the essence, the ‘suchness’ of the place, as a Buddhist would put it.
              The light was milky and soft, the sun only beginning to peek above the horizon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I heard the clickety-clack of prayer wheels, the murmur of
              mantras, the flutter of pigeons flapping their wings, the clanking of shop
              shutters yanked open, the chortle of spoken Tibetan. And, always, that soundtrack
              to Boudha, seeping out of every trinket shop and chai stand or hummed aloud by
              the circumambulators: Om Made Padme Hum. It is the best known of the Tibetan
              mantras. It means literally ‘Hail to the Jewel in the Lotus’. The lotus flower
              grows in muck and mud yet blossoms clean and beautiful. It’s a nice sentiment,
              but what I like most about it is simply the way it sounds in Tibetan, the
              vibrations. The mantra wormed itself into my mind and I found myself chanting
              it without realising that I was doing so.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I continued to walk until my legs tired and my mind settled.
              The circumambulations are open-ended, freestyle. There’s no proscribed number
              of circuits. This is liberating, and frightening. How do you know when enough
              is enough?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“You’ll know,” Hopkins had told me, with a mischievous smile.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But I didn’t know. That was the problem. I couldn’t jettison
              my linear thinking. As I circled the stupa, I periodically twisted my wrist to
              consult my Fitbit. In theory, the device tracks my ‘progress’. It faithfully
              registers steps taken (3,635), miles traversed (1.68) and calories burned
              (879). In reality, though, it tells me nothing. I was going in a circle,
              getting nowhere.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The circle exposes the lie that is progress. Tracking your
              headway in a circle is not only futile but absurd. There are no straight lines.
              The question that a place like Boudha and a faith like Buddhism pose is this:
              can you acknowledge this futility? More than that, can you embrace the
              absurdity of the circle?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For the past few years, I’ve returned to Boudha every autumn.
              At first, I notice the small differences: a wood-fired pizza joint has opened,
              which annoys me (if I wanted wood-fired pizza, I would have stayed home) and a
              new sign declaring that ‘the use of drones is strictly prohibited’. Plenty
              about Boudha hasn’t changed, though. There’s the elderly Tibetan woman, pausing
              every few feet and falling to the ground, prostrating herself again and again.
              There is the little shop selling ‘Happy Buddhist Things’. And there is my
              friend James Hopkins.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Does the fact that I’ve managed to return each year amount to
              progress? A while ago, I might have framed it that way, but not now. I am
              simply revisiting a little corner – no, too angular – a small bubble on the
              planet that has taught me a very valuable geometry lesson. I have come full
              circle in Kathmandu.</span></p>
