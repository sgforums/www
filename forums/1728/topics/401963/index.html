              </span></p><p>SECRETS ON CULTIVATING THE MIND, an 
              outline of basic Seon practices, was written by Chinul between 1203 and 
              1205 to instruct the throngs coming to the newly completed Suseonsa 
              monastery. A seminal text of the Seon school, Secrets presents simple 
              yet cogent descriptions of two important elements of Chinul's 
              thoughtâ€•sudden awakening/gradual cultivation and the simultaneous 
              practice of samadhi and prajnaâ€•interspersed with edifying words to 
              encourage Buddhist students in their practice. Although Secrets was lost
               in Korea after the destruction wrought by the Mongol invasions two 
              decades after Chinul's death, it was preserved in the Northern Ming 
              edition of the tripitaka, produced in the early fifteenth century. 
              Reintroduced into Korea around that time, it was translated in 1467 into
               the Korean vernacular language using the newly invented han 'gul 
              alphabet. It remains one of the most popular Seon texts in Korea today.</p>

              <p>----------------</p>
              <p>
              </p><div>The triple world is blazing in 
              defilement as if it were a house on fire.<sup>1</sup> How can you bear 
              to tarry here and complacently undergo such long suffering? If you wish 
              to avoid wandering in samsara there is no better way than to seek 
              Buddhahood. If you want to become a Buddha, understand that Buddha is 
              the mind. How can you search for the mind in the far distance? It is not
               outside the body. The physical body is a phantom, for it is subject to 
              birth and death; the true mind is like space, for it neither ends nor 
              changes. Therefore it is said, "These hundred bones will crumble and 
              return to fire and wind. But One Thing is eternally numinous and covers 
              heaven and earth."<sup>2</sup></div>
              <div>It is tragic. People have been deluded for so long. They do not 
              recognize that their own minds are the true Buddhas. They do not 
              recognize that their own natures are the true dharma. They want to 
              search for the dharma, yet they still look far away for holy ones. They 
              want to search for the Buddha, yet they will not observe their own 
              minds. If they aspire to the path of Buddhahood while obstinately 
              holding to their feeling that the Buddha is outside the mind or the 
              dharma is outside the nature, then, even though they pass through kalpas
               as numerous as dust motes, burning their bodies, charring their arms, 
              crushing their bones and exposing their marrow, or else write sutras 
              with their own blood, never lying down to sleep, eating only one 
              offering a day at the hour of the Hare [5 to 7 a.m.], or even studying 
              through the entire tripitaka and cultivating all sorts of ascetic 
              practices, it is like trying to make rice by boiling sandâ€•it will only 
              add to their tribulation.<sup>3</sup> If they would only understand 
              their own minds, then, without searching, approaches to dharma as 
              numerous as the sands of the Ganges and uncountable sublime meanings 
              would all be understood. As the World Honored One said, "I see that all 
              sentient beings everywhere are endowed with a tathagata's wisdom and 
              virtue."<sup>4</sup> He also said, "All the illusory guises in which 
              sentient beings appear take shape in the sublime mind of the tathagata's
               complete enlightenment."<sup>5</sup> Consequently, you should know that
               outside this mind there is no Buddhahood which can be attained. All the
               Buddhas of the past were merely persons who understood their minds. All
               the sages and saints of the present are likewise merely persons who 
              have cultivated their minds. All future meditators should rely on this 
              dharma as well. I hope that you who cultivate the path will never search
               outside. The nature of the mind is unstained; it is originally whole 
              and complete in itself. If you will only leave behind false 
              conditioning, you will be "such" like the Buddha.'</div>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3. Why 
              can we not see this Buddhaâ€�nature now?  </strong><br><br> </span></p>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Question: If you say that the 
              Buddhaâ€�nature exists in the body right now, then, since it is in the 
              body, it is not separate from us ordinary men. So why can we not see 
              this Buddhaâ€�nature now? Please explain this further to enlighten us on 
              this point. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Chinul: It is in your body, but you 
              do not see it. Ultimately, what is that thing which during the twelve 
              periods of the day knows hunger and thirst, cold and heat, anger and 
              joy? This physical body is a synthesis of four conditions: earth, water,
               fire, and wind. Since matter is passive and insentient, how can it see,
               hear, sense, and know? That which is able to see, hear, sense, and know
               is perforce your Buddhaâ€�nature. For this reason, Linâ€�chi said, "The 
              four great elements do not know how to expound dharma or listen to 
              dharma. Empty space does not know how to expound dharma or listen to 
              dharma. It is only that formless thing before your eyes, clear and 
              bright of itself, which knows how to expound dharma or listen to 
              dharma."<sup>7</sup> The "formless thing" is the dharmaâ€�seal of all the 
              Buddhas; it is your original mind. Since this Buddhaâ€�nature exists in 
              your body right now, why do you vainly search for it outside? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">In case you cannot accept this, I 
              will mention some of the events surrounding a few of the ancient saints'
               entrance onto the path. These should allow you to resolve your doubts. 
              Listen carefully and try to believe. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Once long ago, a king who believed in
               a heterodox doctrine asked the Venerable Bharati: </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The venerable answered, "Seeing the 
              nature is Buddha." </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The king asked, "Has the master seen 
              the nature yet, or not?" </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The venerable answered, "Yes, I have 
              seen the Buddhaâ€�nature." </span></div>
              <div></div>
              <div></div>
              <div></div>
              <div></div>
              <div></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">your majesty were not acting, its essence would
               be very difficult to see." </span></div>
              <div></div>
              <div></div>
              <div></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">it is called seeing and in the ears it is called
               hearing. In the nose it smells, in the tongue it talks, in the hands it
               grasps, and in the feet it runs. When it is expanded, it contains 
              worlds as numerous as grains of sand. When it is compressed, it exists 
              within one minute particle of dust. Those who have recognized it know 
              that it is the Buddhaâ€�nature; those who have not call it soul or 
              spirit." </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">As the king listened, his mind opened
               into awakening.<sup>8</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">In another case, a monk asked the 
              master Kueiâ€�tsung: </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The master answered, "I will tell 
              you, but I'm afraid you won't believe me." "How could I dare not believe
               the sincere words of the master?" The master said, "It's you!" "How can
               you prove it?"<sup>9</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">These stories I have just told about 
              the saints of old entering the path are clear and simple; they do not 
              strain the powers of comprehension. If you gain some faith and 
              understanding from these two kongan, you will walk hand in hand with the
               saints of old.</span></div>

              Performing magic and miracles  </strong><br><br> </span></p>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question:</strong> You
               talked about seeing the nature. But when there is true seeing of the 
              nature, the person becomes an enlightened saint and should be able to 
              perform magic and miraclesâ€•he would be different from other people. How 
              is it, then, that among those who cultivate the mind nowadays, not one 
              can display these spiritual powers and transformation bodies? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chinul:</strong> You should 
              not utter absurdities lightly; to be unable to differentiate the 
              perverse from the noble is to be deluded and confused. Nowadays, you 
              people who are training on the path chat about truth with your mouth, 
              but in your minds you only shrink from it and end up falling into the 
              error of underestimating yourselves by thinking that you do not share in
               the Buddhaâ€�nature. This is all that you are doubting. You train on the 
              path but do not know the proper sequence of practice. You talk about 
              truth but do not distinguish the root from the branches. This is called 
              wrong view; it is not called cultivation. You are not only deceiving 
              yourselves; you are deceiving others too. How can you not be on your 
              guard against this? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Now, there are many approaches to the
               path, but essentially they are included in the twofold approach of 
              sudden awakening and gradual cultivation. Although sudden 
              awakening/sudden cultivation has been advocated, this is the entrance 
              for people of the highest faculties. If you were to probe their pasts, 
              you would see that their cultivation has been based for many lives on 
              the insights gained in a previous awakening. Now, in this life, after 
              gradual permeation, these people hear the dharma and awaken: in one 
              instant their practice is brought to a sudden conclusion. But if we try 
              to explain this according to the facts, then sudden awakening/sudden 
              cultivation is also the result of an initial awakening and its 
              subsequent cultivation. Consequently, this twofold approach of sudden 
              awakening and gradual cultivation is the track followed by thousands of 
              saints. Hence, of all the saints of old, there were none who did not 
              first have an awakening, subsequently cultivate it, and finally, because
               of their cultivation, gain realization. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The soâ€�called magic and miracles you 
              mentioned manifest because of the gradual permeation of cultivation 
              based on an initial awakening; it should not be said that they appear 
              simultaneous with that awakening. As it is said in the sutras, cordance
               with this awakening. Phenomena cannot be removed suddenly; they are 
              brought to an end step by step."<sup>10</sup> For this reason, 
              Kueiâ€�feng, in a profound explanation of the meaning of initial 
              awakening/subsequent cultivation, said, </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Although we know that a frozen pond 
              is entirely water, the sun's heat is necessary to melt it. Although we 
              awaken to the fact that an ordinary man is Buddha, the power of dharma 
              is necessary to make it permeate our cultivation. When that pond has 
              melted, the water flows freely and can be used for irrigation and 
              cleaning. When falsity is extinguished, the mind will be numinous and 
              dynamic and then its function of penetrating brightness will manifest.'' </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">These quotations should make it clear
               that the ability to perform magic and miracles in the phenomenal sphere
               cannot be perfected in a day: it will manifest only after gradual 
              permeation. Moreover, in the case of accomplished men, phenomenal 
              spiritual powers are like an eerie apparition; they are only a minor 
              concern of the saints. Although they might perform them, they do not 
              give them undue emphasis. Nowadays, deluded and ignorant people wrongly 
              assume that in the one moment of awakening, incalculable sublime 
              functions, as well as magic and miracles, manifest in tandem. This is 
              the sort of understanding I was referring to when I said that you did 
              not know the proper sequence of practice and did not distinguish the 
              root from the branches. To seek the path to Budâ€�dhahood while not 
              knowing the proper sequence of practice or the root and the branches is 
              like trying to put a square peg into a round hole. Can this be anything 
              but a grave mistake? Because such people do not know of any expedients, 
              they hesitate as if they were facing a steep precipice and end up 
              backsliding. Alas, many have broken their ties with the spiritual family
               of the Buddha in this manner. Since they neither understand for 
              themselves nor believe that others have had an understandingâ€�awakening, 
              when they see someone without spiritual powers they act insolently, 
              ridiculing the sages and insulting the saints. This is really quite 
              pitiful! </span></div>

              Sudden awakening/ Gradual cultivation  </strong><br><br> <strong>Question:</strong> You have said that this twofold approach of 
              sudden awakening/ gradual cultivation is the track followed by thousands
               of saints. But if awakening is really sudden awakening, what need is 
              there for gradual cultivation? And if cultivation means gradual 
              cultivation, how can you speak of sudden awakening? We hope that you 
              will expound further on these two ideas of sudden and gradual and 
              resolve our remaining doubts. <br><strong>Chinul:</strong> First let us 
              take sudden awakening. When the ordinary man is deluded, he assumes that
               the four great elements are his body and the false thoughts are his 
              mind. He does not know that his own nature is the true dharmaâ€�body; he 
              does not know that his own numinous awareness is the true Buddha. He 
              looks for the Buddha outside his mind. While he is thus wandering 
              aimlessly, the entrance to the road might by chance be pointed out by a 
              wise advisor. If in one thought he then follows back the light [of his 
              mind to its source] and sees his own original nature, he will discover 
              that the ground of this nature is innately free of defilement, and that 
              he himself is originally endowed with the nonâ€�outflow wisdomâ€�nature 
              which is not a hair's breadth different from that of all the Buddhas. 
              Hence it is called sudden awakening. <br>Next let us consider gradual 
              cultivation. Although he has awakened to the fact that his original 
              nature is no different from that of the Buddhas, the beginningless 
              habitâ€�energies are extremely difficult to remove suddenly and so he must
               continue to cultivate while relying on this awakening. Through this 
              gradual permeation, his endeavors reach completion. He constantly 
              nurtures the sacred embryo,11 and after a long time he becomes a saint. 
              Hence it is called gradual cultivation. <br>This process can be compared
               to the maturation of a child. From the day of its birth, a baby is 
              endowed with all the sense organs just like everyone else, but its 
              strength is not yet fully developed. It is only after many months and 
              years that it will finally become an adult. <br><br><strong>Question:</strong> Through what expedients is it possible to trace back the radiance of 
              one's senseâ€�faculties in one thought and awaken to the selfâ€�nature? <br><strong>Chinul:</strong> The selfâ€�nature is just your own mind. What other expedients do you 
              need? If you ask for expedients to seek understanding, you are like a 
              person who, because he does not see his own eyes, assumes that he has no
               eyes and decides to find some way to see. But since he does have eyes, 
              how else is he supposed to see? If he realizes that in fact he has never
               lost his eyes, this is the same as seeing his eyes, and no longer would
               he waste his time trying to find a way to see. How then could he have 
              any thoughts that he could not see? Your own numinous awareness is 
              exactly the same. Since this awareness is your own mind, how else are 
              you going to understand? If you seek some other way to understand, you 
              will never understand. Simply by knowing that there is no other way to 
              understand, you are seeing the nature. </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>6. Mind 
              of void and calm, numinous awareness  </strong><br><br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question:</strong> When 
              the superior man hears dharma, he understands easily. Average and 
              inferior men, however, are not without doubt and confusion. Could you 
              describe some expedients so that the deluded too can enter into 
              enlightenment?<br><strong>Chinul:</strong> The path is not related to 
              knowing or not knowing." You should get rid of the mind which clings to 
              its delusion and looks forward to enlightenment, and listen to me. </span></p>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Since all dharmas are like dreams or 
              phantoms, deluded thoughts are originally calm and the senseâ€�spheres are
               originally void. At the point where all dharmas are void, the numinous 
              awareness is not obscured. That is to say, this mind of void and calm, 
              numinous awareness is your original face. It is also the dharmaâ€�seal 
              transmitted without a break by all the Buddhas of the three time 
              periods, the successive generations of patriarchs, and the wise advisors
               of this world. If you awaken to this mind, then this is truly what is 
              called not following the rungs of a ladder: you climb straight to the 
              stage of Buddhahood, and each step transcends the triple world. 
              Returning home, your doubts will be instantly resolved and you will 
              become the teacher of men and gods. Endowed with compassion and wisdom 
              and complete in the twofold benefit, you will be worthy of receiving the
               offerings of men and gods. Day after day you can use ten thousand taels
               of gold without incurring debt. If you can do this, you will be a truly
               great man who has indeed finished the tasks of this life. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question:</strong> In our 
              case, what is this mind of void and calm, numinous awareness? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chinul:</strong> What has 
              just asked me this question is precisely your mind of void and calm, 
              numinous awareness. Why not trace back its radiance rather than search 
              for it outside? For your benefit I will now point straight to your 
              original mind so that you can awaken to it. Clear your minds and listen 
              to my words. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">From morning to evening, throughout 
              the twelve periods of the day, during all your actions and 
              activitiesâ€•whether seeing, hearing, laughing, talking, whether angry or 
              happy, whether doing good or evilâ€•ultimately who is it that is able to 
              perform all these actions? Speak! If you say that it is the physical 
              body which is acting, then at the moment when a man's life comes to an 
              end, even though the body has not yet decayed, how is it that the eyes 
              cannot see, the ears cannot hear, the nose cannot smell, the tongue 
              cannot talk, the body cannot move, the hands cannot grasp, and the feet 
              cannot run? You should know that what is capable of seeing, hearing, 
              moving, and acting has to be your original mind; it is not your physical
               body. Furthermore, the four elements which make up the physical body 
              are by nature void; they are like images in a mirror or the moon's 
              reflection in water. How can they be clear and constantly aware, always 
              bright and never obscuredâ€• and, upon activation, be able to put into 
              operation sublime functions as numerous as the sands of the Ganges? For 
              this reason it is said, "Drawing water and carrying firewood are 
              spiritual powers and sublime functions."<sup>14</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">There are many points at which to 
              enter the noumenon.<sup>15</sup> I will indicate one approach which will
               allow you to return to the source. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chinul:</strong> Do you hear 
              the sounds of that crow cawing and that magpie calling? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Student:</strong> Yes. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chinul:</strong> Trace them 
              back and listen to your hearingâ€�nature. Do you hear any sounds? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Student: At that place, sounds and 
              discriminations do not obtain. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chinul:</strong> Marvelous! 
              Marvelous! This is Avalokitesvara's method for entering the noumenon.<sup>16</sup> Let me ask you again. You said that sounds and discriminations do not 
              obtain at that place. But since they do not obtain, isn't the 
              hearingâ€�nature just empty space at such a time? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Student:</strong> Originally 
              it is not empty. It is always bright and never obscured. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chinul:</strong> What is this
               essence which is not empty? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Student:</strong> As it has 
              no former shape, words cannot describe it. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">This is the life force of all the 
              Buddhas and patriarchsâ€•have no further doubts about that. Since it has 
              no former shape, how can it be large or small? Since it cannot be large 
              or small, how can it have limitations? Since it has no limitations, it 
              cannot have inside or outside. Since there is no inside or outside, 
              there is no far or near. As there is no far or near, there is no here or
               there. As there is no here or there, there is no coming or going. As 
              there is no coming or going, there is no birth or death. As there is no 
              birth or death, there is no past or present. As there is no past or 
              present, there is no delusion or awakening. As there is no delusion or 
              awakening, there is no ordinary man or saint. As there is no ordinary 
              man or saint, there is no purity or impurity. Since there is no impurity
               or purity, there is no right or wrong. Since there is no right or 
              wrong, names and words do not apply to it. Since none of these concepts 
              apply, all senseâ€�bases and senseâ€�objects, all deluded thoughts, even 
              forms and shapes and names and words are all inapplicable. Hence how can
               it be anything but originally void and calm and originally noâ€�thing? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Nevertheless, at that point where all
               dharmas are empty, the numinous awareness is not obscured. It is not 
              the same as insentience, for its nature is spiritually deft. This is 
              your pure mindâ€�essence of void and calm, numinous awareness. This pure, 
              void, and calm mind is that mind of outstanding purity and brilliance of
               all the Buddhas of the three time periods; it is that enlightened 
              nature which is the original source of all sentient beings. One who 
              awakens to it and safeguards that awakening will then abide in the 
              unitary, "such" and unmoving liberation. One who is deluded and turns 
              his back on it passes between the six destinies, wandering in samsara 
              for vast numbers of kalpas. As it is said, "One who is confused about 
              the one mind and passes between the six destinies, goes and takes 
              action. But one who awakens to the dharmadhatu and returns to the one 
              mind, arrives and is still."<sup>17</sup> Although there is this 
              distinction between delusion and awakening, in their basic source they 
              are one. As it is said, "The word 'dharma' means the mind of the 
              sentient being."<sup>18</sup> But as there is neither more of this void 
              and calm mind in the saint, nor less of it in the ordinary man, it is 
              also said, "In the wisdom of the saint it is no brighter; hidden in the 
              mind of the ordinary man it is no darker." Since there is neither more 
              of it in the saint nor less of it in the ordinary man, how are the 
              Buddhas and patriarchs any different from other men? The only thing that
               makes them different is that they can protect their minds and 
              thoughtsâ€•nothing more. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">If you believe me to the point where 
              you can suddenly extinguish your doubt, show the will of a great man and
               give rise to authentic vision and understanding, if you know its taste 
              for yourself, arrive at the stage of selfâ€�affirmation and gain 
              understanding of your true nature, then this is the 
              understandingâ€�awakening achieved by those who have cultivated the mind. 
              Since no further steps are involved, it is called sudden. Therefore it 
              is said, "When in the cause of faith one meshes without the slightest 
              degree of error with all the qualities of the fruition of Buddhahood, 
              faith is achieved."<sup>19</sup> </span></div>

              practice of herding the ox   </strong><br><br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question:</strong> Once 
              the noumenon is awakened to, no further steps are involved. Why then do 
              you posit subsequent cultivation, gradual permeation, and gradual 
              perfection?<br><strong>Chinul:</strong> Earlier the meaning of gradual 
              cultivation subsequent to awakening was fully explained. But since your 
              feeling of doubt persists, it seems that I will have to explain it 
              again. Clear your minds and listen carefully! </span></p>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">For innumerable kalpas without 
              beginning, up to the present time, ordinary men have passed between the 
              five destinies, coming and going between birth and death. They 
              obstinately cling to "self and, over a long period of time, their 
              natures have become thoroughly permeated by false thoughts, inverted 
              views, ignorance, and the habitâ€�energies. Although, coming into this 
              life, they might suddenly awaken to the fact that their selfâ€�nature is 
              originally void and calm and no different from that of the Buddhas, 
              these old habits are difficult to eliminate completely. Consequently, 
              when they come into contact with either favorable or adverse objects, 
              then anger and happiness or propriety or impropriety blaze forth: their 
              adventitious defilements are no different from before. If they do not 
              increase their efforts and apply their power through the help prajna, 
              how will they ever be able to counteract ignorance and reach the place 
              of great rest and repose? As it is said, "Although the person who has 
              suddenly awakened is the same as the Buddhas, the habitâ€�energies which 
              have built up over many lives are deepâ€�rooted. The wind ceases, but the 
              waves still surge; the noumenon manifests, but thoughts still invade." 
              Seon Master Taâ€�hui Tsungâ€�kao said: </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Often gifted people can break through
               this affair and achieve sudden awakening without expending a lot of 
              strength. Then they relax and do not try to counteract the 
              habitâ€�energies and deluded thoughts. Finally, after the passage of many 
              days and months, they simply wander on as before and are unable to avoid
               samsara.<sup>20</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">So how could you neglect subsequent 
              cultivation simply because of one moment of awakening? After awakening, 
              you must be constantly on your guard. If deluded thoughts suddenly 
              appear, do not follow after themâ€• reduce them and reduce them again 
              until you reach the unconditioned.<sup>21 </sup>Then and only then will 
              your practice reach completion. This is the practice of herding the ox 
              which all wise advisors in the world have practiced after awakening. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Nevertheless, although you must 
              cultivate further, you have already awakened suddenly to the fact that 
              deluded thoughts are originally void and the mindâ€�nature is originally 
              pure. Thus you eliminate evil, but you eliminate without actually 
              eliminating anything; you cultivate the wholesome, but you cultivate 
              without really cultivating anything either. This is true cultivation and
               true elimination. For this reason it is said, "Although one prepares to
               cultivate the manifold supplementary practices, thoughtlessness is the 
              origin of them all."<sup>22</sup> Kueiâ€�feng summed up the distinction 
              between the ideas of initial awakening and subsequent cultivation when 
              he said: </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">He has the sudden awakening to the 
              fact that his nature is originally free of defilement and he is 
              originally in full possession of the nonâ€�outflow wisdomâ€�nature which is 
              no different from that of the Buddhas. To cultivate while relying on 
              this awakening is called supreme vehicle Seon, or the pure Seon of the 
              tathagatas. If thoughtâ€�moment after thoughtâ€�moment he continues to 
              develop his training, then naturally he will gradually attain to 
              hundreds of thousands of samadhis. This is the Seon which has been 
              transmitted successively in the school of Bodhidharma.<sup>23</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Hence sudden awakening and gradual 
              cultivation are like the two wheels of a cart: neither one can be 
              missing. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Some people do not realize that the 
              nature of good and evil is void; they sit rigidly without moving and, 
              like a rock crushing grass, repress both body and mind. To regard this 
              as cultivation of the mind is a great delusion. For this reason it is 
              said, cut off delusion thought 
              after thought, but the thought which does this cutting is a brigand."<sup>24</sup> If they could see that killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying 
              all arise from the nature, then their arising would be the same as their
               nonarising. At their source they are calm; why must they be cut off? As
               it is said, "Do not fear the arising of thoughts: only be concerned 
              lest your awareness of them be tardy."<sup>25</sup> It is also said, "If
               we are aware of a thought at the moment it arises, then through that 
              awareness it will vanish."<sup>26</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">In the case of a person who has had 
              an awakening, although he still has adventitious defilements, these have
               all been purified into cream. If he merely reflects on the fact that 
              confusion is without basis, then all the flowers in the sky of this 
              triple world are like smoke swirling in the wind and the six phantom 
              senseâ€�objects are like ice melting in hot water. If thoughtâ€�moment after
               thoughtâ€�moment he continues to train in this manner, does not neglect 
              to maintain his training, and keeps samadhi and prajna equally balanced,
               then lust and hatred will naturally fade away and compassion and wisdom
               will naturally increase in brightness; unwholesome actions will 
              naturally cease and meritorious practices will naturally multiply. When 
              defilements are exhausted, birth and death cease. When the subtle 
              streams of defilement are forever cut off, the great wisdom of complete 
              enlightenment exists brilliantly of itself. Then he will be able to 
              manifest billions of transformationâ€�bodies in all the worlds of the ten 
              directions following his inspiration and responding to the faculties of 
              sentient beings. Like the moon in the nine empyrean which reflects in 
              ten thousand pools of water, there is no limit to his responsiveness. He
               will be able to ferry across all sentient beings with whom he has 
              affinities. He will be happy and free of worry. Such a person is called a
               Great Enlightened World Honored One. </span></div>

              Meaning of maintaining samadhi and prajna equally  </strong><br><br> <strong>Question:</strong> In the approach of subsequent cultivation, we
               really do not yet understand the meaning of maintaining samadhi and 
              prajna equally. Could you expound on this point in detail, so that we 
              can free ourselves of our delusion? Please lead us through the entrance 
              to liberation. </span></p>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chinul:</strong> Suppose we consider these two dharmas and their attributes. Of the 
              thousands of approaches to enter the noumenon there are none which do 
              not involve samadhi and prajna. Taking only the essential outline into 
              account, from the standpoint of the selfâ€�nature they are characterized 
              as essence and functionâ€•what I have called the void and the calm, 
              numinous awareness. Samadhi is the essence; prajna is the function. 
              Since prajna is the functioning of the essence, it is not separate from 
              samadhi. Since samadhi is the essence of the function, it is not 
              separate horn prajna. Since in samadhi there is prajna, samadhi is calm 
              yet constantly aware. Since in prajna there is samadhi, prajna is aware 
              yet constantly calm. As Ts'aoâ€�ch'i [the Sixth Patriarch Huiâ€�neng] said, 
              "The mindâ€�ground which is without disturbance is the samadhi of the 
              selfâ€�nature. The mindâ€�ground which is without delusion is the prajna of 
              the selfâ€�nature."<sup>27</sup> If you have this sort of understanding, 
              you can be calm and aware naturally in all situations. When enveloping 
              and reflectingâ€•the characteristics of samadhi and prajna 
              respectivelyâ€•are not two, this is the sudden school's cultivation of 
              samadhi and prajna as a pair. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The practice of samadhi and prajna 
              intended for those of inferior faculties in the gradual school initially
               controls the thinking processes with calmness and subsequently controls
               dullness with alertness; finally, these initial and subsequent 
              counteracting techniques subdue both the dull and the agitated mind in 
              order to enter into stillness. Although this approach also holds that 
              alertness and calmness should be maintained equally, its practice cannot
               avoid clinging to stillness. Hence how will it allow those who would 
              understand the matter of birth and death never to leave the fundamental 
              calm and fundamental awareness and cultivate samadhi and prajna as a 
              pair naturally in all situations? As Ts'aoâ€�ch'i said, "The practice of 
              selfâ€�awakening has nothing to do with arguing. If you argue about first 
              and last, you are deluded."<sup>28</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">For an accomplished man, maintaining 
              samadhi and prajna equally does not involve endeavor, for he is always 
              spontaneous and unconcerned about time or place. When seeing forms or 
              hearing sounds, he is "just so." When wearing clothes or eating food, he
               is "just so." When defecating or urinating, he is "just so." When 
              talking with people, he is "just so." At all times, whether speaking or 
              keeping silent, whether joyful or angry, he is "just so." Like an empty 
              boat riding on the waves which follows the crests and troughs, or like a
               torrent flowing through the mountains which follows the bends and 
              straights, in his mind he is without intellection. Today, he is at peace
               naturally in all conditions without destruction or hindrance. Tomorrow,
               in all situations, he is naturally at peace. He follows all conditions 
              without destruction or hindrance. He neither eliminates the unwholesome 
              nor cultivates the wholesome. His character is straightforward and 
              without deception. His seeing and hearing return to normal and there are
               no senseâ€�objects to come in contact with [which could cause new 
              defilements to arise]. Why should he have to bother with efforts at 
              effacement? Since he has not a single thought which creates passion, he 
              need not make an effort to forget all conditioning. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">But hindrances are formidable and 
              habits are deeply ingrained. Contemplation is weak and the mind drifts. 
              The power of ignorance is great, but the power of prajna is small. He 
              still cannot avoid being alternately unmoved and upset when he comes in 
              contact with wholesome and unwholesome senseâ€�objects. When the mind is 
              not tranquil and content, he cannot but work both at forgetting all 
              conditioning and at effacement. As it is said, "When the six senseâ€�bases
               absorb the senseâ€�spheres and the mind no longer responds to the 
              environment, this is called samadhi. When the mind and the senseâ€�spheres
               are both void and the mirror of the mind shines without obscuration, 
              this is called <span>Even though this is the relative approach 
              to samadhi and prajna which adapts to signs as practiced by those of 
              inferior faculties in the gradual school, it cannot be neglected as a 
              counteractive technique. If restlessness and agitation are blazing 
              forth, then first, through samadhi, use the noumenon to absorb the 
              distraction. For when the mind does not respond to the environment it 
              will be in conformity with original calmness. If dullness and torpor are
               especially heavy, use prajna to investigate dharmas critically and 
              contemplate their voidness, and allow the mirror of the mind to shine 
              without disturbance in conformity with the original awareness. Control 
              distracting thoughts with samadhi. Control blankness with prajna.
              <div>When both activity and stillness disappear, the effort to 
              counteract them is no longer necessary. Then, even though there is 
              contact with senseâ€�objects, thought after thought returns to the source;
               regardless of the conditions he meets, every mental state is in 
              conformity with the path. Naturally samadhi and prajna are cultivated as
               a pair in all situations until finally the student becomes a person 
              with no concerns. When this is so, one is truly maintaining samadhi and 
              prajna equally. One has clearly seen the Buddhaâ€�nature.</div>

              Cultivation prior to awakening is not true cultivation  </strong><br><br> <strong>Question:</strong> According to your assessment, there are two 
              types of samadhi and prajna which are maintained equally during 
              cultivation after awakening: first, the samadhi and prajna of the 
              selfâ€�nature; second, the relative samadhi and prajna which adapts to 
              signs. </span></p>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The selfâ€�nature type means to 
              be calm yet aware in all circumstances. Since the person who has 
              awakened to the selfâ€�nature is always spontaneous and free from 
              attachment to objects, why does he need to trouble with effacing the 
              defilements? Since there is not even one thought which creates passion, 
              there is no need to make vain efforts at forgetting all conditioning. 
              Your assessment was that this approach is the sudden school's equal 
              maintenance of samadhi and prajna which never leaves the selfâ€�nature. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The relative type which follows signs
               means either to absorb distraction by according with the noumenon or to
               investigate dharmas critically and contemplate their voidness. One 
              controls both dullness and agitation and thereby enters the 
              unconditioned. But your assessment was that this practice is for those 
              of inferior faculties in the gradual school. We are not yet free of 
              doubts about the samadhi and prajna of these two different approaches. 
              Would you say that one should first rely on the selfâ€�nature type and 
              then, after cultivating samadhi and prajna concurrently, make further 
              use of the countermeasures or the relative approach? Or should one first
               rely on the relative type so that after controlling dullness and 
              agitation, he can enter into the selfâ€�nature type? If, after initially 
              using the samadhi and prajna of the selfâ€�nature, he is able to remain 
              calm and aware naturally in all situations, thus rendering the 
              counteractive measures unnecessary, why would he subsequently have to 
              apply the relative type of samadhi and prajna? It is like a piece of 
              white jade: if it is engraved, its natural quality will be destroyed. On
               the other hand, after the initial application of the relative type of 
              samadhi and prajna, if the work of counteraction is brought to a close 
              and he then progresses to the selfâ€�nature type, this would be merely 
              gradual development prior to awakening as practiced by those of inferior
               faculties in the gradual school. Then how would you be able to say that
               the sudden school's approach of initial awakening and subsequent 
              cultivation makes use of the effortless effort? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">If these two types can both be 
              practiced in the one time that has no past or future [via sudden 
              awakening/sudden cultivation], there would have to be a difference 
              between the respective suddenness and gradualness of these two types of 
              samadhi and prajnaâ€•so how could they both be cultivated at once? The 
              sudden school adept relies on the selfâ€�nature type and eschews effort by
               remaining natural in all situations. Students of inferior capacity in 
              the gradual school tend toward the relative type and exert themselves 
              applying countermeasures. The suddenness and gradualness of these two 
              types of practices are not identical; their respective superiority and 
              inferiority is obvious. So, in the approach of initial awakening and 
              subsequent cultivation, why is it explained that there are two ways to 
              maintain samadhi and prajna equally? Could you help us to understand 
              this and eliminate our doubts? </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong></strong></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chinul:</strong> The 
              explanation is obvious. Your doubts only come from yourselves! If you 
              try to understand by merely following the words, you will, on the 
              contrary, only give rise to doubt and confusion. It is best to forget 
              the words; do not bother with detailed scrutiny of them. Now let us go 
              on to my assessment of the cultivation of these two types of practice. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Cultivation of the samadhi and prajna
               of the selfâ€�nature involves the use of the sudden school's effortless 
              effort in which both are put into practice and both are calmed; oneself 
              cultivates the selfâ€�nature, and oneself completes the path to 
              Buddhahood. Cultivation of the relative samadhi and prajna which adapts 
              to signs involves the use of the counteractive measures which are 
              cultivated prior to awakening by those of inferior faculties in the 
              gradual school. Thoughtâ€�moment after thoughtâ€�moment, confusion is 
              eliminated; it is a practice which clings to stillness. These two types 
              are different: one is sudden and the other gradual; they should not be 
              combined haphazardly. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Although the approach involving 
              cultivation after awakening does discuss the counteractive measures of 
              the relative approach which adapts to signs, it does not employ the 
              practices of those of inferior faculties in the gradual school in their 
              entirety. It uses its expedients, but only as a temporary measure.<sup>29</sup> And why is this? In the sudden school too there are those whose 
              faculties are superior and those whose faculties are inferior; their 
              "baggage" [their backgrounds and abilities] cannot be weighed according 
              to the same standard. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">If a person's defilements are weak 
              and insipid, and his body and mind are light and at ease; if in the good
               he leaves the good and in the bad he leaves the bad; if he is unmoving 
              in the eight worldly winds; if the three types of feeling are 
              calmedâ€•then he can rely on the samadhi and prajna of the selfâ€�nature and
               cultivate them concurrently in all situations naturally. He is 
              impeccable and passive; whether in action or at rest he is always 
              absorbed in Seon and perfects the natural noumenon. What need is there 
              for him to borrow the relative approach's counteractive measures? If one
               is not sick, there is no need to look for medicine. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand, even though a 
              person might initially have had a sudden awakening, if the defilements 
              are engrossing and the habitâ€�energies deeply engrained; if the mind 
              becomes passionate whenever it is in contact with senseâ€�objects; if he 
              is always involved in confrontations with the situations he meets; if he
               is always beset by dullness and agitation; or if he loses the constancy
               of calmness and awarenessâ€•then he should borrow the relative samadhi 
              and prajna which adapts to signs and not forget the counteractive 
              measures which control both dullness and agitation. Thereby he will 
              enter the unconditioned: this is what is proper here. But even though he
               borrows the countermeasures in order to bring the habitâ€�energies under 
              temporary control, he has had a sudden awakening to the fact that the 
              mindâ€�nature is fundamentally pure and the defilements fundamentally 
              empty. Hence he does not fall into the corrupt practice of those of 
              inferior faculties in the gradual school. And why is this? Although 
              during cultivation prior to awakening a person following the gradual 
              approach does not forget to be diligent and thoughtâ€�moment after 
              thoughtâ€�moment permeates his cultivation, he still gives rise to doubts 
              everywhere and cannot free himself from obstacles. It is as if he had 
              something stuck in his chest: he is always uncomfortable. After many 
              days and months, as the work of counteraction matures, the adventitious 
              defilements of body and mind might then appear to weaken. Although they 
              seem lighter, the root of doubt is not yet severed. He is like a rock 
              which is crushing grass: he still cannot be selfâ€�reliant in the realm of
               birth and death. Therefore, it is said, "Cultivation prior to awakening
               is not true cultivation."<sup>30</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">In the case of a man who has 
              awakened, although he employs expedients, moment to moment he is free of
               doubts and does not become polluted. After many days and months he 
              naturally conforms with the impeccable, sublime nature. Naturally he is 
              calm and aware in all situations. Moment by moment, as he becomes 
              involved in sensory experience in all the senseâ€�realms, thought after 
              thought he always severs defilements, for he never leaves the 
              selfâ€�nature. By maintaining samadhi and prajna equally, he perfects 
              supreme bodhi and is no longer any different from those of superior 
              faculties mentioned previously. Thus, although the relative samadhi and 
              prajna is a practice for those of inferior faculties in the gradual 
              school, for the man who has had an awakening it can be said that "iron 
              has been transmuted into gold."<sup>31</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">If you understand this, how can you 
              have such doubtsâ€•doubts like the discriminative view that a sequence or 
              progression is involved in the practice of these two types of samadhi 
              and prajna? I hope that all cultivators of the path will study these 
              words carefully; extinguish your doubts or you will end up backsliding. 
              If you have the will of a great man and seek supreme bodhi, what will 
              you do if you discard this approach? Do not grasp at the words, but try 
              to understand the meaning directly. Stay focused on the definitive 
              teaching, return to yourselves, and merge with the original guiding 
              principle. Then the wisdom which cannot be obtained from any master will
               naturally manifest. The impeccable noumenon will be clear and 
              unobscured. The perfection of the wisdomâ€�body does not come from any 
              other awakening.<sup>32</sup> And yet, although this sublime truth 
              applies to everyone, unless the omniscient wisdom of prajnaâ€•the basis of
               the Mahayanaâ€•is started early, you will not be able to produce right 
              faith in a single thought. And how can this merely result in a lack of 
              faith? You will also end up slandering the three treasures and will 
              finally invite punishment in the Interminable Hell. This happens 
              frequently! But even though you are not yet able to accept this truth in
               faith, if it passes through your ears just once and you feel affinity 
              with it for even a moment, the merit will be incalculable. As it says in
               Secrets on Mindâ€�Only, <sup>33</sup> But he who does not lose the right cause for the attainment of 
              Buddhahood and who, moreover, listens and believes, trains and completes
               his training, and guards his achievement without forgetting it, how can
               his merit be calculated? </span></div>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>10. If 
              you do not cultivate now, you will go off in the wrong direction for ten
               thousand kalpas.  </strong><br><br> If we consider our actions in our past wanderings in samsara, we have no
               way of knowing for how many thousands of kalpas we have fallen into the
               darkness or entered the Interminable Hell and endured all kinds of 
              suffering.<sup>34</sup> Nor can we know how many times we have aspired 
              to the path to Buddhahood but, because we did not meet with wise 
              advisors, remained submerged in the sea of birth and death for long 
              kalpas, dark and unenlightened, performing all sorts of evil actions. 
              Though we may reflect on this once in a while, we cannot imagine the 
              duration of our misery. How can we relax and suffer again the same 
              calamities as before? Furthermore, what allowed us to be born this time 
              as human beingsâ€•the guiding spirits of all the ten thousand thingsâ€•who 
              are clear about the right road of cultivation? Truly, a human birth is 
              as difficult to ensure as "a blind turtle putting its head through a 
              hole in a piece of wood floating on the ocean"<sup>39</sup> or "a 
              mustard seed falling onto the point of a needle." How can we possibly 
              express how fortunate we are? </span></p>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Whenever we become discouraged
               or indolent, we should always look to the future. In one instant we 
              might happen to lose our lives and fall back into the evil bourns where 
              we would have to undergo unspeakable suffering and pain. At that time, 
              although we might want to hear one phrase of the Buddhaâ€�dharma, and 
              would be willing to receive and keep it with faithful devotion to ease 
              our misfortune, how would we ever encounter it there? On the point of 
              death, remorse is of no use whatsoever. I hope that all of you who are 
              cultivating the path will not be heedless and will not indulge in greed 
              and lust. Do not forget to reflect upon this as if you were trying to 
              save your head from burning. Death is fast closing in. The body is like 
              the morning dew.<sup>3</sup>' Life is like the twilight in the west. 
              Although we are alive today, there is no assurance about tomorrow. Bear 
              this in mind! You must bear this in mind! </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">By relying on worldly conditioned, 
              wholesome actions we will avoid the suffering of samsara in the three 
              evil bourns. We will obtain the favorable karmic reward of rebirth among
               gods or men where we will receive abundant joy and happiness. But if we
               give rise to faith in this most profound approach to dharma of the 
              supreme vehicle for only a moment, no metaphor can describe even the 
              smallest portion of the merit we will achieve. As it is said in the 
              sutras: </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">If one takes all the seven jewels in 
              all the world systems of this trichiliocosm and offers them to all the 
              sentient beings of those worlds until they are completely satisfied; or,
               furthermore, if one instructs all the sentient beings of those worlds 
              and causes them to realize the four fruitions, the merit so gained will 
              be immeasurable and boundless. But it is not as great as the merit 
              gained from the first recollection of this dharma for the period of one 
              meal." </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, we should know that our 
              approach to dharma is the holiest and most precious of all; its merit is
               incomparable. As the sutras say: </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">One thought of purity of mind is a 
              bodhimanda, </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">And is better than building 
              sevenâ€�jeweled stupas as numerous as the sands </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">of the Ganges. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Those jeweled stupas will finally be 
              reduced to dust, But one thought of purity of mind produces right 
              enlightenment." </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">I hope that all of you who are 
              cultivating the path will study these words carefully and keep them 
              always in mind. If this body is not ferried across to the other shore in
               this lifetime, then for which life are you going to wait? If you do not
               cultivate now, you will go off in the wrong direction for ten thousand 
              kalpas. But if you practice assiduously now, practices which are 
              difficult to cultivate will gradually become easier until, finally, 
              meritorious practice will advance of itself. </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Alas! When starving people are given 
              princely delicacies nowadays, they do not even know enough to put them 
              in their mouths. When they are sick they meet the king of doctors but do
               not even know enough to take the medicine. If no one says, "What shall I
               do? What shall I do?" then what shall I do for him?<sup>39</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Although the character of mundane, 
              conditioned activities can be seen and its effect experienced, if a 
              person succeeds in one affair, everyone praises the rarity of it. The 
              source of our minds has neither shape to be observed nor form to be 
              seen; the way of words and speech is cut off there. Since the activities
               of mind are ended, maras and heretics have no way to revile us. Even 
              the praises of Indra, Brahma, and all the gods will not reach it; so how
               can the mind be fathomed by the shallow understanding of ordinary men? 
              How pitiful! How can a frog in a well know the vastness of the sea?<sup>40 </sup>How can a fox roar like a lion?<sup>41</sup> </span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Hence we know that in this degenerate
               dharma age, a person who is able to hear this approach to dharma, 
              realize its rarity, and receive and keep it with faithful devotion has 
              for innumerable kalpas served all the saints, planted all the roots of 
              goodness, and fully formed the right cause of prajna â€•he has the most 
              proficiency. As the Diamond Sutra says, "If there is a person who can 
              have faith in these words, it should be known that this man has planted 
              all the roots of goodness in front of incalculable numbers of Budâ€�dhas."<sup>42</sup> It also says, "This is spoken in order to produce the great vehicle; 
              this is spoken in order to produce the supreme vehicle."<sup>43</sup> I 
              hope that those of you who are aspiring to the path will not be 
              cowardly. You must display your ardor. Good causes made in past kalpas 
              cannot be known. If you do not believe in your superiority and, 
              complacently resigning yourself to being inferior, you decide that you 
              will not practice now because it is too difficult, then even though you 
              might have good roots from past lives, you sever them now. The 
              difficulty will keep growing and you will move farther from the goal. 
              Since you have now arrived at the treasure house, how can you return 
              emptyâ€�handed? Once you lose a human body, for ten thousand kalpas it 
              will be difficult to recover. Be careful. Knowing that there is a 
              treasure house, how can a wise person turn back and not look for itâ€•and 
              yet continue to resent bitterly his destitution and poverty? If you want
               the treasure you must throw away this skinâ€�bag.</span></div>
