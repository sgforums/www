              <p>It depends on what type of insight meditation you are practicing and I am not familiar with every one of them. It is best you try to deligate some time to sitting meditation even if you are busy.</p>
              <p>But in short, yes.</p>

              <p>A chatlog that my friend sent me <img title="Smile" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"> He was
                                      chatting with our forummer, Thusness.<br> <br> Ck: john, how to practise vipassana in daily life?<br> Thusness: just observe every sensation.<br> Thusness: until one day u are able to experience "emptiness as
                                      form".<br> Thusness: then it becomes effortless.<br> Thusness: Truthz u cannot imagine the bliss when one clearly
                                      experiences that.<br> Thusness: but there is no point to over stress anything.<br> Thusness: <img title="Smile" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"><br> Ck: Thusness just observe every sensation... give me an eg?<br> Thusness: when u breath, u don't have to care what is the right way
                                      of breathing, whether u breath hard or soft, smooth or fine...just
                                      experience as much clarity as u can...just that
                                      experience...regardless of what it is like.<br> Thusness: same for all other experiences.<br> Ck: wot abt sound? hows it?<br> Thusness: when u hear, just the sound...the totality of the sound.
                                      There is no how but just to do away with all abitary thoughts. Hear
                                      the sound as clear as u can be.<br> Ck: then wot abt thots?<br> Ck: thots r v sticky <img title="Sad" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad"><br> Thusness: thoughts seldom arise if the practice is correct. If it
                                      arises, then not to chase after its meaning. Not to answer urself
                                      what it means, not to dwell in 'what'...then u will resort to just
                                      the moment of awareness.<br> Ck: when i try to be just openly aware, i notice that i jump from
                                      sense to sense<br> Ck: like one moment hearing, then touch, etc<br> Thusness: that is okie.<br> Thusness: our nature is so.<br> Ck: wots the rite way to do it<br> Thusness: don't think that u should concentrate.<br> Thusness: ur only duty is to sense with as much clarity as
                                      possible.<br> Ck: and for all the sensations, i dun dwell in the 'what'?<br> Thusness: ur mind is looking for a way, a method<br> Thusness: but what that is needed is only the clarity.<br> Thusness: however because our mind is so molded and affect by our
                                      habitual propensities, it becomes difficult what that is direct and
                                      simple.<br> Thusness: just stop asking 'how', 'what', 'why'.<br> Thusness: and submerge into the moment.<br> Thusness: and experience.<br> Thusness: i perfer u to describe.<br> Thusness: not to ask how, what, why, when, where and who.<br> Thusness: only this is necessary.<br> Ck: ok<br> Thusness: if u practice immediately, u will understand.<br> Thusness: if u entertain who, what, where, when and how, u create
                                      more propensities and dull ur own luminosity.<br> <br> Ck: i shuffle btw self inquiry, observing sensations n thots, being
                                      aware... its ok rite<br> Thusness: yes<br> Ck: means start work i'll hv even more propensities...<br> Thusness: that is when u do not understand what awareness, but it
                                      is true to certain extend. <img title="Smile" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>
