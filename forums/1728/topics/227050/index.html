            <div class='col-md body'>Ok I shall reply a bit on the Full of Error video now that I have some time.<br><strong>I have decided to refute every ridiculous claims in this video <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></strong> (unfortunately there are countless of such 'evangelical', 'propaganda' videos that is a complete distortion or misunderstanding of Buddhism. so any more of such crap videos coming up, I'm just going to refer them to this topic.)<br><br><strong>At 2:47, <span style="font-style: italic;">Their days will be spent in hunger and poverty. They will not work and they will beg for food. They will have no family lives and they will have nothing to wear but these clothes. And what is more, they will do all these in the superstitious belief in order not to be reborn as a fly or a mouse</span>.</strong><br><br>This is absurd to the point of...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Firstly monks are not hungry because there are lots of followers who give them alms, on the material level they are adequate and stable, and secondly they have realised the true gems and wealth of the universe is only to be found in the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha).<br><br>The ultimate aim of Buddhism is liberation, nirvana, not just being reborn in higher realms and creating better karma. Anyone - even non-monks - can create good karma and be reborn in heaven. In fact even lay people can practise and be enlightened, liberated.<br><br>The reason why some Buddhists chose to renounce? Because they wish to wholly concentrate their lives on the practising of the dharma leading to the great liberation and serving the lays.<br><br><strong>Ok. Next, at 3:16, <span style="font-style: italic;">For Buddhists, who spend their days in pointless irrational rituals, life is always dark and stagnant.</span></strong><br><br>Again, that is not understanding Buddhism's Sangha and monastic community at all. Rituals take up very little time of a Monk's life. A monk seeks to learn the dharma, practise the dharma, and serve the lay people. Useless rituals are shunned and rejected by Buddhism. Meditation is certainly not a ritual, but a practise to develope concentration and insight, and so is chanting. Another purpose of chanting is to gain knowledge of the scriptures and make sure that one is well versed, knows the words of the Buddha well.<br><br>In fact, one of the fundamental Â“defilementsÂ” that drops away at first awakening (the stage of Sotapanna or Stream-enterer) is attachment to rites and rituals, i.e. Buddhism, ceremony, specific techniques, and religious and cultural trappings in general.<br><br><strong>Next. At 3:28, Furthermore, among all these rituals, Buddhism cause people to forget God or even to deny him.</strong><br><br>What a bunch of crap.. let's not talk about the rituals, but in the first place, does Buddhism even teach about a Creator?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong>Quite unlike Buddhists, those who live under the moral values of Islam are always productive, happy, and at peace.</strong><br><br>Some kind of propaganda nonsense. I am not questioning Islam's goodness, but to say that Buddhists are not productive, happy and at peace is absurd. I'm sure the author has not met any true Buddhists and is merely trying his best to badmouth Buddhism to the best of his ability (and a very bad attempt)<br><br><strong>Buddha chose to speak about his basic tenets and hand on his form of worship orally.</strong><br><br>Buddhists don't worship any supreme deities.<br><br><strong>The only subject matter in this book is people suppressing all their desires and trying to train souls living in poverty and suffering.</strong><br><br>Buddhism teaches <strong>liberation</strong> from desires, not suppressing. Suppressing seems like putting a rock on top of a weed but once the rock is removed, it grows again. But liberation means the root of the weed (of Ignorance) is uprooted.<br><br>Secondly: Buddhists practise middle way of neither the extreme of luxurious wealth, and the other extreme of ascetism.<br><br><strong>Buddhists build their lives on supppressing human wishes and desires and by performing various rituals.</strong><br><br>Suppressing human values and desires --&gt; explained above. Rather, Buddhists aim to develope insights and looking into the very nature of existence, and as a result we free ourselves from false notions such as a permanent and seperate self, or seeing permanence whereas the truth is they are impermanent.<br><br>Actually when Buddha said 'Desire is Suffering', we must be careful in understanding it. Dharma Dan said: <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Craving,Â” Â“attachment,Â” and Â“desireÂ” are some of the most dangerous words that can be used to describe something that is actually much more fundamental than these seem to indicate. The Buddha did talk about these conventional forms of suffering, but he also talked about the fundamental suffering that comes from some deep longing for a refuge that involves a separate or permanent self. We imagine that such a self will be a refuge, and so we desire such a self, we try to make certain sensations into such a self, we cling to the fundamental notion that such a self can exist as a stable entity and that this will somehow help. The side effects of this manifest in all sorts of additions to mind states and emotions that are not helpful, but these are side effects and not the root that cause of suffering that the Buddha was pointing to.</span><br><br>Rituals --&gt; pure lol.<br><br><strong>The process of turning Buddha into an ideal began immediately after his death. Buddhist priests set to make him Divine. They adorn the places they live and with great statues of the Buddha and superstitiously worship these idols they made with their own hands.</strong><br><br>Firstly, Buddha is an ideal because he taught that everyone could attain enlightenment like him. The theory that 'Buddhist priests' (btw is monks or nuns, not priests) make him divine or make him into an ideal is plain queer and without basis.<br><br>Secondly, Buddha himself allowed (in his lifetime) his disciples to make images of him while he travels to preach his mother in the heavens. That is the beginning of the tradition of making images and statues of Buddha. However, we <strong>do not worship any forms and images of Buddha</strong>. Instead, we pay reverence and respects to the Buddha, treating him like our <strong>honoured teacher</strong>, not a divine, supreme deity.</div>

Afterall, the creator is not going to visit this website and see his/her erroneous views being rectified.  He/she is not interested in that anyway.  It was produced by some irresponsible people who maybe, orchestrated the 911.  Anyway, it's way too long and the targetted audience are probably some millitant groups who are anti all religious except theirs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just finished watching the video. I feel that the author is biased against buddhism and in the video, he makes buddhism sound like a cult just because buddhism is an atheist religion and say what buddhism teaches ppl to inflict sufferings and pain on themselves. Then, he also keep quoting from the Quran and keep praising Islam as the best religion. The threadstart obviously got some bad motives.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
