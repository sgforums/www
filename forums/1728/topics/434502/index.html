              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I believe the moderators of ‘Buddhism Wisdom Bliss’ are not given the rights to ‘lock out’ any threads that are deem inappropriate, irrelevant to the subject matter that is intended of the initial posting; or when slandering take place due to difference in opinions; or when discussion turn into unnecessary chatter; or when individual of other Faiths decide to use the forum for proselytizing purposes as well as when individuals decides to used it for other self-serving purposes. <span> </span>It seems that the moderators have only the right to delete single posting that they deem undesirable. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If anyone have visited the Buddhist forum site ‘Buddhism Without Boundaries’, they would have notice that the Administrator and Moderators of the site would not hesitate to 'Lock out’ any original thread once it get out controls such as when situation described above develops. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Initially one may find their decision rather arbitrary in nature and the threads need not have warranted such drastic actions. <span> </span>But when one look at some of the postings in 'Buddhism Wisdom Bliss’ and how they eventually turn so totally irrelevant to the initial intend purpose of the posting; it is certainly necessary to give the moderators of the site the authority to ‘lock out’ any threads that they deem to be undesirable or becoming irrelevant. I believe if this is not done, ‘Buddhism Wisdom Bliss’ will eventually lose its relevant as a site for information and discussion on matters relating to Buddhism. Also, over time it may slowly lose its readership and contributors as well. </span></p>

              <p>Buddhism without Boundaries as you suggested, is one environment to discuss Buddhism,  Buddhism Wisdom Bliss is another. I've learnt quite a bit from here, and realised there's more to learn. I've also learnt somewhat to be more accomodating without compromising my beliefs.  </p>
              <p>Your suggestion hold some reason, but we are practising Buddhism in an open society. I do not relish the idea of having a "closed" forum .Buddhism by it's very nature, inclusive. Probably the most blatant and unsusceptible to reasoning should be censured and  lock out. Quibbling over semantics should also be minimised, I think.</p>
              <p>I also wish people who are not yet Buddhist to  understand Buddhism in the current context of other belief.  I also  think there is a wish for  interfaith discussion. Respect comes from understanding and must be earned! But this is purely hope and speculation on  my part! You should here it straight from the horse's mouth ! </p>

              <p>think im of the opinion that stricter rules are better. </p>
              <p>first, people who are really interested in learning the Dharma will get good guidance from this forum. remember when i first came here to learn, the posts were mostly beneficial and timely.</p>
              <p>second, by stopping irrelevant postings, the chances of slander of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha is lower. many a times we see fuel being added into irrelevant discussions which end up in negative comments.</p>
              <p>ultimately what most practitioners want is a platform to clarify, learn and discuss the important tenets of Buddhism. but if required, rules must be enforced. </p>
              <p>this community is not unlike the sangha. even if physically its not, the spirit and attitude can be.</p>

              <p>When there are two position being contested, tenability of the two positions will be examined, and also validity of the points raised . Thus, ones' views will be reevaluated leading to a deeper understanding and humility.</p>
              <p>And yes, there are a clash of personalities which will cloud issues, but with mindful commentaries, it can be mitigated.</p>
              <p>There are many a good posting by different contributors which makes this forum relevant. There will be Theravadan, Mahayanist replying, but all will be Buddhist. </p>
              <p>However, I hope to see more commentaries and debate by persons  who would then be in a better position to educate others on the wisdom of Buddhism. I  would call these aspiring teachers, leaders of men, our future Arhats, Bodhisattvas and Future Buddhas.</p>

              <p>How lucid our answers are depends on our clarity on the subject. It helps the replier a process to refine his understanding.</p>
              <p>Controversial interjections is not constant.It rains and then its stops, a light drizzle or a heavy storm, no one situation being permanent only in duration. As a site grows, it will attract more people, with varied outlooks, with different abilities and learned backgrounds.</p>
              <p>When there are two position being contested, tenability of the two positions will be examined, and also validity of the points raised . Thus, ones' views will be reevaluated leading to a deeper understanding and humility.</p>
              <p>And yes, there are a clash of personalities which will cloud issues, but with mindful commentaries, it can be mitigated.</p>
              <p>There are many a good posting by different contributors which makes this forum relevant. There will be Theravadan, Mahayanist replying, but all will be Buddhist. </p>
              <p>However, I hope to see more commentaries and debate by persons  who would then be in a better position to educate others on the wisdom of Buddhism. I  would call these aspiring teachers, leaders of men, our future Arhats, Bodhisattvas and Future Buddhas.</p>

              <p>i beg to differ. not that i oppose free expression and individual responsibility, but i trust the ability of our moderators to stop unfruitful and harmful discussions that may serve to confuse new readers.</p>
              <p>most of the regular posters here are mature practitioners and can choose to ignore posters who are here to get attention. however there may be new practitioners who might be confused by a unfruitful debate and lose interest in practice.</p>
              <p>most of the debates here are fine. just a few needs more active moderation, which AEN has demonstrated often when he deleted some posts. hope the other moderators can help in this aspect.</p>

              <p>I can't because my knowledge is limited. Frankly speaking, sometimes I don't quite understand what you guys are talking about, especially about emptiness ha ha............. However, I can alert moderators what to delete if there is a need.</p>
