              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Why so many Americans think Buddhism is just
              a philosophy </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">January 22, 2018 Pamela Winfield The Conversation US</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In East Asia, Buddhists celebrate the Buddha’s death and
              entrance into final enlightenment in February. But at my local Zen temple in
              North Carolina, the Buddha’s enlightenment is commemorated during the holiday
              season of December, with a short talk for the children, a candlelight service
              and a potluck supper following the celebration. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Welcome to Buddhism, American-style. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Early influences</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism entered into the American cultural consciousness in
              the late 19th century. It was a time when romantic notions of exotic Oriental
              mysticism fueled the imaginations of American philosopher-poets, art
              connoisseurs, and early scholars of world religions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Transcendental poets like Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo
              Emerson read Hindu and Buddhist philosophy deeply, as did Henry Steel Olcott,
              who traveled to Sri Lanka in 1880, converted to Buddhism and founded the
              popular strain of mystical philosophy called Theosophy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Meanwhile, connoisseurs of Buddhist art introduced America to
              the beauty of the tradition. The art historian and professor of philosophy
              Ernest Fenellosa, as well as his fellow Bostonian William Sturgis Bigelow, were
              among the first Americans to travel to Japan, convert to Buddhism and avidly
              collect Buddhist art. When they returned home, their collections formed the
              core of the premiere Arts of Asia collection at the Museum of Fine Arts,
              Boston. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At the same time, early scholars of world religions such as
              Paul Carus made Buddhist teachings readily accessible to Americans. He
              published “The Gospel of Buddha,” a best-selling collection of Buddhist
              parables, a year after attending the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago
              in 1893. This was the first time in modern history that representatives from
              the world’s major religions came together to learn about one another’s
              spiritual traditions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddhist delegation in Chicago included the Japanese Zen
              master Shaku SÅ�en and the Sri Lankan Buddhist reformer AnagÄ�rika DharmapÄ�la,
              who himself had studied western science and philosophy to modernize his own
              tradition. These Western-influenced Buddhists presented their tradition to
              their modern Western audience as a “non-theistic” and “rational” tradition that
              had no competing gods, irrational beliefs or supposedly meaningless rituals to
              speak of. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Continuity and change</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Traditional Buddhism does in fact have many deities,
              doctrines and rituals, as well as sacred texts, ordained priests, ethics,
              sectarian developments and other elements that one would typically associate
              with any organized religion. But at the 1893 World Parliament, the Buddhist
              masters favorably presented their meditative tradition to modern America only
              as a practical philosophy, not a religion. This perception of Buddhism persists
              in America to this day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddhists did not deliberately misrepresent their
              tradition or just tell the Americans what they wanted to hear. They were
              genuine in their attempt to make a 2500-year old tradition relevant to the late
              19th century. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But in the end they only transplanted but a few branches of
              Buddhism’s much larger tree into American soil. Only a few cuttings of Buddhist
              philosophy, art and meditation came into America, while many other traditional
              elements of the Buddhist religion remained behind in Asia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism in America</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Once it was planted here though, Americans became
              particularly fascinated with the mystical appeal of Buddhist meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The lay Zen teacher Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki, who was Japanese
              Zen Master Shaku SÅ�en’s student and translator at the World’s Parliament,
              influenced many leading artists and intellectuals in the postwar period. Thanks
              to his popular writings and to subsequent waves of Asian and American Buddhist
              teachers, Buddhism has impacted almost every aspect of American culture. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Environmental and social justice initiatives have embraced a
              movement known as “Engaged Buddhism” ever since Martin Luther King Jr.
              nominated its founder, the Vietnamese monk and anti-war activist Thich Nhat
              Hanh, for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1967. His Buddhist Order of Interbeing
              continues to propose mindful, nonviolent solutions to the world’s most pressing
              moral concerns.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">America’s educational system has also been enriched by its
              first Buddhist-affiliated university at Naropa in Colorado, which paved the way
              for other Buddhist institutions of higher learning such as Soka University and
              University of the West in California, as well as Maitripa College in Oregon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The medical establishment too has integrated
              mindfulness-based stress reduction into mainstream therapies, and many prison
              anger management programs are based on Buddhist contemplative techniques such
              as Vipassana insight meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The same is true of the entertainment industry that has
              incorporated Buddhist themes into Hollywood blockbusters, such as “The Matrix”.
              Even professional athletics have used Zen coaching strategies and furthered
              America’s understanding of Buddhism not as a “religion” but as a secular
              philosophy with broad applications.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The exotic appeal</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But American secular Buddhism has also produced some
              unintended consequences. Suzuki’s writings greatly influenced Jack Kerouac, the
              popular Beat Generation author of “On the Road” and “The Dharma Bums.” But
              Suzuki regarded Kerouac as a “monstrous imposter” because he sought only the
              freedom of Buddhist awakening without the discipline of practice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Other Beat poets, hippies and, later, New Age DIY
              self-helpers have also paradoxically mistaken Buddhism for a kind of
              self-indulgent narcissism, despite its teachings of selflessness and
              compassion. Still others have commercially exploited its exotic appeal to sell
              everything from “Zen tea” to “Lucky Buddha Beer,” which is particularly ironic
              given Buddhism’s traditional proscription against alcohol and other
              intoxicants. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As a result, the popular construction of nonreligious
              Buddhism has contributed much to the contemporary “spiritual but not religious”
              phenomenon, as well as to the secularized and commodified mindfulness movement
              in America.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We may have only transplanted a fraction of the larger bodhi
              tree of religious Buddhism in America, but our cutting has adapted and taken
              root in our secular, scientific and highly commercialized age. For better and
              for worse, it’s Buddhism, American-style.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>My personal opinion is that it is again a semantic issue. Americans who embrace Buddhism tend to be people who have rejected Abrahamic religion. So they prefer to label their new belief as non-religious. In my opinion, religion can be non-theistic which is fine with most non-theistic religious people like Buddhists and Jainists.</p></div>
