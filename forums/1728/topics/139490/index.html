            <div class='col-md body'><br>from   http://festivals.iloveindia.com/ullambana/<br><br>Ullambana festival is the most popular festival in China and Japan. On this day it is believed that the "Gates of the Hell" are opened and the dead ones pay visit to their loved ones. During this festival offerings are made to the spirits of the dead and to the hungry ghosts in order to bring good fortune and luck. It is celebrated on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month.<br><br>Origin, Significance and Legends<br><br>Ullambana is the festival of deliverance, and advocates and reinforces the concept of filial piety. The word ullambana translates into "deliverance from suffering", and specifically refers to the salvation that is granted to tormented souls in hell.<br><br>According to Buddhist legend, the observance of this festival is based on the story of Maudgalyayana (Moginlin or Mogganalla, as per Oriental legends) and his mother.<br><br>Maudgalyayana discovers through his meditative powers that his mother has been reborn in the realms of pain and suffering. When he learns that her spirit is being subjected to hunger and misery, he decides to go to the netherworld to relieve her of her suffering.<br><br>Once he goes there, Maudgalyayana finds his mother starving and in a pitiful state. He offers her food, but when she tries to eat it, the food turns to smouldering pieces of charcoal.<br><br>Maudgalyayana is distressed and seeks advice and help from his master, the Buddha. Buddha tells him that his mother's offences are deep-rooted and that he alone will not be able to ease her sufferings. He advises Maudgalyayana to make offerings of five fruits, incense, oil, lamps, candles, beds and bedding to the assembled members of the Order and pray along with them for the liberation of his mother's soul.<br><br>The Buddha also tells Maudgalyayana that by making such an offering, not only his mother but his forefathers and kith and kin will also escape suffering and attain eternal bliss and salvation.<br><br>The day on which Maudgalyayana performed the act of compassionate filial conduct and brought salvation to his forefathers is celebrated as Ullambana. It is observed on the 15th day of the seventh Buddhist lunar month, and occurs in August in the Augustan calendar.<br><br>On this day, Buddhists offer prayers both to their departed forefathers and to their living parents and elders.<br><br>It is generally believed that one who performs a good deed accumulates spiritual merit. It is considered an even more pious act when the merit earned is shared with departed souls, which will help them to be reborn in good realms and alleviate their suffering.<br><br>Ullambana is celebrated by Buddhists the world over. Though there are slight variations in certain customs and beliefs, the fundamental rituals remain essentially the same. Besides offering prayers to the souls of deceased ancestors and welfare of their parents, people carry offerings such as food, medicine and clothes for monks and nuns in monasteries.<br><br>In China and Taiwan, Ullambana has absorbed the traditional Ghost Festival, which has the similar goal of praying for the welfare of departed souls. The two festivals are together celebrated as Chung Yuan Putu, translated as "Mid-origin Passage to Universal Salvation". On this day, an offering of meat, together with a prodigious table of wine is made to one's ancestors and ghosts from the netherworld.<br><br>In Singapore, the festival is known as Ching Ming Jie.<br><br>The date of Ullambana depends on the calendar that is followed, and varies slightly in different parts of the world.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from : http://www.geocities.com/cobinri/stories.html<br><br>The 15th of the 7th Lunar Month is "THE SEASON OF FILIAL PIETY".<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>WHY DO PEOPLE CELEBRATE<br><br>'GHOSTS SEASON'<br><br>ON BEHALF OF<br><br>THE GHOSTS?<br><br>Throughout thousands of years, most people are born deluded and superstitious.<br><br>The ghosts belong to the beings in one of the three evil paths. Their suffering is indeed acute. There is no special celebration in the Ghost Realm.<br><br>On the contrary, every 7th Lunar Month, the worldly people will arrange special programmes and celebrate 'Ghosts Season' on behalf of the ghosts!<br><br>In fact, the 15th of the 7th Lunar Month is meant for all filial children to practice filial piety towards their present parents, parents of the past and future. So, we should not celebrate 'Ghosts Season'. Instead we should celebrate 'The Season of Filial Piety'!<br><br>THE BUDDHA SPEAKS ON THE ULLAMBANA SUTRA<br><br>THE 7TH LUNAR MONTH IS NOT THE GHOST SEASON<br><br>'In India, the rainy season lasts for three months yearly. It begins on the 15th of the 4th Lunar Month and ends on the 15th of the 7th Lunar Month. So it is very inconvenient for the Sangha to beg for food during that season.'<br><br>'It was then decided that all monks must cultivate diligently during these three months while staying indoors.'<br><br>'After cultivating for three months, many of the sagely assembly attain the Way. The Buddhas in the ten directions rejoice over their attainment.'<br><br>'And also on that day, the sagely assembly come together to discuss their individual progress. All merits and demerits are to be announced to the multitude. So it is also known as the "Sangha Pravarana Day.'<br><br>'At the same time, The Venerable Maugalyayana's mother was experiencing suffering in the Hungry Ghost Realm as she had committed heavy karmic offences of being stingy and greedy. She could not be saved by depending on the spiritual strength of her son alone neither could she be saved with the strength of all earth and heavenly spirits. She could only be saved with the combined strength of the sagely Sanghans in the ten directions who had attained the Way.<br><br>'So The Buddha instructed The Venerable Maugalyayana to widely make Ullambana offering to the Sagely Sanghans on the 15th of the 7th Lunar Month or "The Buddha's Happy Day". By doing so, the present and former parents would receive the blessings and put to extinction all offences. It is also known as "The Day Of Filiality To Parent".'<br><br>'For many thousands of years, the worldly people have mistaken "The Day Of Filiality" as the "Ghost Season". They talk confusedly about the opening and closing of the ghostly door. From here we can see how deep the superstitious practice of the Chinese can be!'<br><br>'At that time, if The Buddha were to teach The Venerable Maugalyayana to make the 'Ullambana Offering' on the 15th of the 6th Lunar Month (or any other days) in order to save his mother then the present people would have treated the 6th Lunar Month as the 'Ghost Season', wouldn't they?'<br><br>'The ghosts are always there. Who says that they only appear on the 7th Lunar Month, the "Ghost Season"?'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>THE BUDDHA SPEAKS THE ULLAMBANA SUTRA<br><br>THUS I HAVE HEARD, AT ONE TIME, THE BUDDHA DWELT AT SHRAVASTI IN THE GARDEN OF THE BENEFACTOR OF ORPHANS AND THE SOLITARY<br><br>MAHAMAUDGALYAYANA HAD JUST OBTAINED THE SIX PENETRATIONS AND WISHED TO CROSS OVER HIS FATHER AND MOTHER TO REPAY THEIR KINDNESS FOR RAISING HIM.<br><br>THUS, USING HIS WAY EYE, HE REGARDED THE WORLD AND SAW THAT HIS DECEASED MOTHER HAD BEEN BORN AMONG THE HUNGRY GHOSTS, HAVING NEITHER FOOD NOR DRINK, SHE WAS BUT SKIN AND BONES.<br><br>MAHAMAUGALYAYANA FELT DEEP PITY AND SADNESS, FILLED A BOWL WITH FOOD AND WENT TO PROVIDE FOR HIS MOTHER. SHE GOT THE BOWL, SCREENED IT WITH HER LEFT HAND, AND WITH HER RIGHT HAND MADE A FIST OF FOOD. BUT, BEFORE IT ENTERED HER MOUTH, IT TURNED INTO BURNING COALS WHICH COULD NOT BE EATEN.<br><br>MAHAMAUGALYAYANA CALLED NOT AND WEPT SORROWFULLY, AND HASTENED TO RETURN TO THE BUDDHA TO SET FORTH ALL OF THIS<br><br>THE BUDDHA SAID, "YOUR MOTHER'S OFFENCES ARE DEEP AND FIRMLY ROOTED. YOU ALONE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH POWER. ALTHOUGH YOUR FILIAL SOUNDS MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH, THE HEAVEN SPIRITS, THE EARTH SPIRITS, TWISTED DEMONS, AND THOSE OUTSIDE THE WAY, BRAHMANS, AND THE FOUR HEAVENLY KING GODS, ARE ALSO WITHOUT SUFFICIENT STRENGTH.<br><br>THE AWESOME SPIRITUAL POWER OF THE ASSEMBLED SANGHA OF THE TEN DIRECTIONS IS NECESSARY FOR LIBERATION TO BE ATTAINED.<br><br>I SHALL NOW SPEAK A DHARMA OF RESCUE WHICH CAUSE ALL THOSE IN DIFFICULTY TO LEAVE WORRY AND SUFFERING, AND TO ERADICATE OBSTACLES FROM OFFENCES.<br><br>THE BUDDHA TOLD MAUDGALYAYANA: "THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH IS THE PRAVARANA DAY FOR THE ASSEMBLED SANGHA OF THE TEN DIRECTIONS.<br><br>FOR THE SAKE OF FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF SEVEN GENERATIONS PAST, AS WELL AS FOR FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE PRESENT WHO ARE IN DISTRESS, YOU SHOULD PREPARE AN OFFERING OF CLEAN BASINS FULL OF HUNDREDS OF FLAVORS AND THE FIVE FRUITS, AND OTHER OFFERINGS OF INCENSE, OIL, LAMPS, CANDLES,  BEDS, AND BEDDING, ALL THE BEST OF THE WORLD, TO THE GREATLY VIRTUOUS ASSEMBLED SANGHA OF THE TEN DIRECTIONS.<br><br>OH THAT DAY, ALL THE HOLD ASSEMBLY, WHETHER IN THE MOUNTAINS PRACTICING DHYANA SAMADHI, OR OBTAINING THE FOUR FRUITS OF THE WAY, OR WALKING BENEATH TREES, OR USING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE SIX PENETRATIONS, TO TEACH AND TRANSFORM SOUND HEARERS AND THOSE ENLIGHTENED TO CONDITIONS.

TRANSFORMATIONALLY BORN, THEY WILL INDEPENDENTLY ENTER THE CELESTIAL FLOWER LIGHT, AND EXPERIENCE LIMITLESS BLISS.<br><br>AT THAT TIME THE BUDDHA COMMANDED THE ASSEMBLED SANGHA OF THE TEN DIRECTIONS TO RECITE MANTRAS AND VOWS FOR THE SAKE OF THE DONOR'S FAMILY, FOR PARENTS OF SEVEN GENERATIONS.<br><br>AFTER PRACTICING DHYANA CONCENTRATION, THEY THEN MAY ACCEPT THE FOOD. WHEN FIRST RECEIVING THE BASIN, PLACE IT BEFORE THE BUDDHA IN THE STUPA. WHEN THE ASSEMBLED SANGHA HAS FINISHED THE MANTRAS AND VOWS, THEN THEY MAY ACCEPT IT.<br><br>AT THAT TIME THE BHIKSHU MAUDGAL YAYANA AND THE ASSEMBLY OF GREAT BODHISATTVAS WERE ALL EXTREMELY DELIGHTED AND THE SORROWFUL SOUND OF MAUDGALYAYANA'S CRYING CEASED. AT THAT TIME MAUDGALYAYANA'S MOTHER OBTAINED LIBERATION FROM ONE KALPA OF SUFFERING AS A HUNGRY GHOST.<br><br>MAUDGALYAYANA ADDRESSED THE BUDDHA AND SAID, "THIS DISCIPLE'S PARENTS HAVE RECEIVED THE POWER OF THE MERIT AND VIRTUE OF THE TRIPLE JEWEL, BECAUSE OF THE AWESOME SPIRITUAL POWER OF THE ASSEMBLES SANGHA.<br><br>IF IN THE FUTURE THE BUDDHA'S DISCIPLES PRACTICE FILIALITY BY OFFERING UP THE ULLAMBANA BASINS, WILL THEY BE ABLE TO CROSS OVER THEIR PRESENT FATHERS AND MOTHERS AS WELL AS THOSE OF SEVEN GENARATIONS PAST?"<br><br>THE BUDDHA REPLIED: "GOOD INDEED, I AM HAPPY YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION. I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT AND NOW YOU HAVE ALSO ASKED ABOUT IT.<br><br>GOOD MAN, IF BHIKSHUS, BHIKSHUNIS, KINGS, CROWN PRINCES, GREAT MINISTERS, GREAT OFFICALS, CABINET MEMBERS, THE HUNDREDS OF OFFICERS, AND THE TEN OF THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS WISH TO PRACTICE COMPASSIONATE FILIAL CONDUCT, FOR THE SAKE OF THE PARENTS WHO BORN THEM, AS WELL AS FOR THE SAKE OF FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF SEVEN LIVES PAST, ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH, THE DAY OF THE BUDDHAS' DELIGHT, THE DAY OF THE SANGHA'S PRAVARANA, THEY ALL SHOULD PLACE HUNDREDS OF FLAVORS OF FOODS IN THE ULLLAMBANA BASINS, AND OFFER THEM TO THE PRAVARANA SANGHA OF THE TEN DIRECTIONS. THEY SHOULD VOW TO CAUSE THE LENGTH OF LIFE OF THE PRESENT FATHER AND MOTHER TO REACH A HUNDRED YEARS WITHOUT ILLNESS, WITHOUT SUFFERINGS, AFFLICTIONS, OR WORRIES, AND ALSO VOW TO CAUSE SEVEN GENERATIONS OF FATHERS AND MOTHERS TO LEAVE THE SUFFERINGS OF THE HUNGRY GHOSTS, TO BE BORN AMONG MEN AND GODS, AND TOT HAVE BLESSINGS AND BLISS WITHOUT LIMIT."<br><br>THE BUDDHA TOLD ALL THE GOOD MEN AND GOOD WOMEN, "THOSE DISCIPLES OF THE BUDDHA WHO CULTIVATE FILIAL CONDUCT SHOULD IN THOUGHT AFTER THOUGHT, CONSTANTLY RECALL THEIR PRESENT FATHERS AND MOTHERS WHEN MAKING OFFERINGS, AS WELL AS THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF SEVEN LIVES PAST.<br><br>EVERY YEAR, ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH, THEY SHOULD ALWAYS, OUT OF FILIAL COMPASSION, RECALL THEIR PARENTS WHO BORN THEM AND THOSE OF SEVEN LIVES PAST, AND FOR THEIR SAKES PERFORM THE OFFERING OF THE ULLAMBANA BASIN TO THE BUDDHA AND THE SANGHA AND THUS REPAY THE LOVING KINDNESS OF THE PARENTS WHO RAISED AND NOURISHED THEM.<br><br>ALL BUDDHAS' DISCIPLES SHOULD RESPECTFULLY RECEIVE THIS DHARMA."<br><br>AT THAT TIME THE BHIKSHU MAUDGALYAYANA AND THE FOUR-FOLD ASSEMBLY OF DISCIPLES, HEARING WHAT THE BUDDHA SAID, PRACTICED IT WITH DELIGHT.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>THE BUDDHA SPEAKS ON THE ULLAMBANA SUTRA<br><br>Edited By: SOON GUO SEN<br><br>Translated By: ZHANG LENG<br><br>'At one time, The Buddha was giving Dharma talks at the Jeta Grove in the Garden of Anathapindika in Shravasti. The Venerable Maugalyayana was one of the ten Great Disciples who had just attained the six spiritual penetrations. He remembered his parents who had passed away for some time and wanted to see their whereabouts.'<br><br>'In order to repay the kind virtues of his mother who had given birth to him and brought him up, he used the Heavenly Eyes which he had cultivated to pervasively contemplate The Saha World Realm and found that his kind mother was suffering in the Hungry Ghost Realm. She was so thin that her skin hung loosely on her bones. It was really pitiful!'<br><br>'After seeing that, The Venerable Maugalyayana was very sorrowful. He filled his alms bowl with food and went to relieve her suffering.'<br><br>'When his mother saw the food, she covered it with her left hand as she was afraid other ghosts might come to snatch away the food.'<br><br>'Habitually she used her right hand to take the food and put it into her mouth. But before she had the chance to eat the food, it had already transformed into burning charcoal.'<br><br>'Then flames burst out from her mouth and she was burnt to death!'<br><br>When The Venerable Maugalyayana witnessed this, he cried sorrowfully. He who had certified to fruition position through cultivation was still incapable of saving his mother from the hellish suffering in the Hungry Ghost Realm.'<br><br>'Under such circumstances, he as a son was indeed helpless and sad. So he went to seek The Buddha's help.'<br><br>'The Venerable told The Buddha about his mother's suffering and asked for advice.<br><br>'After listening, The Buddha said, "The former karmic offences of your mother were too heavy. It is impossible to save her with your strength alone".<br><br>'You are a filial son, and your cry may vibrate the Heaven and Earth, your filial piety may move the heavenly spirits, earth spirits, the practicers of deviant paths ......."<br><br>'"....... All the Way Cultivators and the Four Heavenly Kings, but they are still unable to save your mother!"'<br><br>'The Venerable was indeed sad and his tears rolled down unceasingly. The Buddha said, "Now I will tell you the only way to save your mother from suffering".'<br><br>'"You should prepare the best offering of daily necessities and offer them to the Great Virtuous Sangha assembly in the ten directions on the 15th day of the 7th Lunar Month, that is 'The Buddha's Happy Day', at the end of the Rains Retreat".'<br><br>'"At that time, all the sagely assemblies, the sound Hearers, the Conditioned Awakened Ones, the Tenth Ground Bodhisattvas and others, wherever they may be cultivating or dwelling will transform into Bhikshus to receive your suffering."'<br><br>'"The merits and virtues of this offering are very great. Not only the parents and relatives of many past lives will be liberated immediately from the three evil paths .......".'<br><br>'"Even our present parents who are still alive will be healthy and gain longevity. Our parents in the past seven lives will be at ease and be born from transformation in the Heaven and enter the light of heavenly flowers quickly.'<br><br>'So The Venerable Maugalyayana acted in accordance with The Buddha's Instructions. The Buddha also asked the multitude of Sanghans from the ten directions to recite the Mantras and seek blessings on behalf of the donors .........'<br><br>'......... Wishing that their parents of seven lifetimes would contemplate cultivation and bring forth the mind to practise meditation, before accepting the offering of food.'<br><br>'The offering must be arranged before The Buddha, in the temple or pagoda. Only after the Sanghans have recited the mantras and transferred the merits can the food be eaten.'<br><br>'At that time, the multitude of sagely Bhikshus and great Bodhisattvas were filled with joy.'<br><br>'The Venerable Maugalyayana's mother also left the suffering of Hungry Ghost in this kalpa. So all his sorrows and worries were gone too.'<br><br>'The Venerable Maugalyayana again said to The Buddha, "My mother had left behind the suffering of a Hungry Ghost all because of the merits and virtues of The Triple Jewel and the great awesome spiritual strength of the Sanghan assembly ........"'<br><br>'"........ In future, if there are The Buddha's disciples who wish to cross over their present parents, parents of seven former existences, can they use the same method of making offering to the Sangha assembly in the Ullambana Dharma ceremony?"'<br><br>'"It is good of you to ask such a question! In fact, I have in mind to tell you all about such a good practice!"'<br><br>'The Buddha said, "Good men! If there are Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Kings and commoners who wish to fulfill filial piety, they should make offering to the Sangha on the 15th Day of the 7th Lunar Month (The Buddha's Happy Day) at the end of the Rains Retreat ........"<br><br>'"They must prepare all kinds of tasty food and delicacies and put them in the Ullambana Bowl to make offering to the multitude of Sangha who are cultivating in the ten directions, and transfer the merits to the present parents so that they will gain longevity, be free from worries, illnesses and disaster.<br><br>'"........ And may their former parents in the seven lifetimes be relieved from the suffering in the Hungry Ghost Realm, be born among the humans and heavenly beings to enjoy pervasive blessings and bliss. All Buddha's disciples who wish to practise filiality should always keep this in mind".'<br><br>'"All filial children must repay the parental kindness and compassion and the sufferings they have gone through by making offerings to the multitude of Sangha in the Ullambana Ceremony on the 15th of the 7th Lunar Month. This is the best practice for all filial children".'<br><br>'At that time, The Venerable Maugalyayana Bhikshu and the four-fold disciples rejoiced over The Buddha's teaching. They upheld and practised it sincerely.<br><br>VERSE OF TRANSFERENCE<br><br>May the merit and virtue accrued from this work,<br><br>Adorn the Buddhas' Pure Lands,<br><br>Repaying four kinds of kindness above,<br><br>And aiding those suffering in the paths below.<br><br>May those who see and hear of this,<br><br>All bring forth the resolve for Bodhi,<br><br>And when this retribution body is over,<br><br>Be born together in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.<br><br>*TRANSFERENCE*<br><br>TEN BENEFITS FROM PRINTING BUDDHIST SUTRAS AND MAKING BUDDHA-IMAGES<br><br>1.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Yes indeed. I think in the past I used to share one of the articles of the same things and I would like to emphasize in bolded text -<br><br><blockquote>Volume 5 no 1<br><br>Feature<br><br><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/vol5img1.jpg"><br><br>Ullambana Dharma - not Festival of Hungry Ghosts<br>By Venerable Shen-Kai<br><br>According to a popular Chinese superstition, ghosts are released from hell in the 7th month of the Chinese calendar for a one-month break in the human world. In order to appease them, animals are slaughtered and offered to these 'hungry ghosts', together with other food. Big feasts and other festivities are held during this month and the most 'auspicious day' is the 15th day of the month. It is so widespread that this yearly affair is dubbed the Month or Festival of the Hungry Ghosts. What is this all about?<br><br>Among the chief disciples of the Buddha was one named Maudgalyayana. He had immense supernatural powers: Deva-foot ubiquity which made it possible for him to appear at any place at will, the divine sight of Deva-eye to have unlimited vision of all things, large and small, near and distant; Deva-ear to hear all sounds regardless of the distance. Furthermore, he had the ability to read and understand whatever was in a person's mind. He also had the ability to see clearly the events that occurred in a person's many past lives aeons ago. Thus, Maudgalyayana is considered to be a Maha-Bodhisattva who is foremost in supernatural powers.<br><br>One day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. Her throat was as small as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha and insulted the Sangha [1], had no respect for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, Maudgalyayana wept in pain.<br>Notes<br>1. 	Sangha<br>The corporate assembly of at least 3 monks; in general the term has come to mean a monk, or monks.<br>2. 	Bodhi<br>From budh; knowledge, understanding; perfect wisdom; the illuminated or enlightened mind.<br><br>The Buddha continued to console him, "It is impossible to rely solely on your own effort to save your mother from the realm of the hungry ghost. The only way is to use the combined merits of the Sangha. The 15th day of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because of the purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised cultivation, many attain the Bodhi [2]. The merits that they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha is most delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this time, you can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the suffering of the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) through their immense merits. If the parents are still living, then they shall be blessed with good health, happiness and a life of abundance. This is the truly marvellous method of giving salvation to the deceased." Maudgalyayana was delighted to hear this, and carried out the Buddha's advice accordingly. Thus, on the 15th of the 7th month after the offering to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the suffering of the realm of the hungry ghost.<br><br><strong>To give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 'Ullambana' method. After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express our gratitude and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, the passage of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, so much so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to the Dharma. Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The original act of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for feasting and making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to invite the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.<br><br>When we refrain from killing and protect all lives, we actually accumulate the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to kill other living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to all forms of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the tradition of offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be changed, the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of meat with vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are not able to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we could invite them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the deceased. In this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.</strong><br><br>Notes<br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'>talking about offering. i do read in pali canon before of how sariputta help a peta. he was walking for alms one day and saw a peta, he peta approached him for help. sariputta teaches her dhamma and the peta rejoices in the words of dhamma.<br><br>sariputta somehow he got a material for robes and he offer it to the sangha. and he say he wish to transfer the merit to that particular peta.<br><br>immediately a beautiful deva appears knee down and thanks him. saying she was that ugly peta before. and she taken refuge under the triple gem.<br><br>don't ask me which part of the canon is it. i forgotten. and i have cut short the story a lot and bound to have errors. but that roughly the story.<br><br>so seriously the best way to help your so call "relative" who are sadly still "around". make offer to the triple gems. E.g. giving almsfood, giving robes, provide basic daily necessities for the monks for their practice. then with a sincere mind transfer the merit to them.<br><br>end of it says sadhu sadhu sadhu.(there is a reason for it, sorry not too sure about it so i do not wish to mention it)<br><br>however...just a side note. the merit might not be transfer IF the particular peta does not know about it, IF the peta reject the offers. however regardless of the case the one doing the offering will have merit.<br><br>that about all that i know regarding petas aiding them according to the canon.</div>
