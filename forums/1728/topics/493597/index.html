              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><em style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Contrary to popular belief, you can’t be
              in the present moment.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">However,
              you are always here now. It is only a matter of whether you know it or not. The
              Now is often confused with our understanding of the present time or the present
              moment. In Tibetan Buddhism, the Now is considered the “timeless time” that
              includes the three relative times of past, present, and future. We know not to
              get caught in the past or the future, but in order to be in the Now, we also
              have to let go of the present. The Now is not confined by relative clock time,
              yet it is also not pure timelessness. The Now is the meeting place of timeless
              spacious awareness with the relative world and its conventional time. The Now
              does not come and go, but includes everything all at once. When we’re aware of
              being in the Now, present moments come and go, like ripples and waves in the
              ocean of awake awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              we don’t know the alternative to the three relative times, we create an
              imitation of the Now and call it “the moment” or “the present.” Here’s how
              Merriam-Webster defines moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">a:
              a minute portion or point of time: INSTANT</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">b:
              a comparatively brief period of time</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Clearly,
              we can’t live in the moment, because moments come and go like the tick-tock of
              a clock. Moment . . . gone . . . new moment . . . gone . . . new moment . . .
              gone. You can’t stop moments or be quick enough to occupy any particular moment
              of time. Physicist Max Planck recognized that moments are flashes in relative
              time. He divided moments into small measures known as Planck units, which are
              10â�»â�´³ seconds long. No matter how hard we try, we can never slice time thin
              enough to enter the moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Our
              perceived experience is made up of mind moments that appear continuous, like
              movies. Films project 24 still frames every second in order to make the
              movement of their images appear lifelike to the brain. A moment is like a
              single frame that we can look at but cannot remain in. Even if we took one
              still frame from a movie, we would see a frozen moment, not the dynamic living
              Now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Trying
              to be in the Now by entering the present moment is also like sitting at the
              edge of a river, looking at the water flowing over one rock. As soon as you
              focus on one moment in the flow of water, that portion of water has already
              moved downstream. We cannot enter present moments because they move too fast
              and change continuously. Contemporary Tibetan Buddhist teacher Mingyur Rinpoche
              says, “If you examine even the present moment carefully, you find that it also
              is made up of earlier and later moments. In the end, if you keep examining the
              present moment, you find that there is no present moment that exists either.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Interestingly,
              mindfulness meditation begins with the opposite approach to trying to be in the
              moment; it asks us to actually notice moment-to-moment change. One of the great
              insights we can get from mindfulness meditation practice is that each moment of
              experience arises and passes. Having a direct experience of this impermanence,
              from observing awareness, helps us let go of the attempt to calcify any single
              moment of time, to try to make something stable that is not. When we really get
              a feeling for the coming and going of moments, it helps us break the illusion
              of a solid, separate self, which gives us relief from suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              present time is not the Now. When Gampopa, an 11th-century Buddhist teacher,
              said, “Don’t invite the future. Don’t pursue the past. Let go of the present.
              Relax right now,” he was pointing to the fact that trying to locate yourself in
              any of the three relative times, including the present, can cause suffering.
              It’s not always a benefit to strive to be in the present. While working as a
              psychotherapist, I saw that the distinguishing feature of clinical depression
              is feeling stuck in the present. As one client said, “It feels like there is
              only this present, unbearable pain and no hope of it changing.” Being depressed
              is like being in a prison where you’re cut off from positive memories of the
              past and from the potential to change in the future. Part of the treatment for
              depression is to have people remember how they got through sad periods in the
              past and realize there’s a positive future. In terms of the present, it’s
              helpful to realize “This too shall pass.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              is true that our attention can be negatively obsessed with remembering the
              past. However, most of us would agree on an everyday level with poet and
              philosopher George Santayana, who said, “Those who cannot remember the past are
              condemned to repeat it.” Yet we can also be preoccupied with fearing the
              future. The ability to imagine the future has helped all of us survive and
              thrive, for instance by being able to prepare for the coming winter or spring.
              You can plan for the future and recall the past while being in the Now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              most important thing to know is that we are always already in the Now—however,
              we are not always aware of being in the Now. You can only know the Now from
              awake awareness. Many of us have experienced being in the Now when we were “in
              the zone” or in a panoramic flow state.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              we learn to shift into directly being aware of being in the Now, our whole
              sense of reality changes for the better. We can’t be aware of being in the Now
              from our everyday, ego-identified state of mind. We can shift through the door
              of the Now into awake awareness, or when abiding in awake awareness, we can
              begin to notice the feeling of being in the Now. The purpose of clarifying and
              distinguishing the Now from the present and present moment is for us to be able
              to shift into being in the Now and know we are here.</span></p>
