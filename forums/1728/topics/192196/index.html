It feels now as if I am talking about some past lifetime or somebody else's life.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Awakening</strong></span><br>One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday, I woke up in the early hours with a feeling of absolute dread. I had woken up with such a feeling many times before, but this time it was more intense than it had ever been. The silence of the night, the vague outlines of the furniture in the dark room, the distant noise of a passing train Â– everything felt so alien, so hostile, and so utterly meaningless that it created in me a deep loathing of the world. The most loathsome thing of all, however, was my own existence. What was the point in continuing to live with this burden of misery? Why carry on with this continuous struggle? I could feel that a deep longing for annihilation, for nonexistence, was now becoming much stronger than the instinctive desire to continue to live.<br><br>Â‘I cannot live with myself any longer.Â’ This was the thought that kept repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought it was.. Â‘Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the Â‘IÂ’ and the Â‘selfÂ’ that Â‘IÂ’ cannot live with.Â’ Â‘Maybe,Â’ I thought, Â‘only one of them is real.Â’<br><br>I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I was fully conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what seemed like a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at first and then accelerated. I was gripped by an intense fear, and my body started to shake. I heard the words Â‘resist nothing,Â’ as if spoken inside my chest. I could feel myself being sucked into a void. It felt as if the void was inside myself rather than outside. Suddenly, there was no more fear, and I let myself fall into that void. I have no recollection of what happened after that.<br><br>I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I had never heard such a sound before. My eyes were still closed, and I saw the image of a precious diamond. Yes, if a diamond could make a sound, this is what it would be like. I opened my eyes. The first light of dawn was filtering through the curtains. Without any thought, I felt, I knew, that there is infinitely more to light than we realize. That soft luminosity filtering through the curtains was love itself. Tears came into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room. I recognized the room, and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it before. Everything was fresh and pristine, as if it had just come into existence. I picked up things, a pencil, an empty bottle, marvelling at the beauty and aliveness of it all. That day I walked around the city in utter amazement at the miracle of life on earth, as if I had just been born into this world.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Bliss</strong></span><br>For the next five months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted deep peace and bliss. After that, it diminished somewhat in intensity, or perhaps it just seemed to because it became my natural state. I could still function in the world, although I realized that nothing I ever did could possibly add anything to what I already had.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Understanding</strong></span><br>I knew, of course, that something profoundly significant had happened to me, but I didn't understand it at all. It wasn't until several years later, after I had read spiritual texts and spent time with spiritual teachers, that I realized that what everybody was looking for had already happened to me. I understood that the intense pressure of suffering that night must have forced my consciousness to withdraw from its identification with the unhappy and deeply fearful self, which is ultimately a fiction of the mind. This withdrawal must have been so complete that this false, suffering self immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled out of an inflatable toy. What was left then was my true nature as the ever-present I am: consciousness in its pure state prior to identification with form. Later I also learned to go into that inner timeless and deathless realm that I had originally perceived as a void and remain fully conscious. I dwelt in states of such indescribable bliss and sacredness that even the original experience I just described pales in comparison. A time came when, for a while, I was left with nothing on the physical plane. I had no relationships, no job, no home, no socially defined identity. I spent almost two years sitting on park benches in a state of the most intense joy.<br><br>But even the most beautiful experiences come and go. More fundamental, perhaps, than any experience is the undercurrent of peace that has never left me since then. Sometimes it is very strong, almost palpable, and others can feel it too. At other times, it is somewhere in the background, like a distant melody.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Sharing</strong></span><br>Later, people would occasionally come up to me and say: Â‘I want what you have. Can you give it to me, or show me how to get it?Â’ And I would say: Â‘You have it already. You just canÂ’t feel it because your mind is making too much noise.Â’ That answer later grew into my book, Â‘The Power of NowÂ’.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">From The Power of Now, copyright 1999 by Eckhart Tolle, published in the UK in 2001 by Hodder and Stoughton.</span>[/b]<br><br>Photographs Â© Cygnus Books 21-Feb-2001[/b]</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.eckharttolle.com/home.php?section=about&amp;show=ABOUT%20-%20Eckhart%20Tolle" rel="nofollow">http://www.eckharttolle.com/home.php?section=about&amp;show=ABOUT%20-%20Eckhart%20Tolle</a><br><br><img src="http://www.eckharttolle.com/images/about_eckhart_tolle.jpg"><br><br>Eckhart Tolle is emerging as one of the most original and inspiring spiritual teachers of our time. He travels and teaches throughout the world.<br><br>Eckhart is not aligned with any particular religion or tradition, but excludes none. His profound yet simple and practical teachings have helped thousands of people find inner peace and greater fulfillment in their lives. At the core of his teachings lies the transformation of individual and collective human consciousness - a global spiritual awakening.<br><br>Eckhart was born in Germany and educated at the Universities of London and Cambridge. At the age of twenty-nine, a profound spiritual transformation virtually dissolved his old identity and radically changed the course of his life. The next few years were devoted to understanding, integrating and deepening that transformation and marked the beginning of an intense inward journey. Later, he began to work with individuals and small groups as a counselor and spiritual teacher.<br><br>Eckhart Tolle is the author of The Power of Now, a #1 New York Times best-seller which has been widely recognized as one of the most influential spiritual books of our time. It has been translated into over 30 languages.</blockquote>[/url]</div>

The same goes for so-called mystism, it simply borrows terms and ideas and transform it to their own religious ideas. It is like a copycat.<br><br><blockquote>Through some of those men and women, Â“schoolsÂ” or movements developed within all major religions that represented not only a rediscovery, but in some cases an intensification of the light of the original teaching. This is how Gnosticism and mysticism came into existence in early and medieval Christianity, Sufism in the Islamic religion, Hasidism and Kabala in Judaism, Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism, Zen and Dzogchen in Buddhism. Most of these schools were iconoclastic. They did away with layers upon layers of deadening conceptualisation and mental belief structures, and for this reason most of them were viewed with suspicion and often hostility by the established religious hierarchies</blockquote>He talks about religion. He express support for religious thoughts in forms of gnostism, etc. He has his stance about certain religion, and disapprove of many religious thoughts and schools.<br><br>He is religious, as far as this book is concern.<br><br>It is like a Chinese, refusing to admit he is one.</div>

But beliefs arent really needed anymore, when you see it for yourself and leaves no doubt. Just like everyday I tell you 'there is a dinosaur in the park', and you come to believe in me. But one day, you see it yourself, then it isn't a matter of faith and belief anymore. You have seen it.<br><br>---<br><br>And what you said about gnosticism that part, I don't see any links with mysticism. I think even gnosticism has its own dogmas, I may be wrong, or perhaps there is an underlying deeper essence to what it meant.
