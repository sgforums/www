              <p>(Image: The AvalokiteÅ›vara Bodhisattva)<br> <br> About 400 years after the passing away of Shakyamuni Buddha, i.e. around
                       1 century BCE, the school of Mahayana Buddhism developed with a 
                      different emphasis and focus of practice as compared to the 
                      practitioners of Early Buddhism (Also see: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2014/05/early-buddhisms-model-of-enlightenment.html">Early Buddhism's Model of Awakening</a>).
                       Examples of forms of Mahayana Buddhism practiced today include Zen, 
                      Pure Land, Tantric/Vajrayana (including Tibetan, Japanese Shingon), 
                      Tendai, and a number of others schools that no longer exist today or are
                       absorbed into Zen (e.g. Huayan). Today, the number adherents of the 
                      Mahayana forms of Buddhism in the world have exceeded the number of 
                      adherents of the Theravada/Early form of Buddhism due to the extent in 
                      which Mahayana forms of Buddhism have spread into China, Japan and 
                      Tibet.<br> <br> The practitioners of Early Buddhism (of which Theravada is modeled 
                      after), or what Loppon Malcolm calls "Mainstream Buddhism" (because it 
                      was a much more commonly practiced form of Buddhism in the past in 
                      India), aimed to attain their own liberation or Nirvana by removing the 
                      afflictions (passion, aggression and delusion) that causes rebirth. 
                      Thousands of Buddha's students attained that goal called Arahantship. <br> <br> However, Mahayana Buddhism has a higher aim. Not only do they want to 
                      remove the causes for samsaric birth, they also want to remove all 
                      knowledge obscurations preventing the attainment of omniscience and 
                      Buddhahood, for the sake of liberating all sentient beings. Mahayana 
                      Buddhists feel that the scope of attaining liberation for oneself is too
                       limited, so out of great compassion and for the benefit of all sentient
                       beings, they want to attain the same Buddhahood as Shakyamuni. The 
                      practitioner walking the path to Buddhahood is called a Bodhisattva.<br> <br> This post attempts to share the model of awakening in classical Mahayana
                       Buddhism. There are 10 stages of an awakened Bodhisattva, beginning 
                      with the direct realization of twofold emptiness. (The Tibetan/Vajrayana
                       traditions may also add a few more stages, making it 13 or 16)<br> <br> From a writing I wrote:<br> <br> ...<span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>The
                       reason I said Bernie is a 'real bodhisattva' is not because of 
                      impressive sounding words he spoke but rather that he clearly actualizes
                       and expresses his wisdom in compassionate activities. He is 
                      tremendously involved in compassionate and selfless activities empty of 
                      self and in total exertion. He is able to apply his wisdom of anatta and
                       D.O. to dissolve I/mine making in the practice of paramitas in his 
                      encounters with sentient beings, which as Thusness said is the 'great 
                      anatta' (Thusness two weeks ago: "...anatta in the 6 paramitas...it is 
                      great actualization of anatta."). For most of us, although we may have 
                      this and that Bodhisattva vows or believe ourselves to be practicing the
                       Bodhisattva way, it is as Thusness said, "In my opinion many of our 
                      great aspirations and high views turn empty talks easily...." - </span><a dir="ltr" rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2014/05/the-path-of-anatta.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/.../the-path-of...</a><span> - or like my Mahayana teacher said, even the greatest vow becomes merely a discursive/fanciful thought when not actualized....</span></span></span><br> ...<span>The practice and engagement of the 10 paramitas (or 6)
                       in the
                      daily life becomes of utmost importance in Mahayana Buddhism, allowing 
                      the twofold
                      cultivation of merits and wisdom so necessary for the attainment of
                      full Buddhahood. It is in fact in the very mundane activities of
                      daily life and interactions that allows us the opportunity to
                      attain the ten perfections (paramitas) that allows us to attain
                      full Buddhahood. The paramitas are not just 'mundane qualities',
                      but the actualization of awakened wisdom - for example, the
                      perfection of generosity is not just the ability to give lots of
                      money to other people, but rather, the selfless giving freed from
                      any confusion of a giver-giving-gift. The wisdom of the emptiness
                      of self and phenomena allows our act of generosity to be perfected.
                      When our giving transcends giver-giving-gift, without attachments
                      we relinquish and give and sacrifice for other beings out of
                      genuine compassion, that is true generosity. The cultivation of the
                      ten paramitas in conjunction of the wisdom of emptiness is itself a
                      method for the liberation of our mental afflictions, clinging, I and 
                      mine-making, as well as the cultivation of immense merits required for 
                      Buddhahood.<br><br> </span><span>It is said that at each of the ten bhumi stages, one
                      of the perfections have been perfected. For example, the first
                      bhumi perfects the perfection of generosity, second bhumi the
                      perfection of precepts, so on and so forth.<br> In short, in the Mahayana path, as Huayan
                      Patriarch Cheng'guan explained ( <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/httpssites.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/.../httpssites...</a> ), the essential wisdom that allows for the twofold
                      liberation of afflictive obscurations and knowledge obscurations is
                      the wisdom of twofold emptiness. Then there is the emphasis on cultivating the
                      paramitas.</span><br> I translated an excerpt from æ³•è¯­ç¼¤çº·ï¼ˆ2ï¼‰ by Venerable Shen Kai (my refuge
