               July 2011, Sichuan Province, Baiyu County, the founder of Yachen Gar, a
               great exponent of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection teaching, HH Lama 
              Achuk Rinpoche (HH Jamyang Lungdok Gyalsen) enters into paranirvana 
              (1927 – 2011).</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">30 July 2011, Yachen Gar formally announced to the news of HH Lama Achuk <a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-31.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1010" title="Paranirvana 3" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-31-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a>Rinpoche’s
               passing into paranirvana to the outside world.  Devotees from all parts
               of the world were allowed to view the body of Lama Achuk and pay their 
              final respect to a great master.  All sangha members from Yachen Gar 
              gathered to recite sutra for a period of 49 days.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-41.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1009" title="Paranirvana 4" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-41-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a>29
               August 2011, the cremation ceremony of Lama Achuk commenced.  The body 
              of Lama Achuk shrunk from a height of 1.8 meters to about 1 inch tall, a
               sign of achieving the rainbow body.  From time of Lama Achuk’s 
              paranirvana to the cremation, many auspicious signs appear, five colored
               rainbows are often sighted in the sky and the area surrounding Lama 
              Achuk’s body often appears five colored pure lights bindu.  More than 
              100,000 sangha members and lay devotees attended the puja and paid 
              respect to the sacred body of Lama Achuk, it was a spectacular sight to 
              behold.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Lama Achuk was born in 1927 in Trom, 
              Eastern Tibet as foretold by Guru Rinpoche.  Since a tender age of 24, 
              he served Tulku Arik Rinpoche for 43 years.  He learned and mastered the
               realizations of the Great Perfection-Dzogchen.  Since then, following 
              his Guru’s instructions and to benefit more sentient beings, he 
              established Yachen Gar in 1983, an encampment of thousands of <a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-5.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1011" title="Paranirvana 5" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-5-245x300.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="300"></a>monks,
               nuns and lay practitioners.  At age of 84, he entered into paranirvana 
              and achieved the rainbow body, a great inspiration to disciples to 
              persevere in their practice of the Great Perfection teachings.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">After Lama Achuk went into paranirvana, 
              every devotees who came forward to pay their respect made the following 
              aspirations, i.e. not to steal, not to consume intoxicant, not to drink 
              alcoholic drinks, not to engage in the trading of live stocks and to 
              continue to recite 108 times of Om Ahmi Dewa Hrih mantra (Amitabha 
              Mantra) and Om Ma Ni Pad Me Hung mantra (Chenrezig Mantra) daily.  Most 
              of them are lay devotees with their wavering faith in Lama Achuk made 
              these aspirations a part of their lives.  Every devotee who returns to 
              wherever they come from will carry with them this whiff of pure loving 
              kindness to wherever they go.  This whiff of pure loving kindness will 
              flow to every city, town, and country.  This is the power and strength 
              of a highly realized being.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-6.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1012" title="Paranirvana 6" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-6-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>And
               there are many monks and nuns who made aspiration in front of Lama 
              Achuk to enter into 3 years or 5 years retreats, and some even resolved 
              to do retreat forever.  They truly actualized Lama Achuk’s teachings, 
              understood the true nature of their mind and realized the equal state of
               realizations as that of Lama Achuk.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">“Whichever pureland that Guru goes, we shall be there too”. – Lama Ahchuk’s last sentences.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Lama Achuk’s final teachings to all 
              disciples is to stay united harmoniously, to keep pure precepts, and not
               to forget our meditation practice.  Whichever pureland that Lama Achuk 
              goes, we will be there too.  Lama Achuk said before that anyone who 
              complete the practice of 1,000,000 times of Amitabha Mantra will 
              definitely go to the pure land of Dewachen.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> <a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-8.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1014" title="Paranirvana 8" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-8-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a>“This
               is all like a dream, I am in the dream and have no wish to be awaken.” 
              Lama Achuk’s heart son, Yachenlama (Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche) said</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">yachenlama Rinpoche said this in a 
              class: “Since Lama Achuk Rinpoche’s paranirvana, everything is like a 
              dream, it is as if Lama Achuk has never left us, the times that we spent
               with Lama Achuk came to my mind, just like he was right here beside us.
               Everytime, after the class, I feels like wanted to talk to Lama Achuk 
              as usual. Only upon walking to his little house, staring at his sacred 
              body that it dawn on me that he has left, the Lama Achuk that appears in
               my dream just dissolved into my dream….” “It was a very painful period 
              for me, this is my attachment to Guru, but that is not just attachment, I
               recall the benevolence that Guru showed me, and from this point of 
              view, it cannot be expressed in any words or language, I can only use my
               live to repay the kindness of a Buddha.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-71.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1015" title="Paranirvana 7" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-71-300x217.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="217"></a>Although
               Rinpoche was in deep sadness, he still continuously gave blessings to 
              all devotees who came to pay respect to Lama Achuk’s sacred body, and 
              continuously gave teachings to new devotees.  Continue to propagate the 
              precious Great Perfection teachings which Lama Achuk left for us.  May 
              the Great Perfection teachings spread far and wide.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">“My dear children, you must drink 
              yogurt, joyfully play, you must be happy!” Lama Rinpoche said this to us
               during the Vajra Dance Puja, Lama laughed heartily after saying this.  
              Lama Rinpoche was always so happy.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> “I miss Lama Rinpoche, Lama Rinpoche is
               always so jovial when giving teachings. He sometimes would tell us 
              jokes.  When I called my brother also an ordained person, telling him 
              what Lama Rinpoche taught, he would say I have very good merits to be 
              able to listen to such profound teachings.  Come summer, Lama Rinpoche 
              would stay on the grassland for a month, giving teachings to us every 
              morning, and that was my happiest moment.  The saddest thing was not 
              practicing well when Lama Rinpoche was around, I did not treasure 
              then.”  The A Tibetan nun said with tears in her eyes.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-10.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1016" title="Paranirvana 10" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-10-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>This
               is only one of the many nuns, every nun are filled with sadness after 
              Lama Rinpoche passed into paranirvana, they would always cry together 
              after reciting the sutra, and never feel tired when queuing to see 
              Lama’s body, they would wake up at 3, 4 am and start queuing, the queue 
              was always very long, the queue starts from one side of the river bank 
              to the other.  Regardless of blazing sun or heavy rain, they would queue
               silently, reciting Lama Rinpoche’s name.  And in front of Lama 
              Rinpoche’s body, they would diligently complete one seating of the Guru 
              Yoga’s practice, and refused to leave even after that, chanting “Tsa Wei
               Lama Rinpoche”, “Tsa Wei Lama Rinpoche” (My Root Guru in Tibetan) until
               they were asked to leave.  After leaving the grounds of Lama Rinpoche, 
              some nun continued to do full prostration at the foyer where Lama’s 
              picture was, a few aged nuns, though their knees are weak, would pause a
               while and continue to do the full prostration, they silently pray for 
              Lama Rinpoche to return swiftly to benefit limitless sentient beings.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-9.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1017" title="Paranirvana 9" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-9-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>“Granny,
               queue tomorrow, it is already passed nine.”  A 19 years old 
              granddaughter said this to her 77 years old granny.  They travelled many
               hours in car to reach Yachen Gar, it was already 6-7 pm when they 
              arrived.  After alighting from the car, they did not rest but joined the
               queue, until passed 10 pm, they finally managed to pay respect to Lama 
              Rinpoche’s body.  The old granny moved unsteadily with a khatag in her 
              hands, presented her most precious offerings, tears filled her face.  
              This is the older Tibetan’s faith and devotion to Lama Achuk, unable to 
              express in any words and language.   Late in the night, when back to 
              their dwelling place, the granddaughter was worried that the old granny 
              would catch a cold and gently covered the old granny with blanket, and 
              prepare meal for the granny.  The old granny seldom chit chats during 
              her free time, always holding her white rosary, doing silent recitation 
              of mantras.  Before going to bed, granny was not in a comfortable 
              posture, the granddaughter thought granny wants to rest and help granny 
              took off her jacket, not knowing that granny was trying to do some 
              prostration to Lama Achuk, a difficult gesture for the old granny that 
              was filled with such deep faith and devotion.  Early morning at 4am, the
               granny continued to join the queue to see Lama Rinpoche, after that, 
              she returned to her hometown in the afternoon car.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-123.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1028" title="Paranirvana 12" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-123-234x300.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="300"></a>This
               is a short story of a devoted Tibetan.  They came from afar just to be 
              able to see Lama Rinpoche, their unwavering faith and respect despite 
              having very little, often a stale biscuit and a bottle of mineral water 
              to fill the stomach, but so pure and devoted is their heart.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">“Quick! Wake up!, Lama Rinpoche, on the 
              moon!”  a nun was nudging her sister who was beside her at 12 midnight 
              to wake up.  They climbed up to the rooftop, faced the moon and recited:
               “Lama Rinpoche, Lama Rinpoche, Lama Rinpoche!”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Many nuns and monks believed that Lama 
              Rinpoche had manifested on the sun, moon, in the sky above. The time 
              after Lama Rinpoche entered paranirvana till cremation, many miraculous 
              signs appear in the sky such as rainbow, clouds, colored bindu, etc.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-112.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1029" title="Paranirvana 11" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/09/Paranirvana-112-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193"></a>For
               example, on a clear sky, with no rain and just a few clusters of cloud,
               a rainbow arch appeared in the sky, with very definitive five colors 
              for a period of ten over minutes.  This phenomenon happened for about 
              4-5 times. These were the sign of Lama Achuk’s achievement and 
              demonstration of prefect rainbow body. It is one of the largest even in 
              Yachen Gar, as well as in recent Buddhist history!</p>

              <p>The most renowned meditation master in Tibet, Akhyuk Rinpoche, 
              Jamyang Lungtok Gyaltsen (aka Drubwang Lungtok Gyatso) passed away 
              Saturday at his remote encampment in the highlands of Eastern Tibet. 
              Together with the late <a href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Khenpo_Jikme_Phuntsok">Khenpo Jikmé Phuntsok</a> (1933-2004) of Larung Gar Buddhist Academy, Akhyuk Rinpoche revitalized
               the study and practice of Buddhism in Eastern Tibet beginning in the 
              1980s, eventually drawing tens of thousands of students from across 
              Tibet and China to his Buddhist encampment of Yachen Gar.</p>
              <p><img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2011-07-27-AkhyukRinpoche.jpg" alt="2011-07-27-AkhyukRinpoche.jpg" width="390" height="518">I
               first met Akhyuk Rinpoche (pronounced Acho) nearly fifteen years ago, 
              and continued to visit him whenever I returned to Eastern Tibet. Every 
              time I met Akhyuk Rinpoche something extraordinary occurred that 
              profoundly impacted my mind and perspective on spiritual practice. I 
              feel extremely fortunate to have received teachings from Akhyuk 
              Rinpoche, as he was truly one of Tibet's last great yogis who was 
              formally trained and practiced in Tibet before the Chinese occupation in
               the 1950s.</p>
              <p>The first time I went to see Akhyuk Rinpoche I arrived like most 
              other pilgrims to Yachen Gar, dust covered and spent from long days of 
              travel by bus through Sichuan Province and then hitchhiking and walking 
              on the Tromthar Plateau. Akhyuk Rinpoche was staying in his one-room 
              hermitage where he had been for the past decades, sitting in meditation,
               when not receiving students and pilgrims. I asked the rather stern 
              looking monk for a blessing and after reciting a few prayers, Akhyuk 
              Rinpoche reached towards his chest and pulled from his bare skin a 
              ringsel, a kind of pearl-like relic that is often found in cremation 
              pyres of saints. I had only read about ringsel, never having seen one, 
              and certainly did not know that the sacred relic might manifest while 
              the saint was still alive. I later learned that such physical signs of 
              spiritual realization indeed could come during the life of accomplished 
              yogis. Upon handing me the small ringsel, I felt, for a few minutes, 
              what can only be described as,<em> my awareness knew no bounds</em>.  
              Akhyuk Rinpoche recommended that I wear it in my amulet as a protection.
               I felt as though it was a reminder of how the mind is when it is set 
              free from the habitual patterns of chasing after thoughts.</p>
              <p>On another occasion a year later, after giving a short Buddhist 
              teaching to my Tibetan travel partner and me, Akhyuk Rinpoche 
              spontaneously pulled his shirt and shawl over his head and yelled, "What
               do you see?" Upon looking on his chest, a shadow-like but very clearly 
              defined triangular shape, pointing downward, extended the length of his 
              body, as well as a darkened swoosh on his neck, as if painted lightly 
              with an ink brush. The unconventional master explained that the triangle
               shape was the appearance of a ritual phurba-dagger (used to vanquish 
              the self-cherishing ego) on his body as a result of deep states of 
              meditation. That I could see it was a sign of our spiritual connection, 
              but because the details were not clear was an indication that I needed 
              to spend long periods in meditation retreat. The ink swoosh, Akhyuk 
              Rinpoche told me, was a sign of the blessing of his own teacher, Arik 
              Rinpoche, who had a long whispy beard.</p>
              <p>I heard many such mystical stories about Akhyuk Rinpoche from his 
              students during my ten-years of travel throughout Tibet. Students spoke 
              in awe of his vast learning, where he could recite entire books by 
              memory. Yet, the most significant impact Akhyuk Rinpoche had on students
               was in his unique way of guiding them through their meditation and 
              yogic practices.</p>
              <p>"To be taught such practices from a master who has himself 
              accomplished them, reached the pinnacle of the practice, this truly has 
              the power to impact our minds," a senior student at Yachen Gar once told
               me. "Otherwise, it is just dry philosophy and book knowledge that does 
              not penetrate to your heart."  That thousands of Akhyuk Rinpoche's 
              students spent years in meditation retreat, and are continuing to do so,
               is testament to their devotion to emulate their teacher's profound path
               of spiritual accomplishment.</p>
              <p>Akhyuk Rinpoche experienced great hardship in his life, especially 
              during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). Eventually, after the death 
              of Arik Rinpoche in 1988, Akhyuk Rinpoche began teaching.  Students 
              settled around him in the barren highlands of the Eastern Tibetan where 
              the monks and nuns lived in simple mud-walled houses, burning yak dung 
              for fuel. Above fourteen thousand feet in elevation, windswept and 
              exposed, it offered few comforts. For the hermits, however, the infinite
               sky view and lack of distraction found in villages and cities make it 
              ideal for meditation. The meditators were once described to me as, "sons
               and daughters of the mountains choosing mist as their clothes and 
              meditation as their food."</p>
              <p>During the 1990s, the population of monks and nuns at Yachen Gar 
              (also known as Yachen Orgyen Samten Chöling) grew to over 7,000. Despite
               the nonpolitical nature of the monks and nuns meditating at Yachen, 
              trouble was at their doorstep. The Chinese authorities deemed 
              problematic this encampment of adobe huts and tents filled with 
              meditating monks, nuns and lay practitioners. Not only did such an 
              encampment exhibit the strength and resilience of Tibetan identity and 
              its unique wisdom culture, it also stirred the principal fear that the 
              Chinese Communist Party has about Tibet; a complete lack of legitimacy, 
              even after 60 years of rule. In the fall of 2001, just months after the 
              demolition of thousands of homes at the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy in 
              Golok, Chinese authorities acted upon their fear and ordered the 
              demolition of large parts of Yachen Gar. I visited Yachen during this 
              dark time to photograph the destruction, and subsequently wrote about it
               in <a href="http://www.matteopistono.com/"><em>In the Shadow of the Buddha: Secret Journeys, Sacred Histories, and Spiritual Discovery in Tibet</em></a>.</p>
              <p>Akhyuk Rinpoche remained at Yachen Gar during the demolitions and 
              told his students not to generate anger towards the government's actions
               but rather to empathise with government officials who were in fact 
              bringing upon themselves future suffering by their present negative 
              deeds. Despite the destruction and repressive policies by Chinese 
              authorities, Akhyuk Rinpoche continued to teach his students and the 
              monastic community survived with a new nunnery being constructed in 
              recent years and plans for a medical clinic for meditators.</p>
              <p>During my last visit to Yachen Gar, Akhyuk Rinpoche told me the 
              authorities from the provincial capital telephoned him every day to 
              check on his whereabouts. Such calls had been kept up for years. I asked
               Akhyuk Rinpoche what he tells the Chinese police.</p>
              <p>"Every day I tell them I'm in the same place I have been for the last twenty years; sitting in meditation at my hermitage!"</p>
              <p>Akhyuk Rinpoche (b. 1927) died at his hermitage at Yachen Gar on July 23, 2011.</p>
