            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I will never again feel insecure, or feel fear, or feel doubt or feel those emotions we don't want to feel</blockquote>I agree that thereÂ’s something very wrong with the emotional models of enlightenment and the dogmas that most people have regarding enlightenment and emotions. (I was feeling a little frustrated recently conversing with a few people recently, who had very thick dogmas about what enlightenment is supposed to be)<br><br>To correct this situation the 'non-duality model' of enlightenment must be introduced to get rid of people's misconceptions. (that means, enlightenment is merely a quantum leap of perception into the nature of non-duality, and is not about behaviour modifications)<br><br>However that said, we must also know... as Thusness said, 'non-duality, fearlessness and non-attachment' are the three qualities essential to self liberation.<br><br>If there are not these three qualities, then the karmic propensities are still reacting strongly and one cannot be able to see self-liberation. There is no true freedom, you are under total control of the momentum only. There is no seeing and no liberation.<br><br><blockquote>Thusness says:<br>u said momentum is at work?<br>Thusness says:<br>how is one to realise it?<br>Thusness says:<br>Asking Â“who am IÂ”, pre-assumes that there is a Â‘whoÂ’.<br>Thusness says:<br>Or are we free from the 'who'?<br>Thusness says:<br>Does asking 'who am I' that eventually lead to the experience of  "I AM" because it assumes a who from start?<br>Thusness says:<br>what is the nature of non-duality?</blockquote>But again, even self-liberation is a matter of insights, it is not through effortfully modifying one's behavior to get rid of 'bad emotions'. Like the following quote says, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Self-liberation does not mean that a self liberates himself or herself from delusorily valued thoughts or delusory experiences; what it means is that delusorily valued thoughts and delusory experiences liberate themselves spontaneously (which may take place in three main ways).</strong> (Source: <a href="http://eliascapriles.dzogchen.ru/self-liberation.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://eliascapriles.dzogchen.ru/self-liberation.pdf</a>)</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW just something that Thusness told me, there are different levels of spontaneous arising. Self-liberation is the <strong>deeper</strong> insight of it, so not to confuse it with an initial realisation of spontaneity. This is posted to correct any misconcepts and confusion over whether 'spontaneous arising' and 'self-liberation' are the same thing (self-liberation is also about spontaneous arising but a deeper level of realisations).<br><br>But what I said regarding the momentum thing and not to mistake it as spontaneous arising and self-liberation is correct.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I posted this in: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=262770" rel="nofollow">The Spell of Karmic Propensities</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Initially I thought Thusness told me to post our whole chat log on this in the forum which I did, then it turns out that what he meant was he wanted me to SUMMARISE it to see my understanding based on the chat log <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So my summary goes...<br><br>Karmic Propensities is what blinded us from seeing the ultimate reality. Our entire mind is affected by karmic propensities such that our entire system of enquiry, even when we want to inquire on reality, we cannot know beyond "Who", "When", "What", "Where". Our mind is always thinking dualistically, in terms of subject and object (an I and a Not-I, which cannot be found in reality). It is a momentum that cannot be located, yet it can be directly felt and experienced, and the momentum arises every moment and affect the entire way we see things. When we are affected by momentum the mind cannot know the ultimate reality (Emptiness).<br><br>Because our momentum is at work, we will always assume a subject-object duality. That is, there is a Self, an Agent, and observer, doer, thinker of think. A self that persists in time in a connected way... experiencing things... It blinds us into seeing self and objective world as 'entities', as 'things' with inherent existence, as a separate and permanent 'me'.<br><br>So when momentum is in action, we cannot help but react with our karmic patterns. If we were to ask, "If you lost your shoe, are you still you?" or "If u lost ur hands, do u still exist?". It almost seems certain to say "Yes, of course I am still I." because we always assumed there is a truly existing "Self" experiencing changes. This momentum can continue even after experiences of transcendental Presence, and distorting the experience. Dharma Dan calls this the "fundamental knot of perception".<br><br>Because it is our habit energy that made us think that way, we are so used to thinking in terms of subject object duality that it has become so deeply part of us, deeply imprinted into our consciousness.<br><br>If we were to eliminate this bond, then we can begin to realise, there is no "Self". In reality, there is only Self1, Self2, Self3, moment to moment our mental and karmic factors arise spontaneously but not in a connected way. We are not a permanent self, we are momentary self and nothing stays, everything is ever flowing.<br><br>Without seeing things of 'entities', we can begin to realise the nature of Denpendent Co-Arising, Conditionality, Interdependence, etc, i.e Emptiness. The nature is always so, but our karmic propensities obscure us from seeing the truth, distorting the way we see things, enquire things, and perceive things. It is this bond that bonds us life after life in Samsara.<br><br>Forgot to mention... to eliminate the bond we have to feel it, feel the power of the bond, experience it. To eliminate the bond is a matter of insights, the insight into our true nature, the insight into self-liberation, etc.</div></blockquote></div>
