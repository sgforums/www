              <p>I realised I have posted this before but I think it is worth mentioning again.</p>
              <p>This is a seriously good dharma book by a truly enlightened dharma teacher who wrote a very detailed book on the practice (especially on the practice of Vipassana/insight meditation), the stages of insights, pointers and advices for the practice, etc... available free online, but also available for purchase in places like Amazon. Our moderators Thusness and Longchen who have read the book also thinks it is very well written.</p>

              <h1>Daniel Ingram's Free Book and Handouts</h1>
              Nearly all of my earlier writings have been compiled, edited, expanded and integrated into a work called <em>Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha, An Unusually Hardcore Dharma Book</em>.
              I think it is one of the more practical and technically detailed
              manuals for high-level insight and concentration practice available,
              and its maps of spiritual terrain and advice for navigating in unusual
              territory are world-class. It is available in Adobe (.pdf) format for
              download below and is about 1.4 megabytes. When printed, the book is
              about 392 pages. In 2007 and 2008 I rewrote a substantial portion of
              the chapter on the Models of the Stages of Enlightenment.<br> <br> The book is also available in <a href="http://web.mac.com/danielmingram/iWeb/Daniel%20Ingram%27s%20Dharma%20Blog/The%20Blook/The%20Blook.html">blog format (blook)</a> to make for easier browsing and on-line reading for those who don't want to download one of the files below.
              <br><br> <img src="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/bookcover.jpg" alt=""> <strong> I am extremely happy to announce that, at long last, the book is available in standard printed form from <a href="http://www.aeonbooks.co.uk/product.php?PID=27526">Aeon Pulications</a>, out of London.</strong> It should be of real value to those who actually want to hold a book in
              their hands and not some large unbound thing they printed off on the
              office laser printer. It is also available for order from your local
              independent bookstore or any of the standard mega-sources, including
              the likes of Amazon.
              <br><br>My book has parts of it that are suitable for beginners, but
              some of it is likely to be somewhat daunting unless you are into
              hardcore practice.
              <br><br> Many books that are very suitable for beginners may be found in my <a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/booklist.shtml">book list</a>.
              <br><br> You may quote my book if you reference it properly, do not alter the text you quote, and do not use quotes out of context.
              Please realize that it is bound by the standard limitations of language and the author.

              <p>Having a living teacher is of course very helpful. However I would say that there is not a problem to learn from the internet or books as long as the books or the internet sources come from reliable, experienced meditators who actually help deliver the correct understanding and practice of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>As for Dharma Dan, I strongly believe as he has indicated that he has attained enlightenment and full liberation (Arhatship). That is quite an open, honest, but somewhat unbelievable claim (because teachers usually aren't so open about these things even if they do become enlightened). At first when I saw his book several years ago, I didn't believed it, but when I showed Thusness a year later (I think 2006 or 07) he said he was very impressed with the insights of the author. Because of this, I read through the book, and became convinced. As Thusness said, the insights of Daniel is beyond many other teachers and authors around nowadays... it is good to take this book as a serious guide to practice.</p>
              <p>It should be noted however that this is a 'hardcore practice book', if you are still starting on meditation there are simpler guides like <a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Mindfulness In Plain English</span></strong></span></a></p>
              <p>Which is also a good guide and contains detailed instruction of breathing meditation and mindfulness practice. Very good.</p>
              <p>I highly recommend reading these two books.</p>
