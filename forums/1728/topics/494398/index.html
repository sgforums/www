              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              does not depend on or assume any external authority whatsoever. It is neither
              exclusive nor possessive. Being Buddhist is a matter of living a sublime way of
              life, the brahmacariya, wherein one explores the law of nature and lives in
              harmony with it. It is not a matter of external identity or affiliation.
              Therefore, you need not convert or register yourself as a Buddhist in order to
              study and practice Buddhism. You can follow whatever religion pleases you or
              follow no religion at all, and still study and practice Buddhism. It is simply
              a matter of how you live your life. Any who are willing to approach, learn,
              investigate, practice, and live according to natural truth can experience this.
              Buddhism is available to everyone and is not exclusive in any way.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              qualities of a student have been long established in Buddhism. They include the
              checklist you might expect—concentration, application, respect for your teacher
              and the dharma. But they also include the quality of having a questioning
              attitude, specifically an attitude ensuring that the teachings you receive are
              in accordance with the established dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              of the most common criticisms of Buddhism I come across is the idea that in
              following a particular teacher, practitioners are somehow allowing themselves
              to become brainwashed. From the outside, it’s easy to see why people might
              think that practitioners fall under the spell of their guru, given their
              efforts to carry out instructions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              as this teaching shows, there is no room for passivity on the part of a
              student. This is not a one-way process, like watching TV. Students are,
              instead, engaged in a dynamic activity in which we are constantly assessing and
              questioning the teachings, thinking about how they apply to our lives. In
              following a teacher, dharma students are not abdicating responsibility for
              their future to someone else. Quite the opposite. Just as the occupants of a
              prisoner-of-war camp might value the advice of a tunnel engineer, or a group of
              lost explorers would have much to learn from a navigation expert, the actual
              business of escaping from samsara is something we need to do for ourselves—and,
              of course, for others.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">PERLE BESSERMAN AND MANFRED STEGER</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There’s
              a difference between meditating to achieve an immediate goal, like becoming a
              healthier or a better person, and committing yourself to a lifetime of zazen
              practice with no tangible goal at all. The 20th-century Japanese Zen master
              Yasutani Hakuun Roshi once described the two kinds of people who come to the
              practice as those seeking a temporary cure for suffering and those seeking to
              unearth the root of suffering altogether. Although he didn’t brush aside the
              former, he pointed out that this instrumental attitude wasn’t enough to sustain
              a long-term relationship with Zen, one that goes beyond simply adding another
              “technique” to our first aid kit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Looking
              to Zen for self-improvement isn’t an American invention. It has a long
              tradition in Japan that goes back to its ancient warrior society. Most samurai
              used Zen, in fact, to become more skilled at making war and dying. They
              practiced zazen in order to develop strong “mind power” (joriki) so they would
              be better swordsmen and less fearful in facing an enemy. Today Japanese
              businesspeople use it to become more concentrated competitors. The impulse of
              the businesspeople does not differ much from that of the samurai. The
              motivation for self-improvement takes many forms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              second group of people who come to Zen, those whom Yasutani Hakuun Roshi
              described as seeking to unearth the root of suffering altogether, aren’t any
              less troubled or pained than the first. Often, in the course of training, those
              seeking self-­improvement develop into committed Zen practitioners while the
              so-called spiritual seekers disappear. The issue is not so much the reasons for
              coming as what happens once you actually sit down and start to meditate. You
              might come wanting to improve yourself and leave after six sessions because you
              feel you aren’t getting anywhere. Likewise, you can be driven by a profound,
              burning lifelong existential question, and also leave after those same six
              sessions for the same reason. The important thing is to stick to the practice
              no matter what. You’ve got to develop the love of sitting for its own sake—and
              an appreciation for the paradox, because the point of Zen is seeing that there
              isn’t any static self to improve or realize.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              faith is strong and pure, then wisdom will develop easily into enlightenment.
              But if we lack faith and devotion, then even if the Buddha were standing in
              front of us, he could not bring any benefit. Being without faith is said to be
              like trying to make a stone float or trying to steer a boat without a rudder;
              it is like an armless man in front of treasure, like trying to grow a plant
              from a burnt seed, or like a blind man trying to find his way in a temple.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              is a story of a king who, upon listening to a musician playing a 16-string
              sitar, was moved to the depths of his soul. The music touched him so deeply
              that he wanted to discover exactly where it was coming from. When the musician
              departed, he left his sitar with the king, and the king ordered his servant to
              chop the instrument into small pieces. No matter how hard they tried, though,
              they could not find the source of the beautiful sound, the essence of the
              music. Just like the king looking into the sitar, the bodhisattva
              Avalokiteshvara looked deeply into his own five skandhas [impermanent “heaps,”
              made of matter, sensations, perceptions, thoughts, and self-consciousness] and
              discovered that they were empty of a self. No matter how wonderful something
              is, when we look deeply into it, we see that there is nothing in it we can
              identify as a separate self.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              student came to Master Bankei and said that he had an uncontrollable temper,
              which he felt was obstructing his cultivation practice. What, he asked, could
              he do about it?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Okay,”
              said Master Bankei. “Show it to me.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              cannot show it to you right now,” answered the student.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Well,”
              asked Master Bankei, “when can you show it to me?” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“It
              comes on me all of a sudden,” said the student.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Ah,”
              said the master. “Then it cannot be a part of your true nature. If that were so
              you would be able to show it to me any time.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              student went away and meditated on this and from that day his temper was gone.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">PHILLIP MOFFITT</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist
              teachings suggest that there are certain characteristics called paramis, or
              perfections, that you must develop before you can ever achieve liberation. One
              of these qualities, right resolve, has to do with developing the will to live
              by your intentions. Through practicing right resolve, you learn to set your
              mind to maintaining your values and priorities, and to resist the temptation to
              sacrifice your values for material or ego gain. You gain the ability to
              consistently hold your intentions, no matter what arises.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Right
              intention is like muscle—you develop it over time by exercising it. When you
              lose it, you just start over again. There’s no need to judge yourself or quit
              when you fail to live by your intentions. You are developing the habit of right
              intention so that it becomes an unconscious way of living—an automatic response
              to all situations. Right intention is organic; it thrives when cultivated and
              wilts when neglected.</span></p>
