              <p>up to this point the best way for me to proceed is still the choiceless awareness practice.</p>
              <p>as i was wondering what's the role attention plays in this meditation,a tiny little thought comes up :  " truth will reveal itself where attention goes "</p>
              <p>now,there's the strong desire,and i already understand the importance of mindfulness,effort is going to be applied (to sustain mindfulness),</p>
              <p>but should i let my attention free or constricted?in other words,make it into spotlight or a theatre light(wide)?</p>
              <p>what's the difference in terms of results(this Q is in fact pointless,for the only way to find out is to test both and see for myself)</p>
              <p>not in term of objects/phenomena(in choiceless awareness any phenomena which comes to mind will do),but the quality,strength of focus.</p>

              <p>This is a good question, and I think at different stage our emphasis may be different. I do not have a clear answer for you, but sometimes I like the perspective of being fully absorbed, sometimes graciously witnessing, sometimes wide and open like the sky. In whatever case, true attention has the 'direct, non-conceptual' quality to it which is most essential, that quality which is to directly experience something whether the I AM or a sight/sound/sensation/etc without intemediary, concepts, subject-object separation, i.e. being 'bare' and 'naked'.</p>
              <p>Jack Kornfield deals with this very thoroughly in his article <a href="http://www.jackkornfield.org/index/articles?id=amindlikesky">http://www.jackkornfield.org/index/articles?id=amindlikesky</a></p>
              <p class="mainText" style="color: #8e8e8e;"><em>May, 2003</em><br> <span class="articleHeader">A Mind Like Sky</span></p>
              <p class="mainText">Meditation comes alive through a 
                  growing capacity to release our habitual entanglement in the stories and
                   plans, conflicts and worries that make up the small sense of self, and 
                  to rest in awareness. In meditation we do this simply by acknowledging 
                  the moment-to-moment changing conditions—the pleasure and pain, the 
                  praise and blame, the litany of ideas and expectations that arise. 
                  Without identifying with them, we can rest in the awareness itself, 
                  beyond conditions, and experience what my teacher Ajahn Chah called jai 
                  pongsai, our natural lightness of heart. Developing this capacity to 
                  rest in awareness nourishes samadhi (concentration), which stabilizes 
                  and clarifies the mind, and prajna (wisdom), that sees things as they 
                  are.</p>
              <p class="mainText">We can employ this awareness or wise 
                  attention from the very start. When we first sit down to meditate, the 
                  best strategy is to simply notice whatever state of our body and mind is
                   present. To establish the foundation of mindfulness, the Buddha 
                  instructs his followers "to observe whether the body and mind are 
                  distracted or steady, angry or peaceful, excited or worried, contracted 
                  or released, bound or free." Observing what is so, we can take a few 
                  deep breaths and relax, making space for whatever situation we find.</p>
              <p class="mainText">From this ground of acceptance we can learn to use 
                  the transformative power of attention in a flexible and malleable way. 
                  Wise attention—mindfulness—can function like a zoom lens. Often it is 
                  most helpful to steady our practice with close-up attention. In this, we
                   bring a careful attention and a very close focus to our breath or a 
                  sensation, or to the precise movement of feeling or thought. Over time 
                  we can eventually become so absorbed that subject and object disappear. 
                  We become the breath, we become the tingling in our foot, we become the 
                  sadness or joy. In this we sense ourself being born and dying with each 
                  breath, each experience. Entanglement in our ordinary sense of self 
                  dissolves; our troubles and fears drop away. Our entire experience of 
                  the world shows itself to be impermanent, ungraspable and selfless. 
                  Wisdom is born.</p>
              <p class="mainText">But sometimes in meditation 
                  such close focus of attention can create an unnecessary sense of 
                  tightness and struggle. So we must find a more open way to pay 
                  attention. Or perhaps when we are mindfully walking down the street we 
                  realize it is not helpful to focus only on our breath or our feet. We 
                  will miss the traffic signals, the morning light and the faces of the 
                  passersby. So we open the lens of awareness to a middle range. When we 
                  do this as we sit, instead of focusing on the breath alone, we can feel 
                  the energy of our whole body. As we walk we can feel the rhythm of our 
                  whole movement and the circumstances through which we move. From this 
                  perspective it is almost as if awareness "sits on our shoulder" and 
                  respectfully acknowledges a breath, a pain in our legs, a thought about 
                  dinner, a feeling of sadness, a shop window we pass. Here wise attention
                   has a gracious witnessing quality, acknowledging each event—whether 
                  boredom or jealousy, plans or excitement, gain or loss, pleasure or 
                  pain—with a slight bow. Moment by moment we release the illusion of 
                  getting "somewhere" and rest in the timeless present, witnessing with 
                  easy awareness all that passes by. As we let go, our innate freedom and 
                  wisdom manifest. Nothing to have, nothing to be. Ajahn Chah called this 
                  "resting in the One Who Knows."</p>
              <p class="mainText">Yet at times 
                  this middle level of attention does not serve our practice best. We may 
                  find ourself caught in the grip of some repetitive thought pattern or 
                  painful situation, or lost in great physical or emotional suffering. 
                  Perhaps there is chaos and noise around us. We sit and our heart is 
                  tight, our body and mind are neither relaxed nor gracious, and even the 
                  witnessing can seem tedious, forced, effortful.</p>
              <p class="mainText">In this circumstance we can open the lens of attention to its widest 
                  angle and let our awareness become like space or the sky. As the Buddha 
                  instructs in the Majjhima Nikaya, "Develop a mind that is vast like 
                  space, where experiences both pleasant and unpleasant can appear and 
                  disappear without conflict, struggle or harm. Rest in a mind like vast 
                  sky."</p>
              <p class="mainText">From this broad perspective, when we sit 
                  or walk in meditation, we open our attention like space, letting 
                  experiences arise without any boundaries, without inside or outside. 
                  Instead of the ordinary orientation where our mind is felt to be inside 
                  our head, we can let go and experience the mind's awareness as open, 
                  boundless and vast. We allow awareness to experience consciousness that 
                  is not entangled in the particular conditions of sight, sound and 
                  feelings, but consciousness that is independent of changing 
                  conditions—the unconditioned. Ajahn Jumnien, a Thai forest elder, speaks
                   of this form of practice as Maha Vipassana, resting in pure awareness 
                  itself, timeless and unborn. For the meditator, this is not an ideal or a
                   distant experience. It is always immediate, ever present, liberating; 
                  it becomes the resting place of the wise heart.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Fully absorbed, graciously witnessing, or open and spacious—which of 
                  these lenses is the best way to practice awareness? Is there an optimal 
                  way to pay attention? The answer is "all of the above." Awareness is 
                  infinitely malleable, and it is important not to fixate on any one form 
                  as best. Mistakenly, some traditions teach that losing the self and 
                  dissolving into a breath or absorbing into an experience is the optimal 
                  form of attention. Other traditions erroneously believe that resting in 
                  the widest angle, the open consciousness of space, is the highest 
                  teaching. Still others say that the middle ground—an ordinary, free and 
                  relaxed awareness of whatever arises here and now, "nothing special"—is 
                  the highest attainment. Yet in its true nature awareness cannot be 
                  limited. Consciousness itself is both large and small, particular and 
                  universal. At different times our practice will require that we embrace 
                  all these perspectives.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Every form of genuine 
                  awareness is liberating. Each moment we release entanglement and 
                  identification is selfless and free. But remember too that every 
                  practice of awareness can create a shadow when we mistakenly cling to 
                  it. A misuse of space can easily lead us to become spaced-out and 
                  unfocused. A misuse of absorption can lead to denial, the ignoring of 
                  other experiences, and a misuse of ordinary awareness can create a false
                   sense of "self" as a witness. These shadows are subtle veils of 
                  meditative clinging. See them for what they are and let them go. And 
                  learn to work with all the lenses of awareness to serve your wise 
                  attention.</p>
              <p class="mainText">The more you experience the power of
                   wise attention, the more your trust in the ground of awareness itself 
                  will grow. You will learn to relax and let go. In any moment of being 
                  caught, awareness will step in, a presence without judging or resisting.
                   Close-in or vast, near or far, awareness illuminates the ungraspable 
                  nature of the universe. It returns the heart and mind to its birthright,
                   naturally luminous and free.</p>
              <p class="mainText">To amplify and 
                  deepen an understanding of how to practice with awareness as space, the 
                  following instructions can be helpful. One of the most accessible ways 
                  to open to spacious awareness is through the ear door, listening to the 
                  sounds of the universe around us. Because the river of sound comes and 
                  goes so naturally, and is so obviously out of our control, listening 
                  brings the mind to a naturally balanced state of openness and attention.
                   I learned this particular practice of sound as a gateway to space from 
                  my colleague Joseph Goldstein more than 25 years ago and have used it 
                  ever since. Awareness of sound in space can be an excellent way to begin
                   practice because it initiates the sitting period with the flavor of 
                  wakeful ease and spacious letting go. Or it can be used after a period 
                  of focused attention.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Whenever you begin, sit 
                  comfortably and at ease. Let your body be at rest and your breathing be 
                  natural. Close your eyes. Take several full breaths and let each release
                   gently. Allow yourself to be still.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Now shift 
                  awareness away from the breath. Begin to listen to the play of sounds 
                  around you. Notice those that are loud and soft, far and near. Just 
                  listen. Notice how all sounds arise and vanish, leaving no trace. Listen
                   for a time in a relaxed, open way.</p>
              <p class="mainText">As you 
                  listen, let yourself sense or imagine that your mind is not limited to 
                  your head. Sense that your mind is expanding to be like the sky-open, 
                  clear, vast like space. There is no inside or outside. Let the awareness
                   of your mind extend in every direction like the sky.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Now the sounds you hear will arise and pass away in 
                  the open space of your own mind. Relax in this openness and just listen.
                   Let the sounds that come and go, whether far or near, be like clouds in
                   the vast sky of your own awareness. The play of sounds moves through 
                  the sky, appearing and disappearing without resistance.</p>
              <p class="mainText">As you rest in this open awareness, notice how 
                  thoughts and images also arise and vanish like sounds. Let the thoughts 
                  and images come and go without struggle or resistance. Pleasant and 
                  unpleasant thoughts, pictures, words and feelings move unrestricted in 
                  the space of mind. Problems, possibilities, joys and sorrows come and go
                   like clouds in the clear sky of mind.</p>
              <p class="mainText">After a 
                  time, let this spacious awareness notice the body. Become aware of how 
                  the sensations of breath and body float and change in the same open sky 
                  of awareness. The breath breathes itself, it moves like a breeze. The 
                  body is not solid. It is felt as areas of hardness and softness, 
                  pressure and tingling, warm and cool sensation, all floating in the 
                  space of the mind's awareness.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Let the breath 
                  move like a breeze. Rest in this openness. Let sensations float and 
                  change. Allow all thoughts and images, feelings and sounds to come and 
                  go like clouds in the clear open space of awareness.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Finally, pay attention to the awareness itself. 
                  Notice how the open space of awareness is naturally clear, transparent, 
                  timeless and without conflict—allowing all things, but not limited by 
                  them.</p>
              <p class="mainText">The Buddha said, "O Nobly Born, remember 
                  the pure open sky of your own true nature. Return to it. Trust it. It is
                   home."</p>
              <p class="mainText">May the blessings of these practices 
                  awaken your own inner wisdom and inspire your compassion. And through 
                  the blessing of your heart may the world find peace.</p>

              <p>up to this point the best way for me to proceed is still the
              choiceless awareness practice.</p>
              <p>as i was wondering what's the role attention plays in this
              meditation,a tiny little thought comes up :  " truth will
              reveal itself where attention goes "</p>
              <p>now,there's the strong desire,and i already understand the
              importance of mindfulness,effort is going to be applied (to sustain
              mindfulness),</p>
              <p>but should i let my attention free or constricted?in other
              words,make it into spotlight or a theatre light(wide)?</p>
              <p>what's the difference in terms of results(this Q is in fact
              pointless,for the only way to find out is to test both and see for
              myself)</p>
              <p>not in term of objects/phenomena(in choiceless awareness any
              phenomena which comes to mind will do),but the quality,strength of
              focus.</p>

              <p>from my experience, there's two aspects to the practice - stability and clarity.  and these two aspects must be equal or balanced to produce a "good" meditation, so to speak.</p>
              <p>i personally find "wide-open" choiceless awareness type of meditation easier to do.  when i say easier, it means its pretty easy for me to sit down, relax and get the stability aspect of it right within few mins' time. stability in terms of stable state of calmness with little or zero thoughts and agitation/fluctuation.  but the pitfall for me is i find that i lose the clarity aspect more easily, say, after 15mins of stability.  where it goes into what i call high stability with low clarity - relaxed, blissful, no thoughts, stable but yet "not bright" and mindful as it should be.  this is obviously, not good at all.</p>
              <p>on other end of spectrum, i find "spotlight" type of meditation harder.  where i either do concentration type of focus on single object/breathe or vipassanna type of noticing sensations moment to moment.  this yield higher clarity for me as i spend more engergy focusing and being mindful, but lower sense of stability as the mind either habitually pulls away from object of attention in case of concentration practice, or moment-to-moment noticing which by nature of the practice do not have a natural sense of stability.  so the ramp-up time to achieve stability is longer for me when attention is narrower but yet the advantage is the clarity or mindfulness is very high.</p>
              <p>my own belief is no one type of practice is suitable for everyone, as every individual is wired differently.  you just have to experiment yourself by trying out different ways, identify your own weaknesses during practice and determine which works and which do not.</p>

              <p>thanks guys... great pointers ,esp kornfield's article(though seems too much to be digesible at this moment :-) )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i especially like this section(as speaks to my present  obstacle) :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>" Yet at times this middle level of attention does not serve our practice best. We may find ourself caught in the grip of some repetitive thought pattern or painful situation, or lost in great physical or emotional suffering. Perhaps there is chaos and noise around us. We sit and our heart is tight, our body and mind are neither relaxed nor gracious, and even the witnessing can seem tedious, forced, effortful.</p>
              <p>In this circumstance we can open the lens of attention to its widest angle and let our awareness become like space or the sky. As the Buddha instructs in the Majjhima Nikaya, "Develop a mind that is vast like space, where experiences both pleasant and unpleasant can appear and disappear without conflict, struggle or harm. Rest in a mind like vast sky."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im trying now to extend the practice into everyday movement,and  when habitual patterns of conditioning(thoughts-emotions) arises.like to share something i read this morning :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so what u have to do (to purify and eliminate thoughts)?</p>
              <p>surprisingly nothing.why?....like all phenomena..they'r impermanent.when u leave them alone,they'll simply disssolve,as the tibetans say - self-liberate (like try to draw on water surface)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>.....you must allow thoughts liberate as soon as they arise(my comment : key point!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thn the author continues to point out that if the thought are  couple with strong emotions  ,when liberated will release some energy which "brightens " awareness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in this way they bcomes our friend instead something to get rid of.</p>
