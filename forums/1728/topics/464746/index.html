              <p>Thusness used to tell us about seeing faces of past lives and wrote:<br><em><br></em></p>
              <h5 class="uiStreamMessage userContentWrapper"><em><span class="messageBody"><span class="userContent">Life
                       is like a passing cloud, when it comes to an end, a hundred years is 
                      like yesterday, like a snap of a finger. If it is only about one life, 
                      it really doesnt matter whether we are enlightened. The insight that the
                       Blessed One has is not just about one life; countless lives we 
                      suffered, life after life, unending. Such is suffering.<br> <br> It is 
                      not about logic or science and there is really no point arguing in this 
                      scientific age. Take steps in practice and experience the truth of 
                      Buddhas words. Of the 3 dharma seals, the truth of suffering to me is 
                      most difficult to experience in depth.<br> <br> May all take Buddhas words seriously.<br> <br> ~ Thusness, 2006</span></span></em></h5>

              <div class="Message">last night during the meditation i determined to see 'my' previous births<br><br>1. after a while i have succeeded to see a woman with three children, i felt that was me and my children<br><br>smallest
                       child was sitting on my lap, another one sitting on the bench where i 
                      was sitting and the older child standing a lttle bit further where i was
                       sitting, but close enough to felt he (it was a he) also mine<br><br><br>2. after a while i see a woman carring a child (a baby) <br>at that time also i felt that was me<br><br>3.  after a while i saw so many corpses in frount of me<br>there were countless corpses and i wanted to see the faces but i couldn't<br><br>all these scenaries were very vivid and like i see them with my own eyes even though my eyes were closed<br><br>i want to share this with you<br><br>i know the meaning of the last scene but i would like to know what you think about the third (3) <br><br>after that i felt like i couldn't be angry with anything or anyone<br>it is like ',my' heart is full of loving-kindness and compassion<br><br><br>please share your thoughts            <br><br>............<br><br> at that moment i knew all those corpses were mine
                      <br> <br>if i end as a corpse everytime i born, what is the use of coming  ing again
                      <br>the last result, the end result was a corpse each time before
                      <br>it was obvious at that time
                      <br>what is going to happen this time also the same
                      <br> <br> <br>any living being gets the same result 
                      <br>so why should i get angry with any living being whatever they do or say?
                      <br>they do not know wha they do or say and they continue to suffer enen houugh they know or not know they are suffering
                      <br>what would you think?
                      <br>you have loving-kindness for them
                      <br>if possible you would help them to get rid of their suffering- that is compassion
                      <br> <br>whatever comes in front of me which i am not happy to have in front 
                      of me that is done by a living being who is going to be a corpse
                      <br>so why should i get angry with anything that i confront (even though
                       i get angry with what i confronted my anger goes towards the person who
                       has done it - consider athat you see graffity on your house early in 
                      the morning and how would your mind react to it)
                      <br> <br>so how can you get angry with anything or anyone?
                      <br>do not think, i would be able to be like that all the time in future
                      <br> <br>now i know, and now i can work on my anger
                      <br>how far i will be successful is to be seen in future            <br></div>

              Basically, the above sentence means: To become husbands &amp; wives is to have met the right conditions; Sons &amp; daughters are born to you because of debts. Without the right conditions, a relationship will not arise;  When there is no debt to be paid, they won't come after u.
              
              I want to ask, what is your view regarding this?  
              
              Imagine parents &amp; their childrens listening to a dharma talk that preaches this, and the dharma teacher keeps emphasing naughty kids are è®¨å€ºé¬¼ (debt-seeking devil).  What kind of impact does this have on family relationship?  Will kids listen to the dharma in future when they are depicted as some kind of devil?  (sorry, I ask this because I listened to a dharma talk &amp; this teacher can go to the extent of painting a really negative view of human relationships, to the extent of, I think quite an embarrassment for a family sitting together listening to such a speech)
              
              Also, I feel it is unfair to call somebody  è®¨å€ºé¬¼ in the first place. Why not label ourselves as a debtor rather than calling someone else a debt-seeking devil?   
              
              For those who can see their previous lives, what do they think of human relationships?  Is it purely of repaying &amp; seeking debts?   
              
              Thank you. :)

              <p>There are many many reasons why one person can take birth in a particular life... seeking debt is only one kind. There are also those who want to pay debts, these are the ones that are usually very good to their parents.<br><br>There are also those who are not born because of 'debt' but because of other reasons, such as wanting to seek a human birth to continue his Buddhist cultivation. This is also possible.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol7no1c.htm">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol7no1c.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong><em><span style="color: #009900;">5 
                        types of offspring<br> <br> </span></em></strong>It is normal to expect kinship between parents and their 
                        children. Loving parents and filial children are the basis for a warm and 
                        harmonious relationship. However, there are exceptions to this norm. According 
                        to Buddhist sutras, there are five types of conditions under which people 
                        are born to their parents:<br> <br> 1. They are reborn into the family to pay back their indebtedness to the 
                        parents. For example, the child is filial, obedient and diligent in his 
                        studies or at work. Regardless of the financial situation, he would provide 
                        for the needs of his parents.<br> <br> 2. They are here to seek the return of what their parents owed them in the 
                        past. This might be due to the parents owing unsettled matters or debts 
                        to the child incurred in their past lives. Thus, not only does the child 
                        not bring fortune to the family this life, but the parents have to spend 
                        a lot of money on him. For example, the child may be sick very often thereby 
                        causing the parents to incur a huge amount of medical expenses, or other 
                        situations where the parents have to spend a lot of money on him and driving 
                        them to financial difficulties. Some of them may even cause the family to 
                        break-up or the death of family members. Some may become incapacitated and 
                        cause the family to run into huge debts or even bankruptcy. These types 
                        of children are reborn to their parents to seek the return of their dues.<br> <br> 3. A child may 
                        be born into a family to return the benevolence that his parents had accorded 
                        him in his past lives. In this lifetime, everything is smooth sailing for 
                        the child and he is successful in his studies and career to bring honour 
                        and pride to the family. Hence, he is here to repay kindness of his parents.<br> <br> 4. They are here to seek revenge on their parents. Perhaps there might be 
                        hostility between the two parties in their past lives. The parents might 
                        have hit the person; insulted him, ill-treated him, or treated him unfairly. 
                        He could not forgive and forget. For example, he would beat up his parents, 
                        ill-treat them, or even to take their lives in return for what they owed 
                        him in the past lives. Hence, he is reborn into the family to seek revenge.<br> <br> 5. They merely borrow the mother's womb to be born into this world. The 
                        great sages and virtuous men, monks and nuns, the Bodhisattva path cultivators 
                        and the Buddha belong to this category.<br> <br> If there is hostility between parents and their children, the parents have 
                        to sincerely repent and perform meritorious deeds in the name of the children. 
                        Parents should not bear hatred and anger but to treat them with compassion 
                        and loving-kindness. Then, the situation would slowly improve and the animosity 
                        would soon dissolve. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>

              <p>Hi all, </p>
              <p>This thread reminds me of the Buddhist tradition of rejoicing in this life and opportunity that we have and to strive to create the cause for a future life with similar circumstances so we can continue our practice. The conducive conditions to practice is classified under the 18 opportune conditions and that is further broken down to 10 endowments and 8 freedoms. Here's the breakdown so it makes it easier for everyone to understand this:-</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>Remember that right now I have the 8 freedoms: </p>
              <p>1. I am not in hell being continuously tortured </p>
              <p>2. I am not living as a hungry ghost, always having hunger and thirst </p>
              <p>3. I am not an ignorant animal </p>
              <p>4. I have some feeling for good and bad </p>
              <p>5. I am able to study religion </p>
              <p>6. The teachings of the Buddha are now available </p>
              <p>7. I have a healthy mind, not crazy </p>
              <p>8. I am not a god, only indulging in pleasures</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember that right now I have the 10 endowments: </p>
              <p>- 5 Personal: </p>
              <p>1. I am a human being </p>
              <p>2. I have access to the teachings of the Buddha </p>
              <p>3. I have all my organs </p>
              <p>4. I have not killed my parents or bodhisattvas etc. </p>
              <p>5. I have the possibility to choose my life philosophy or religion freely </p>
              <p>- 5 Circumstantial: </p>
              <p>6. A Buddha has come in this era </p>
              <p>7. He has taught the Dharma </p>
              <p>8. The Dharma is still available in the world </p>
              <p>9. People are still practising Dharma </p>
              <p>10. Others generally have love in their hearts</p>
