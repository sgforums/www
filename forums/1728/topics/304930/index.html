As a baby, the baby has no choice but to be egocentric, focused on the very tactile world around himself. In fact, at this stage, the child and his surroundings are completely undifferentiated: the child literally does not know that he and it are different. Moving through childhood, the child continues to differentiate and integrate itself and its surroundings until it reaches a more ethnocentric view of the world, focusing on himself, his family, his friends, his nation, etc. Basically, this is the Â“Boyscout/GirlscoutÂ” age of conformity.

One of the first things a first year baby learns is to separate his own little self from his environment. He learns the difference between his body and his environment by biting successively his blankets and the extremities of his body. The first action hurts not, but the second one can give you a hell of a pain (even without teeth). This biting gives the little baby the feeling that 'body-things' somehow belong to the self but 'non-body-things' do not. Having learned this the consciousness of the little infant has become better, because it is quite essential for its survival and continuation to know the difference between the self and a possibly dangerous and threatening outside. This is the most essential and basic differentiation that has to occur.  If this little baby would be able to communicate his newly acquired knowledge to his fellow baby's in the nursery room, who have not as yet acquired these essentials of babyhood, he would somehow acquire a certain leadership in the room. They would appoint him to be the baby in charge.<br><br>(1-3 yrs.)

In the first three years of his life the little infant learns to understand his primal emotions. He learns how signals of hunger, thirst or loneliness are received by the outside world and how to use these signals for his life support. The first images are formed in mental consciousness. He recognizes the mother, the nipple, the cradle; more and more images are formed as he grows older. All newly formed images make his consciousness better equipped for life.  The images and symbols he learns are the most fundamental for his life support.  Images and symbols that correspond the most accurately with the desired objects have leadership in consciousness over images that are more remote to these objects.<br><br>(3-7 yrs.) With the development of language at this age the first concepts are formed in the mind. With language the capacity for abstraction is greatly enhanced, but the mind is still mainly representational. Its function to operate upon the words and images is still rudimentary developed, but now, with the help of language, communication works so much better.

Researchers describe the infant's experience at this stage as "oceanic". The child has no boundaries, and the experience is one of being undifferentiated from the material world. Everything is self. (This is, by the way, not the same experience as the oneness experience of enlightenment, because it does not include a developed awareness of self.)<br><br>But as the baby interacts with the environment, it makes the distinction between self and not-self. It bites its finger, and feels pain. It bites its blanket and it doesn't feel pain. The baby begins to realize that the finger is self and the blanket is not-self. This is the beginning of the awareness that such a thing as not-self exists. Some part of what was thought to be the self (which in this case included everything), now is experienced as not-self. The physical body becomes subject (by which I mean the center from which everything else is experienced) and the rest of the world becomes object.<br>(10:14 PM) Anonymous1: icic, agree, however, the thing is, this learning ability is so natural, but yet it harms him in his spiritual cultivation. such a paradox man<br>(10:15 PM) Anonymous2: it depends.. thats why we should close our six sense doors<br>(10:15 PM) Anonymous2: guard it with mindfulness<br>(10:15 PM) Anonymous2: Here the Lord Buddha said, `Your six sense doors must be closed so that you don't have any mental defilements.` Then do you know how to close the door?

This attachment is to the rose. Then if the flower is not beautiful, is ugly and produces a bad smell, when you see it how do you feel, pleasant or unpleasant? Unpleasant.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks, paperflower <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>In what I began to read after the jungle, and among the people I come across, much importance is made of this thing called awakening or enlightenment. Although I have used the word 'awaken' to express the moment of the shift in perception that occurred in the jungle, at times it seems that this is a misnomer; that the word in this context makes very little sense.<br><br>There is a sense in which there is no 'awakening,' no enlightenment, because there is no 'one' to awaken. Who would this be? Who is awakened?<br><br>'Me,' david? Of course not: david is a dream character, an idea, a fiction; not the dreamer, and therefore obviously cannot awaken. There is no 'david' to <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> anything including awaken.<br><br>Or is it 'Who I Really Am' that has 'awakened;' Presence, Awareness, All That Is?<br><br>But of course Awareness has never been asleep, has no need to awaken to anything; Awareness is always already All There Is.<br><br>Clearly then, there is no one to awaken.. 'Awakening' is only an analogy, a concept, a pointer. The seeker community tends to take it literally, but like most analogies it only takes you so far.<br><br>What has happened is more like this: in the dream, in the case of the dream character 'david,' All That Is stops pretending that 'It' is asleep. What has always been awake lets the misunderstanding that there is some on to be asleep and some one to awaken, fall away.<br><br>That is all. And the dream continues, as before. The misunderstanding has fallen away, but the misunderstanding was not real anyway, so what has happened? Nothing. The dream character 'david' now knows he is only a dream, not 'real;' knows it is all a dream. But even this dream character's 'knowing' is part of the dream, part of the unfolding of the script of the dream for that dream character, and nothing has happened. The dream character goes on being the dream character.<br><br>'Nothing happens' precisely because what appears to be happening is not, and what is happening is what appears as 'no thing'.</blockquote></div>

              <p>Joan Tollifson once asked Toni Â“if she'd ever had one of
                                      those big awakenings where life turns inside out and all
                                      identification with the body-mind ceases.<br> <br> Toni replied, "I can't say I had it," she replied. "It's this
