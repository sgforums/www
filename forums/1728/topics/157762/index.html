All of us when we turn on the news and watch TV at night, we get overwhelmed by how much suffering there is in this world, with disasters, tsunami, and now earthquakes and many people dying. But it must come from inside first, so individually, if we can make that change and absorb this teaching, it will be reflected in the way you smile to someone on the bus."<br><br>Zen Master Dae Bong, Kye Ryong Sahn International Care, South Korea, said: "In the Western world there are many intelligent people, who are tired of being given solutions that they are told are the truth by religion, politics and economic theories. It competes with one another, and it has conflicts with one another, so that's not satisfying to people. If my religious truth causes me to have conflicts with others, what's the value in it? Many people think this way."<br><br>That is one reason why a thousand people gathered to seek the Zen path.<br><br>So, does Zen have a place in fast-paced Singapore?<br><br>Master Dae Bong said: "I heard in Singapore everyone wants the 5 Cs, I want the cash, the credit cards, but those things aren't permanent. They're useful, but will never give us satisfaction or happiness, even the satisfaction we get is temporary, because what gives you happiness will also give you sadness. So if you just allow all these external circumstances to control you then it doesn't matter whether you live fast or slow, you will be controlled by circumstances."<br><br>The two-day international conference is the seventh in the series, aimed at allowing followers to interact with the best minds in Zen teaching. - CNA /ch<br><br>Copyright Â© 2005 MCN International Pte Ltd</div>
