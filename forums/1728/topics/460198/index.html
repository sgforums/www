              <p>I'm no scholar on these things but this is my understanding.</p>
              <p>Loppon Malcolm, "The problem with shentong, which CHNN has addressed many times, is that in 
              Dzogchen the result exists as a potentiality of the basis; but in Shenton it is 
              fully formed at all times. For this reason, in several retreats ChNN has 
              declared that shentong is incompatible with Dzogchen."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Dzogchen the result exists as a potentiality of the basis along with secondary conditions as part of lhun grub or unafflicted dependent origination. This means the result (buddha's qualities) arises as one of the possible appearance of wisdom. But it is nothing inherently existing anywhere, merely manifest when conditions are there. It is in the form of actualizing buddha nature through conditions. "in Shenton it is fully formed at all times." - The buddha qualities in Shentong are inherently existing in ourselves, so there is no need for any conditions and it is only a matter of discovering something inherent. This teaching does not factor conditionality in terms of result and may have a danger of falling into a view ot true existence/inherency. That means the luminosity aspect may be reified into something that truly exists, that is one of the dangers. While non-shentong teachings of madhyamika may have a tendency towards nihilism if wrongly interpreted.</p>
              <p>So when we understand the principle of potentiality, this means nothing exists in and of itself, the basis is empty of any inherent existence but has limitless potential that manifests according to conditions.</p>
              <p>Something I wrote before: "Buddha-nature is this total exertion, it is not a hidden noumenon or a latent thing that ‘produces’ the myriad things, nor is it something that truly exists hidden waiting to be discovered – that is a mere dead image we form about Buddha-nature that has come to past.<br><br>It is the entire universe of complete seamless interpenetration that is ‘exerting’ Buddha-nature in a completely dynamic, ever-advancing state of self-actualizing. We are not discovering Buddha-nature so much as to be actually “creating” it every moment. Or you can say we are simultaneously discovering, renewing, creating, and casting-off Buddha-nature every moment (yet this Birth and Death IS precisely No-Birth and No-Death)."</p>

              <div>"So in D, what is the relationship between mind and rigpa"</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>Mind is the same as it is in prasanga madhyamaka, completely 
              dependently originated and forming through the same process that everything 
              apparently existent arises from (the 12 nidanas). Mind is called sems in 
              dzogchen and is the driving force behind samsaric (afflicted) 
              proliferation.</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>Rigpa is knowledge of the nature of mind, the nature of mind is the 
              nonduality of the mind's essence (emptiness) and nature (clarity). All 
              dependently originated. Rigpa is equivalent to enlightenment in the classical 
              sutras, it's 100% empty and illusory. Everything is illusory in dzogchen.</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>"and awareness and emptiness?"</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>The term awareness is used alot in d-word translations, and the 
              translations do have the potentiality to convey a very advaita like feel to the 
              teaching when they're merely read at face value. There's also buddhist dzogchen 
              and Bon dzogchen, the bon dzogchen tends to be somewhat more essentialist since 
              it doesn't have a buddhist foundation and it also claims that the dzogchen view 
              of emptiness and the buddhist view of emptiness are different, buddhist 
              dzogchenpas disagree. But overall awareness is also dependently originated and 
              therefore illusory and unestablished.</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>Emptiness is the same, everything that appears is empty. There is 
              however afflicted dependent origination and unafflicted dependent origination. 
              Afflicted dependent origination is appearance which is product of ignorance 
              (ma-rigpa) and unafflicted dependent origination is lhun-grub or the natural 
              formation of the basis.</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>Malcom wrote:</div>
              <div>" The basis in Dzogchen is completely free of affliction, it therefore 
              is not something which ever participates in afflicted dependent origination. 
              Unafflicted causality in Dzogchen is described as lhun grub, natural formation. 
              However, since there is causality in the basis, it also must be empty since the 
              manner in which the basis arises from the basis is described as "when this 
              occurs, this arises" and so on. The only reasons why this can happen is because 
              the basis is also completely empty and illusory. It is not something real or 
              ultimate, or truly existent in a definitive sense. If it were, Dzogchen would be 
              no different than Advaita, etc. If the basis were truly real, ulimate or 
              existent, there could be no processess in the basis, Samantabhadra would have no 
              opportunity to recognize his own state and wake up and we sentient beings would 
              have never become deluded. So, even though we do not refer to the basis as 
              dependently originated, natural formation can be understood to underlie 
              dependent origination; in other words, whatever is dependently originated forms 
              naturally. Lhun grub after all simply and only means "sus ma byas", not made by 
              anyone.</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>Rigpa is not a phenomena, it is not a thing, per se. It is one's 
              knowledge of the basis. Since it is never deluded, it never participates in 
              affliction, therefore, it is excluded from afflicted dependent orgination. 
              However, one can regard it as the beginning of unafflicted dependent 
              origination, and one would not be wrong i.e. the nidanas of samsara begin with 
              avidyÄ�; the nidanas of nirvana begin with vidyÄ� (rigpa)."</div>

              <div></div>
              <div>"Is it a synonym of awareness in those translations?"</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>Not at all, the term awareness is just pointing to the fact of present 
              wakefulness.</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>"Pragmatically, as Dzogchen is taught on the ground, what aspect does 
              the lion's share of the soteriological work?"</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>This is the part that really defines dzogchen, the aspect that does the 
              lion's share of the work is the fact that dzogchen is precisely the knowledge of 
              the natural state (rigpa) and is therefore enlightenment itself. So it's not a 
              causal vehicle that really incorporates 'work' because the basis, path and fruit 
              are all simultaneously accomplished. The teacher points out the natural state, 
              and the student either recognizes it or doesn't. If it's not recognized then 
              there are teachings which aid in discovering that aspect, but the teachings 
              themselves aren't dzogchen, dzogchen is only the experience and is therefore 
              actually indescribable (though much describing happens naturally!)</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>"Does Kagyu teach Dzogchen?"</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>I'm pretty sure Kagyu focuses on mahamudra, and they actually tend to 
              subordinate dzogchen as just another means no different than mahamudra, when 
              there are big differences.</div>
              <div>Also the Kagyupas (being that they focus on mahamudra) designate 
              thoughts and emotions as the dharmakaya, and dzogchen does not.</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>"What is the difference between Dzogchen and Mahamudra?"</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>Mahamudra and dzogchen are different methods and therefore end up being 
              different paths. Mahamudra considers the basis (nature of mind) to be the 
              kun-gzhi or alaya, which is the emptiness and clarity of the mind. In dzogchen 
              the kun-gzhi is considered to be the basis of affliction (ignorance) and the 
              basis (gzhi) in dzogchen has nothing to do with the mind. I recently attended a 
              teaching by a guy named Keith Dowman and he was also teaching that the nature of 
              mind was the kun-gzhi, I asked him what the difference is between the kun-gzhi 
              and the gzhi and he said that it has to do with further refinement 
              "purification" and release of subtle traces, but he said for now during that 
              talk there was no need to get into that (being that the crowd in general had 
              some people who were actually just learning of dzogchen for the first 
              time).</div>

              much and answer all my picky questions! I get a much different impression of 
              this approach now. I like where you say, "Everything is illusory in dzogchen."
