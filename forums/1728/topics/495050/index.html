              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Life in Luang Prabang's slow lane</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">November 08, Pattarawadee Saengmanee The Nation </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The ancient royal capital of Laos requires much more than a
              weekend to explore its charms </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">RECOGNISING THE potential for border trade along the Mekong
              River, sharp-eyed Chinese entrepreneurs have flooded into Laos in recent years
              pouring billions into mega infrastructure projects as well as luxury hotels and
              shopping malls. Fortunately, though, they have left the ancient royal capital
              of Luang Prabang relatively untouched and the town has succeeded in retaining
              its glorious cultural heritage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Sitting at the confluence of the Mekong and Khan rivers,
              Luang Prabang has long been a popular holiday destination. Tourists from all over
              the world come here to drink in the French colonial architecture and enjoy a
              slower pace of life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It’s a short hop by air from Chiang Mai to Luang Prabang and
              an hour after taking off, we arrive in the Unesco heritage town just in time to
              admire the romantic sunset from the top of Mount Phousi.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Although a mere 100 metres above sea level, climbing the 355
              steps along a narrow stairway is hard going, especially as we have local young
              joggers and foreign tourists snapping at our heels.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We take the easy way out and stop halfway up at Wat Tham
              Phousi, a small cave temple housing several Buddha images in different
              postures, enshrined in both the interior hall and on open patios along the
              sides. Practicality meets spirituality with a drinks stall providing some
              much-needed refreshment. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">On top of the hill is a narrow platform with a small Buddhist
              pagoda and a seven-tiered parasol called That Chomsi that was constructed in
              1804 during the reign of King Anourouth. And when the sky is clear, visitors
              are rewarded with a beautiful sunset and spectacular panoramic views of Luang
              Prabang surrounded by lush forests and the Mekong and Nam Khan rivers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Going down is a little easier and we are soon in the midst of
              the much-loved night market at the foot of Phousi Hill, which spreads from Wat
              Mai all along Sisavangvong Road. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Every night from 5 to 10pm, hundreds of hilltribe and lowland
              vendors set up shop with an eye-catching collection of Hmong-style costumes,
              handicrafts and souvenirs, ranging from indigo-dyed woven scarves,
              Laotian-style hand-embroidered skirts, embroidered bags and bedspreads, pop-up
              postcards, paintings and local herbal spirits. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Hungry shoppers can walk to the end of the market, where a
              cluster of old Colonial-style shophouses have been transformed into
              restaurants, bars, cafes and boutique hotels, serving a variety of local and
              international delicacies, sweets and drinks. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The next day starts early for us and at 5.30 we join the
              daily ritual of alms-giving to 100 saffron-clad monks. Local residents wait in
              front of their houses or the monasteries, the women clad in the local sin
              (sarong) with a scarf across their left shoulder. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Unlike in Thailand, pilgrims are allowed to sit on a mat or
              stool and use their hands to scoop up balls of sticky rice one by one.
              Tradition has it that only sticky rice is offered rather than steamed rice
              along with some ready-to-eat dishes. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A short walk from Wat Mai, we reach a narrow alley off
              Sisavangvong Road that is home to Luang Prabang’s biggest morning market. Here
              too hundreds of local vendors are selling fresh organic vegetables, herbs and
              meat. We stop to admire, though not buy, the orange crabs, still-croaking
              frogs, beehives oozing honey, river weed and insects before stopping for a
              hearty breakfast of curry infused with pla ra (fermented fish sauce), Lao
              sausage, spicy fried chicken in red curry, kanom krok (Lao coconut pudding) and
              grilled sticky rice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Appetites sated, we board a ferry to the famous Pak Ou Caves
              that sit at the confluence of the Mekong and Ou rivers. Our cruise takes one
              hour and 45 minutes and offers an amazing view of lush mountains, temples and
              fishing villages as well as parts of the high-speed railway from China to the
              Mekong River, which is expected to be complete in 2021.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The two natural grottoes – Tham Ting (lower cave) and the
              Tham Theung (upper cave) – have been considered sacred since King
              Setthathirath, who moved the capital from Luang Prabang to Vientiane 450 years
              ago, enshrined the first carved wood Buddha images there in the 16th century. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Believing that 15 Nagas lived in the estuary to protect the
              kingdom, the king would visit this cave during the Lao New Year to wash the
              Buddha images. Today, the caves are home to a small gilded pagoda and 2,500
              Buddha images, most of them donated by local residents.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We climb the 250 steps to the upper cave, where we are
              greeted by a pair of stone lions standing guard over the entrance. Using our
              phones as torches, we go deep into the dark tunnel and soon discover a host of
              gold Buddha images in different postures and sizes and walls covered with faded
              gold murals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Back in town later that day, we visit Wat Xieng Thong. Built
              on the bank of the Mekong River by King Setthathirath in 1560, it is known for
              its beautiful sim (ubosot), home to a reclining Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Inside, the walls are adorned with elaborate gold murals on a
              background of black and red lacquer depicting the heavens where the Lord Buddha
              and deities live and hell, where sinners are receiving punishments. There are
              also some familiar scenes from the Jakata tales and motifs of flowers and
              animals on view. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The temple is also home to a Chariot Hall built in 1962 to
              contain the funeral carriage of King Sisavang Vong who died in 1959. It
              features eye-catching carved and gilded teak wood panels capturing scenes from
              the Phra Lak Phra Lam, the Lao version of the Ramayana epic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Another must-visit attraction is the Royal Palace Museum.
              Built in 1904 after the sacking of the city by the Black Flag Army, the complex
              served as the residence of King Sisavang Vong and the royal family. In 1975,
              the Laos monarchy came to an end and one year later the palace was converted
              into the National Museum.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Home to a rare collection of artefacts and historical
              documents, the compound features the King’s reception room decorated with
              paintings of daily life in Luang Prabang in the 1930s and the main reception
              hall boasting the throne of King Sisavang Vatthana . The private zone comprises
              two French-style bedrooms, a living room and dining space decorated with
              original furniture and precious souvenirs from several countries, including
              stationery with gold stencils on black lacquer from China and ceramic vases
              from Japan.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Palace complex also houses Hor Prabang (Prabang Temple)
              built in 1969 by King Sisavang Vatthana. It shelters a sacred Prabang Buddha
              image, cast in Sri Lanka, a gift from King Fa Ngum of the Khmer Kingdom.</span></p>
