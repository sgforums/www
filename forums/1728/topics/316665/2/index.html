              <p>That was Devadatta. He already became a monk and a disciple when he wanted to kill him. He was already part of the Sangha, and wanted to cause schism, kill the Buddha, and so on.</p>
              <p>He finally succeeded in hurting the Buddha but failed to kill him (Buddhas cannot be killed). He also failed his attempt to cause schism in the sangha. For these karma he was going to enter Avici hell (the 'lowest' hell, the hell with the most sufferings and timespan)</p>
              <p>But the Buddha allowed him to become a monk because he knew that the merits accumulated through the practice of jhanas (which he mastered) will cause him to attain Pratyekabuddhahood a long long time after he finished his karma in avici hell. If he didnt let him into the sangha, he would not have that opportunity.</p>

              <p>i remember a story about nagarjuna ,someone want to kill him ,but he know he can't do  that ,because nagarjuna got magics.So he figured a way out.Someday he met nagarjuna ,and say ,"can u give me ur head".This is a dilemma,if nagarjuna still care about live and death ,he is not awaken,He can humiliate him,if he drop off everything, He can kill him.</p>
              <p>And the story ends like nagarjuna kill himself</p>

              <p>The path of laymen and the path of the sangha/practioner is different, first we must accept that. The Buddha said it clearly that laymen should try to practice the 5 precepts to accumulate better karma and reborn in a better place next life. Buddha however, did not insist laymen to strive for nirvana, but only to the sangha. Buddha knew that we are all human and abstaining from desires, hatred and igorance is already not an easy task. By following the 5 precepts, we may in hope reduce the desires, hatred and ignorance we previously had. Buddha also knew that the path of spiritual is not easy, and that what laymen can do at least is to do good and avoid evil. Thats generally the rule.</p>
              <p>But for practioners, it is a more strict rule. This path is for people who are determined to strive for nirvana. It involves the giving up of desires and passions etc.</p>

              <p>the 5 precepts to laymen are really harsh.I don't think laymen can adhere to it fully,sutras is more usefull to who want to abstain from delusion and hatre,buddhism is not tell u cannot do sth,but make u reveal to ur Anattman,and u do'nt want to do bad things.</p>

              <p><br>Actually the 5 precept is not really that harsh to me. However, there is no easy path. Even christianity is not easy. If any religion is easy, then the one is not practising it. The standard of 5 precepts depend on each person's intepretation.</p>
              <p>5 precepts:</p>
              <p>1) no killing(intentionally) - this can be done if we open a compassionate heart and try not to harm animals or kill insects and so on. If killing is inevitable, we must repent.</p>
              <p>2) no stealing - theres no reason why we shld still anything..becos' we shld work hard to get what we want and not steal. Stealing will cause one to face the law anyway.</p>
              <p>3)abstain from sexual misconduct - this is the most difficult to define, due to different views among buddhis traditions. However the main basic idea is to be faithful to one's life partner and dont create adultary. Sexual misconduct should not be viewed as a sin( 'sin' is a christian context) but bad karma, because it breaks up relationship and so on.</p>
              <p>4) no lying - this is sometimes quite difficult, especially white lies. This is something all of us must learn. However if lying is inevitable, we must repent.</p>
              <p>5) no intoxicated drinks and drugs - science has already proven that intoxicated drinks and drugs is bad for health and ruins people's life. Therefore since we know the harmful effects, it would be unwise for us to consume it anymore. They will only cause suffering to our physical body.</p>

              <p>yup, i think 3 .4 .5 are very difficult to follow.No lying ,yup ,i have to say white lies,somehow sometime.But i think it's an expedient way to make life easy.Buddhism also teach expedient.I think the lye we should oppose is the one u do with evil intentions.</p>
              <p>intoxicated drinks is hard to avoid also ,if u r in the industry.When talking about business,seems it's quite often need some alcohole.</p>
