              <p>As long as they are faithful partners and are faithful to each other (do not have relationship or casual sex outside), then that's fine. Some people did not get married but nevertheless remain faithful to each other for life. But casual sex between friends or strangers is <strong>not </strong>fine.</p>
              <p>Marriage is only a social and cultural norm, the Buddha never demands people married, he is only concerned whether you are faithful to your partner. Perhaps, marriage may not even exist for some cultures. So what is important is not 'marriage' but 'faithfulness'.</p>

              <p>If young ppl get into BGR they should avoid sex for practical reasons -- not to get pregnant, they're still studying, they may not stay together for long. They are not ready to start a family yet. Always be mindful that abortion is killing and be responsible for both your child and your karma. Use contraception whenever necessary.</p>
              <p>So it's not that sex is inherently wrong without marriage, with or without marriage is only a social and cultural behavior. What is important is to use wisdom, and of course, be moral -- i.e. be faithful to your partner and not have extramarital affairs.</p>

              <p><br>Buddha is not particularly concerned with the specifics and 'official' marriage, he is only concerned about the quality of a true relationship. He never mentioned about marriage in his teachings. All these differs from culture to culture and the traditions of the people.</p>

              <p>30. "In five ways should a wife as the western direction be

              <p>"And, the wife so respected reciprocates with compassion in five
                  ways:<strong> by being well-organized, being kindly disposed to the in-laws and
                  household workers, being faithful, looking after the household goods,

              <p><br>Don't worry, still can marry.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Undesirable sexual behaviours are quite broad, so after understanding more, as  Buddhists, we should slowly eliminated them one by one according to our abilities and circumtances. The first few examples of undesirable conducts are easy to indentify and be given up easily and naturally. I think you are more concern of sexual behaviours between a truly loving couple.</p>
              <p>What JiKiat said is very true. So I think even sexual behaviour between married couple should not be overly excessive. One reason is that does such behaviour really neccessary for relationship bonding? Or has it more to do with sexual gratifications for oneself? I think once we are clear of this, we will know what to do naturally, no worries. Just like eating meat, we can chose to eat less or give up totally, or don't care at all. But  i do agree that our partner play a big role in achieving the way of life we want to lead. So, chose your life partner carefully, don't cohabitat so fast.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Of cos, normally, a married couple would like to have children of their own, in this case sexual intimacy is neccessary for procreation purposes. But I think after our 'quota 'of kids have been achieved, and/or both partners have come to a certain age ( sorry, just my opinion, I feel married or unmarried senior folks should not indulge in this anymore, but spend more time and resources on wisdom building<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png">),  we should understand that sexual conducts are just that: sexual activities. Such pleasure attachments should be drop if possible.</p>

              <p>If young ppl get into BGR they should avoid sex for practical reasons -- not to get pregnant, they're still studying, they may not stay together for long. They are not ready to start a family yet. Always be mindful that abortion is killing and be responsible for both your child and your karma. Use contraception whenever necessary.</p>
              <p>So it's not that sex is inherently wrong without marriage, with or without marriage is only a social and cultural behavior. What is important is to use wisdom, and of course, be moral -- i.e. be faithful to your partner and not have extramarital affairs.</p>

              <p>pre marriage sex is regarded as a moral conduct.And before marriage we all say beauty words to each other,but in fact there is no bound for the two.After marriage ,at least there is a form called law to protect this relationship.So in asian, ppl try to restrict pre marriage sex.</p>

              <p>Marriage is just a formality and as you said a 'legal bond', and the culture of marriage differs from places. Some partners stay faithful to each other without marriage and I think that's perfectly fine. On the other hand some people are married but yet do not stay faithful to each other.</p>
              <p>What's important is 'faithfulness' so of course one must be committed to the other. Marriage is a way to stay committed so it is preferable for most people and there are benefits from it. But I don't think it's a 'must'.</p>
              <p>As for pre-marital sex, it should be avoided if one knows that the relationship will not last or one is still not sure. Also, as I said earlier, one must be ready to raise a family. If one becomes pregnant and thinks of abortion, that is being irresponsible.</p>

              <p>i feel that most ppl who don't want to get married ,is because they don't want to fulfill responsbility,without marriage ,u can suddenly broke up with ur gf ,bf.If a man don't want to marry his girl ,i don't know the reason,is it because he is not sure about the relationship?faithfulness is important,but with marriage ,it's secured.I think there r some section in law punish the unloyal wife or husband.<br>Most country encourage marriage,because it guaranty the relationship.And marriage is a form ,that ur relationship is protected by law.And i don't see the differring culture of marriage,family is basic union of society,as long as every family is harmony,society will be harmony,and steady.with the family ppl will not do extreme things,that's an important factor about family or marriage</p>
