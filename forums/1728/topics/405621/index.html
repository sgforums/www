              <p>However the Shurangama Sutra is a Chinese Mahayana-Only sutra that didn't appear until over 1000+ years after the Buddha's passing. I should add that I do not doubt that this is an authentic Mahayana Sutra in the same way I do not doubt that Lankavatara Sutra or Heart Sutra or Diamond Sutra is authentic - Shurangama Sutra is one of my favourites because there are some deep and profound meditative wisdom coming from direct insight, but it is not fair to judge others based on what is said above, simply because if this sutra only appeared 1000+ years after the Buddha's passing instead of being taught by the historical appearance of Buddha, then what about all the others who ate meat prior to that because this sutra did not appear yet? Then what about the non-Chinese-Mahayana schools who continue to eat meat and do not emphasize on vegetarianism? All Mahayana (along with Tibetan/Vajrayana) sutras and tantras (see <a href="/forums/1728/topics/378306">Are Mahayana Sutras Taught by Buddha?</a>), due to its length and style which are clearly not from the historical Buddha in the historical times (the Pali Canon), are clearly recorded as the visions of great masters of the Sambhogakaya manifestation of Buddha imparting them these Mahayana teachings hundreds of years after the passing of the historical Buddha. They only appear much later.They are revealed teachings at a latter time and arose in reaction to certain trends/situation. It may not apply to everyone. But of course those who did have the merits to read this sutra should follow their advice seriously.</p>
              <p>Tibetans and Theravadins do not have this sutra and their monks continue eating meat. There is no rules in the precepts that forbid eating meat - and when Devadatta tried to introduce compulsory vegetarianism into Buddhism, the Lord Buddha himself outright rejected it. Therefore we must not force it on other Buddhists, lest we become Devadatta.</p>
              <p>Even Dalai Lama eats meat. Many great and famous lamas and rinpoches still eat meat. Also, think of any great Theravada monks: Ven Mahasi Sayadaw, Ajahn Sumedho, Ajahn Chah, Ajahn Brahm, Ajahn Maha Boowa, and all the other sayadaws, ajahns, etc - they all eat meat based on alms. All these great masters are known to have entered true samadhi and awareness. We should not pre-judge these great masters (and create very bad karma for ourselves) simply based on things like vegetarianism: instead we must judge solely on the criteria of their wisdom and insights.</p>
              <p>Therefore we must not judge a master by their eating/not-eating meat. But the sutra is good in encouraging people to take up vegetarianism. I think the basis we should take up vegetarian is to practice compassion and bodhicitta.</p>

              <p>Some additions:</p>
              <p>1. The Dalai Lama tried very hard to be vegetarian to the detriment of his health in the past, now he tries to be vegetarian half the time. From what i've read last.</p>
              <p>2.  Many of the greatest Tibetan Lamas are vegetarian. Like Drubwang Rinpoche who came to Singapore, Chatral Rinpoche, Pema Dudul who attained rainbow body in recent history.  Pema Dudul had a vision of Chenrezig (or Guan Yin) in particular who rebuked him for taking meat when he was supposed to be practising compassion and Chenrezig then showed him the consequences of taking meat (some kind of hell).</p>
              <p>3. The climate constraint is a huge factor for Tibetan lamas in their dietary choice. Anyway, i think that is already covered in the sutra extract above.</p>
              <p>I am mentioning these points because i don't feel good that Tibetan lamas are constantly referred to as examples of Buddhist meat-eaters...</p>

                                                          half the time. From what i've read last.</p>
              <p>2.  Many of the greatest Tibetan Lamas are vegetarian. Like
                                                          Drubwang Rinpoche who came to Singapore, Chatral Rinpoche, Pema
                                                          Dudul who attained rainbow body in recent history.  Pema Dudul
                                                          had a vision of Chenrezig (or Guan Yin) in particular who
                                                          rebuked him for taking meat when he was supposed to be practising
                                                          compassion and Chenrezig then showed him the consequences of taking
                                                          meat (some kind of hell).</p>

              <p>If this is the case, why didn't the Buddha state unambiguously to his monks and why isn't this clearly stated in Pali suttas (that after the Buddha enters parinirvana, monks and lay persons should not eat meat anymore)? Why aren't Theravadin monks vegetarian?</p>
              <p>I'd say this is a revealed teaching when Mahayana Buddhism arose - only when the conditions for the spread of Mahayana started. All Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings are only revealed hundreds (or more than a thousand) years after Buddha's parinirvana. To be precise, this sutra is translated from sanskrit and appeared 1200 years in the Chinese canon after the Buddha's passing away, and not in any other canons (either Tibetan or Theravada). Vegetarianism started and is taught in the various Mahayana sutras during a period where the conditions to teach great compassion and bodhisattva ideals arose.</p>
              <p>The way it is phrased in the sutra (including calling them raksashas, etc) is simply to showcase Buddha's admonition of meat eating (much like saying 'you are lazy like a pig', 'cunning like a fox') and not to be taken literally - would you say that those great Theravadin (and some Vajrayana) masters who eat meat are literally raksashas from their past lives, etc, I think it would be ridiculous to make such claims. A verbal admonition of a certain practice through derogotary terms should not be seen as  anything more than that.</p>
              <p>Most of all we musn't ourselves criticize those Arhats who continue to eat meat - and even though in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana sutra the Buddha is said to admonished arhants as having 'spoilt roots', this criticism is not meant for us to make. Only the Buddha is entitled to say something like that. For us, if we meet an arhant, we must pay our utmost respect and offerings, much less calling them spoilt roots and raksashas etc.</p>
              <p>In conclusion: take the advice of the sutra for your <strong>own </strong>practice, but do not use it to judge others.</p>

              <p>What you said is right. But it's not just that Buddha did not 'make it compulsory'. In the Theravadin tradition (the most original tradition of Buddhism), the monks cannot even <em>choose</em> to be vegetarian even if they wanted to, it is not about it being not compulsory. They have to eat whatever they are given. Their texts suggest they should simply eat whatever they are given without preferences like eating medicine (unless they are spoilt, poisonous, etc).</p>
              <p>Therefore I suggest that vegetarianism is a practice that is specific only to the Chinese Mahayana tradition (and some Vajrayana masters/monks practice this as well, but not all). We should not impose it on others. But other traditions and even non-Buddhists are welcomed to follow this teaching, it will be good.</p>

              <p>You're right. In the Theravadin tradition, Dispassion (non-craving, objectivity) towards the senses is most highly valued and emphasized.</p>
              <p>Compassion, in addition to just mere dispassion, is taking a more prominent role later in the development of Mahayana Buddhism.</p>

              <p>You read Ven Hsuan Hua's commentaries too?  I find him to
              be excellent, reading his stuff has helped and inspired me alot on
              the path...  and his level of accomplishment is very very
              high.</p>

              <p>Yes, I read Ven Hsuan Hua's commentaries and dharma talks and found it very straight forward, pointing out our faults - like keeping the precepts, talking too much, watching tv and idle in front of the computer, eating too much etc. Read the Shurangama Sutra last time without commentary, it was not that easy to understand, but with the commentary it really helps a lot. It's just that the Sutras with his commentaries are not easy to find in Sg.<br>I also like ven master <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guang_Qin">Guang Qin</a>'s quotes, very simple and straight forward.</p>
