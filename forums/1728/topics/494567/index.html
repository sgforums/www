              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">Crisis on the Roof of the
              World</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">John DeMont| August 16,
              2017 Lion’s Roar</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              repression, surveillance, and propaganda are Orwellian. Chinese money,
              immigrants, and tourists are pouring in. The fight to control religion is
              heating up. John Demont reports that China’s long term campaign to assimilate
              Tibet has entered a critical new stage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              was understandable skepticism last March when Chinese state broadcaster CCTV
              declared Lhasa “the happiest city in China.” In 2008, after all, an estimated
              140 people had died in protests in the Tibetan capital on the forty-ninth
              anniversary of the revolt against the Chinese takeover. Since then, 148 monks,
              nuns, and lay Tibetans—as well as eight Tibetans in exile—have set themselves
              aflame to protest Chinese rule over their homeland.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              cheery poll also contrasted sharply with the news that Freedom House, in its
              annual “Freedom in the World” report, ranked Tibet the second-worst place in
              the world for political rights and civil liberties. Number one was Syria.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              propaganda goes, the government-sanctioned poll seemed woefully transparent.
              Yet, it said something telling about Beijing’s current strategy for expanding
              its mastery over Tibetan life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Their
              approach has become more sophisticated,” concedes Penpa Tsering, the North
              American representative of the Tibetan government-in-exile. Even if China’s
              ultimate aim remains the same: “To assimilate or exterminate the Tibetans, as a
              geopolitical necessity,” says Robert Thurman, professor of Indo-Tibetan
              Buddhist Studies at Columbia University and President of Tibet House U.S.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              an objective that hasn’t really changed since 1951, when Mao Tse-Tung’s armies
              invaded Tibet. China had long claimed sovereignty over Tibet; now the
              Communists added the additional rationale of liberating it from its old,
              semi-feudal ways.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Today,
              Tibet is a vital part of the Chinese empire, geopolitically and economically.
              It serves as a buffer zone between China on one side and India, Nepal, and
              Bangladesh on the other. It is a crucial source of fresh water for China’s
              billions. The riches beneath the Tibetan plateau—minerals such as copper, gold,
              iron, mercury, uranium, and zinc, along with oil, natural gas, and coal—power
              China’s cities, factories, and exploding economy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">China’s
              grip over Tibet has tightened, loosened, and tightened again over the decades.
              Today, Tibet suffers a level of oppression “unprecedented since the Cultural
              Revolution,” says Robert Barnett, director of the Modern Tibetan Studies
              Program at Columbia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              addition to the traditional tools of Chinese suppression—soldiers routinely
              unleashed on peaceful protestors, unprovoked arrests and detentions,
              nightmarish re-education camps—Tibetans today face an even greater military
              presence and an increasingly Orwellian level of security and surveillance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              upshot, according to Human Rights Watch, is “diminishing tolerance by
              authorities for forms of expression and assembly… (which) has led authorities
              to expand the range of activities and issues targeted for repression in Tibetan
              areas, particularly in the countryside.” There, as in the cities, the Chinese
              authorities hope to nip opposition in the bud.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Examples
              of this approach, which Barnett calls a sophisticated “management” of dissent,
              abound. By targeting their families for persecution, China has curtailed the
              activities of activists and dissenters. Threats of severe punishment for
              families of Tibetans who light themselves on fire have slowed the number of
              self-immolations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Three
              years ago, China instituted a “Grid Management” surveillance system, installing
              hundreds of police booths on residential streets. The system is designed to
              manage Tibetan society “without gaps, without blind spots, without blanks,” in
              the words of state media.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the same period, reports Human Rights Watch, some 21,000 government officials
              have been transferred to villages and monasteries throughout the Tibet
              Autonomous Region (TAR). Thousands of additional police have been deployed in
              Tibetan communities, where the “double-linked households system” requires that
              party personnel befriend and guide families to adopt Chinese Communist Party
              orthodoxy and better themselves economically.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Consequently,
              there has been a surge in the creation of local Communist Party organizations,
              government offices, police posts, security patrols, and political organizations,
              all designed to keep a watchful eye on the Tibetan population. The impact has
              been dramatic: in the past, most political prisoners were Buddhist nuns and
              monks. Now, the persecuted are as likely to be local community leaders,
              environmental activists, artists, or just ordinary villagers going about their
              lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Surveillance
              is at an all-time high,” says Tencho Gyatso, director of Tibetan Empowerment
              &amp; Chinese Engagement Programs at the International Campaign for Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              is hardly what the Dalai Lama has in mind when he proposes a “middle way” to
              secure his people’s freedom—autonomy within China that protects Tibetans
              culture, religion, and national identity. The reality today is the opposite:
              cultural and religious self-expression is increasingly suppressed in a society
              where government cameras and plain-clothes police watch over monasteries and
              public squares, and where scrutiny of Internet and mobile phone use is
              widespread.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Escaping
              the Chinese government’s unrelenting propaganda campaign is equally difficult.
              “Tibet,” says Burnett, “is a propaganda state with a heavy military garrison as
              its backup.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Old
              Tibet,” the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) wrote in a 2015 white paper, was
              “savage, cruel, and backward, like the dark society of medieval Europe” before
              the communists embarked on a “peaceful liberation” of the region. Now the CCP
              wants the world to believe that its rule has propelled Tibet from the darkness
              into the light.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mostly,
              the propaganda campaign focuses on China’s expansive plan to develop the
              economy and purportedly improve the standard of living for Tibetans. Since
              Tibet’s annexation, the Chinese government has spent an estimated $100 billion
              in the region, mostly on roads, train lines, bridges, airports, and other
              infrastructure.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Along
              with the money have come people. The Chinese authorities claim that Tibet’s Han
              population numbers some 245,000, a figure that critics call laughably
              understated. Han Chinese, both tourists and residents, have been pouring into
              Tibet since the first high-speed train line to Lhasa opened in 2006. The
              numbers are expected to soar in the future as new high-speed rail lines come on
              stream.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              it is, the official Chinese media has reported that 21 million tourists, almost
              all of them from China, visited Tibet in the first three quarters of 2016,
              compared to fewer than three million indigenous Tibetans. The government’s
              tourism strategy emphasizes secular elements in Tibetan culture and “red
              tourism”—the marketing of sites with revolutionary significance for the Chinese
              Communist Party.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Critics
              say that little of this spending is making it into the pockets of ordinary
              Tibetans. The nascent tourism industry and most of the services in the
              fast-growing cities are controlled by Han Chinese. Most construction material is
              imported from China. Overall, most of the new jobs go to Chinese immigrants,
              who now make up 22 percent of the population of Lhasa.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“It’s
              all a show, a facade, a house of cards,” says Tencho Gyatso about the economic
              development plan. “It is not there to sustain what is important to Tibetans.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Instead,
              she and others argue that the influx of money and Han Chinese immigrants is
              marginalizing Tibetans in their own country—and making Chinese assimilation
              harder to resist. Forced resettlement and natural migration patterns are
              uprooting hundreds of thousands of rural Tibetans and moving them into the
              growing cities, which will soon be dominated by ethnic Chinese, according to
              the Tibet Policy Institute.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“In
              another 40 or 50 years,” concludes Penpa Tsering, “we could have a Tibet with a
              Han majority population.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              drive for economic development is also damaging Tibet’s fragile environment.
              The urbanization push means rural pastureland is disappearing. Tibet’s rivers—a
              critical resource for more than 1.3 billion people in the world’s ten most
              densely populated nations—are being dammed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Tibetan plateau is heating up three times as fast as the global average, and as
              a result, glaciers are melting at a rate of seven percent annually, causing
              massive landslides. At this speed, according to Lobsang Sangay, prime minister
              of Tibet’s government-in-exile, two-thirds of the 46,000 glaciers on the
              Tibetan plateau—the largest concentration of ice on the planet after the North
              and South poles—will be gone by 2050, leading to a release of carbon that will
              have a catastrophic impact on global climate change.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tibet’s
              culture is no less under attack. In one glaring example, China has sharply
              scaled back the teaching of the Tibetan language as part of its push to
              encourage the assimilation of Tibetans into the dominant Han culture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              assault on Tibetan Buddhism, which the Dalai Lama characterizes as “cultural
              genocide,” is far broader. The famed Potala Palace in Lhasa, traditional seat
              of the Dalai Lamas, has been turned into a tourist museum with secular guards.
              Buddhist monasteries are strictly controlled. Thousands of buildings have been
              demolished and monastics displaced at Larung Gar and Yachen Gar, two of the
              largest and most important centers of Buddhist learning in Tibet over which
              China has now assumed control.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              campaign to demonize the Dalai Lama personally is equally relentless. His
              Holiness, who fled Tibet after the abortive uprising in 1959, is derided by
              Chinese officials as a “wolf in monk’s robes” and a “splitist” intent on
              separating Tibet from its Chinese motherland. His followers are belittled as
              the “Dalai Lama clique.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Foreign
              leaders who meet with the Dalai Lama earn Beijing’s scorn, a worrisome prospect
              given China’s economic power. Many decline to meet with him at all, or hold
              only private meetings. The repercussions of supporting the Dalai Lama are many
              times greater inside Tibet, where merely possessing his image is punishable by
              years in jail. Earlier this year, Chinese authorities barred Tibetans—who in
              2016 received only a fraction of the foreign travel visas they were once
              granted—from travelling to the Dalai Lama’s Kalachakra teachings in India.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              central instrument in China’s strategy to curb the Dalai Lama’s global clout is
              the Chinese-appointed Panchen Lama, who is being groomed by the government as
              an alternative to His Holiness, who turns 83 this summer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              1995, the Dalai Lama had named a six-year-old Tibetan boy living in Tibet as
              the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, Tibet’s second most important religious
              figure. Three days later, the boy and his family were kidnapped by Chinese
              authorities and have never been seen or heard from again. In his place, the
              government installed the son of a pair of Communist Party members, who this
              year called on Tibetan Buddhist monks to love the Communist party.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              appointment of the fake Panchen Lama as a political tool is not working,” says
              Penpa Tsering of the government-in-exile. But China’s biggest power play is
              surely ahead.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              officially atheist government in Beijing has declared that it will find its own
              reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, which would help the CCP further solidify
              control over Tibet. In response, His Holiness has said that he will not be
              reincarnated in Chinese-controlled territory—“Reincarnation is not the business
              of the Communists,” he has said—and for that matter, may not be reincarnated at
              all, if that is the will of the Tibetan people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Whoever
              follows may never enjoy the geopolitical stature of Tenzin Gyatso, the
              Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who is venerated as both a secular and spiritual leader
              and has personally brought his people’s tragedy into the global consciousness.
              But there are other reasons why the “middle way” goal of cultural and religious
              autonomy for Tibet within China remains, in the eyes of many, as distant as
              ever.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tsering
              says that it is hard for the government-in-exile to move toward a diplomatic
              solution with a Chinese government that refuses to recognize, let along
              negotiate with, the democratically-elected administration. For other
              Tibet-watchers, the government-in-exile has erred strategically by focusing
              more on winning over the West than on trying to make headway with China. Even
              within the Tibetan diaspora, there is disagreement on the best way to advance
              the Tibetan cause, with some Tibetan exiles backing His Holiness’ notion of
              autonomy while others still call for rangzen, or full-blown independence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Robert
              Thurman, though, remains hopeful. The reason, perhaps surprisingly, is Xi
              Jinping, the man who runs China, in the view of the New York Times, “with a
              firmer hand than any leader since Mao Zedong.” The political pragmatist seems
              to have something of a fondness for Buddhism—at least compared to his
              predecessors.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              the Dalai Lama was a young man, he spent months in Beijing studying Chinese and
              Marxism. At the end of his studies, His Holiness presented a watch to one of
              the Chinese officials he’d spent time with— Xi Zhongxun, father of the current
              leader—who wore the gift for many years afterwards. Xi Jinping’s mother, a
              practicing Buddhist, was buried with full Tibetan Buddhist rites. His wife, a
              popular folk singer, is also a practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism in a country
              where interest in the faith is increasing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Family
              tradition” and “karma,” says Thurman, may sway Xi Jinping’s attitude toward
              Tibet. But geopolitical realities, more than anything, could be what push China
              towards a more accommodating approach. In the long run, China’s iron hand in
              Tibet will damage the giant’s ability to utilize its “soft power.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Xi
              Jinping is the first Chinese president who can feel the pulse of the world and
              realize that China has everything to gain by being a respected, powerful
              international player in a harmonious international system,” says Thurman.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So
              far, there have been few signs that Xi is willing to challenge the hard-line
              CCP leadership on the “Tibet question.” But Thurman thinks that an opening
              exists for Xi to adopt a “loose reins policy” regarding Tibet as the Chinese
              leader consolidates power in the coming years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              question is, how long can Tibet wait? At the last Kalachakra teaching, the
              Dalai Lama said, perhaps jokingly, that he could live another thirty years.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“His
              Holiness is convinced that his approach will work in the long run,” says
              Thurman. “He is just sick and tired of it being such a long, long run.”</span></p>
