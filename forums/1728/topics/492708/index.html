              funeral movement is starting to push for eco-conscious burials in natural
              environments, but it still distances the living from the dead. For city dwellers,
              architect Katrina Spade has come up with a surprising solution. Spade was
              studying architecture in a graduate program at the University of
              Massachusetts–Amherst when she learned about livestock composting from a
              friend, and wondered if she could apply the same process to humans. The
              sketches for that concept became her graduate thesis, and the beginnings of the</span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  letter-spacing: -.05pt;'> </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'><a style="color: inherit; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.439216); background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) 50%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) 50%); background-size: 2px 0.1em;  " href="http://www.urbandeathproject.org/"><span style=" letter-spacing: -.05pt;">Urban Death Project</span></a>.</span></p>

              calls this new process “re-composition.” It’s a “gentle” way to describe human
              composting without the association with garbage and food. Re-composition is
              about giving death a chance to re-grow into new life, and Spade imagines it
              taking place constantly, all around us, in facilities scattered across neighborhoods
              like library branches.</span></p>
              <p id="16bb" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Future
              families will bring the deceased, wrapped in a linen shroud, to a
              re-composition center, a building with a three-story center where the bodies
              are placed. The laying in of the body “[begins] the transformation,” Spade explains.
              The nitrogen rich bodies are laid on top of a pile of carbon-rich woodchips and
              sawdust and allowed to break down, creating a nutrient rich, soil-like
              substance. The heat released from the chemical reaction should kill common
              pathogens and extinguish any smells. With human bodies, there are a few more
              factors to work out, like how to decompose bones or teeth. After four to six
              weeks, the bodies (including the bones) break down and turn into about a cubic
              yard of compost, which can be used to plant memorial gardens or trees.</span></p>

              to Spade, in future re-composition centers, there will also be staff “trained
              in grieving deeper and in more participatory ways than we’re used to.” The
              death care staff signals a different kind of funeral practice, a more intimate
              relationship with death. They are trained to support families that want to have
              home funerals, for instance, where families help prepare the body for burial</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria Math","serif";  '> </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>—</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria Math","serif";  '> </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>washing

              be able to design a personal laying-in ceremony according to their faiths and
              preferences: “music, silence, candles, conversations, whatever works.”</span></p>

              are advocates within the funeral industry pushing for a more gracious, personal
              death, but, according to Nora Menkin, a funeral director at the Co-op Funeral
              Home of People’s Memorial in Seattle, Washington, (and a board advisor on the
              Urban Death Project), re-composition isn’t fully on the death industry’s radar
              yet.

              community of death care experts: “I think it’s a time that people are realizing
              that you don’t have to blindly follow what is traditional,” she says.</span></p>

              conventional funeral practices are mostly built around our discomforts around
              death. Instead of facing death as a natural process and talking about how to
              prepare for it, we avoid it until it is too late. We hire funeral directors to
              make important decisions and embalm bodies to hide signs of decay. We construct
              elaborate rituals, buy extravagant caskets, and build ornate vaults to shroud
              the inevitable process of decomposition. We hide grief behind ritual.</span></p>

              a 38-year-old architect from New Hampshire, was born to a family of doctors and
              aware of death from an early age. She grew up on a 13-acre farm, surrounded by
              lush, growing things and their decay. She remembers seeing the farm animals
              slaughtered, or learning when a patient of her parents died. Death was never
              taboo, and she wants to bring that openness about death to our cultural
              reality.</span></p>

              but making it a worldwide phenomenon still has its challenges. Re-composition
              has yet to become legal. It’s not illegal currently, per se; each state in the
              U.S. makes its own laws about disposition methods. Some states don’t have any
              restrictions, while others limit it to burial, cremation, or the donation of a
              body to science. Restricted states have been adding new methods to their
              approved lists, like alkaline hydrolysis, a kind of “green cremation,” so there
              is a precedent for re-composition, but legislation hurdles can still spring up.

              The other obstacle, of course, is in people’s minds, whether it’s coming to
              terms with the notion of multiple bodies stacked in one facility, or turning a

              integrating death into everyday life. It’s exactly what the UDP team is trying

              we’re all feeling for the state of the planet.” The UDP team hopes to finish
              the approval process with the city of Seattle by spring of 2017. After testing
              animal remains to make sure the system works, they’ll invite human volunteers

              believes that the more participatory death that the UDP encourages can be
              “healing and cathartic.” Adoptees of re-composition will be able to see that “we’re
              still treating this vessel that held a person once upon a time with dignity.”
              But this same involvement could turn some off, especially those who prefer
              death to happen behind closed doors. “We’re not advocating that everyone should
              go this way,” Menkin says. It’s just about having more choices: whether it’s
              the food we eat, the clothes we wear, or how we die.</span></p>

              <p>I think one of the main problems for human decomposition is human density vs rate of decomposition. There maybe simply to many of us, that's why cremation is the fastest and the funerary urn is quite some compare to a burial plot. </p>
              <p>Even in Singapore, land burial is only for a number of years before exhumation tto allow others to use the same plot, I believe.</p>
              <p>The most ecologically sound burial should be the Bali Aga burial of the Trunyan village. The human are left in the open under the banyan tree. Interestingly, the fragrance of the banyan tree prevents the odor of rotting flesh.</p>
              <p>And interesting fact about the banyan tree it is supposed to be sacred. Many Malay royalties are buried under the banyan tree. You even still see there are tombs under the banyan in Singapore. The royalty and holy tombs are covered with yellow cloth, I believe.</p>

              <p>That being said, profiting for personal gain but being useful to society is nothing shameful or atrocious, it simply is the way of the world, how we are groomed to be since early age, to be useful and to be rewarded for being useful. </p>
