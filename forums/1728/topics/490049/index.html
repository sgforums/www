              new century calls for new approaches.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>One of the most profound developments to emerge from the 20th century
              affects the lives of billions of people yet remains largely unnoticed.
              Alongside dramatic social and political changes, technological and scientific
              discoveries, and new systems of transportation and communication, historians of
              the future will surely recognize how the relative freedom to first interpret
              and then shape one’s own identity has empowered human existence. Familiar
              frameworks of the self formed by ethnicity, neighborhood, race, and family (to
              name a few) are still present but have been diminished through a variety of
              factors unique to the 20th century. So thoroughly have liberal democratic
              societies adopted an experimental self as fundamental to notions of what it
              means to be a person, we rarely consider how significantly this concept has
              altered forms of social and cultural organization. The ability to select,
              fashion, and then continually augment our identity in ways we hope are positive
              has come to dominate how we conceive of and construct our lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Nowhere is this freedom more evident than in our relationship with
              religion. Of course, there are many parts of the world—including the West—where
              religious institutions still have sufficient clout to arbitrate morality and
              ethics, legitimate authority, sanction social causes and political movements,
              and even validate the findings of physicians and scientists. But in societies
              that attempt to separate religion and politics through the rule of law, those
              powers have been limited. For the <em>first</em> time in human history, hundreds
              of millions of people are now able to choose for themselves which religious
              ideas to believe in, or whether to believe in religious propositions at all. A
              2009 survey by the Pew Research Center on “Changes in Religious Affiliation in
              the U.S.” indicated that 44 percent of all Americans change religion at some
              point in their lives—which may explain how you came to be reading this article
              in a publication designed to accommodate diverse interests in Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>There is an impressive range of options from which to choose a spiritual
              or religious path, and an individual’s first encounter with the variety of
              Buddhist traditions can be daunting. Before an individual “becomes” Zen,
              Vajrayana, Pure Land, or any of the other schools now accessible globally
              through actual and virtual sites, most newcomers to Buddhism as well as many
              born into a Buddhist tradition, inhabit a loose category of what I call
              “experimental Buddhists.” The adjective “experimental” calls particular
              attention to the ways Buddhist traditions are negotiated by a variety of
              persons, then implemented selectively and pragmatically over time. Through
              trial and error, relevant concepts or methods are sought, examined, and then
              applied to any number of agendas, some psychological and spiritual, others
              social and political. This isn’t an idealized Buddhism of the monastery or
              popular culture, but one fully engaged with contemporary sensibilities and
              situations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Here are five characteristics of experimental Buddhism that may shift
              your paradigms a little. They point to correspondences between our unique
              historical era—where unprecedented global flows of information, people, and
              money have become familiar—and the ways in which religions like Buddhism must
              accommodate these new influences. Applicable both to Buddhist institutions and
              practitioners (committed, casual, and otherwise), the features that follow
              first arose in the late twentieth century but have “gone viral” in the last
              decade.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>First and foremost, an experimental approach to Buddhism involves
              positioning. Like a GPS monitoring system, we attempt to navigate social,
              cultural, economic, and ecological complexities to indicate where we actually
              are, and not where we imagine or wish ourselves to be. An experimental approach
              acknowledges the histories and traditions of multiple Buddhist paths, but it
              insists on locating individuals, teachers, practices, and institutions within
              “multiple modernities”—those alternate political and social orders (think of
              China or Singapore) that envision progress in ways resonant with—but also
              different from—the West. Given our dependence on global systems of
              transportation, finance, instantaneous communications, and environmental
              sustainability, it would be a world-denying stance (and hypocritical as well)
              to reject or shy away from our distinctive place in history. It is simply not
              plausible for contemporary Buddhist practices emphasizing interdependence,
              compassion, lovingkindness, and mindfulness to propose maps of liberation that
              emphasize the local without setting it within regional and global contexts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The second characteristic of an experimental practice is the freedom to
              shape our own spiritual or religious biographies. “Agency” is a well-traveled
              term in the social sciences indicating a creative process whereby culturally
              conditioned individuals select, test, and then verify a plan or process that
              they think will improve their circumstances. In an experimental Buddhist
              context, this means synthesizing teachings and methods to try to form an
              integrated stance that can negotiate perceived problems and challenges (which
              may themselves be conditioned by global forces and local contingencies).
              Traditional authority within Buddhist denominations—based as they are upon
              doctrines, teachers, lineages, sacred sites, and so forth—has been slow to
              adjust to this historical shift. As a result, the agency of common individuals
              who skillfully employ the media, wield economic influence, or advance new
              technologies has impacted most Buddhist traditions in significant (though not
              always positive) ways.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Since many Westerners tend to view religious authority with some
              caution, a third feature is the wary negotiation that occurs before making a
              commitment to participate in and support a particular Buddhist tradition. We
              tell ourselves we won’t get fooled again by religion, and begin assessing
              concepts, doctrines, teachers, practices, and institutions to imagine how a
              specific version of the dharma will play out in the “field experiment” of our
              lives. This assessment is common among lay practitioners, of course, but we
              find it increasingly among priests, monks, and other religious specialists. In
              the research I’ve been doing among progressive Buddhist priests in Japan, there
              is great creativity (often coupled with dogged determination) in rebooting the
              application of ancient temples and teachings to become relevant for people
              living in one of the world’s most advanced consumer cultures. While the
              concerts, cafés, websites, symposia, and social welfare–related initiatives
              these priests organize and promote are not always successful, at least no one
              can accuse them of inaction or indifference.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>A fourth attribute of experimental Buddhism is its rational and keen
              observance of practice grounded in everyday life. From an initial hypothesis
              about the utility of an idea or method to the testing we perform as the results
              become apparent, an experimental Buddhism returns us not to the meditation hall
              but to the messy conditions of contemporary social orders. While that may sound
              cliché, there’s one important plot twist: Those hoping to make Buddhist
              teachings or practices transform their lives know that a subjective judgment
              about their progress, even when it comes from a venerated teacher, is not
              enough. Society, and not the temple or monastery, is becoming the ultimate
              testing ground and arbiter for what constitutes the viability and effectiveness
              of a Buddhist practice that “works.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Some may consider this world-affirming approach ironic and perhaps
              mistaken, since it seems to undermine the whole point of stepping back from
              social conditioning to investigate one’s mind and emotions. An occasional
              retreat from society may be necessary to maintain a foundation for this kind of
              practice, but the historical record indicates that, like the Buddha himself,
              monks in early sanghas were constantly on the move and interacted with all
              segments of society. Like the lay sage Vimalakirti chiding the monk Shariputra
              for “indulging” in tranquil forest meditation, experimental Buddhists know that
              leaving a controlled setting and venturing into everyday life situations
              exposes their practice to considerable uncertainty. The initial steps of
              learning meditation may have a great deal of what scientists call “internal
              validity,” whereby one’s efforts function smoothly within a structured
              environment. However, the same practice may lack “external validity” when the
              location is not a quiet room lit by candlelight but a noisy city street or an
              intensely busy office.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Despite an intention to remain calm and centered in the midst of
              stress—based on what one may have read or been taught about Buddhism, or
              learned vicariously through the experience of others—we really don’t know
              what’s going to happen when we are confronted by stimuli over which we have
              little control. Will a coworker’s constant yammering about his dysfunctional
              relatives elicit the usual feelings of annoyance? Or, because we are learning
              to disassociate negative emotions from the stimuli that trigger them, will we
              see his plight compassionately, as if his dilemma were our own? Will the
              feelings of helplessness associated with distant wars and human rights
              violations leave us dispirited and depressed, or will we draw upon teachings of
              interdependence and summon a resolve to become involved? Through a sort of
              call-and-response dynamic, whereby ideally our practice enables us to be
              proactive to experience (rather than simply reactive), we gain proficiency in
              navigating the challenges life provides.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Finally, an experimental practice embraces the continual reinvention of
              not just Buddhism but all religious traditions. Whether their leaders like it
              or not, religious organizations have entered a historical moment when
              conventional teachings, methods, and institutional structures have little
              choice but to exit traditional contexts and fashion a new significance to
              engage the lives of contemporary men and women. Some types of Buddhism have
              done this better than others, or perhaps it’s more accurate to say that a
              number of Buddhist teachers and administrators have drawn attention to their
              respective approaches based on what can only be described as a more
              experimental approach. They position and emphasize the relevance of a
              2,600-year-old tradition for diverse and resourceful audiences; they utilize
              global systems unique to modernity, not only to disseminate their ideas but
              also to conduct workshops in person or give lectures; they provide a pragmatic
              and rational case for the effectiveness of their teachings, verified by
              experience experience instead of subjective opinion; and they are able to
              muster the necessary financial capital to keep all of these activities moving
              forward.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Thinking of the “Buddhisms” we adopt and engage as experimental rather
              than prescriptive can help liberate practitioners from investing too heavily in
              the categories and expectations of various traditions. Since we find ourselves
              living at a time when it is the individual and not the group that is privileged
              and empowered, we should acknowledge that, like practitioners throughout
              history, we orient our Buddhisms to the realities we’ve constructed rather than
              the other way around. With this positioning, we also avoid pointless
              self-recrimination for not measuring up to ideals or archetypes from centuries
              past. Precedents are important, but we have to reconcile those models with the
              deeply internalized dispositions that incline us to act, think, and feel in
              ways consistent with social situations and cultural norms. We develop a
              competence to navigate the present without depending wholly on maps of the
              past. An experimental perspective on Buddhist practice renders those inspiring
              yet somewhat static blueprints into creative resources, ones that our everyday
              experience shapes into meaningful—and sometimes even profound—applications.</span></p>
