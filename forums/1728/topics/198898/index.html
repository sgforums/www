This is the danger. The problem of enlightenment is no longer solely a problem of seeing into the nature of one's own mind. Even Shakyamuni recognized the need to take care of one's physical body if right meditation is to be practiced. Now we must take care of our universe-body as well. Thomas Berry has also pointed out that, "We need the healing Beauty of the natural world.<br><br>We need the Beauty for our imagination.<br><br>To damage the outer world is to destroy the inner world.<br><br>" As Buddhists, we must acknowledge that a destruction of the inner world as a consequence of having no responsibility towards or appreciation for the cosmos and our role in it's unfolding is not conducive to right meditation or right livelihood.<br><br>Berry's earnest recommendation is that we must learn to see that "the universe is a communion of subjects, not a collection of objects." With all of this said, I think it can be safely concluded that Buddhism must now come to grips with cosmology if it is to provide a healthy vision for a humanity that must learn to relate to the natural world in an entirely new way if it is to survive. </strong><br><br>My intake to Ryuei Michael McCormick is that Buddhist Cosmology have profound influence on the Environmental concept of Reduce ,Reuse and Recycle.<br><br>It would be a good understanding that human inhabitated this planet Earth ,but have caused a lot of environment disaster which is impacting and<br>causing change in climate and weather pattern , as in the Global Warming and<br>frequent earthquake<br><br>[quote]<strong>The 7th century Hua Yen monk Fa-tsang illustrated li shih wu ai through the analogy of a golden lion. If we think of the gold as the principle and the form of the lion as phenomena, then we can begin to understand how principle and phenomena can be simultaneously present and mutually supportive.[/</strong>quote]<br><br>the 2 common concept in Huayen (Flower Adornment school )<br>is the Lih Shi wu ai and Shih shih wu ai<br><br></div>
