He was 87.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/Chief-Aug-31-1957.jpg"><br><strong>Ven K Sri Dhammananda was there to witness Malaysia's declaration of independence on August 31, 1957</strong><br><br>Dhammananda, who was popularly referred to as "Chief", had been critically ill for the past six weeks after suffering from a stroke.<br><br>Last week he was flown back to Kuala Lumpur after spending three weeks at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. He suffered a second stroke shortly after returning from Singapore and has been slipping in and out of consciousness since then.<br><br>A leading figure in the Buddhist community in Malaysia and Singapore, Dhammananda arrived in Malaysia in 1952 from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) to help tend to the spiritual needs of the Singhalese community in Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>Shortly after his arrival he was summoned by the High Commissioner to Malaya Sir Gerald Templer who asked him to teach Buddhism among the Chinese communities in the New Villages set up by Templer to help check the spread of Communism.<br><br>Thus began his missionary work, lasting over half a century, which eventually spread throughout the whole of Malaysia and later, Singapore as well.<br><br>As recent as a few months ago, he was still giving his regular Friday evening religious talks, something he has done continuously since the 1950s.<br><br>Dhammananda is the Chief Monk of the famous Maha Vihara Temple in Kuala Lumpur and is technically the head of the Theravada denomination in Malaysia and Singapore.<br><br>In Buddhism there are two main denominations: Theravada and Mahayana.<br><br>Most Theravada Buddhist practitioners in these two countries are English-speaking because of Dhammananda's influence. He taught in English.<br><br>The other main branch of Buddhism in Malaysia and Singapore is the Mahayana school, whose devotees are mainly Chinese speaking and whose teachers are mainly from Taiwan.<br><br>"He's such a towering figure in the Buddhist community here that he's widely referred to as the 'Chief' by everyone regardless of which denomination they belong to," says Charlie Chia, 51, a veteran Buddhist teacher.<br><br>"In Malaysia, there is only one icon for Buddhism, and that's the Chief," says Lim Kooi Fong, founder of the Buddhist Channel, a non-denominational website. "Being that Malaysia is his adopted home, perhaps it's significant that he died on independence day."<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/chief-face_filtered.jpg"><br><strong>Ven.

At the age of 22. he received higher ordination (upasampada) under Venerable K Ratanapala Maha Thera, the Chief abbot of Kotawila Vihara.<br><br>Ven. Dr K Sri Dhammananda came to Malaya (now Malaysia) in January 1952. He has since then made Malaysia his adopted home.

The pyre was a beautifully constructed 40 foot structure which was wrapped with orange and yellow cloth, symbolic colours of the Mahasangha robes<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/pyre1.jpg"><br><strong>Fare ye well, dear Chief. May you attain the bliss of Nibbana </strong><br><br>Members of the Mahasangha then made clockwise circumbulation, walking around the pyre three times followed by VIP delegates.<br><br>Despite the wet conditions, the pyre was lit on time at about 6.30 pm by the respective representatives of Sasana Abhiwurdhi Wardhana Society, Mr A Hemadasa and Mr Ang Choo Hong, on behalf of the Buddhist Missionary Society of Malaysia. As the pyre was lit, a section of the crowd paid their respects by putting their palms together and in unison chanted the Â“Ti Ratana VandanaÂ” (Homage to the Triple Gem) while others groups recited Â“Namo AmitabhaÂ” repeatedly in Chinese. By this time, the storm had subsided and a soft drizzle had gently settled in.<br><br>As the fire was burning, the 5,000 kg of jasmine wood placed inside the pyre released a fragrant aroma which permeated the surrounding area.<br><br>The ceremony concluded with hymn singing, conducted by the Wayfarers and iGemz choirs.<br></div>
