                        fist is the ten directions. Naked Awareness<a><sup>2</sup></a> contains and illuminates the ten directions of the universe 
                  because the
                        luminosity of Experiencing is its very bone and marrow.<br> <br> Once, the Awakened One Sakyamuni said to the great assembly, “<em>Throughout
                        the Fields of Awakening of the ten directions there is only this 
                  single
                        Path of Reality.</em>”<a><sup>3</sup></a><br> <br> These “<em>ten directions</em>” are the Field of Awake 
                  Awareness. There is no
                        universe that we can know that is not a Field of Awakening. This 
                  universe
                        of Saha is the Field of Awake Awareness and Sakyamuni is its 
                  Teacher. The
                        world of events you see about you is exactly the same as the Field
                   of
                        Sakyamuni the Awakened One; they are like six of one, half a dozen
                   of the
                        other. The ten directions are all each in each direction and each 
                  is Awake
                        Awareness. Each direction and each Awakened One contains all 
                  others. This
                        universe has many facets such as the ten directions, one 
                  direction, this
                        direction, directionality, and the direction of this present 
                  moment. There
                        is the direction of the eye, the direction of a fist, the 
                  direction of a
                        post, the direction of a stone lantern. The Awakened Ones within 
                  the
                        Fields of the ten directions transcend vast or normal, pure or 
                  stained.<br> <br> And so all the Buddhas throughout the ten directions proclaim each
                   other.
                        When they criticize each other it is only to turn the cycle of the
                        Teachings further and should not be understood as if it were the 
                  arguments
                        of usual people. All Awakened Ones are intimate with each other as
                        Teachers and students and question each other<a><sup>4</sup></a> to clarify practice. This is how we must approach practice if we 
                  are to
                        inherit the Transmission of the Awakened Ones and Ancestors.<br> <br> Awakened Ones never engage in slander, even of the truly evil or 
                  those
                        outside of the Vast Path. If we look through all of the Discourses
                   that
                        tell of the life of Sakyamuni that have been transmitted to China 
                  we never
                        find an instance in which he says of other Awakened Ones that this
                   one is
                        better than that one or that they are not truly Awakened Ones. 
                  Throughout
                        his life we cannot find any words of envy or libel. As well, we 
                  never hear
                        of any other Awakened Ones finding fault with him.<br> <br> The Awakened One Sakyamuni said, “<em>I
                        alone know the true form of all experiences<a><sup>5</sup></a> and this can be said of all the
                   Awakened Ones throughout the ten
                        directions.</em>”<a><sup>6</sup></a> You should understand that this form is something like a circle.<a><sup>7</sup></a> It means that, “a long bamboo staff is long and a short one is
                        short.”<a><sup>8</sup></a> That’s it and that’s all. All of the Awakened Ones throughout the 
                  ten
                        directions know this “<em>form</em>” and therefore 
                  Sakyamuni knows it also. “<em>I know true form</em>” is the same 
                  for all Awakened Ones throughout the
                        universe. It is my form, the form of Knowing, the form of Reality,
                   the
                        form of the ten directions, the form of this realm of Saha, the 
                  form of
                        Sakyamuni.<br> <br> This is the essential point of all of the Discourses: an Awakened 
                  One and
                        a Field of Awakening are not two separate things. They are beyond 
                  sentient
                        and insentient; they are neither “deluded” nor “enlightened;” not
                        good, bad, or indifferent; not pure or impure; beyond arising, 
                  dwelling,
                        destruction, and nothingness;<a><sup>9</sup></a> permanent or impermanent; existent or non-existent; self or other.
                   They
                        cannot be understood through the fourfold analysis of same, 
                  different,
                        existent, or non-existent, nor are they just nothing. The Field of
                   Awake
                        Awareness is the universe of ten directions. The whole world is 
                  the whole
                        world. That’s all.<br> <br> Zen master Changsha Zhaoxian<a><sup>10</sup></a> said, “<em>The whole world of ten
                        directions is reflected in this monk’s eye.</em>”<a><sup>11</sup></a>This eye is the eye of that monk 
                  Gautama; it is “I have the Eye of
                        Utter Reality”. It can be transmitted to anyone,<a><sup>12</sup></a> but it is still the eye of that monk Gautama. All the ragged 
                  presencing of
                        experiences of the ten directions are contained within this Eye. 
                  It is all
                        points of view and contains all eyes.<a><sup>13</sup></a><br> <br> [Changsha said,] “<em>The whole world
                        of ten directions is contained in</em> <em>everyday
                        talk.</em>” Everyday<a><sup>14</sup></a> means used daily as well as customary or ordinary.<a><sup>15</sup></a> The “<em>ten directions</em>” is
                        everyday kind of talk for monks. Even every word contains the ten
                        directions. This is correct speech and correct word. Learn through
                        practice that because everyday talk is the universe of ten 
                  directions, the
                        universe of ten directions is everyday talk. The ten directions 
                  are
                        without limit<a><sup>16</sup></a> and so are wholly<a><sup>17</sup></a> the ten directions.<br> <br> This is why the “<em>ten directions</em>”
                        are used in our everyday lives. For example, an Indian emperor 
                  used to ask
                        for “sendaba” which can mean a horse, salt, or a drink of water 
                  and a
                        true servant knows by the context exactly what to bring.<a><sup>18</sup></a> What can we call someone who steps past the confines of the 
                  conditioned
                        attention of the mass of people and is transformed in body and 
                  mind in the
                        midst of this stream of speech? Even in mid-speech, speech can be 
                  turned
                        around.<br> <br> The correct word and straightforward speech of the tongues of 
                  mountains
                        and rivers are this everyday talk. You do not have to use the 
                  tongue and
                        teeth to speak such sounds. Even if the mouth is stopped up and 
                  everyone
                        plugs their ears, these words are always already spoken and heard.
                   If you
                        can speak and hear these words then you understand intimately the 
                  ten
                        directions.<br> <br> [Changsha said,] “The ten directions are the body of this monk.” 
                  [When
                        Sakyamuni was born he] pointed one hand to the sky as sky and one 
                  hand to
                        the earth as earth and said, “<em>Beneath
                        the heavens and above the earth I alone am the Generous One</em>.”<a><sup>19</sup></a> This is the ten directions presencing as the body of a single 
                  monk. His
                        head, eyes, nose, skin, flesh, bones, and marrow are the body of a
                   monk
                        liberated into the ten directions. There is nowhere outside of the
                        universe for the universe to move. Independent of ideas about it, 
                  realize
                        this monk’s body as the ten directions, the ten directions as the 
                  body
                        of this monk.<br> <br> “<em>This whole world is your own luminosity.</em>” This 
                  luminosity is your
                        nostrils before your father and mother were ever born. Who you are<a><sup>20</sup></a> is right in the palm of your hand—it is the ten directions. Who 
                  you are
                        is actualized in your very presencing. This is where we must 
                  establish the
                        Hall of the Awakened Ones and find the Awake Awareness which we 
                  are.<br> <br> At that moment, our eyes have become black beads. Further, the 
                  face splits
                        open and we are able to meet the great masters. To go further, 
                  calling
                        someone to come to us is easy but getting them to leave is 
                  difficult. And
                        when you are called, the head turns. What need is there for 
                  someone to do
                        the turning of the head? My head is just turned, relying on the 
                  fact of
                        actuality. A meal is there for someone to eat it, a robe is there 
                  for
                        someone to wear it; but if you naively grope for a “someone”, you 
                  have
                        already deserved thirty blows from the staff. It’s too bad, but 
                  it’s
                        true.<br> <br> “<em>The whole world of ten directions fills your body.</em>”
                   An eyelid is
                        actually luminosity. When the eyelid opens, there is this 
                  “filling”.
                        The filling of the eyes with seeing is the whole world of ten 
                  directions.
                        Since we sleep together on the same floor, we know the holes in 
                  each
                        other’s quilts.<br> <br> “<em>The whole world of ten directions is your own 
                  luminosity.</em>”
                        Whenever a teacher raises their hand, there is no situation of ten
                        directions that is not who they are. The ten directions are who I 
                  am; they
                        are me as myself, you as me, me as you. I as you and you as I and 
                  these
                        ten directions are seamless. The life of each person and all 
                  people is
                        found right in the palm of your hand. Each returns to the others 
                  the cost
                        of their straw sandals. Can you see that the entire lives of the 
                  Awakened
                        One and of Bodhidharma are there in that stone pillar? You must 
                  understand
                        that the stone pillar’s coming and going is the coming and going 
                  of the
                        total universe of ten directions.<br> <br> Great master Zongyi<a><sup>21</sup></a> of Xuansha said, “<em>This world of ten directions is a 
                  single bright jewel.”</em> You must
                        understand intimately that this “s<em>ingle
                        bright jewel”</em> is everywhere throughout the ten directions. 
                  States
                        high and low<a><sup>22</sup></a> all arise within this “<em>single bright jewel</em>.” 
                  Awakened Ones and Ancestors teach that this
                        is the essential point of the Way of Awake Awareness. Men and 
                  women live
                        their lives through its richness and it is the practice of those 
                  just
                        beginning and those maturing within the Way. Our everyday 
                  activities of
                        wearing the robes and eating rice arise within this “<em>single
                        bright jewel</em>.”<br> <br> My late master Rujing once held up a ball of mud to show his 
                  students the
                        “<em>single bright jewel.”</em> Although it is as simple as placing a stone on a go board, it 
                  scoops out
                        the eyes of the Ancestors. Each of the Ancestors helps with this 
                  scooping
                        out. The insides of their eyes shine with radiance.<br> <br> <em>Once a monk asked Qianfeng,</em><a><sup>23</sup></a> <em>“I have heard that there is only
                        one gate to the end of all conditions which is used by all 
                  Generous Ones
                        throughout the ten directions.” Qianfeng drew a circle with his 
                  staff in
                        the air and said, “Here it is.”</em><a><sup>24</sup></a><br> <br> “<em>Here it is</em>” is the
                        ten directions. All of the Awakened Ones are within the staff and 
                  the
                        staff is right here. This is the single gate of the ten 
                  directions. But
                        don’t lose the staff in Gautama’s nostrils or lose the staff in 
                  the
                        nostrils of the staff. Don’t worry about what Qianfeng might know 
                  about
                        the Awakened Ones of the ten directions and the single gate to 
                  nirvana.
                        Just take his saying of “Here it is!” You can’t deny that.<br> <br> Old Man Qianfeng’s “<em>Here it
                        is”</em> was quite good but I hope that he didn’t miss anything 
                  with
                        that circle he drew with his staff in the air. The ten directions 
                  are the
                        breath of the Awakened One. This is the point of our practice.<br> <br>    </span></span></p>
