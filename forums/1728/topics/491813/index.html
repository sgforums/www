              Guardian science journalist and practicing Buddhist James Kingsland
              investigates the ancient and modern takes on the health and spiritual benefits
              of meditation and mindfulness in this highly-readable, cutting-edge assessment
              that shows how Siddhartha, known to us as the Buddha, anticipated the findings
              of modern science by two millennia. Moving effortless between science and
              scripture, Kingsland charts Siddhartha’s spiritual journey and explains how new
              research by leading neuroscientists and clinical psychologists – many of who
              are interviewed here – suggests that the Buddha’s mindfulness practice
              reconfigures our brains to make us sharper, smarter, healthier and happier, and
              that it can help treat stress, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, hypertension
              and substance abuse</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.85pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 1.85pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Many have argued that Buddhism is
              not a religion at all, at least not in the conventional sense. To an atheist
              and skeptic like myself, this lack of a supernatural belief system makes
              Buddhism very appealing. When I first became interested in its practices and
              philosophy, some five years ago, I was also intrigued by the way “sin” in the
              language of other religions—lust, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy, pride, and so
              forth—is labeled more neutrally by Buddhists as “unskillful behavior” that will
              reap painful consequences through the ineluctable operation of the laws of
              cause and effect. The implication seems to be that to be a good, contented
              human being is a skill that can be learned, like driving a car or baking a
              cake. The more you practice, the better you will get at it. Viewed this way, to
              judge someone for their greed or pride starts to look as misguided as
              condemning them for not being able to drive or bake. Nevertheless, why should
              Buddhism be any better than the other world religions—or indeed a completely
              secular approach—at teaching such skills? All things mystical and religious,
              regardless of whether or not they involve a god, a creed, or commandments, are
              viewed with suspicion by many scientists and nonbelievers, including the
              majority of those I have worked with over the years in my job as a science
              writer and editor. And the cure Buddhism claims to offer for the afflicted
              human mind is largely based on meditation, which for professional skeptics like
              myself looks initially like just another health fad. Mindfulness meditation,
              which involves cultivating nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, has
              gone global. There are programs tailored for use in schools in the UK, for
              young offenders in New York City, for US Marines awaiting deployment, for
              firefighters in Florida and taxi drivers in Iran, to name just a few.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.85pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 1.85pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">But, in intellectually conservative
              circles, announcing that you meditate is still likely to be met with a snort of
              derision. Claims in the past about the efficacy of meditation have been tainted
              with a certain amount of woo-woo New Age mumbo jumbo. In several countries
              around the world, people still remember elections during the 1990s when
              candidates for the Natural Law Party advocated transcendental meditation as the
              cure for all the world’s ills. The party declared that its “systematic and
              scientifically tested” pro- gram would involve thousands of meditators creating
              “coherence in national consciousness” to reduce stress and negativity in
              society through the power of levitation. I remember watching the party’s
              surreal 1994 European election broadcast in the United Kingdom, which showed
              cross-legged young men bouncing across mattresses on their bottoms. We were
              informed that a group of these “yogic flyers” had already reduced the crime
              rate in Merseyside by 60 per- cent over the previous seven years.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.85pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 1.85pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Against this backdrop, scientists
              looking into the potential clinical benefits of mindfulness meditation have had
              to work hard over the past few decades to be taken seriously. Several
              researchers have told me that when they started out in the field, it was
              consid- ered career suicide to admit to your peers that you were investigat-
              ing meditation. This has all changed now. Some of the world’s most respected
              clinical psychologists and neuroscientists are now involved, and their papers
              are published in mainstream journals such as Nature, Proceedings of the
              National Academy of Sciences, and The Lancet. The credibility of the field has
              been enhanced enormously through the use of new brain-scanning technologies
              such as fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), which has shown in study
              after study that meditation produces discern- ible changes in brain activity.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.85pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 1.85pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Another remarkable development has
              been recent studies of the brains of Buddhist contemplatives who have clocked
              decades of meditation experience in various monastic traditions. This research
              has largely been inspired by formal discussions since the 1980s between
              scientists and the Dalai Lama. One of the neuro- scientists most closely
              involved in this work is Richard Davidson, from the University of Wisconsin,
              who says we still have much to learn from contemplatives. “This research has
              underscored the potential value of these traditions for cultivating healthier
              habits of mind,” he told me. “Mental practice can lead to fundamental changes
              in the brain to support these new habits.” He believes that the brain’s innate
              “plasticity”—its capacity for rewiring itself as we learn from experiences and
              develop new skills—can be harnessed to promote well-being. According to this
              view, happiness is a skill that, like any other, can be developed through
              diligent practice.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.85pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 1.85pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">All the same, there remains a
              certain wariness of meditation. One common misunderstanding, which inspired my
              cynical joke that morning at the monastery, is that it transforms people into
              creatures who have had all their desires, ambitions, and personality
              excised—zombies, if you will. When I played back the recording of my interview
              with Ajahn Amaro, I was relieved to discover that it was he who first brought
              up the subject. I had suggested to him that Buddhism, with its emphasis on
              cultivating “selflessness,” went against the grain of Western culture, with its
              emphasis on endless striving for self-advancement. It’s what gets us out of bed
              in the mornings and pays our bills. He disagreed. “People think that in
              Buddhist practice you’re meant to be free from desire and so then we shouldn’t
              want anything. They take it to mean that we’re supposed to be totally passive,
              or endeavoring to be a kind of zombie that isn’t doing anything. It’s a radical
              misunderstanding, because a) work does not mean suffering, and b) peace does
              not mean inactivity. When we think ‘I want to be peaceful’ we think of zoning
              out at the beach, but you can be completely at peace and working hard at the
              same time. They are not antithetical to each other.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.85pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 1.85pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">If anything, this book will argue
              that the evidence from neuroscience suggests that meditation can make people
              less zombie-like, by giving them more control over their thoughts, emotions,
              and behavior. Siddha¯rtha’s Brain is about the science of mindfulness and the
              quest for spiritual enlightenment—or, to express the same thing in less loaded
              terms, the search for optimum psychological well-being. Enlightenment has
              distinct religious overtones, though what Buddhists mean by the word is simply
              the full realization of the way things truly are—free of any kind of delusion.
              This is not so different from what scientists are trying to achieve when they
              investigate the chemistry, physics, and biology of our world. But what of that
              other slippery word, spiritual? As I have looked deeper into mindfulness and
              Buddhism, the dividing line between the spiritual guidance provided by teachers
              such as Ajahn Amaro and the mindfulness courses provided by mental health
              practitioners has started to look less and less clear-cut. In the past decade,
              thousands of studies have been published that tested the efficacy of secular
              forms of mindfulness meditation for treating drug addiction, depression,
              anxiety, and many other afflictions of the mind. Whether you believe this
              approach is seeking to improve people’s “spiritual health” or their “mental well-being”
              is a matter of perspective. Your choice of words will depend on whether
              mindfulness training is delivered in a monastery or a clinic. Ajahn Amaro, in
              common with many other Buddhist teachers, sees himself as much as a mental
              health counselor as a spiritual adviser. Every day people share their
              anxieties, their problems, and hang-ups with him. He listens and offers advice
              about possible courses of action. When it comes down to it, there’s not that
              much difference between his role and that of a secular expert in mindfulness
              therapy.</span></p>
