Some of them after died become reborn as ghost first, before reborning in hell. The ghost rebirth is called 'hua-bao4' - flower, while the hell birth is called 'guo bao4' - fruit, as u know the flower comes first before the fruit. And to those who finish their guo-bao, some of them still need to reborn in other lower realm to suffer the remaining karma, i forgot what 'bao4' is that called. These things are mentioned in the sutras.<br><br>There are also some, after finishing suffering in hell, finish suffering in ghost realm, finishing suffering in animal realm - after that being able to reborn as human, they will die as infants or at a very young age.<br><br>Btw, they are not reborn as germs, microbes, virus or bacteria. Because all these do not have consciousness. They are reborned as microscopic animals.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Questions: When a doctor prescribe antibiotics and drugs to help patients to get rid of harmful bacteria , does he create bad Kamma?<br><br>Venerable Dhammasami, London, UK<br><br>Answer: Bacteria in human's body may not be considered a life in Buddhism. Life, in Buddhism, has three factors: karma (kamma), consciousness and physical body. The physical body is maintained by four forces: Karma, consciousness, food and inorganic environment. As a result the physical body is categorised into four according the forces that support and maintain it.<br><br>A physical body like bacteria, that is supported and maintained only by food and an inorganic environment, may not be considered a life because it is not a produce of Karma and Citta (consciousness).<br><br>So, there should not be anything wrong with a doctor prescribing antibiotics to a patient. Nevertheless, I still want to confirm my view with scientific finding as to what bacteria is. Another point to keep in mind is intention. If a doctor has the will to save his patient rather than to kill other being ( if you consider it to be so) like bacteria.<br><br>There are bacteria that die when we eat vegetables. There is no innocent food even if you are a perfect vegetarian. The thing is that you do not intend to kill but you eat mainly for your survival. A surgeon performing an operation with the intention to save life does not accrue demerit when the operation goes wrong and the patient lost his life. </blockquote><a href="http://www.triplegem.plus.com/q&amp;a0.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.triplegem.plus.com/q&amp;a0.htm</a><br><br>/\</div>

However, viruses, bacteria etc, cannot be considered sentient lifeforms. They may be considered non-sentient lifeforms like plants.
