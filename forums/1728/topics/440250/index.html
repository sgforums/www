              <p>Hi all,  I have a question here. Hope i can get some thoughtful responses from your understanding and experience.</p>
              <p>Recently, in my friendship with an older dharma friend, i found that i was reacting to this person in ways that were not rational and more impulse-based.  After thinking deeply about it, i realised that there was always the same kind of dynamic in our friendship with my friend. That i always had an impulse to control my friend in a certain way and would be quite frustrated if i did not get the responses i wanted.  I began to see the recurring pattern of thinking i had which was q<span style="text-decoration: underline;">uite particular towards this friend only</span> and it began to feel to me like something karmic or from a habitual tendency built up over long time maybe beginning from the past lives.</p>
              <p>Sorry for lohso intro, but my question is, (1) how do we resolve such karmic patterns or 'knots'?  Instead of letting it continue forever into the future and maybe have to come back in future lives to have the same kind of game going on again under different identities.  </p>
              <p>Also, (2) how do we know when the karmic pattern has been truly resolved, instead of being buried in our subconsciousness only, waiting to surface in the future?</p>
              <p>Another topic related to this is that i have read about past lives regression thru hypnosis and usually when the person goes through regression to recall a certain usually carthartic or significant event, he releases that karmic 'knot' and when he comes out of the hypnosis, the problem in his life, whether it is in a relationship or in an illness will be suddenly be resolved.  As far as i can observe, it is just a revisiting of the event in his memory. My question is (3) Why is it the revisiting of the event in his memory can resolve the karmic pattern in the present.  Is that what is meant by purification?</p>
              <p>Last question (4) is for any spiritual path to liberation, is it necessary to resolve all karmic patterns and release all 'knots'?  Is that what is meant by the karmic debts?  The reason for my asking this question is because in the stories i read, the person usually becomes more uplifted, open, happier, at ease and spiritually elevated as they release  more and more 'knots' through hypnosis...</p>
              <p>The book i read is Many Masters Many LIves...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for reading through my questions.  </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>With regards to your first concern about resolving habitual patterns...</p>
              <p>Rather than giving yourself the burden of thinking your problem is a karmic one stemming from past lives, I would suggest thinking of it as an ingrained habit.  Afterall, this habit of yours may or may not stem from any past life issues.  Treat a habitual tendency as being just that, regardless of where/when it stems.</p>
              <p>I would tentatively offer the opinion that you can try building a new habit to antidote the originally ingrained (but unwholesome) one.  I can testify that when certain habits of relating to others are ingrained, it really takes effort and a lot of mindfulness to reverse.  However as mentioned, effort and mindfulness are what is needed and you can summon those, so all is not lost.  Also expect that it may take some time to break the pattern.  If you really want to though, you can.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents for now.  I'm sure others will give you input too.</p>

              <p>Translated into English the gist of the article by Ch'an Master Sheng Yen.  The second article is a little more deep and I don't know if I fully understand it.  Maybe someone else can help with translating that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We all have afflictions, but once these afflictions become repetitive, it forms a habitual tendency.  For example, a greedy person grabs money whenever he can.  If he repeatedly behaves in this way, not considering whether such behaviour is unwholesome, he creates a habitual tendency.  His affliction has therefore taken on the momentum of habit. </p>
              <p>Our afflictions, if expressed can hurt others.  However, even if we don't express them we could end up hurting ourselves too.  An example would be in the case of a boy who secretly likes a girl but doesn't express it.  However, because he can't get over it, his persistent attachment has actually caused himself harm.  Alternatively, the boy could keep pestering the girl, causing her to feel vexed and frustrated.</p>
              <p>In expressing our habits, we need to be mindful of whether we make others feel uncomfortable.  Sometimes, it may be the case that we didn't mean to upset others, but nevertheless, our habits have caused others to feel uncomfortable. </p>
              <p>Some habits may be somewhat endearing and comical.  Some are simply naturally conditioned reflexes which do not need to be tempered.  If there is an itch, scratch it without feeling like one must suppress such a natural urge.  Afterall, we shouldn't be too contrived in our actions either. </p>
              <p>In all, we need to be mindful of how our habits impact others.  Always be mindful of the social setting we are in and behave accordingly.  Do not let our habitual tendencies end up hurting others.  </p>
              <p>---------------------</p>
              <p>After reading the article above, it occurred to me that:  The motivation to not cause harm to others, is useful for helping us overcome unwholesome habitual tendencies.</p>

              <p>Translated into English the gist of the article by Ch'an Master Sheng Yen.  The second article is a little more deep and I don't know if I fully understand it.  Maybe someone else can help with translating that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We all have afflictions, but once these afflictions become repetitive, it forms a habitual tendency.  For example, a greedy person grabs money whenever he can.  If he repeatedly behaves in this way, not considering whether such behaviour is unwholesome, he creates a habitual tendency.  His affliction has therefore taken on the momentum of habit. </p>
              <p>Our afflictions, if expressed can hurt others.  However, even if we don't express them we could end up hurting ourselves too.  An example would be in the case of a boy who secretly likes a girl but doesn't express it.  However, because he can't get over it, his persistent attachment has actually caused himself harm.  Alternatively, the boy could keep pestering the girl, causing her to feel vexed and frustrated.</p>
              <p>In expressing our habits, we need to be mindful of whether we make others feel uncomfortable.  Sometimes, it may be the case that we didn't mean to upset others, but nevertheless, our habits have caused others to feel uncomfortable. </p>
              <p>Some habits may be somewhat endearing and comical.  Some are simply naturally conditioned reflexes which do not need to be tempered.  If there is an itch, scratch it without feeling like one must suppress such a natural urge.  Afterall, we shouldn't be too contrived in our actions either. </p>
              <p>In all, we need to be mindful of how our habits impact others.  Always be mindful of the social setting we are in and behave accordingly.  Do not let our habitual tendencies end up hurting others.  </p>
              <p>---------------------</p>
              <p>After reading the article above, it occurred to me that:  The motivation to not cause harm to others, is useful for helping us overcome unwholesome habitual tendencies.</p>

              <p>Hi simpo, i got the impression from reading AEN's post that realisation is permanent and that non-self or non-duality is realised and does not change from then on. Do you mean to say it still flickers on and off.</p>
              <p>thanks for your answer, i had a feeling that it needs something as thorough as insight into selflessness to unknot the pattern, otherwise it will resurface again...</p>
              <p>However, the question remains why did those ppl who go thru the regression recover from their knots just by recall, or they did not really resolve the knots completely in the first place?  Do you or anyone out there have any explanation for this?</p>

              <p>With regards to your first concern about resolving habitual
              patterns...</p>
              <p>Rather than giving yourself the burden of thinking your problem
              is a karmic one stemming from past lives, I would suggest thinking
              of it as an ingrained habit.  Afterall, this habit of yours
              may or may not stem from any past life issues.  Treat a
              habitual tendency as being just that, regardless of where/when it
              stems.</p>
              <p>I would tentatively offer the opinion that you can try building
              a new habit to antidote the originally ingrained (but unwholesome)
              one.  I can testify that when certain habits of relating to
              others are ingrained, it really takes effort and a lot of
              mindfulness to reverse.  However as mentioned, effort and
              mindfulness are what is needed and you can summon those, so all is
              not lost.  Also expect that it may take some time to break the
              pattern.  If you really want to though, you can.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents for now.  I'm sure others will give you
              input too.</p>

              <p>hello realisation, the five minutes break between posts is quite frustrating... haha...</p>
              <p>anyway, whether it is past life issue or not, it is a pattern from habit and you could call it karmic. i feel it affects all of us and in almost any way.  i am more interested in its general working than anything particular about just this one single incident or friend.</p>
              <p>However for my story up there. it is mainly with this friend where the force is so strong. I dun usually have this problem with others, at least not to that same degree. So this suggests something...?</p>

              <p>IMO, an insight is permanent understanding. But to be 100% 'be' as 'insighted' (LOL for lack of words) is extremely hard and certainly takes time. That is why there are 4 stages leading to Arahantship. IMO, the first definitive insight/direct experience of no-self is Stream entry.</p>
              <p>After that, there can be many more minor and major insights. Some pertaining to particular situations while others overarching in their realisations.</p>

              <p>The feelings of past life are in the subsconscious. That is similar to saying that we do certain things without knowing why we do it. Certain feelings and desires are associated with the action... they are not discovered yet.</p>

              <p>I do have some questions.   </p>
              <p>Let's say I am in fact very indebted to a certain person in my past life.  So, before knowing about this, I have always felt impelled to help this person or be nice to this person in this life.</p>
              <p>Then, I somehow learn of this indebtedness via regression or I spontaneously remember it myself.  At the same time, my cultivation bears fruit and I also gain insight into No-Self (lol). </p>
              <p>How will realisation of No-Self lead to anything being different?  Will not karma still have to play itself out in the manner of me continuing to be good to this person?  Afterall, I now know that I owe him something.</p>
              <p>Taking another scenario in which I discover why my friend and I innately dislike each other; how would realisation of No-Self help, other than to help me bear my friend's insults in a relaxed manner?  I imagine that karma will still carry on its momentum, except that it becomes easier to bear due to a relinquishment of self-cherishing. </p>
              <p>And then with time, due to me not reacting, the knot that binds my friend and myself to being mean to each other gets released.  A bad situation that might perpetuate endlessly gets diffused.  However, I feel that knowing or not knowing the past life situation, one can still do something to transmute a bad situation.  What do you think?</p>
              <p>The above comes from my own logical reasoning only... Just hoping you can share a little more with us  :)</p>

              <p>Glad to have simpo back in action,whats keeping you away for so long?</p>
              <p>From what you are trying to explain,can i safely assume that you too believe that there are various stages of insights some very impacting causing and some not so along the path of fully understanding whether is there a presence of a unchanging self/me thus this journey will start to begin when we start to have insights and thus even if these insights are nto deep enough to break and fully overcome the self notion(arahantship)</p>
              <p>Upon stream entry,chances are minor habits will start to be overcomed and the person himself will also begin to reflect and try to understand/overcome the causes and how to break through his grosser/stronger habitual thinking/actions?</p>

              <p>off topic, but very very nice information! </p>
              <p>now i know how the cancer <span style="text-decoration: underline;">group </span>in china that was mentioned by MCK heal themselves, without any doctor's treatment. they were told by the doctors that they have short period to live. though they chanted and perhaps with the help of will power, they cured themselves.</p>
              <p> In order to properly and completely heal from anything, one must be free of fear.</p>
