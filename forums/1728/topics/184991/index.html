            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha <span style="text-decoration: underline;">says that everything is "empty". </span>Some think that this is empty, that is empty, or everything is empty. Since everything is empty, and meaningless, one does not need to do either evil or good. These people understand the concept vaguely, and lead an aimless life. In fact, "emptiness" in Buddhism is the most <span style="text-decoration: underline;">profound philosophy</span>. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are the people who have realised the truth of emptiness. <strong>"Emptiness"</strong> does not mean nothing at all, in contrast, it includes everything. <span style="font-style: italic;">The world is world, life is life, suffering is suffering, happiness is happiness, everything does exist.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To put it in layman term:</span><br><br>persons (like you and me) and all other phenomena (tables, etc.) are empty of our fantasized projections on them. One of the principle deceptive qualities that we project onto persons and phenomena is that they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inherently existent,</span> that is, that they exist without depending on causes and conditions, parts, and the consciousness which conceives them and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gives them a name.</span><br><br><strong>Thus, in our ordinary view, things appear to have some true of inherent nature, as if they were really there, as if we could find these real, independent entities if we searched for them. They appear to be there, independent of the causes and conditions that created them, independent of the parts of which they are made, and independent of the mind which conceives and gives them a name. This is the appearance of true or inherent existence and our mind grasps it as real.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">However</span>, when we examine analytically if things exist in this independent way as they superficially appear to, we find that they do not. They are empty of our fantasized projections onto them. Still, they do exist, but they exist dependently, for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they rely on causes and conditions,</span> on parts, and on the mind which conceives them and gives them a name</strong>.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's a <strong>common misunderstanding </strong>of the concept of emptiness in Buddhism - namely that "Buddhists believe that things don't (really) exist" or,  "Buddhists believe that nothing exists".<br><br>Emptyness really means <span style="color: green;">'empty of inherent existence'</span>. In other words no phenomenon contains the reason for its existence within itself. All phenomena arise from ever-changing relationships with other phenomena, including the minds of the observers.<br><br>When Buddhists speak of a thing or person being <span style="color: green;">`empty' </span>we really mean empty of inherent existence'.<br><br>To understand the philosophical meaning of this term, let's look at a simple solid object, such as a cup. <span style="color: red;">How is a cup empty?</span> We usually say that a cup is empty if it does not contain any liquid or solid. This is the ordinary meaning of emptiness. <span style="color: red;">But, is the cup really empty?</span> A cup empty of liquids or solids is still full of air. To be precise, we must therefore state what the cup is empty of. <span style="color: red;">Can a cup be empty of all substance?</span> A cup in a vacuum does not contain any air, but it still contains space, light, radiation, as well as its own substance. Hence, from a physical point of view, the cup is always full of something. Yet, from the Buddhist point of view, the cup is always empty. The Buddhist understanding of emptiness is different from the physical meaning. <span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">The cup being empty means that it is devoid of inherent existence</span>.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">What is meant with non-inherent existence? </span>Is this to say that the cup does not ultimately exist? - Not quite. - The cup exists, but like everything in this world, <span style="color: red;">its existence depends on other phenomena</span>.There is nothing in a cup that is inherent to that specific cup or to cups in general. Properties such as being hollow, spherical, cylindrical, or leak-proof are not intrinsic to cups. Other objects which are not cups have similar properties, as for example vases and glasses. <span style="color: red;">The cup's properties and components are neither cups themselves nor do they imply cupness on their own. The material is not the cup. The shape is not the cup. The function is not the cup.</span> <span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">Only all these aspects together make up the cup</span>.</span> Hence, we can say that for an object to be a cup we require a collection of specific conditions to exist. It depends on the combination of function, use, shape, base material, and the cup's other aspects. <span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">Only if all these conditions exist simultaneously does the mind impute cupness to the object</span></span>. If one condition ceases to exist, for instance, if the cup's shape is altered by breaking it, the cup forfeits some or all of its cupness, because the object's function, its shape, as well as the imputation of cupness through perception is disrupted. The cup's existence thus depends on external circumstances. Its physical essence remains elusive.<br><br><img src="http://mud.mm-a2.yimg.com/image/570895090"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the story was that someone asked the Monk (during QnA in front of a crowd) whether a highly cultivation Monk - himself, is still bounded by cause and effect. His answer was NO, which resulted into rebirth as a fox.<br><br>There was also another story about a very careless doctor. He was so careless that he prescribed the wrong medicines for his clients and lives were lost many times. Upon death, he still maintained that he was careless and did not intentionally kill others. Nevertheless, he was brought to 18th floor of hell. While he was on the 18th floor, he heard noises emerging from a floor below. Through conversation, he found out later that the poor soul below was once a Teacher.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sinweiy:</div><div class="quote_body">"All is empty, but the cause and effect is not.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: green;">Emptiness of the five skandhas</span></span><br><br>The <span style="color: red;">Heart Sutra </span>expresses the same idea by stating the emptiness of the five skandhas, <span style="color: blue;">i.e. the emptiness of the body, sensations, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness</span>. The five skandhas are commonly translated into English as the <strong>five aggregates</strong>. According to the Buddha, these aggregates are what constitutes a person. As adumbrated above, it is possible to deconstruct the five skandhas in the same manner as objects. However, this method of deconstruction assumes a third person perspective. It analyses phenomena perceived as external to the observer. When we talk about the essence of a person, the situation is slightly different, because we talk indirectly about ourselves. It may therefore be more intuitive to look at things from a first person perspective. The first person perspective allows us to make statements about the internal state of the observer thereby producing self-reference. What is observed is the observer. Perhaps this will lead to new insights into the essence of mind and body.<br><br><img src="http://villa.lakes.com/cdpatton/Dharma/Basics/5skandhas.gif"><br><br>First, let's look at experience. <span style="color: red;">What exactly is experience?</span> - Obviously, we experience objects and phenomena through the<span style="color: blue;"> senses</span>. This is one form of experience. We also experience<span style="color: blue;"> feelings, moods, thoughts, and emotions</span>. The former can be called sensory experiences and the latter mental experiences. Upon contemplating the distinction we may find that there is <strong>no clear boundary between sensory and mental experience</strong>. As soon as we<strong> perceive a physical object, for example an apple, the corresponding mental experiences are immediately triggered. First, we think "apple". This is identification. Following this thought, a number of things we associate with apples may come to mind, for example "sweet, edible, green, red, healthy, delicious, juicy," and so on</strong>. These associations may be followed by the<strong> buildup of a desire to touch or to taste the apple. Once the desire is strong enough, our thoughts may be occupied with consuming the apple and we start weighing the merits and demerits of consuming the apple now or later</strong>. <span style="color: red;">All these mental experiences are caused by, yet independent of the original object</span>. If the apple is withdrawn, the memory of it may be able to sustain the chain of thoughts for a short time, yet it will <strong><span class="large">eventually cease</span></strong>.<br><br><img src="http://sg.wrs.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0Je56AbIGNEvGQAbPAu4gt./SIG=12m2grp05/EXP=1147433371/**http%3a//www.takingdownwords.com/photos/uncategorized/applephoto.jpg"></div>

Emptiness is not seeing something as void but seeing things as it is - many ppl cling to attachment to forms, that veils them from seeing true reality, so Buddha says 'all forms are illusory'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Form is Emptiness; Emptiness is form.<br><br>This is how I understand and teach it to my charges. If I see that their problem lies in their inablity to let go; I like to quote this phrase.<br><br>You see, many gamblers get into deeper and deeper problems because they cannot get over their losses. The want to win it back. They then go into all sorts of delusions about how they can win it back.<br><br>Even though a glass is filled with water, if it is dirty water, then it is useless water. So form is emptiness.<br><br>Without first emptying a glass full of dirty water you cannot fill it with clean water. So emptiness is form.<br><br>From the examples given; it would suggest that the word form and emptiness is better intepreted as "of substance" and "of no substance."<br><br>What you consider as substance can be "empty;" of no substance. What you consider as "empty;" can be substantive.<br><br>========================<br><br>Form is Emptiness; Emptiness is form.<br><br>At a much deeper level, we consider things like family and children.<br><br>Are we to empty ourselves of our children? After all Form is Emptiness.<br><br>You see, we have many desires for our children. We try to change them from what we perceive as "bad" to "good."<br><br>For example, the worst alcoholics come from families that do not touch alcohol at all on religious grounds. When they grow up the children go "insane." Whereas those that come from families that drink alcohol moderately learn moderation.<br><br>You see form is emptiness.<br><br>Children must be allowed to fulfill their karma. It is better that Parents guide and assist their children along rather than try to change them and by extension, change their karma. Rather than give them what they do not want, you give them what they ask for and need and reject their requests if it is harmful or needless. This hands free approach can be said to be an "empty" approach.<br><br>You see, emptiness is form<br><br>===================================<br><br>We can actually go to deeper and deeper levels of understanding Form is Emptiness; Emptiness is form.</div>

A river does not truly exists on its own as it consists of many streams of water coming and going, that make up its substance. Each of these streams is just as unsubstantial, each consisting of smaller and smaller streams within it as substance. There is no substantial or "real" river - there is only the flowing. We say that the river is empty of a real fixed nature - exhibiting Emptiness. Everything in the Universe (all physical and mental phenomena) exhibits characteristics of Emptiness.<br><br>Another example is a waterfall. A waterfall seen from a distance appears like a shiny solid sheet in one complete piece. But upon closer inspection we see clearly that the "piece" is only a continuous flowing stream of water. There is essentially no fixed "waterfall" - there is only water falling.<br><br>Two Sides Of Emptiness<br>Here is a useful maxim to remember the core concept of Sunyata/emptiness by:<br><br><strong>Sunyata Affirms the Existence of Existence;<br>Sunyata Negates the Self-nature of Existence.</strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">This means that Emptiness does not deny the existence of each and every thing, but it denies the existence of a fixed unchanging self behind each and every thing.</span><br><br>Using a river again as an example, we can say that a river (made up of many small streams) exists dependently or conditionally on the streams - this illustrates the first aspect of the above maxim. Because the river flows on and on (keeps changing), or unconditionally (as it has no unchanging identity or self) - this illustrates the second aspect of the maxim.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emptiness And The Middle Way</span><br>The above two aspects of Emptiness should be realized together as they balance to show the Middle Way beyond all extremes.<br><br>Realizing the first aspect of Emptiness without the second can lead one to be greedy and selfish-falsely, believing that all pleasures and material things are "real" and lasting.<br><br>Realizing the second aspect without the first can lead one to be pessimistic, passive or immoral, falsely believing that nothing is worth striving for as everything is hollow and meaningless.<br><br>It is therefore very important to see both these aspects together in order to function with Wisdom in a balanced way in everyday life. One should learn to perceive everything as they are while knowing the true nature of their existence. One who realizes Emptiness is able to live positively with great ease and freedom, treasuring everything without attachment.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emptiness Is Not Nothingness</span><br>Emptiness does not mean physical or mental nothingness - it is the law of total openness and infinite possibilities. Emptiness, is like the vast clear sky that allows clouds, birds, planes etc. to come in and go by, allowing infinite phenomena to occur within it. Emptiness is thus infinitely more than everything that the unenlightened can perceive. It is because of Emptiness that everything, including ourselves, can continually change for the better. Anything can transform into something else when the right combination of causes and conditions is present. Similarly, anyone can become Enlightened if one cultivates spiritually. Emptiness is thus a teaching full of hope.<br><br>Emptiness Mind And Matter<br>Emptiness applies to all physical entities. Much more subtly, it applies to all mental entities (mind-states).<br><br>All physical entities upon closer inspection are only unceasing fluctuations of molecules, of atoms, of electrons, neutrons and protons, of particles, of sub-atomic particles of... energy. All is only infinite manifestations of energy.<br><br>All mental entities upon closer inspection are only processes that change subtly all of the time. For example, we know we have thoughts, but how subtly each though flows to another and another is most unnoticeable to the untrained Mind.<br><br>The Magic Of Emptiness<br><br>Things are entirely what they appear to be,<br>and behind them...<br>there is "nothing."<br><br>Before us is everything but behind everything is nothing substantial (as all is constant change). But everything here is indeed here! And the "nothing" that is behind them is here at the same place and time too!<br><br>Everything the same; Everything distinct.<br>Everything is same in the sense that all are equally empty. However, everything is distinctly different as they manifest in countless forms. "Everything" also refers to all of one's possessions, family, health, wealth, fame etc.<br><br>As in the river analogy (see "Examples of Sunyata"), the river is both here and not here in the same place and time. This applies to everything. The whole wide world that we know is "real yet unreal" at the same time. It is the ultimate "magic trick" that the unenlightened fails to see and be amazed at!<br><br><strong>Benefits Of Realizing Emptiness</strong><br>Our Ignorance is seeing the illusory as being "too real" - we see the constantly changing as unchanging and become attached to the unsubstantial. Ignorance of not seeing the unreality of the self creates suffering centering around our false sense of self. There is no hint of a fixed self in anything physical or mental. There is no "I, you, my, your..." When self is realized to be empty and unreal, all opposing differences disappear - all are seen just as they are in their naked reality without empty labels, judgments or prejudice.<br><br>Being able to apply Emptiness in daily life brings unlimited ease and happiness as one becomes free of the burden of attachment. Realizing Emptiness is to attain the Wisdom of selflessness (to see the non-self of everything). The functioning of selflessness is Compassion. Thus, true Wisdom is compassionate and true Compassion is wise - they are interdependently linked. Both perfection of Wisdom and Compassion form the twin peaks of spiritual cultivation or Enlightenment.<br><br>As we familiarize ourselves with Emptiness, we gradually open our minds and free ourselves from the bonds of Ignorance that misconceives reality. In time, we will eliminate all Ignorance, anger, attachment, pride, jealousy and other disturbing attitudes from our Mind. By doing so, we cease to create the destructive actions motivated by them. We will thus be freed from all problems. In other words, realizing Emptiness brings True Happiness.<br><br><strong>As a summary, a practical application of Emptiness in everyday life would be:<br><br>To Treasure Everything<br>(in this moment)<br>as All is Transient;<br><br>To Be Unattached to Everything<br>(in this moment)<br>as All Is Transient.</strong><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

It teaches that one should not look at anything with judgement. That is to say, one do not conclude if it is Good or Bad.  "Form is Emptiness and Emptiness is Form" would suggest that there is both Good and Bad in everything. The is nothing perfectly good and nothing perfectly bad in this world.
