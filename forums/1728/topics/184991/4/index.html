Bottomline is, do we justify those desire as a form of need? If so, how much "needs" will we satisfy?<br><br>FYI, if you've attended enough Dharma Talks, you'll notice many venerables will actually quote modern technologies in their dharma preaching, so that people like us will understand.  Are you saying that they will not gain enlightenment also?  Of course, myself will not gain enlightenment so soon, I'm still learning.  Maybe you'll attain enlightenment before me, perhaps this life? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>Let'snot jump to conclusions and talk about who will get enlightenment first... in not seeking achievements we achieve?<br><br>Sure at a Dharma talk, the Ven will talk at the level of the audience. How will he know what kind of education the audience has?<br><br>This is a forum, it is interactive. There is no need to talk baby talk.<br><br>Certainly Buddha is not suggesting that people give up all their needs and live on bare necessities? Otherwise, we all go back and live in the forests.<br><br>Surely Buddha is not suggesting that science stop all their scientific discoveries. No we do not need anything else, to want to desire is suffering so stop discovering, so stop experimenting?<br><br>So what is it? Have needs and wants... you can have needs and wants, but... but what? What does Buddha says about that? But what?<br><br>Like your EZlink card example.... why use easy link card? Why not walk? and even further, why walk? why not just stay at home? Why stay at home, why not just live in the forest?<br><br>You see if you push to the end, you get why stay alive? Why not just get it over with? To be alive is to have needs and wants. Have needs and wants but.... but what? What does Buddha say?</div>

Because with a billion dollars, you can<br>buy all type of factories.<br>The fourth child is smarter, he said, "If I have a wish, I'll wish<br>for 3 wishes. In my first wish, I can wish for an ice-cream factory,<br>and for my second wish, I can wish for a billion dollars, and for the<br>third wish, I can wish back my 3 wishes." Because with endless<br>wishes, you can get what you want again and again.<br>The fifth child bet all the four children. His wish was more profound<br>and brought more happiness. He said, "If I have a wish, I wish I<br>don't need any more wishes ever again, end of wishing." Because<br>without wishes, one let go, that is contentment and freedom, freedom<br>of desire. If one still needs wishes, one is not happy with the<br>present situation. Worldly beings would rather choose to be the forth<br>child, but the fifth child IS the idea of Buddha.<br><br>/\<br></div>

We are so poor that we mess up government statistics. We live frugally on the unsolicited, simple gifts from our lay supporters. However, infrequently, we may be offered something special.<br><br>I had helped a Thai man with a personal problem. Out of gratitude, he said to me: "Sir, I would like to give you something for your personal use. What can I get you for the amount of five hundred baht?" It was usual to quote the amount when making such an offering, to avoid any misunderstanding. Since I wouldn't think what I wanted straight away and he was in a hurry, we agreed that I could tell him the next day when he returned.<br><br>Before this occured, I was a happy little monk. Now I started to contemplate what I wanted. I made a list. The list grew. Soon, five hundred baht wasn't enough. But it was so difficult to take anything off the list. Wants had appeared out of nowhere and solidified into absolute necessities. And the list kept growing. Now, five thousand baht wasn't sufficient!<br><br>Seeing what was happening, I threw my wish list away. The next day, I told my benefactor to give five hundred baht to the monastery building fund or to some other good cause. I didn't want it. What I wanted most of all was to regain the rare contenment I had had the day before. When I had no money, nor the means to get anything, that was the time when all my wishes were fulfilled. Wanting has no end to it. Even one billion baht isn't enough, nor a billion dollars. But freedom from wanting has an end. It is when you want nothing. Contentment is the only time you have enough.<br><br>- Who Ordered This Truckload of Dung? : Inspiring Stories for Welcoming Life's Difficulties (Ajahn Brahm)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Ven P.A. Payutto taught:<br><br>Contentment<br><br>While not technically an economic concern, I would like to add a few comments on the subject of contentment. Contentment is a virtue that has often been misunderstood and, as it relates to consumption and satisfaction, it seems to merit some discussion.<br><br>The tacit objective of economics is a dynamic economy where every demand and desire is supplied and constantly renewed in a never-ending and ever-growing cycle. The entire mechanism is fueled by tanha. From the Buddhist perspective, this tireless search to satisfy desires is itself a kind of suffering. Buddhism proposes the cessation of this kind of desire, or contentment, as a more skillful objective.<br><br>Traditional economists would probably counter that without desire, the whole economy would grind to a halt. However, this is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of contentment. People misunderstand contentment because they fail to distinguish between the two different kinds of desire, tanha and chanda. We lump them together, and in proposing contentment, dismiss them both. A contented person comes to be seen as one who wants nothing at all. Here lies our mistake.<br><br>Obviously, people who are content will have fewer wants than those who are discontent. However, a correct definition of contentment must be qualified by the stipulation that it implies only the absence of artificial want, that is tanha; chanda, the desire for true well-being, remains. In other words, the path to true contentment involves reducing the artificial desire for sense-pleasure, while actively encouraging and supporting the desire for quality of life.<br><br>These two processes -- reducing tanha and encouraging chanda -- are mutually supportive. When we are easily satisfied in material things, we save time and energy that might otherwise be wasted on seeking objects of tanha. The time and energy we save can, in turn, be applied to the development of well-being, which is the objective of chanda. When it comes to developing skillful conditions, however, contentment is not a beneficial quality. Skillful conditions must be realized through effort. Too much contentment with regards to chanda easily turns into complacency and apathy. In this connection, the Buddha pointed out that his own attainment of enlightenment was largely a result of two qualities: unremitting effort, and lack of contentment with skillful conditions.

Improve living conditions, yet at the same time, be contented with what IS at the moment.<br><br>Nowadays everyone in society is trying to get somewhere, and when they got that somewhere, very soon or immediately he will want to get another 'somewhere' again. He continually miss the present moment. That is craving, desire, and dukkha. What Buddhism teaches is not that you cannot work for the future, but that be continuously 'in that moment' when you are working towards the future. Not to see this moment as a means to an end, but be fully PRESENT in the moment. That is contentment. It is also mindfulness, because a sort of clarity arises when you are no longer seeking the future or grasp onto the past but mindful of what IS at the moment. Another example, other than desire, is resistance. When we meet a situation we don't like, we resist it and we create a lot of useless mental noise 'I want to get out of this situation... I cant be here!' or 'how I wish tomorrow is a public holiday'. That is also dukkha. Thus, you can see, the modern materialistic world is not in fact contradictory with what the Buddha taught and every moment we can practise the dharma.<br><br>I know of many enlightened people who are very rich anyway. Many of them did not become monks or nuns but continued to stay in society.</div>
