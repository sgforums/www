            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>"When I had no money, nor the means to get anything, that was the time when all my wishes were fulfilled.</blockquote>Buddha never asked people to not have money. We must be able to differentiate the role of a monk and a lay practitioner, and the Buddha clearly differentiated it for us. In fact, the Buddha did gave this sermon before:<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2a.htm" rel="nofollow">Seize The Day</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In the Noble Eight-fold Path[1] taught by Buddha, the Right Action[1] advocates practitioners of Buddhism to pursue all that are virtuous with zeal and a commitment to progress. Such should be the correct attitude whether in our career or in pursuit of the ultimate truth. The following short story may help to illustrate Buddha's teaching more clearly.</span><br><br>Early one morning Buddha and one of his chief disciples, Ananda, set out from Jetavana to seek alms. They came to the city of Sravasti. As they entered the city gate and were walking along a path by the city wall, they saw an aged couple.<br><br>Their backs were crooked and they could neither straighten themselves nor move about. They were dressed in rags, appearing unhygienic and well worn with age: frail, toothless, grey hair, hard of hearing and poor eyesight. They lived next to a pile of rubbish by the derelict wall of a sleazy alley. They crouched close to each other, facing a small fire for warmth. With eyes only for each other, they resembled a pair of old swans that cannot bear to part.<br><br>The Buddha turned his head and asked Ananda, "Did you see that aged couple by the wall and the warmth of the burning cow dung?"<br><br>Ananda replied, "World Honoured One, I see them."<br><br>The Buddha continued, "If this old couple had been determined and diligent when they were young and strong, regardless of the nature of their work as long as it is legitimate, perhaps at this age they are already amongst the wealthiest class of people in Sravasti. On the other hand, if they had chosen to renounce their worldly life to learn and cultivate the right path with diligence, perhaps they would have already attained the Arhat [2] by now.<br><br>Even if they were not that determined when they were young, but are ambitious and diligent only at a later age and they work with the Right Action, perhaps they are already amongst the second wealthiest class of people in Sravasti. Similarly, if on the other hand, they had chosen to renounce their worldly life to learn and cultivate the right path with diligence, perhaps they would have already attained the Anagami [2].<br><br>Worse still, should they only realise about diligence and progress when they are already at their middle age, and only then began to work with the Right Action, perhaps they are already amongst the third wealthiest class of people in Sravasti. If they had chosen to renounce their worldly life to learn and cultivate the right path with diligence, perhaps they would have already attained the Sakrdagamin [2].<br><br>However, they did none of the above. Instead, they spent their life times loving and possessing each other, and wasted the most useful time of their lives. That is why today they are helpless and have no way out of their predicament. They live in poor conditions, are penniless and there is nothing that they can do. For them it is a living death, having to face the retribution of their own doing, and nobody took any pity on them. What meaning is there in a life like this?"<br><br>In order to encourage people not to fall into the same predicament, the Buddha said, "Ananda, always remember to advise and guide people:<br><br>In youth, be determined, diligent, and thrifty and strive to acquire knowledge.<br><br>Maintain a mind that is distant and unchained from desire and be focused on building a career during the prime of life.<br><br>In middle age, realise a stable career that is based on diligence, zeal, progress and Right Action.<br><br>Always use the wealth meaningfully to benefit self and others.<br><br>Do not wait till old age and rely on the people's benevolence like the aged swan."<br><br>The above incident demonstrates the compassion of the Buddha in caring for sentient beings and encouraging people to be determined in striving for progress, regardless of whether one is concerned with building a career, or one who has renounced the worldly life to learn and cultivate the right path. His only wish was for all sentient beings to be distant from suffering and attain happiness in life.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Notes:<br>[1] Noble Eight-fold Path:<br>1. Right Speech<br>2. Right Action<br>3. Right Livelihood<br>4. Right Effort<br>5. Right Mindfulness<br>6. Right Concentration<br>7. Right Views<br>8. Right Thought<br><br>[2] The four stages in Hinayana sanctity:<br>- 1st stage - srota-apanna<br>- 2nd stage - sakrdagamin<br>- 3rd stage - anagami-phala<br>- 4th stage - arhat, the highest stage</span></blockquote>------------<br><br><blockquote>Wanting has no end to it. Even one billion baht isn't enough, nor a billion dollars. But freedom from wanting has an end. It is when you want nothing. Contentment is the only time you have enough."<br><br>This kind of answers. It is an answer that is not in touch with reality.</blockquote>It is ALWAYS in touch with reality - not a time that is not in touch with reality. Contentment is true wealth because wealth is relative and dependant on what you perceive as enough - and enough is only when you are contented. Simple? This kind of statement is really direct and unrefutable - just as things like 'all things that arise will have an end' this kind of statement that even low IQ people will probably be able to understand.<br><br>And as the article above mentioned, which is a sermon by the Buddha, the Buddha taught that everyone should have the zeal and commitment to progress. It does NOT mean that being contented means we can slack - that is loth. That is laziness, and it is a fetter.<br><br>See my previous reply:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...What Buddhism teaches is not that you cannot work for the future, but that be continuously 'in that moment' when you are working towards the future. Not to see this moment as a means to an end, but be fully PRESENT in the moment. That is contentment. It is also mindfulness, because a sort of clarity arises when you are no longer seeking the future or grasp onto the past but mindful of what IS at the moment...</span><br><br><blockquote>Straightway people will think that he is asking people to be monks. That the only way is to be a monk. That the only way to happiness is being a monk.</blockquote>Of course not. Lay practitioners can just be as happy and be as enlightened. But a monk and a lay practitioner has different roles - a monk focus on helping the lay practitioners in propagating dharma and the lay practitioners help the monks by providing them what they need economically. We are interdependant.<br><br><blockquote>It does not touch on the issues of human motivations, for example.</blockquote>Oh... isnt the article/sermon that I provided you just above inspiring, motivational enough? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Want some more? There are a lot more motivational things that the Buddha said.<br><br>But ultimately we must never depend on such 'motivational', 'inspiring' things because even they are impermanent and unsatisfactory.<br><br>Exerpt from NOW IS THE KNOWING by Venerable Ajahn Sumedho:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">....Reflect on your own life and the cycles of nature. Just observe what delights and what depresses. See how we can feel very positive or very negative. Notice how we want to attach to beauty or to pleasant feelings or to inspiration. It's really nice to feel inspired isn't it? "Buddhism is the greatest religion of them all" or "When I discovered the Buddha I was so happy, it's a wonderful discovery!" When we get a little bit douvtful, a little bit depressed, we go and read an inspiring book and get high. But remember, getting high is an impermanent condition, it's like getting happy, you have to keep doing it, sustaining it and after you keep doing something over and over again you no longer feel happy with it. How many sweets can you eat? At first they make you happy and then they make you sick. So depending on religious inspiration is not enough. If you attach to inspiration then when you get fed up with Buddhism you'll go off and find some new thing to inspire you...</span></blockquote></div>

No. By all means, make use of your life and your intelligence, and obtain all these things legally and honestly. The point is to be contented with what you have.

No. <strong>By all means, make use of your life and your intelligence, and obtain all these things legally and honestly.</strong> The point is to be contented with what you have. Do not become a slave of craving: that is the message. Reflect on the weaknesses of beings so that you can get the most from your body and life before you are too sick and old to practice and can only depart from this useless corpse.</span><br><br>Another one:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Reply with Quote<br>Ven P.A. Payutto taught:<br><br>Contentment<br><br>While not technically an economic concern, I would like to add a few comments on the subject of contentment. Contentment is a virtue that has often been misunderstood and, as it relates to consumption and satisfaction, it seems to merit some discussion.<br><br>The tacit objective of economics is a dynamic economy where every demand and desire is supplied and constantly renewed in a never-ending and ever-growing cycle. The entire mechanism is fueled by tanha. From the Buddhist perspective, this tireless search to satisfy desires is itself a kind of suffering. Buddhism proposes the cessation of this kind of desire, or contentment, as a more skillful objective.<br><br><strong>Traditional economists would probably counter that without desire, the whole economy would grind to a halt. However, this is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of contentment. People misunderstand contentment because they fail to distinguish between the two different kinds of desire, tanha and chanda. We lump them together, and in proposing contentment, dismiss them both. A contented person comes to be seen as one who wants nothing at all. Here lies our mistake.<br><br>Obviously, people who are content will have fewer wants than those who are discontent. However, a correct definition of contentment must be qualified by the stipulation that it implies only the absence of artificial want, that is tanha; chanda, the desire for true well-being, remains. In other words, the path to true contentment involves reducing the artificial desire for sense-pleasure, while actively encouraging and supporting the desire for quality of life.</strong><br><br>These two processes -- reducing tanha and encouraging chanda -- are mutually supportive. When we are easily satisfied in material things, we save time and energy that might otherwise be wasted on seeking objects of tanha. The time and energy we save can, in turn, be applied to the development of well-being, which is the objective of chanda. When it comes to developing skillful conditions, however, contentment is not a beneficial quality. Skillful conditions must be realized through effort. Too much contentment with regards to chanda easily turns into complacency and apathy. In this connection, the Buddha pointed out that his own attainment of enlightenment was largely a result of two qualities: unremitting effort, and lack of contentment with skillful conditions.
