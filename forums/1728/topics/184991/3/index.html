But in the context of the First Noble Truth, dukkha also means 'imperfection', 'impermanence', 'emptiness', 'insubstantiality'. There are three kinds of suffering:<br><br>* Ordinary Suffering--dukkha-dukkha<br>* Suffering produced by Change--virapinama-dukkha<br>* Suffering as Conditioned States--samkara-dukkha<br><br>Ordinary Suffering--dukkha-dukkha<br>There are all kinds of suffering in life: birth, old age, sickness, death, association with unpleasant persons and conditions, separation from beloved ones and pleasant conditions, not getting what one desires, grief, lamentation, distress--all forms of physical and mental suffering.<br>Suffering produced by Change--virapinama-dukkha<br>Pleasant and happy feelings or conditions in life are not permanent. Sooner or later they change. When they change they may produce pain, suffering, unhappiness or dissappointment. This vicissitude is considered viparimana-dukkha.<br>Suffering as Conditioned States--samkara-dukkha<br>An 'individual', an 'I' or a 'self' is a combination of ever-changing mental and physical forces which can be divided into five groups or 'aggregates' pancakkhandha. Suffering as conditioned states is produced by attachment to these five aggregates:<br><br>* Matter--rupakkhandha<br>* Sensations--vedanakkhandha<br>* Perceptions--sannakkhandha<br>* Mental Formations--sankharakkhandha<br>* Consciousness--vinnanakkhandha</div>

Like children in a toy shop, they crave for all the attractive things they see around them. But like children too, they soon become dissatisfied with what they already have and desire for more. Sometimes, they can hardly eat or sleep until they get what they want. Yet when they succeeded in getting what they want, they may still find their happiness short-lived. Many will be too worried for the safety and condition of their new possessions to enjoy it. Then when the object they possess eventually breaks into pieces and has to be thrown away, they will suffer its loss even more.<br><br>so u see When we have obtained something that we desire, we may want more and more of it and so greed arises.It like filling the " black hole" .It never enough.We thought that by having all these things will give everlasting happiness.It never happen.<br><br>take for another example A very poor, underprivileged person might think that it would be wonderful to have a car or a television set and, should he acquire them, would at first feel very happy and satisfied. Now, if such happiness were permanent, as long as he had the car and the TV set he would remain happy. But he does not; his happiness goes away. After a few months he wants another kind of car; if he has the money, he will buy a better television set. The old things, the same objects that once gave him much satisfaction, now cause dissatisfaction.<br><br>so u see what we really need is not that much however what we want is never enough.<br><br><blockquote>b]Pleasant and happy feelings or conditions in life are not permanent.[/b] You go for lunch with colleagues and that makes you happy.

You cannot hold on to some parts of Buddha's teaching but ignore some other parts. What are you afraid of?<br><br>We now understand motivations in terms of needs. You are motivated to do something because you have a need to fulfill. After your basic needs are met you try to fulfill your higher level needs.<br><br>Everybody knows that we all live "a few decades;" even if the world is permanent, we are not.<br><br>You are right only if you say "some" people treat the world as if it is permanent and live their lives as if they are going to live forever.<br><br>There is of course also biological needs. These are recurring needs and whether you are under the illusion that the world is permanent or not you need to eat sleep and have sex among other things.<br><br>You need to look at Buddhism in a more profound way and discard all those observations made thousand of years ago and replace them with modern observations.<br><br>You cannot on the one hand say that the world is an illusion and changing except Buddhist scriptures.<br><br>Understand my words: "I am not against Buddhism."

A higher form of needs are considered as desire, which is never ending.  Example, you think you need a 1.6 Altis to take you from A to B and back.  Once you have it, and you may think that you need a 2.0L Picnic cos the space is bigger and can accomodate more of your shopping. Then next, you may think you need a Beemer for safety reason.

If so, how much "needs" will we satisfy?<br><br>FYI, if you've attended enough Dharma Talks, you'll notice many venerables will actually quote modern technologies in their dharma preaching, so that people like us will understand.
