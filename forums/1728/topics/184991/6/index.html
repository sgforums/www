It is nothing less than seeing the actual state of things<br>as they are; it is knowing that the true nature of mind is the true nature<br>of everything; and it is realizing that the true nature of mind is the<br>absolute truth.<br><br>Dudjom Rinpoche says: Â“The View is the comprehension of the naked awareness,<br>within which everything is contained: sensory perception and phenomenal<br>existence, samsara and nirvana. This awareness has two aspects: Â‘emptinessÂ’<br>as the absolute, and Â‘appearancesÂ’ or Â‘perceptionÂ’ as the relative.Â”<br><br>Sogyal Rinpoche<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>More than twenty-five hundred years ago, a man who had been searching for<br>the truth for many, many lifetimes came to a quiet place in northern India<br>and sat down under a tree. He continued to sit under the tree, with immense<br>resolve, and vowed not to get up until he had found the truth.<br><br>At dusk, it is said, he conquered all the dark forces of delusion; and early<br>the next morning, as the planet Venus broke in the dawn sky, the man was<br>rewarded for his age-long patience, discipline, and flawless concentration<br>by achieving the final goal of human existence: enlightenment.<br><br>At that sacred moment, the earth itself shuddered, as if Â“drunk with bliss,Â”<br>and, as the scriptures tell us: Â“No one anywhere was angry, ill or sad; no<br>one did evil, none was proud; the world became quite quiet, as though it had<br>reached full perfection.Â” This man became known as Buddha.<br><br>Sogyal Rinpoche<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok guys I just came back from Jerusalem 2hrs ago. I walk the "Via Dolorosa, Way of Sorrow" or "Way of the Cross". This is the path where Jesus's last walk with the cross. Total 14 stations. From Jesus is condemned till Jesus is placed in the tomb.<br><br>There is nothing mentions about "Ultimate Truth (Emptiness)" on this tour. There is no such teaching or understanding seen on this tour. I seen only history &amp; tourism blend together. The Tour Guide can only confirm Jerusalem is the place where Jesus died, but the actual place is "JUST CULTURE".<br>Jerusalum old city is split into Jews, Arabs &amp; Muslims. Good ingredient for religion tension.<br><br>This is how I feel &amp; think. When I was at "The Wall". This is Jews holliest prayer &amp; wish making place. There is a feelings keep coming up. I can't described it clearly. Very mixed not happy nor sorrow or anything. Maybe just the enviroment. The second place is Station 13. The stone where Jesus's body was taken from the cross &amp; laid there for cleaning. Just full of sorrow feelings. No doubt Jesus have did something that touched people. I will not argue he is a saint. As "God's Son" I think twice because this was a pass down story &amp; how can a women give birth without having a man or science's help. His story I think is highly "Painted". Too many history is not accurate. Some says he came back from death, some say he was poison to sleep for 3 days. His body was told buried as a Jews but was not at the Jews grave. Take away those magical touch in this story, too many points in it is non-logical to modern science or no prove to actually what happened.<br><br>If got chance I would like to visit Hindus Holy place. Heard they have a few millions of Gods to pray. To me seems like too many??</div>

Like children in a toy shop, they crave for all the attractive things they see around them. But like children too, they soon become dissatisfied with what they already have and desire for more. Sometimes, they can hardly eat or sleep until they get what they want. Yet when they succeeded in getting what they want, they may still find their happiness short-lived. Many will be too worried for the safety and condition of their new possessions to enjoy it. Then when the object they possess eventually breaks into pieces and has to be thrown away, they will suffer its loss even more.<br><br>so u see When we have obtained something that we desire, we may want more and more of it and so greed arises.It like filling the " black hole" .It never enough.We thought that by having all these things will give everlasting happiness.It never happen.<br><br>take for another example A very poor, underprivileged person might think that it would be wonderful to have a car or a television set and, should he acquire them, would at first feel very happy and satisfied. Now, if such happiness were permanent, as long as he had the car and the TV set he would remain happy. But he does not; his happiness goes away. After a few months he wants another kind of car; if he has the money, he will buy a better television set. The old things, the same objects that once gave him much satisfaction, now cause dissatisfaction.<br><br>so u see what we really need is not that much however what we want is never enough.<br></div></blockquote>How to cease craving or lessen attachment for sensual pleasure?</div>
