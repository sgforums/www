              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Eric Swedlund Nov. 27, 2017 UA News</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">New grants have launched an in-depth study of East Asian
              Buddhism as one of the signature projects of the UA's Center for Buddhist
              Studies. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Aiming to chart the spread of Buddhism in China and across
              East Asia, University of Arizona researchers are examining distinct traditions
              that developed in the Hangzhou region.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Although Buddhism originated in ancient India, the tradition
              of Chan (Japanese, Zen) Buddhism that developed in Hangzhou from the
              10th century became the basis for East Asian Buddhist practices that
              spread to and flourished in Japan and Korea.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Albert Welter, head of the Department of East Asian Studies,
              has long specialized in Buddhist figures and texts related to the Hangzhou
              region, but only in the last two years did he begin developing a research
              project that seeks to understand Hangzhou in a holistic sense as the foundation
              of East Asian Buddhism. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"My research has been related to Hangzhou for decades,
              but I never thought of myself focusing on the Hangzhou region," Welter
              says. "This project looks at the Hangzhou region as a second homeland for
              Buddhism subsequent to India. Usually the history of Buddhism is told from an
              Indian perspective with little emphasis on East Asian, but that was just the
              first phase. From an East Asian perspective, phase two begins when Buddhism
              recedes in India and is no longer active. At that point, Hangzhou comes into
              its own."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A signature research effort of the UA's new Center for
              Buddhist Studies, the Hangzhou Project aims to develop a new paradigm for the
              study of East Asian Buddhism, replacing an outdated focus presuming India as
              the center of the Buddhist world, with a regional focus on the expansion that
              started in China. Traditional historical and textual study will be augmented
              with digital humanities methodology, including GIS mapping and the creation of
              a "virtual Hangzhou" in collaboration with the UA's new Center for
              Digital Humanities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Earlier, 19th-century European pioneers of Buddhist studies,
              following the model of Protestant Christianity, were mostly preoccupied with
              the founder of Buddhism and his original teachings and regarded later forms as
              corruptions of the original message.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Spread of Chinese
              Teachings</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">However, Welter argues, by the 10th century Chinese
              Buddhists became boldly innovative, creating new forms of Buddhism unique to
              the East Asian context and the spread of those new forms became foundational
              for an East Asian Buddhism that was largely independent and only tangentially
              related to its Indian forebears. As the Hangzhou region, located on China's
              east coast at the southern terminus of the ancient Grand Canal, gained
              prominence among both religious pilgrims and trade merchants from Japan and
              Korea, Chinese teachings spread from the hub of the Hangzhou region.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The current project aims to systematically reorient the
              study of East Asian Buddhism as an indigenous form, and not as part of an
              Indian trajectory," Welter says. "The Hangzhou region became a kind
              of 'homeland' for many Buddhists throughout the East Asian region who traced
              their lineages, doctrines and teachings directly to Hangzhou regional Buddhist
              institutions."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Zen, or Chan Buddhism as it is known in China, is the most
              prominent form of East Asian Buddhism and the most common form depicted in
              Western media. In the West, as well as in China, Zen Buddhism is attracting
              increasing attention, which creates an opportune time for a more in-depth study
              of Zen in both the historical and modern contexts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The proposal looks at the vertical aspect, the
              development of Buddhism historically, as well as the horizontal aspect, the
              regional spread," Welter says. "The Hangzhou region is traditionally
              the strongest region of Buddhism in China and it's returning to that place
              today."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Hangzhou, today the capital and most populous city of
              Zhejiang Province, is known for its West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A
              prosperous city for the last millennium, Hangzhou first gained notoriety in the
              Western world through Marco Polo, who visited in the late 13th century and
              called it "without a doubt the finest and most splendid city in the
              world." It also hosted a G20 summit in 2016.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">During the Mao era, from 1949 through 1976, traditional
              Buddhist culture in China was cast aside as socialism and secularism replaced
              religion in the culture, Welter says. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
              that occurred from 1966 to 1976 was particularly brutal toward expressions of
              traditional Chinese culture, including Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Buddhism was virtually destroyed in China, both the
              physical monuments and the culture. Temples went defunct or were repurposed as
              factories or military installations, and for all intents and purposes Buddhism
              no longer existed in China in any real capacity," Welter says. "But
              in the last couple decades, there's been a tremendous revival of Buddhism and
              Buddhist culture, as China rediscovers and reinvents its past."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Last summer, Welter received a $28,500 International Research
              and Program Development, or IRPD, seed grant, co-funded by the UA's offices of
              Research, Discovery &amp; Innovation and Global Initiatives, to launch the
              project.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Partnerships Seen as
              Model</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In May, Welter and six graduate students in East Asian
              studies conducted a research trip to Hangzhou to enlist local support for the
              project and visit many of the region's important sites for initial observations
              and investigations. The idea of the project was "extremely well
              received," says Welter, who formed partnerships among the UA, Zhejiang and
              Jiliang universities in Hangzhou, and the Hangzhou Buddhist Academy. The
              triangulation is a model for how the IRPD grant can work.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Building on the IRPD grant, Welter received a grant from the
              Khyentse Foundation, with $173,292 going to fund three years of the Hangzhou
              project starting in 2018. Additionally, Welter has received a fellowship grant
              from the American Council of Learned Societies, supported by the Taiwan-based
              Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation. With in-kind contributions from the partner
              institutions in Hangzhou, $550,000 has been committed to the project. The
              Khyentse Foundation grant also will support the continuation of the UA's
              Buddhist Studies Lecture Series and initiate a Khyentse Foundation Outstanding
              Student Award.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The grants will fund three-week field research trips for six
              graduate students annually, each working on individual research projects that
              will be presented together at three planned conferences — two that will be held
              in Hangzhou and one at the UA. While in Hangzhou, students will participate in
              workshops/seminars featuring experts in Hangzhou Buddhist culture, many of whom
              will be drawn from universities and academies in the Hangzhou region. Graduate
              students in China also will participate in the project.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"This will create a new and enhanced model for graduate
              training. Our students and the Chinese partners' students will be working
              together, each doing individualized projects in the context of a greater
              whole," Welter says. "These thematic volumes of research that connect
              with everyone will demonstrate to people how they can develop projects in their
              own areas of expertise, and the synergy of the combined research will show a
              comprehensive picture. It's a transition to a team approach.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The combined effort of many people can produce
              something I could never dream of. That's the model that this project and future
              Center for Buddhist Studies projects can offer down the road." </span></p>
