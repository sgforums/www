            <div class='col-md body'>Here is an article I posted about 2 years ago, <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=136868" rel="nofollow">Abortion</a><br><br><blockquote>IMHO and scriptually speaking, Abortion is un-buddhist. Has anyone seen the procedure of abortion? It is very cruel and and images are so gruesome.<br><br>They use a loop shaped steel knife to slice the baby in parts (the hands, limbs, the body etc) and later take the dead baby out. It's the most horrible medical procedure on Earth and I've seen it on video tape. And in the Video, it is said that modern equipments detected that even the 1st stage (1~3 months) the baby could move and have heart beat, which means that it is definitely sentient.<br><br>Even if the child is of low mental capability, or have some organ defects/etc, it is a karma and responsibility that the parents must take even though it takes a lot of courage. More so are those whose babies are healthy! At most, give the baby away for adoption (which is only last-resort). I'm sure there are many people out there who have trouble making babies and are looking forward to adopt a child!<br><br>I would like to share a with you a true story which was told by a Venerable. There was a Venerable who had the powers to know a person's previous existence. There was a couple who had a child with low mental capabilities and they asked the venerable why was that so. The Venerable answered - that child of yours was a drug lord in the previous life and has caused much mental delusions and intoxications to others, and therefore that was his karma. The parents then asked abruptly, if that was the case then why were they affected too? (to have the responsibility to take care of that child). The Venerable continued, "let me finish explaining. You two were his accomplice in selling the drugs while he was the mastermind and therefore it was your karmic consequence for having him as your child." Therefore I think whatever child was borned, that was his karma, by karmic association. He should accept it, give extra love and patience to bringing up their child.<br><br>The abortion rates are simply unacceptable. I can't imagine myself being one of the babies subject to the cruel and torturous abortion procedures.<br><br>Those who had abortions, there are a few suggestions by Buddhist Venerables for karmic clearance: Do daily repentance*, help promote anti-killing, anti-abortion, through any means, and transference of merits (accumulated throughout one's entire life) to the deceased foetus.<br><br>I would encourage people to know more about abortion -<br>those who are not weak hearted can watch the whole abortion procedure (<strong>Warning: very gruesome images!</strong>): <a href="http://old.abortionno.org/realaudio/hrdtruthdsl.rm" rel="nofollow">http://old.abortionno.org/realaudio/hrdtruthdsl.rm</a><br><br>less gruesome alternative which explains accurately the abortion procedures, etc ~ "Pro Life Doctor Speaks Out"<br><a href="http://www.abortiontv.com/Movies/ProLifeDoctorsSpeakOut.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abortiontv.com/Movies/ProLifeDoctorsSpeakOut.htm</a> - information about the video<br>working video links (outdated links on that page):<br><a href="http://old.abortionno.org/realaudio/hrdtruthdsl.rm" rel="nofollow">http://old.abortionno.org/realaudio/hrdtruthdsl.rm</a><br><a href="http://old.abortionno.org/realaudio/hrdtruthdsl.rm" rel="nofollow">http://old.abortionno.org/realaudio/hrdtruthdsl.rm</a><br><br>*Repentance verses:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All the evil karma that I have committed in the past,<br><br>Arising from my aeons of greed, anger and ignorance,<br><br>Committed by my body, speech and mind,<br>Now I repent before the Buddha.</span><br><br>Ideally for repentance practise is to chant 108 times, each time bowing down to the Buddha.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Buddhism, the unborn baby has consciousness and to abort is similar to killing the baby. Therefore in Buddhism, abortion should be avoided to the best of our abilities and if we choose to abort due to circumstances we still have to be aware or and understand that there are karmic consequences following our descision and do our best to help the aborted child (i.e dedicating one whole life's merits to the aborted child, repentance, etc etc as listed above)<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no4d.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no4d.htm</a><br><br>8. Abortion is legal in some countries. Does Jen Chen Buddhism support abortion? What are the retributions from the karma of abortion?<br><br>Jen Chen Buddhism advocates contraception, not abortion.<br>Jen Chen Buddhism advocates the observance of the Five Precepts: to abstain from (1) killing, (2) stealing, (3) sexual misconduct, (4) false speech and (5) consumption of all kinds of intoxicants. To abstain from killing is the first precept and that means to avoid taking the life away from any living beings. All killings are sinful, especially the killing of human beings since they are of the highest order amongst all living things on earth. As viviparous animals, the human embryo is considered a human being. Therefore, one who has aborted a foetus has committed an act of killing.<br><br>Jen Chen Buddhism absolutely does not support abortion because it is an act of killing. The retribution of killing is to suffer in hell. Moreover, the consciousness of the foetus whom has been deprived of his birth and caused to suffer in his killing, will be engulfed in hatred and anger. Thus, the collective negative karma of killing will lead to a common retribution, resulting in calamities among humanity.<br><br>Jen Chen Buddhism hopes that humanity accepts contraception and objects to abortion. It is in this way that humanity can have happiness and bliss.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2e.htm</a><br><br>6. Is abortion an act of killing?<br><br>It is the killing of one's own flesh and blood.<br><br>Abortion is not only an act of killing, it is the taking of a human life. Moreover, it is not only taking a human life, but the killing of one's own flesh and blood.</blockquote></div>

I am conscious of my existence now, just as I was conscious back when I was 3 years old... I believe I even retain a scrape of memory and consciousness when I was still an infant (though kinda hazy). But at which point do I start to have consciousness of <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> life?<br><br>When my wife was pregnant with our first kid. Her gynaecologist did routine ultrasound scans... That was when I 'see' my first born daughter for the first time; a tadpole-like thing measuring perhaps 2 cm, and complete with a heartbeat to boot. I remembered very clearly that the specialist gynaecologist told us that even foetuses of this size can start to dream.... In other words, a foetus 2 cm long can start to have consciousness.<br><br>I also read from some Buddhist works that the consciousness (the ongoing one, the one that we need to liberate from samsara) gets inplanted into a newly formed foetus as soon as it is formed...</div>

I do not understand what you mean.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...One need not be a Christian or even a believer in God to KNOW that taking an innocent human life is wrong. The Hippocratic Oath, from the 4th century B.C., declares: "...Nor will I give a woman a pessary to procure abortion." Until recently, this oath was taken by every physician as he entered his practice. Sadly, this is no longer the case. After 6000 years of keeping inviolate a human life in the womb, our "modern" society has decided that some lives are more important than others. We have lost our moorings..</span></div>

We should not simply kill a child just because he has something lacking of an ordinary child.<br><br>Thirdly if the child poses a danger to the mother's life or in certain circumstances that abortion is to be taken it should be understood that there are karmic consequences for aborting the child and one must take the necessary steps as a Buddhist to clear our karma and help the aborted child (as explained in the previous post).<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A medical practitioner, such as Oxford Mushroom, may further point out that doctors usually practice abortions so as to uphold the hippocratic oath.

In the case of saving mother's life during emergency situations, nevertheless there is karma for killing although the level of karma may be different for killing the baby for other unnecessary reasons (i.e due to unwanted babies). A big problem is many people abort the babies with excuses of medical symptom but in actuality it is just a fictitious excuse. Anyway so I was saying whatever the reasons for aborting the baby there is karma involved, so if one has aborted the baby one has to practise the things that can clear our and the babies' karma.</div>

But like I explained if abortion is to be undertaken one must understand that even so, there are karma involved and therefore one has to do lots of purification practices and dedicate merits to the baby so as to help ourselves and the baby clear our karma and hopefully the baby wld be reborn in virtuous realms.</div>
