Since between 1 to 3 months they already show signs of heartbeat, movement, and sense perception. 4 months old already have baby that are prematurely born. Lots of babies are born at 6th month and looks very healthy.</blockquote>Stating that you are overgeneralising. Not all babies are born healthty and there are those whose birth will finally result in death soon.</div>

Extensively tests were taken to ensure that the baby was not the unfortunate 25% of failure but the test results showed that the baby will not survive till birth (only 10% will survive but will eventually die within hours of birth due to genetics defects). The baby was aborted when he/she was in the 16 weeks.<br><br>The second abortion was due to no heartbeat when doing a routine ultra-sound.<br><br>My question to the threadstarted is that am i building very bad karma because i have aborted my 1st baby? The reason for abortion was due to medical reasons (if continue pregnancy, there will be dangers to the mother).<br><br>Some background on the Medical condition:<br>- The genetics condition is Known as Bart Hydrops which affects the baby.<br>- The parents must suffer from the same genetics diease known as thalasymia (sic) where one of the two oxygen carrying red blood cells is not carrying oxygen.<br>- There are two types of thalasiymia -Type A and Type B.<br>- My wife and i suffered from Type A.<br>- Bart Hydrops refer to no oxygen carrying Red Blood cells in the baby.<br><br>Pls help explain whether i have committed great sins in aborting my baby in the first abortion based on the above medical conditions.<br>Thanks.<br><br>Regards,<br>Paefans.</div></blockquote>Hi Paefans,<br><br>Just to share my opinion on your queries.<br><br>I guess whether or not have you commit a <span style="font-style: italic;">great sin</span> depends on your understanding of kamma. It's sad to say the norm buddhists out there had been seeing kamma as an invisible force of nature or justice that is supposedly to bring justice out of a person's deed. Now this would make the Buddha's definition of kamma sounds like determinism which is definitely untrue. Buddha's idea of kamma is about <strong>conditioning factor</strong> rather than determining factor.<br><br>When the Buddha had advised us on the first precept, to avoid killing, it was aimed to cultivate our mind to at least not to have the thought of killing due to acting on it frequently, so as our mind will from there, generate the thought of <span style="font-style: italic;">to act for the welfare and happiness of all beings</span>.<br><br>Now being said this, how many times have you aborted? I don't believe it will be so high of a frequency that it turns into a habit right? In fact I believe both your wife and yourself would be very disappointed and even frustrated with yourselves.<br><br>The abortions that you'd done were carried out due to medical background and in no way I think that you'd done so due to a deliberate act in trying to shed off the responsibility as parents.<br><br>Now I believe that both your wife and yourself shouldn't be tied down by this "had we done great sins" at the back of your mind. Because having this negative thought, I believe it will hinder rather than complement your marriage life. Having the little ones in a well-built family is part and parcel of lives, but over blaming for the lost of them is definitely not a constructive element in building up a happy family. The self blame could eventually become finger-pointing.<br><br>AEN pointed out that you could do some repentance, it may be good, but I don't see the necessity our of it. You may have deliberate aborted the child but it is done in a forced circumstance. You could however dedicate merits to the unborn child while you are doing your chanting service daily (I assume you have?). Or while making a dana (donation) to your local monastry and/or ordain monks and/or nuns, utter this with sincerity in your mind: <span style="font-style: italic;">May the merits of the dana I had performed be dedicated to my unborn child. May he be well and happy.</span><br><br>And if any person tells you that certain people performing rituals for unborn children, really, please don't entertain them. To the best of my knowledge, there isn't any scriptures that says about rituals for unborn children. Rather, business-minded people see a market nowadays that the abortion rate is getting higher and making use of the trend to make money out of it. They might use your guilt as a bait to engage future such services.<br><br>As buddhist, we should refrain ourselves from unethical and unbuddhistic practices and I think giving dana to the local monastry and the monk is simple and good enough way to dedicate merits.<br><br>And by saying monastry, I don't mean those "fake" ones, but rather those that either really putting in effort in promoting Buddhism, or at least have decent and well learned monks and not those that simply sit and wait for dana.<br><br>As for sinweiy whose idea prone to determinism, well, probably the child did something grievious in his previous life to <span style="font-style: italic;">have determined</span> to have his end in this manner in this life. I mean we definitely won't know. And hence I don't recommend in speculate that child is creditor; parents are debtors.<br><br>And to Herzog_Hwei, I believe AEN is either a very fortunate kid to have little or none of these type of sufferings be happened to anyone around him or he really is a highly cultivated being to have stick to the principle of the Dhamma.<br><br>Let's not argue for the sake of argueing shall we?<br><br>=)</div>

I also made a point that 25% of fetuses in Singapore are aborted, and it wouldn't make sense that much of the numbers are aborted due to health reasons but usually they are aborted due to unwillingness and other avoidable reasons.<br><br>In any case I also have to make a point that even if abortion is done under circumstances such as health reasons, we cannot just say there will not be karmic effects.. as Yamizi is said, karma isn't just a system to judge a person. The act of killing the baby, causing tremendous pain, taking away life, itself has karma even though it might be done under various circumstances. The same goes for euthanasia, even if choices are made due to that circumstance it doesn't mean no karma will be created. So even though the karmic effects may not be the same as, say abortion done out of unwillingness to bear a child, we should bear in mind that all abortions will result in some form of karma, and therefore, we should under such circumstances try to lighten our karma and his karma and dedicate merits to the child.</div>

In this paper, we studied the effect of abortion legislation on abortion trends in Singapore. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Ministry of Health, Singapore, collects data on all abortions performed in Singapore. These data have been analyzed and are presented in this paper. RESULTS: The liberalization of abortion legislation resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of abortions performed beginning in 1974. The rate peaked at 23,512 abortions in 1985, and in fact, 35% of all pregnancies were terminated in 1985. The introduction of mandatory abortion counseling in 1986 resulted in a decline in the number of abortions to 16,476 in 1993 with only 24.6% of pregnancies being terminated. The teenage abortion rate was 0.2 per 1000 female teenagers under 20 years of age in 1970. With the liberalization of abortions, the rate reached a peak of 13.7 per 1000 female teenagers in 1985. In 1993, the teenage abortion rate was 9.5%. The proportion of nulliparous women seeking abortion has increased phenomenally from 0.5% in 1976 to 40.6% in 1993. Close to 95% of the women seeking abortions in 1993 did so for social reasons, 3.7% for medical reasons, and 2.0% for failed contraception (Table 3). CONCLUSION: Mandatory abortion counseling and a change in the government policy which now encourages Singaporeans to have more children if they can afford it, have resulted in a decrease in the number of abortions being performed. The problems of teenage abortions, nulliparous abortions, and repeated abortions need to be further addressed.<br><br>PMID: 9551373 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</blockquote></div>
