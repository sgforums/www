              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">The concept of Nirvana is
              more than 2500 years old. Throughout the centuries various scholars and
              philosophers tried to explain this concept using their limited knowledge.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>In fact the concept of
              Nirvana is much more wide and difficult to explain in mundane terms. The
              Nirvana concept is often misunderstood and sometimes misused (eg - Nirvana Rock
              Band, Nirvana Night Club) in the Western world. Some Western scholars have
              tried to interpret it as a sensational feeling or like orgasm which was
              incorrect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>The concept of Nirvana was
              originally explained by the Lord Buddha (566-486 BC). His Lordship reached
              Enlightenment, at the age of 35, awakening to the true nature of reality, which
              is Nirvana (Absolute Truth). The word Nirvana comes from the root meaning 'to
              blow out' and refers to the extinguishing of the fires of greed, hatred and
              delusion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>When these emotional and
              psychological defilements are destroyed by wisdom, the mind becomes free,
              radiant and joyful and at death one is no longer subject to rebirth. Nirvana is
              the ultimate happiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>The Buddha describes the
              abiding in nirvana as a state of 'deathlessness' and as the highest spiritual
              attainment, the reward for one who lives a life of virtuous conduct. Nibbana is
              meant specifically as pertains gnosis that which ends the identity of the mind
              with empirical phenomena.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>Nirvana can only be
              explained to the 'unenlightened' by negation. Thus the Buddha tries to explain
              this deep concept to one of his disciples. He asks whether the fire, when it is
              extinguished, can be said to have gone north, south, east, or west. Nirvana,
              however, cannot be described as existing, not existing, both existing and not,
              or neither existing nor not.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>Venerable Dr. Walpola

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>...The only reasonable
              reply is that it can never be answered completely and satisfactorily in words,
              because human language is too poor to express the real nature of the Absolute Truth
              or Ultimate Reality which is Nirvana. Language is created and used by masses of
              human beings to express things and ideas experienced by their sense organs and
              their mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>A supramundane experience
              like that of the Absolute Truth is not of such a category. Words are symbols
              representing things and ideas known to us; and these symbols do not and cannot
              convey the true nature of even ordinary things. Language is considered
              deceptive and misleading in the matter of understanding of the Truth. So the
              Lankavatara-sutra says that ignorant people get stuck in words like an elephant
              in the mud. Nevertheless, we cannot do without langauge.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>It is incorrect to think
              that Nirvana is the natural result of the extinction of craving. Nirvana is not
              the result of anything. If it would be a result, then it would be an effect
              produced by a cause. It would be 'produced' and 'conditioned'. Nirvana is
              neither cause nor effect. It is not produced like a mystic, spiritual, mental
              state, such as dhyana or samadhi.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>People often ask: What is
              there after Nirvana? This question cannot arise, because Nirvana is the
              Ultimate Truth. If it is Ultimate there can be nothing after it. If there is
              anything after Nirvana, then that will be the Ultimate Truth and not Nirvana.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>He who has realised Truth,
              Nirvana, is the happiest being in the world. He is free from all 'complexes'
              and obsessions, the worries and troubles that torment others. His mental health
              is perfect. He does not repent the past, nor does he brood over the future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>He lives fully in the
              present. Therefore he appreciates and enjoys things in the purest sense without
              self-projections. He is joyful, exultant, enjoying the pure life, his faculties
              pleased, free from anxiety, serene and peaceful.</span></p>

              desire, hatred, ignorance, conceit, pride, and all such 'defilements', he is
              pure and gentle, full of universal love, compassion, kindness, sympathy,
              understanding and tolerance. His service to others is of the purest, for he has
              no thought of self. He gains nothing, accumulated nothing, because he is free
              from the illusion of self and the 'thirst' of becoming.</span></p>

              elements: solidity, fluidity, heat, motion, space and consciousness. All human
              knowledge is founded on particles and forces in space and time, which assumes
              the existence of four separate things. This cause many problems for humanity

              known as the 'psychophysical' problem and has been concisely formulated by the
              French philosopher and mathematician Rene Descartes in his 'Meditations',
              published in 1641. Descartes observed that the world consists of two basically
              different substances; mind and matter.</span></p>

              mind and matter; interrelate. Benedict Spinoza (1632-1677) saw mind and body as
              two attributes of the same substance, processes of one and the same thing
              expressed in two different ways.</span></p>

              - Sarvodaya Vishva Lekha Publishers 2004 Colombo, Sri Lanka) gives some
              background ideas about the functions of superego and the ultra super ego in
              people who have a developed psyche. People with highly developed psyche have
              diminished levels of id functions and their spiritual dimensions is prominent.</span></p>

              deals with basic issues of existence that may be the source of present conflict
              within a person. These concerns are universal and inherent in the human condition;
              death, freedom, and essential aloneness and meaningless. The emptiness 'is the
              human condition to which both Buddhism and Nietzsche respond.</span></p>

              deep philosophical meaning of suffering and emptiness. Dukkha is the Sanskrit
              word commonly translated as 'suffering'. The most important type of Dukkha,
              however, is Sankhara-dukkha, an existential incompleteness due to spiritual

              addresses the meaning of life and human freedom. The Buddha used Nirvana more
              as an image of freedom. Nirvana names the transcendent and singularly ineffable
              freedom that stands as the final goal of all the Buddha's teachings.</span></p>

              unified or meaningful whole, which was to be the focus of psychological study
              instead. Gestalt psychology is based on the observation that we often

              many organising principles called Gestalt laws. People cannot see the
              multidimensional reality because human senses are limited to three dimensions,
              yet the higher-dimensional world is only a subset of the multidimensional

              holistic principles is developed. The multidimensional world is then explored
              with this holistic logic system. This leads to commonsense interpretations of
              quantum physics effects and provides plausible answers to many unresolved
              questions, such as the whole versus parts problem, mind-body interaction, the
              inner structure of the human psyche, the beginning of life, and the creative

              creation or an agglomeration of causative factors; it was never created; it
              always was, is and will be. But due to the moral and mental darkness of
