              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Much attention
                  has been given to how far west Buddhism extended in ancient times. The most
                  westerly Buddhist monument that can be is the foundations of a large stupa
                  in the south east corner of the ancient citadel of Khiva in Turkmenistan.
                  Small communities of Buddhists may have existed beyond this but if they did
                  they would have been insignificant, isolated and exceptional. We can say
                  therefor that the outer edge of Buddhism in the west was what is now
                  eastern Iran. But how far to the east did Buddhism spread its gentle and
                  civilizing influence? To the outer islands of Indonesia, to Australia or
                  perhaps beyond? In the 1920's a superb bronze bust of the Buddha was found
                  on Sulawesi, one of the larger islands that make up Indonesia. This is the
                  eastern most point that any Buddhist antiquity has ever been found. There
                  is, though, no evidence of an enduring Buddhist presence either on Sulawesi
                  or beyond it; no ruined temples or monasteries, no inscriptions or
                  references to it in the historical records. However, only a few hundred
                  miles south west of Sulawesi is the small island of Bali where
                  archeological, epigraphically and literary evidence shows that Buddhism
                  existed along side Hinduism for about seven hundred years.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Indian merchants
                  first arrived in Bali in about 200 BCE and it was probably these people who
                  introduced Buddhism and Hinduism. A Balinese work of uncertain date called
                  the Nagarakrtagama by the Buddhist monk lists all the Buddhist temples in
                  Bali, twenty six altogether, and mentions that in 1275 King Kretanagara
                  underwent a Tantric Buddhist initiation to protect his kingdom from an
                  expected invasion by Kublai Khan. The island's history is scant until 1343
                  when it was conquered by and absorbed into the Majapahit Empire of
                  Java-Sumatra. Hinduism and Buddhism both received state patronage although
                  the type of Buddhism that prevailed gradually became indistinguishable from
                  Hinduism. A Javanese Buddhist work from about the 12th century contains
                  this telling verse. "The one substance is called two, that is, the
                  Buddha and Siva. They say they are different but how can they be divided?
                  Despite differences there is oneness". Clearly at the time these words
                  were being composed some Buddhists were struggling to maintain the
                  uniqueness of the Dhamma while others were stressing its similarity with
                  Hinduism. Eventually in both Java and Bali the integrators prevailed.
                  Incidentally, the phrase "Despite differences there is oneness" (
                  Bhineka tunggal ika ) has been taken as the motto for the Republic of
                  Indonesia. With the collapse of Mahapahit in 1515 and the ascendancy of
                  Islam, Java's old intellectual and religious elite, including the last
                  surviving Buddhist monks and scholars sought refuge in Bali. <br> <br> In January 2004 I fulfilled a long-standing wish to visit the island that
                  Nehru eulogized as "The Morning of the World". I planned to visit
                  all the sights that other tourists like to see but my main intention was to
                  search out the traces of Buddhism and find out something about Bali's small
                  Buddhist community. My first stop was the Bali Museum in Dempasar, the
                  capital of the island. The older part of the museum was built in 1910 in
                  the style of a royal palace and gives some idea of the artistic
                  sophistication of the traditional Balinese culture. The exhibits on display
                  in the museum reinforce the impression that the Balinese have an unusually
                  highly developed aesthetic scene. The paintings, masks, pottery, wood
                  calving and fabrics are superlative. In one room is a modest collection of
                  Buddhist antiquities. These consist of clay votive stupas found at Pedgeng
                  dating from about the 9th century and seals with the well-known
                  Dhammapariaya on them. There is also a small collection of bronze images of
                  the Buddha and various bodhisattvas. The captions on these exhibits gave
                  little information about them and so I made an appointment to see the
                  curator. He was able to give details about publications containing some
                  details about the history of Buddhism in Bali but told me that no
                  comprehensive account of it has ever been written.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'> <br>Next I headed for Goa Gajah near Ubud where I had read there were some
                  traces of Buddhism. Goa Gajah was a sacred spring in ancient times and
                  locals still come to bathe in its two pools. Water pours into the pools
                  from pots held by beautifully calved figures of apsaras. Beyond the spring
                  is a deep mossy and fern filled canyon with huge boulders strewn around it.
                  The rocks on the side of the canyon have half finished Buddha statues,
                  architectural forms and other things calved out of them. </span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>One bolder has
                  what was quite clearly meant to be the pinnacle of a stupa calved out of
                  it, again unfinished. There are also several artificial caves cut out of
                  the cliffs one of which have three small stupas in front of it. The several
                  inscriptions found at Goa Gajah show that both Hindu and Buddhist ascetics
                  once lived here. My next stop was Besakih Bali's largest and most sacred
                  temple , which is situated on the lowest slopes of the spectacular Gunung
                  Agung volcano. As the bus wound its way gradually upward the air became
                  cooler and the landscape began to remind me of the country around Kandy,
                  lush and green and filled with flowers. The top of Gunung Agung was hidden
                  by cloud. Before the 10th century Besakih had been a Buddhist temple but
                  just as Buddhism gradually declined and was absorbed into Hinduism so
                  Besakih gradually became a Hindu temple. The temple itself is laid out in a
                  series of terraces and extends for about a mile up the side of the volcano.
                  I looked for signs of Buddhism, old statues or familiar motifs but could
                  find nothing. Volcanic eruptions have destroyed or damaged Besakih several
                  times throughout its history. Perhaps excavations in the thick black ash on
                  which the present temple now stands would yield evidence of its Buddhist
                  predecessor. </span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>My last stop was
                  the eastern town of Klungkung which had been capital of a small kingdom
                  during the 16th and 17th centuries. In the center of the town is Taman Gili
                  (The Island Garden) the only surviving part of the old royal palace which
                  was built in 1710. The ceiling of several pavilions in the garden are
                  covered in paintings of the highest quality. Most of these depict incidents
                  from the Tantrikatha, a Balinese version of the Thousand and One Nights,
                  and the Hindu epic the Mahabhatara. But there is also some twenty panels
                  illustrating the life and adventures of a legendary Buddhist character
                  named Satusoma. Unfortunately, try as I might, I was unable to find out
                  anything about Satusoma before going to Bali and so could not make sense of
                  any of the paintings. Being part of the old Netherlands East Indies much of
                  the historical research on Bali is in Dutch and not accessible to an
                  English speaker like myself. However, the paintings depicting Satusoma's
                  deeds are full of action and drama and the legends about him are probably
                  very interesting (see above). I have made a point to find out more about
                  him. Although my main intention in visiting Bali was to seek out traces of
                  Buddhism I was very interested in seeing the many beautiful Hindu temples
                  also. When I was at the Puseh Pura Desa Temple at Batubulan I chanced to
                  see a line of images which included an elegantly calved one of the Buddha
                  Later in the temple at Pura Ulunsiwa I saw another statue of the Buddha
                  still being worshiped. Hinduism first integrated Buddhism into itself and
                  then erased its identity leaving only there two sad reminders. </span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The last census
                  in 1989 showed that there were 13,274 Buddhists in Bali, nearly all of them
                  either ethnic Chinese or people from other parts of Indonesia. There are
                  two Buddhist temples, one in Singharaj in the north of the island built by
                  the Thai and Indonesian governments in 1971 and another in Dempasar. I
                  visited both these establishments and was sad to see that the monks in them
                  did little more than conduct rituals and do blessings for the people who
                  came. I was invited to the homes of several Buddhists and was treated with
                  the greatest respect but it was very clear that my hosts knew little about
                  the Dhamma. They all acknowledged their ignorance and seemed to have a
                  genuine desire to know more but as they all said, there was no one to teach
                  them. On a more positive note, I met a devote Javanese lady now living in
                  Dempasar who has been very active in publishing books on Buddhism for free
                  distribution. But Hinduism on Bali is surprisingly vigorous and still
                  claims the allegiance of almost everyone, young and old. It seems unlikely
                  that the teachings of the Buddha will prove attractive to the Balinese for
                  a long time in the future.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
