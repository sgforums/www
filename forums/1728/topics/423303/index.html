The Buddha :” Don’t be afraid Mahanama. Your death won’t be a bad one. When a person’s mind has been fortified over a long time by FAITH, VIRTUE, LEARNING, GENEROSITY &amp; WISDOM, after the breaking up of the body, his mind goes upwards, goes to distinction.”<br><br>#<br><br>    *<br>      Ehi Passiko<br>      In Samyutta Nikaya 55.21, the Buddha was visiting his Aryan Disciple Mahanama, who was very sick and about to pass away. Though Mahanama was a Buddhist Saint : a Once-Returner (Sakadagami), he was still afraid of his death. The Buddha told ...him and also taught us that if we have already had unwavering FAITH in the Buddha, Dhamma &amp; Sangha, keeping our PRECEPTS, LEARNING &amp; PRACTISING THE DHAMMA, doing DANA &amp; practising MEDITATION/WISDOM for a long time in our life. We should not be afraid of the DEATH, because the Buddha gave an ASSURANCE that our DEATH will be a good &amp; peaceful one. Our body might endures pain due to the sickness, but not our mind. The trained mind will always be calm &amp; peaceful. Our next rebirth destination will be a higher one &amp; evolving onwards to Nibbana (mind goes upwards to distinction). In other words : it is highly possible we will attain the Sainthood/Aryanhood.<br><br>      Hence, the theory that said our last thought before passing away is the most important factor to determine our next destination is not really correct or without condition. If a person was a precept breaker (commit killing, stealing, adultery,etc.) for almost his entire life and only realize his/her mistakes in the last few years of his/her life &amp; start to repent &amp; practise the Dhamma, it will be quite difficult to have good last thought &amp; good death in most cases. Because the training of our mind or practising the Dhamma is a GRADUAL PROCESS. There is no short cut. But most people with wrong views believe that only when they are old &amp; retired, they will start doing good, doing charity, turning to be religious/spiritual, start going to temples, joining retreat, start doing chanting etc. During their youth or prime time, they are only interested in worldly affairs, works, family, etc. No time for spiritual affair. When we are old, our sense &amp; mental faculty are already weaken or we even fall sick. The chance &amp; energy to practise the Dhamma is very low. If we have hardly ever done dana or good deeds, if we are a selfish or jealous man who always complain &amp; discontent in most of our life time, what kind of good memory can we expect to recall in our last moment of life ? Even Mahanama, a Sakadagami/ an Aryan disciple was afraid of death. How about us, the lay disciple ? Therefore we should practice the Dhamma as early as possible in our life time before it is too late...._/\_See More<br>      January 19 at 1:59am ·</p></div>

               Buddha taught us these five contemplation to remind us the facts that 
              every being has to accept in this faring of Samsara. So that we will not
               be infatuated with the pride of our health, wealth, youth, life, fame, 
              happiness etc. Beings <span class="text_exposed_hide">...</span><span class="text_exposed_show">have
               lustful desire for what is dear &amp; beloved and inflamed by lust. 
              With these contemplation we are able to minimise our desire &amp; greed.
               But most of the time we are too busy with our worldly affairs 
              especially our works and have always forgot these contemplation. Only 
              when we suddenly fall sick or experience the worldly failures. Then we 
              start to realize what this life is all about. Most people will get 
              frightened and depressed once these five conditions are approaching 
              them. Some even become mentally unsound because they cannot accept these
               facts. In most of the culture in the world, it is a taboo to talk about
               death. It is some kind of superstitious belief that if you always 
              contemplate the death. It will catch you. Just like a sleeping tiger 
              which is better not to disturb it. But this is only a delusion that we 
              always try to create. Whether we accept or do not accept it, sooner or 
              later, death will catch us. Actually our life is like we are staying 
              together with the tiger in the cage. We are not able to escape and just 
              waiting for time for the tiger to wake up to catch us.  <br><br>I 
              dedicate this Sutta to my friend who have just lost his wife in a sudden
               sickness. The family happiness just shattered away like a broken glass.
               His wife gave birth only less than a month ago. On the Sunday afternoon
               the entire family went to Botanical Garden for a picnic. The happiest 
              moment to go out to the park with the new born baby boy for the first 
              time. Their first child is a two year old daughter. Unfortunately the 
              wife was bitten by a dengue mosquito. The next day she had high fever 
              and on Tuesday she was unconscious &amp; felt into comma. The doctor 
              declared she got meningitis &amp; dengue fever and the immune system of 
              her body was not able to produce anti-body to fight the dengue. The 
              fever started to cause brain damage bit by bit till it is totally 
              damage. She passed away only about one week in hospital. The entire 
              family is wordless, because this happened so fast. Nobody can ever 
              imagine, you were having one of the happiest moment in your life, but 
              two days later, it turned into tragedy. <br><br>For me personally, this 
              is the most impermanent occasion I have ever seen from somebody I know 
              directly. My colleague is a Moslem. It is certainly difficult to comfort
               him by explaining about impermanent &amp; kamma. May be he will think 
              his Allah, his God is testing him. I visited his wife in the ICU ward. 
              The moment I walked into the wards, I saw the entire row of room 
              isolated with glass walls with any kind of patient lying on the bed, be 
              it old man/woman, children or even babies. Some may be just waiting for 
              their time. The family members are waiting with tears &amp; worry beside
               them. In one of the room there was even a hysterical cry &amp; a family
               member was shaking the woman, may be her mom who had just passed away. 
              This scene remind me that I could be the one lying on that bed in the 
              future, because I ,too cannot escape illness &amp; death. It is just a 
              matter of time. My friend is at the prime of his life at 30 years old, 
              her wife was 27 years old , with good career, two loving kids &amp; 
              loving family. But the prime time has just turned to the lowest point of
               his life without warning. People always said if you are going to lose 
              your loved ones or family member, you will usually have a sign, be it a 
              dream or a weird happening like your eye brows is shaking, etc. But all 
              these might not happen the same to everyone. Death usually comes without
               warning. My friend did not have any weird dream or sign. Our merit is 
              not like worldly bank account. Once our merit is used up, we might not 
              be able to get credit like from the worldly bank. The downfall or the 
              condition of bad kamma will ripen immediately once the merit is used up.
               Therefore we have to top it up regularly, be it from doing good deeds 
              like dana, cultivation of sila, wisdom, meditation, etc. Impermanent are
               all formation, their nature is subjected to rise &amp; to cease/to 
              disintegrate. If you are experiencing the happiest moment of your life, 
              do not forget the ground, because it is always temporary. The same, too 
              if you are experiencing sadness, do not forget the sky, because it is 
              always temporary. This, too will pass. Most people having the happy 
              moment of their life, always lost the ground, they become arrogant of 
              their wealth, stingy &amp; even ready to commit evil deeds to maintain 
              their so called worldly happiness. They live their life as if there is 
              no tomorrow. Let’s treasure our life and people around us. Life is 
              fragile. You may not see them anymore in the next moment. Let’s spend 
              some time to contemplate what the Buddha taught us : our aging, 
              sickness, death, separation from our loved ones and our 
              actions/kamma....So when our turn has come, whether our death or losing 
              loved ones. Our mind will be strong enough to accept &amp; to understand
               the fact of this Samsara. Never take granted that even we live in one 
              of the cleanest country of the world, ...Singapore... with all its 
              advanced hospital. You will never caught by dengue &amp; 
              death........_/\_</span></div>

              worlds more suitable for their learning, we have to respect their free

              i think the only thing close to the concept of ascension is the rainbow body attainment where the physical body dissolves into light. many buddhists throughout history have attained this even today. there are evidences so it is something credible, even the communist chinese are stunned when they see what happen.
              
              however this is not something the normal joe can attain. i mean eeryone can attain it, but it requires deep experiential realization of the nature of reqlity and many years of yogic practice. in this world twhere only a small percentage are wakin up or getting enlightened, such things hapenning on mass scale is simply not possible.

              <p>Yep... I concur with AEN.</p>
              <p>Yep.. the ascension refers to the rainbow light body attainment. It is not so easy... not even ordinarily enlightened people can attain it. It requires the full complete dissolving of all karma from body and mind... which is not possible for people who are not even aware of how consciousness really function..... I will just humbly admit that i do not know much about its experiences. But from description in Tibetan books, there are stages that most of us will not experience or even understand.</p>
              <p>The new age got too much misinformation and people think that just by doing some kind of practice that is at the mind-level or just be good is enough. Far far from the truth.</p>
              <p>'Seeing the light' if it is due to letting go ... is only experiencing the luminousity aspect of awareness. This can happen at the I AM stage. .. which mean one will assume the light to be God/Creator that is separated from the experiencer. There are other aspects of awareness that are veiled from us and will remain a mystery... until further insights are gained. Hey... words like light, luminosity, non-duality,  no-self, emptiness are describing various aspects of reality as it is. For example, luminosity is not the same insight as no-self ... etc... Each insight make us 'realise' the truth of reality better...</p>
              <p>BTW... SoulDivine, you indeed did 'plan' to be a guide for this lifetime. But, my friend... keep the possibilites open :)</p>

In this case, you assumed that the Source is at the 12 D.</p>
              <p>The source is manifested in the appearance(manifestations). The Source is too close for the eye 'I' to see. The source is your true nature as well as the nature of everyone and everything. It is not separated from you for the 'you' as a individual person call SoulDivine is an experience... just as all experiences in truth have no self-identity...</p>
              <p>In the Mahayana Teaching, there is a saying that 'Form is Emptiness' and 'Emptiness is Form'. This roughly translate that the Source is 'embedded' in the Creations. One is seeing the world and yet is still ignorant of what is being seen.</p>
              <p>As for the ascension, my opinion is that karma ( which includes ignorance) is what make one sees things as being solid (3D). If don't really know what the reality is like, how to transform it?</p>
              <p>Right from the beginning, there is no substantial 3D, 4D or 5D. All are appearance that implied and imposed various forms of living conditions.</p>
              <p>I don't mean to be offensive. But as mentioned, new age teachings are incomplete and lacking in vital insights. It is not wrong per se but is certainly is beating around the bush.</p>
              <p>Just a sharing</p>

You have completely move out of the pop culture. You do not worry about whether you own the lastest iPhone gagets or what brand of watch/clothes you wear on your body. You could care less about what happens on the latest television drama shows or those "Idol" contest. These things become irrelevant and insignificant in your life.</em></p>
              <p><em>You communicate freely with other people that are on your level or at similar state of consciousness/awareness.<br><br>You will be aware that you are the creator of your individual life experience. You are the observer(and also the one being observed) of the drama in your life and you are more aware of the possible outcomes of your actions. You will realise that your consious perception shapes up your own reality. You will learn that you are the master of your Earthly experience. You know that you have free-will and are learning how to use it. You are learning about karma, what it is, how it works and how to balance it. You will understand your various soul contracts, the purpose of your incarnations and the purpose in life.<br><br>At this stage, you have become fourth density human.</em>"</p>

              <p>Dalai Lama's answer:-</p>
              <p><a href="http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html">http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html</a></p>
              <h4>Q: You have said that according to Buddhist philosophy there is no Creator, no God of creation, and this may initially put off many people who believe in a divine principle. Can you explain the difference between the Vajrayana Primordial Buddha and a Creator God?</h4>
              <p><strong>A: </strong>I understand the Primordial Buddha, also known as Buddha Samantabhadra, to be the ultimate reality, the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras. However, in the context of your question, the tantric tradition is the only one which explains the Dharmakaya in terms of Inherent clear light, the essential nature of the mind; this would seem imply that all phenomena, samsara and nirvana, arise from this clear and luminous source. Even the New School of Translation came to the conclusion that the "state of rest" of a practitioner of the Great Yoga--Great Yoga implies here the state of the practitioner who has reached a stage in meditation where the most subtle experience of clear light has been realized--that for as long as the practitioner remains in this ultimate sphere he or she remains totally free of any sort of veil obscuring the mind, and is immersed in a state of great bliss.</p>
              <p>We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein. But we must be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual level.</p>
              <p>Likewise, when we speak of karma as the cause of the universe we eliminate the notion of a unique entity called karma existing totally independently. Rather, collective karmic impressions, accumulated individually, are at the origin of the creation of a world. When, in the tantric context, we say that all worlds appear out of clear light, we do not visualize this source as a unique entity, but as the ultimate clear light of each being. We can also, on the basis of its pure essence, understand this clear light to be the Primordial Buddha. All the stages which make up the life of each living being--death, the intermediate state, and rebirth--represent nothing more than the various manifestations of the potential of clear light. It is both the most subtle consciousness and energy. The more clear light loses its subtlety, the more your experiences take shape.</p>
              <p>In this way, death and the intermediate state are moments where the gross manifestations emanating from clear light are reabsorbed. At death we return to that original source, and from there a slightly more gross state emerges to form the intermediate state preceding rebirth. At the stage of rebirth, clear light is apparent in a physical incarnation. At death we return to this source. And so on. The ability to recognize subtle clear light, also called the Primordial Buddha, is equivalent to realizing nirvana, whereas ignorance of the nature of clear light leaves us to wander in the different realms of samsaric existence.</p>
              <p>This is how I understand the concept of the Primordial Buddha. It would be a grave error to conceive of it as an independent and autonomous existence from beginningless time. If we had to accept the idea of an independent creator, the explanations given in the <em>Pramanavartika, </em>the "Compendium of Valid Knowledge" written by Dharmakirti, and in the ninth chapter of the text by Shantideva, which completely refutes the existence per se of all phenomena, would be negated. This, in turn, would refute the notion of the Primordial Buddha. The Buddhist point of view does not accept the validity of affirmations which do not stand up to logical examination. If a sutra describes the Primordial Buddha as an autonomous entity, we must be able to interpret this assertion without taking it literally. We call this type of sutra an "interpretable" sutra.</p>

              The <strong>Tathagatagarbha doctrine</strong> says that each sentient being contains the potential to become a <a href="/definition/Buddha"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Buddha</span></span></a>. "Tathagata-garbha" means "Buddha Womb" or "Buddha Embryo", and this notion is explicated by the Buddha in the "<a href="/definition/Mahayana_Mahaparinirvana_Sutra"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra</span></span></a>" as the "True Self" within all sentient beings - the unconditioned, boundless, sustaining and deathless Self of Buddha, which is indiscernible to worldly, unawakened vision as a result of the masses of negative mental states and general emotional taints which envelop it. <a href="/definition/Tathagata"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Tathagata</span></span></a> is one of the <a href="/definition/Ten_epithets"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">ten epithets</span></span></a> for a Buddha. The Tathagatagarbha doctrine arose mainly within Mahayanists who were associated to some degree or another with <a href="/definition/Yogacara"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Yogacara</span></span></a> studies, in order to clearly account for the possibility of the attainment of Buddhahood by ignorant sentient beings. Two of the most important early texts for the introduction of this doctrine are the <a href="/definition/%C5%9Ar%C4%ABm%C4%81l%C4%81-s%C5%ABtra"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">ÅšrÄ«mÄ�lÄ�-sÅ«tra</span></span></a> and the <a href="/definition/Awakening_of_Faith"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Awakening of Faith</span></span></a>; the "<a href="/definition/Mahayana_Mahaparinirvana_Sutra"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra</span></span></a>" is a further vital text for a fuller understanding of "Tathagatagarbha" teaching. The Tathagatagarbha doctrine is closely related to that of the notion of <a href="/definition/Buddha-nature"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Buddha-nature</span></span></a>; indeed, in the <a href="/definition/Mahayana_Mahaparinirvana_Sutra"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra</span></span></a>, which is the lengthiest sutra dealing with the immanent and transcendent presence of the Tathagatagarbha within all beings, the terms "Buddha-nature" ("Buddha-dhatu") and "Tathagatagarbha" are presented as essentially synonymous.</p>

                                                              the one source of "All that is".<br> <br> My primary focus now is Ascension because the whole world
                                                              population are affected and even Earth itself is at risk. After

                                                              because the whole world will know what "Ascension" means to them
                                                              through direct experience.</p>

              <p>The view that we are all One Source of All That Is, is precisely the view of the person at the I AM phase.</p>
              <p>Me, Longchen, Thusness, have gone through these phases before, so we know what it is by direct experience. It is the direct experiential realization of ourselves as an impersonal, all-pervasive Presence prior to thoughts.</p>
              <p>This experience is intimate, non-dual, and quickly becomes reified into an ultimate identity or true self. I reached this phase in February 2010 - Longchen and Thusness had it more than 20 years ago (and progressed into the Anatta and Emptiness phases in more recent years).</p>
              <p>After a few months entering into the I AM phase (Thusness Stage 1), the impersonal aspect (Thusness Stage 2) of it became clearer, and this led to a sense of everything and everyone as coming forth from, and being the effortless expression of One Source. The absence of the sense of personality led to the reification of Consciousness as being fundamental, universal, over-arching like a cosmic consciousness/source from which all things animate and inanimate issues forth. We feel that it is not 'I', as an individual doer, who lives life, but that we are all lived by a greater power - as described in  Galatians 2:20: <em>I have been 
                  crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me</em></p>
              <p>An analogy I used then was like the electricity powering every single instrument (be it TV, radio, iron, etc). There is no personal doer involved.</p>
              <p>However, at this level, Consciousness is reified as an ultimate Self, Source, that lies 'behind' all manifestations as its source, substratum, base. There is no individuality present - all things manifest and dissolve back into an unchanging base of pure presence.</p>
              <p>This 'Presence' is still seen as separated from manifestations - like what Longchen said about the division between Source and Manifestation. Source/Presence/Consciousness becomes seen as a backdrop of all existence, so there is still a duality between the 'Background' (Source) and the 'Foreground' (phenomenal existence).</p>
              <p>When it is realized that Manifestation is the Source, there is no longer the division between the Witness and the Witnessed, the Observer and the Observed, the Source and the Manifestation. Everything becomes equally an expression of/AS the Source/Awareness/Presence.</p>
              <p>But this is still the substantialist non-dual phase, or Thusness Stage 4. There can still be a sense of a universal Consciousness, though everything is realized to be equally an expression of that universal consciousness without the slightest division between Subject and Object - now you truly see yourself as everything, as the sound, the bird singing, the scenery, etc.</p>
              <p>A subtler realization must occur that Awareness, Seeing, Hearing, is JUST the manifestation - the sounds, sights, experiences that arise self-luminous on its own accord. There is no agent, center, perceiver involved at all - Awareness is simply a word or label collating the various experiences that arise, like the word 'Weather' is simply a label collating the various ever-changing patterns of weather occuring. This is the realization of Anatta, or Thusness Stage 5.</p>
              <p>At this point you no longer reify a universal substratum or source out of which things arise. Why? Because 'Source', 'Awareness', is realized to be simply a label collating the various experiences arising. There is no inherently, independently existing universal Source out of which things occur - there is just processes, experiences, manifestations. There is no universal mind, only individual streams of mind (experiences) that occur without an agent, separation, perceiver, controller.</p>
              <p>Then you can proceed from there to realize the dependently originated and empty nature of experiences, that all things occur not due to a controller, God, or agent, but is due to karma and other conditions, so Awareness is not so much of a 'cause' but more like an 'effect' - but even that is not quite right, because both cause and effect (precisely because they are dependently originated) are empty of independent existence and cannot be established to be independently existing. This leaves everything unconditioned as they are, though thoroughly interdependently originated. It sounds paradoxical but isn't, when realized experientially.</p>
              <p>That said, 'start practicing meditation' is very important - because when you start practicing meditation, and particularly self inquiry which I recommend, you will then ascend the stages of enlightenment and come to realize these experiential facts for yourself. However, to meditate, without the right view instilled - will lead to getting stuck on certain stages, like the I AM stage.</p>

              <h4>Q: You have said that according to Buddhist philosophy there is
                      no Creator, no God of creation, and this may initially put off many
                      people who believe in a divine principle. Can you explain the
                      difference between the Vajrayana Primordial Buddha and a Creator
                      God?</h4>
              <p><strong>A:</strong> I understand the Primordial Buddha, also
                      known as Buddha Samantabhadra, to be the ultimate reality, the
                      realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all
                      phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation
                      taught by the Sutras and Tantras. However, in the context of your
                      question, the tantric tradition is the only one which explains the
                      Dharmakaya in terms of Inherent clear light, the essential nature
                      of the mind; this would seem imply that all phenomena, samsara and
                      nirvana, arise from this clear and luminous source. Even the New
                      School of Translation came to the conclusion that the "state of
                      rest" of a practitioner of the Great Yoga--Great Yoga implies here
                      the state of the practitioner who has reached a stage in meditation
                      where the most subtle experience of clear light has been
                      realized--that for as long as the practitioner remains in this
                      ultimate sphere he or she remains totally free of any sort of veil
                      obscuring the mind, and is immersed in a state of great bliss.</p>
              <p>We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light,
                      is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether
                      they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein. But we must
                      be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into
                      error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of
                      collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of
                      Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this
                      luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate
                      or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual
                      level.</p>
              <p>Likewise, when we speak of karma as the cause of the universe we
                      eliminate the notion of a unique entity called karma existing
                      totally independently. Rather, collective karmic impressions,
                      accumulated individually, are at the origin of the creation of a
                      world. When, in the tantric context, we say that all worlds appear
                      out of clear light, we do not visualize this source as a unique
                      entity, but as the ultimate clear light of each being. We can also,
                      on the basis of its pure essence, understand this clear light to be
                      the Primordial Buddha. All the stages which make up the life of
                      each living being--death, the intermediate state, and
                      rebirth--represent nothing more than the various manifestations of
                      the potential of clear light. It is both the most subtle
                      consciousness and energy. The more clear light loses its subtlety,
                      the more your experiences take shape.</p>
              <p>In this way, death and the intermediate state are moments where
                      the gross manifestations emanating from clear light are reabsorbed.
                      At death we return to that original source, and from there a
                      slightly more gross state emerges to form the intermediate state
                      preceding rebirth. At the stage of rebirth, clear light is apparent
                      in a physical incarnation. At death we return to this source. And
                      so on. The ability to recognize subtle clear light, also called the
                      Primordial Buddha, is equivalent to realizing nirvana, whereas
                      ignorance of the nature of clear light leaves us to wander in the
                      different realms of samsaric existence.</p>
              <p>This is how I understand the concept of the Primordial Buddha.
                      It would be a grave error to conceive of it as an independent and
                      autonomous existence from beginningless time. If we had to accept
                      the idea of an independent creator, the explanations given in the
                      <em>Pramanavartika,</em> the "Compendium of Valid Knowledge"
                      written by Dharmakirti, and in the ninth chapter of the text by
                      Shantideva, which completely refutes the existence per se of all
                      phenomena, would be negated. This, in turn, would refute the notion
                      of the Primordial Buddha. The Buddhist point of view does not
                      accept the validity of affirmations which do not stand up to
                      logical examination. If a sutra describes the Primordial Buddha as
                      an autonomous entity, we must be able to interpret this assertion
                      without taking it literally. We call this type of sutra an
                      "interpretable" sutra.</p>

              <p>This is a good explanation. The Dalai Lama is clear about the difference between Buddhism and non-Buddhist traditions like Advaita Vedanta, even though both of them experiences the Clear Light.</p>
              <p>Buddhism, with the correct cognition of Anatta and Emptiness, does not reify Clear Light into a fundamental, over-arching, cosmic source of all things and beings.</p>
              <p>Instead, it sees clear light for what it is - the individual stream of consciousness. So while it is true that everything experienced comes forth from mind, and IS mind, this mind is not an ultimate universal consciousness, a God or Brahman of some sort. Consciousness is an individual source that interdependently originates.</p>
              <p>What is clear light? The Dalai Lama explains:</p>
              <div id="post-body-9933119" class="body">
              <p><strong><em>These two features - luminosity, or clarity, and knowing, or
                                              cognizance - have come to characterise 'the mental' in Indo-Tibetan
                                              Buddhist thought. Clarity here refers to the ability of mental
                                              states to reveal or reflect. Knowing, by contrast, refers to mental
                                              states' faculty to perceive or apprehend what appears.</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>All phenomena possessed of these qualities count as mental.
                                              These features are difficult to conceptualise, but then we are
                                              dealing with phenomena that are subjective and internal rather than
                                              material objects that may be measured in spatio-temporal terms.</em></p>
              <p><em>Perhaps it is because of these difficulties - the limits of
                                              language in dealing with the subjective - that many of the early
                      <strong> Buddhist texts explain the nature of consciousness in terms of
                                              metaphors such as light or a flowing river</strong>. As the primary feature
                                              of light is to illuminate, so consciousness is said to illuminate
                                              its objects. <strong>Just as in light there is no categorical distinction
                                              between the illumination and that which illuminates, so in
                                              consciousness there is no real difference between the process of
                                              knowing or cognition and that which knows or cognizes. In
                                              consciousness, as in light, there is a quality of illumination.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>~ His Holiness the Dalai Lama, "The Universe in a Single
                                              Atom"</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here, the Dalai Lama clearly expresses the insight of Anatta.</p>
              <p>Luminosity is not a Knower, Cognizer, but is simply the self-luminous essence of the process of experiencing, knowing. It is the individual stream of mind that we are talking about - its self-knowing quality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Dalai Lama also understands the tendency of Consciousness, Clear Light to be reified (like in non-Buddhist religions) into an ultimate God, Brahman, etc.</p>
              <p>He said:</p>
              <p><em> Through the gates of the five sense organs a being sees,     
                                                            hears, smells, tastes and comes 
                      into contact with a host                     of                       
                      external forms, objects and impressions. Let the form, sound,

                      which are the relations                                           of the

                                                    of past events on which the mind tends to 
                      dwell will be completely

                                                      for the future and contemplation of

                      allowed to arise. It is necessary to create a space in                  
                                               place of all such processes of thought if one 
                      is to empty                                           the mind of all 
                      such processes of thought. Freed from all

                      examine what sort of characteristics                                    
                             constitute the mind when it has attained this stage. We surely   
                                                              do possess some thing called 
                      mind, but how are we to recognize                                       
                          its existence? The real and essential mind is what is to            
                               be                       found when the entire load of gross

                      (i.e. sense impressions, memories, etc.) has been cleared               
                                                  away. Discerning this aspect of real mind, 
                      we shall discover                                           that, unlike
                       external objects, its true nature is devoid                     of     
                                        form or color; nor can we find any basis of truth for 
                      such                                           false and deceptive 
                      notions as that mind originated from                     this           
                                  or that, or that it will move from here to there, or that   
                                                              it is located in such-and-such a
                       place. When it comes into                                           
                      contact with no object mind is like a vast, boundless void,             
                                                    or like a serene, illimitable ocean. When 
                      it encounters an                                           object it at 
                      once has cognizance of it, like a mirror instantly                      
                                           reflecting a person who stands in front of it. The 
                      true nature                                           of mind consists 
                      not only in taking clear cognizance of the                              
                                   object but also in communicating a concrete experience of  
                                                               that object to the one 
                      experiencing it.<a href="http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=413#note">*</a> Normally, our forms of sense cognition, such as 
                      eye-consciousness,                                           
                      ear-consciousness, etc., perform their functions on external            
                                                     phenomena in a manner involving gross

                      resulting from sense cognition, being based on gross external           
                                                      phenomena, is also of a gross nature. 
                      When this type of gross

                       infinite void similar to the infinitude of space. But                  
                         this                       void is not to be taken as the true nature
                       of mind. We have                                           become so 
                      habituated to consciousness of the form and color

                      of mind, it is, as I have said, found to                     be         
                                    a vast, limitless void free from any gross obscurity or

                      mind. </strong></em></p>
              <p><em> There are in addition several other 
                      aspects and states of                       mind. In other words, taking
                       mind as the supreme basis, there                       are many 
                      attributes related to it. Just as an onion consists                     
                        of layer upon layer that can be peeled away, so does every            
                                 sort of object have a number of layers; and this is no less  
                                           true of the nature of mind as explained here; it, 
                      too, has                       layer within layer, slate within state. </em></p>
              <p><em> All compounded things are subject to 
                      disintegration. Since                       experience and knowledge are
                       impermanent and subject to disintegration,                       the 
                      mind, of which they are functions (nature), is not something            
                                 that remains constant and eternal. From moment to moment it  
                                           undergoes change and disintegration.<strong> This 
                      transience of mind                       is one aspect of its nature. </strong>However, as we have observed,                       its true nature has 
                      many aspects, including consciousness                       of concrete 
                      experience and cognizance of objects. Now let                       us 
                      make a further examination in order to grasp the meaning                
                             of the subtle essence of such a mind. Mind came into existence   
                                          because of its own cause. To deny that the 
                      origination of                       mind is dependent on a cause, or to
                       say that it is a designation                       given as a means of 
                      recognizing the nature of mind aggregates,                       is not 
                      correct. <strong>With our superficial observance, mind, which                   
                          has concrete experience and clear cognizance as its nature,         
                                    appears to be a powerful, independent, subjective, 
                      completely                       ruling entity. However, deeper analysis
                       will reveal that this                       mind, possessing as it does
                       the function of experience and                       cognizance, is not
                       a self-created entity but Is dependent                       on other 
                      factors for its existence. Hence it depends on something                
                             other than itself. This non-independent quality of the mind      
                                       substance is its true nature which in turn is the 
                      ultimate                       reality of the self. </strong></em></p>

              <p>Also, the Dalai Lama explains this luminosity of mind to be eternal, but not an unchanging eternal but a changing eternality:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>The fundamental mind which serves as the basis of all phenomena of 
                      cyclic existence and nirvana is posited as the ultimate truth or nature 
                      of phenomena (dharmata, chos nyid); it is also called the ‘clear light’ 
                      (abhasvara, ‘od gsal) and uncompounded (asamskrta, ‘dus ma byas). In 
                      Nying-ma it is called the ‘mind-vajra’; this is not the mind that is 
                      contrasted with basic knowledge (rig pa) and mind (sems) but the factor 
                      of mere luminosity and knowing, basic knowledge itself. This is the 
                      final root of all minds, forever indestructible, immutable, and 
                      unbreakable continuum like a vajra. Just as the New Translation Schools 
                      posit a beginningless and endless fundamental mind, so Nying-ma posits a
                       mind-vajra which has no beginning or end and proceeds without 
                      interruption through the effect stage of Buddhahood. It is considered 
                      ‘permanent’ in the sense of abiding forever and thus is presented as a 
                      permanent mind. It is permanent not in the sense of not disintegrating 
                      moment by moment but in the sense that its continuum is no interrupted…</em></p>
