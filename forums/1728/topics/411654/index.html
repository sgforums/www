              <p>Buddhism is about  ending of suffering.</p>
              <p>It teaches us that living entails old age, sickness and death, and that we should accept it as fact.</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In every religion we hear of miracles being performed by either the founders of these religious or by some of their disciples. In the case of the Buddha, he performed what people would call miracles on the day of his birth until his passing away into Nirvana<em>.</em> The psychic powers (so-called miraculous powers in other religions) of the Buddha were attained through his long and intense training in meditation. The Buddha meditated and passed through the highest stages of meditation that culminated in Enlightenment. Among his many abilities were the power to levitate, to multiply his body, to read the minds of others, to pass through solid rock and such.  These abilities were performed during many episodes of his life and were considered common events by his disciples and those who encountered him. The Buddha taught that such powers can be acquired through training in meditation. They are not considered miracles by those who understand them and they fall within the ability of any person who trains his mind through meditation and mental concentration to very high levels.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Once a man named Kevatta went up to the Buddha, paid homage, and said, "Lord, Nalanda is a successful city. The people living in Nalanda are prosperous, and they have confidence in the Blessed One.  Lord, it would be good if the Blessed One appointed a monk to work a marvel of supernormal power, so that the people of Nalanda might become much more confident in the Blessed One."<br><br>The Buddha replied, "Kevatta, I do not teach the Law to monks in that way".  The Buddha gave the same reply when the question was put to him the second and third time. After the third question, the Buddha replied that there were three kinds of supernormal levels:<br><br>1. The marvel of supernormal power to appear as many persons, to pass through walls, to fly through the air, walk on water. All these are physical actions the ordinary people cannot perform.<br>2. The supernormal power to read other people's minds.<br>3. The supernormal power to be able to guide people according to their mental development, for their own good, using suitable methods that fit these people.</span></p>
              <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">He taught that a monk who displays the first two supernormal powers for their own sake in order to impress people, is no different from the performance of a shaman or a magician.  The Buddha said that a monk who practices such worldly miracles is a source of shame, humiliation and disgust. This is because such actions may impress and win converts and followers, but they do not help them put an end to their suffering.
              <p> </p>
              </span></span>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The third kind of supernormal power which the Buddha calls "the miracle of instruction" helps people to get rid of suffering. This is the only supernormal power that is fit to be practiced and is encouraged and praised by the Buddha.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #cc0000;">"Furthermore, there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened. He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. ~ Kevatta Sutta"</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img src="http://www.parami.org/buddhistanswers/Walkonwater1.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="345" height="292" align="right"></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another story illustrates the Buddha's attitude towards miraculous powers. One day the Buddha met an ascetic who sat by the bank of a river. This ascetic had practised austerities for 25 years. The Buddha asked him what he had received for all his labour. The ascetic proudly replied that, finally, he could cross the river by walking on the water. The Buddha pointed out that this gain was insignificant for all the years of labour, since he could cross the river using a ferry for one penny!  </span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When the uneducated, the unsophisticated and the naive see the performance of miracles, their faith and incredulity deepens. The converts who are attracted to a religion through witnessing these powers embrace a faith, not because they realize the truth or gain in wisdom, but because they are either frightened or impressed by matters they do not understand.  In contrast, the Buddha appealed to the reasoning power of people to consider his teachings. This is best illustrated in the <a href="http://www.parami.org/buddhistanswers/kalama_sutta.htm">Kalama Sutta</a>.</span></p>
              <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">
              <p>It is possible and even quite common for a person to gain psychic abilities  without gaining any wisdom. The Buddha teaches that if we first gain spiritual power, then we can easily develop the miraculous or psychic powers too. But if we develop psychic abilities without spiritual development, then we are in danger.  Because of man's ego it is easy for him to misuse this power for worldly gain, to impress others and for other selfish purposes. Indeed, many people who have obtained some psychic abilities have merely succumbed to their ego and vanity.</p>

              <p>Talking about miracles(not about healing) , about HH Penor Rinpoche, was that when he was young, he broke a vase(or something to that effect), he broke a vase and managed to glue the pieces of the vase together with his saliva.</p>
              <p> This recount was heard when HH came to Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>hi puritysoul,</p>
              <p>There are countless healings in Buddhism on many levels.  However, healing is very much connected to the mind. Anyone can learn to heal others, it's a matter of whether you have the yuan and openness to do so or not... it is not a religious thing. Most of the so-called miraculous healings are actually simply working with energy.</p>
              <p>Also, in many places where mass healing occurs, a lot of subliminal programming and near-hypnosis techniques are utilised to induce a kind of suggestion in the person's mind so that he gets better.  Sometimes, this has a temporary effect, sometimes the effect is permanent, depending on the person being healed. It may not really be direct intervention of the divinity or deity or God per se.</p>
              <p>Of course, the power of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and Arhats include healing, but many other kinds of beings such as spirits, devas, etc. can heal too depending on your particular problem... and also, you yourself possess the ability to help yourself heal... there have been many cases of healing without the use of any religious affliations. </p>
              <p>Don't associate healing with particular religions, i think it is not really related... or even relevant...</p>
              <p>Buddhism want to cure the fundamental problem of suffering, not just ordinary sickness, but the real sickness of mind.  If we just cure the superficial sickness and leave the real root of sickness alone, then physical sickness can be cured, but one day it may come again, or maybe this person who was cured is so negative that he will bring even more problems and sickness to others when he is physically healthy.  So healing has to be the ultimate healing which Buddhism offers.  The medicine of compassion, emptiness or non-self.</p>
              <p>Hope my comments help.</p>

              <p>I have heard of many miracle healings from Buddhists and from those who shared their personal experiences during dharma talks in the temples. The most well known one is Mr. Lee Bock Guan of Buddhist Lodge who had late stage cancer more than 10 years ago  was healed after chanting sincerely. Well, I think both mind and prayers play a part in healings.</p>
              <p>My personal experience is my 3 family members were healed from eczema which they suffered for many years after I pray sincerely to å�—æ— åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è�¨ on their behalf. The amazing part is the 2 of them who stay with me heal at the same time. The other one is not staying with me so I'm not too sure when he was healed. I will say for sure mind does not play a part in my case because they did not pray by themselves, I'm praying on behalf for them. It is all thanks to å�—æ— åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è�¨'s blessings.</p>

              <p>Hi puritysoul</p>
              <p>There are miracle in Buddhism too. However, that is not use as a "selling" point in the buddhist circle. As most of the blogger has already mentioned, the healing that occurred is due to the change in mind which influence the healing process in our body.</p>
              <p>If you want further information, on this topic from Australia academic professor and former Zen priest point of view. You can go to the link <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/compass/s564956.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/compass/s564956.htm</a> where a lady was interview on the Australia National TV program called, The Compass, on how she was heal through chanting, " Namu Myo Ho Renge Kyo". As the interviewee is a Soka member so do note that I am here to promote Soka Gakkai rather to present this article as validity of Buddhist chanting from both academic and Buddhist point of view. Enjoy!!</p>
