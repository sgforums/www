              <p>Hi people,</p>
              <p>My Kundalini was spontaneously awakened 1 year back. Found some help online but the energy surges and many other symptons are very much still present.</p>
              <p>I want to ask if this group here happen to know people who understand kundalini and can help bring it to fruitation. I prefer someone who have completed their kundalini journey and are not too dogmatic about their teachings..</p>
              <p>I am not a religious person - but I do consider myself as someone on the spiritual path after kindalini erupted 1 year back. Am slightly concern with the excessive traditions with organized religions. </p>
              <p>This topic may already be talked about before - if that's the case please accept my apologies. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi Simpo,
                          
                          My understanding (may well be wrong) is that when prana shakti completes what she is set out to do..... ie clearing all engery centers - then it can be said that one has completed their K journey. <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">At this stage prana shakti is at rest - united with shiva. </span></p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  "> I am more inclined to the self inquiry (direct) path - that is the reason why I did nothing to mitigate the energy surges together with all symptons associated with kundalini. I view kundalini as a path of the yogi..... ie working directly on the various energy centers etc. </span></p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">Kundalini came spontaneously for my case, before that I was not even on the spiritual path. Now I see a major transformation in my life - am a more tolerable person to hang out with : )
                          Is just that sometimes - my symptons get too serious and it can be quite a problem in public. One of the mild sympton for example - I can be out at a public setting and feel the various energies of people walking pass me. Those energies esp the negative ones sometimes brings me to my kneels. Spontaneously chanting is also quite inconvenience in public setting....... Can't control those things</span></p>

              <p>Being in the presence of an enlightened being helps quite alot. Am currently in touch with one such rare being here in Singapore.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Allow me to expand your knowledge base by sharing what I know.
                                      (I assume all of you are already familiar with the seven main
                                      chakras in the body.)</p>
              <p>1. Kundalini - the energy emanates from Mother Earth, enters the
                                      body at the base of the spine as Kundalini,  ascends in a
                                      sprial motion up the spine to the top of the head and outward
                                      through the crown chakra.</p>
              <p>2. Prana - the energy emanated from the Great Central Sun,
                                      enters through the top of the head at the crown chakra, descends in
                                      a spiral motion down the spine, out through the base of the spine
                                      and into the Earth.</p>
              <p>3. Love - although the energies are continuously moving up and
                                      down the spine in both directions, they merge and unify in the
                                      heart chakra as love. The merged energies radiate out through the
                                      heart in all directions as love and compassion.</p>
              <p>This love and compassion is essential for the individuals and
                                      Earth to ascend to 5D.</p>
              <br>

              <p>thanks so much for your reply and advice</p>
              <p>I do not share the same view as you that enlightened people all have kundalini. for this group of people.... energy surges are common as the ego releases a vast amount of energies they're hogging all this while - thus resulting in the energy surges....</p>
              <p>the context of kundalini i am describing is more skewed toward unenlightened people.... its hard to explain to people about kundalini unless you go thru it yourself..</p>
              <p>the symptons you read about are very real ....... I experienced almost all of those that are documentated... spontanous asanas, mudras, kriyas, visions, spinning chakras, chanting, energy surges and more... in fact it got so intense... that it left a mark around my third eye region.... now ..there is a dent there. therefore if you follow my view ..... there is a slightly negative connotation to it.....( due to the symptons) - that to me is the distinction between the two groups.</p>
              <p>also to point out that kundalini does not follow a regular pattern like what you've described.... ie from the base of the spine. There are top down activation too.... and also .. activation of the heart. the "new ager" popularized kundalini in a certain manner that start from the spine .. ie from Muladhara to Sahasrara.  kundalini does not play by those rules</p>
              <p>more... to be technically pedantic, everyone with a spine in this world have kundalini coz its resides in the spine as coiled energy. it does not enter the spine like what you've described... it resides in the spine...... when kundalini is awakend... the more accurate term to describe  ... is prana shakti.... </p>
              <p>to save myself from becoming insane... i read alot alot alot on this subject.... i felt that my life is at stake back then....... the common view of kundalini at best is vague.... most of the time...outright misleading.....  </p>
              <p>on a certain level of understanding ... you're right .....both enlightened ppl and those with kundalini are just experiencing energies... and engery are just energy.. </p>
              <p>thanks once again for the reply.......</p>
              <p>never knew I'll come across this spiritual group in Singapore......very interesting and sincere group... and I appreciate that alot.....</p>

              <p>It is hard to explain Kundalini - what it really is.</p>
              <p>However there are things written about it that may help you understand alittle about it. Notice I use the word "alittle". The prevalent understanding is superfical at best - often misinterpret by the "new ager".</p>
              <p>Some say Kundalini is a myth - i leave it up to you if you want to believe</p>
              <p>For a lay person, kundalini is such a uninteresting topic, there is hardly any point for them to understand it at all. for me, it came to me spontaneously and I have no choice but to learn as much as I can to regain sanity. There wasn't an ounce of spirituality back then in me. </p>

              This is interesting.
              
              I have heard of people who spontaneously does some yoga posture due to some energy movement in their body.

              <p>Tingling at the tip of the head could possibly mean that one is releasing/dropping enough mental activity to experience pure awareness/luminousity soon. Often, this will be accompanied by the automatic repositioning of body to straighten the spine. At the opening of luminosity and spaciousness, the eyes may open very wide to match the quantum leap in energy surge and luminosity.</p>

              <p>if you are interested in consciousness - then yes its relevant. Kundalini although a word from the hindu tradition exist in all human beings. just like enlightenment in buddhism - its relevant to all people. </p>
              <p>if you are only concern with buddhism and all its traditions - maybe not. tantric buddhism have a detail description of kundalini though.</p>
              <p>for me, kundalini is just a form of how consciousness manifest itself. </p>

              <p>hi jamber,</p>
              <p>thanks for sharing your experience. the aim of all (if not most) spiritual practices is to ultimately eradicate the ego - there after one discover the self</p>
              <p>sounds to me that you are undergoing the falling off process - where the subliminal facets of the ego is being let go. this results in a minor surge in energy - as the ego hogs a great part of our total energy and now releasing it back to the body.</p>
              <p>am just speculating based on your description - also based on my own experience. am not an expert in this field. simpo or eternal now may disagree or may have their own views.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>kundalini is more violent that your experience. it will put u in yogo pose(asanas) without you knowing. i woke up a few times in the middle of the night in asanas. sometimes at work - spontaneous chanting, mudras etc. for me, i think you are the more fortunate one - where spiritual experiences are much more manageable.</p>

              <p>Hi Criable and Jamber,</p>
              <p>Thanks so much for the sharing.</p>
              <p>Will like to just add a bit of my input. Nothing definitive as we are all exploring.</p>
              <p>The visual effects and pixels that Jamber sees is not the luminosity that we are taking about. The luminousity is more an experiential clarity.</p>
              <p>There is a significant difference between experiencing/understanding the luminosity before and after realisation of no-self.</p>
              <p>Before the realisation of no-self, any pure awareness/consciousness experience will be interpreted as the Self. In another word, the experience will be ' I have an experience of the Self.'</p>
              <p>After realisation of no-self, the awareness experience may not be experienced by a someone who is me. In another word, 'there is an experience, but it is not experienced by me'.</p>
              <p>The difference is that the ego/sense of self/me/I is not an entity but a transcient effect of grasping that spell-bound awareness into a sense of an individual self having experiences. So the 'I' experience is a subtle 'ignorance' that tint an experience... and this subtle grasping can also be present in the experience of pure consciousness.</p>

              <p>Hi Jamber, if i am not wrong, your symptoms are indicative of the Qi (energy) moving up and opening your ear channels and moving around in your head, therefore all your different signs. It could also be a sign that there are some latent blockages and illnesses in that area. It is not yet Kundalini. One of the signs of true Kundalini is that the sense of a body will disappear and you will feel bliss and clarity like AEN describes in his ejournal.  Although AEN did not practise through the kundalini path, nevertheless he awoke true Kundalini through his insight practices. It is much faster that way. You should combine your practice of meditation with more emphasis on insight.  You can read those stuff as AEN posted and on his blog, they are very helpful.</p>

              <p>Hi Simpo,
              Thanks for your advice.  At this point when I do vipassana style mindfulness, for example, 
              although I can observe my hands swinging by itself without prior "self" control, but I also observe immediately afterwards that a thought will pop up to affirm that these hands are indeed swung by me. Same case for other bodily actions. So while I can notice "no self" with mindfulness but I don't instinctively "believe" this to be true after the meditation is over.</p>

              Hi Criable, do not know whether this will help, something to put into context; in chinese martial arts, there is a particular form call "shen ta",or spiritual fighting, where the practitioner collect his/her consciousness and allows the chi to follow. Some will have  no response,while others have to be restrained as they have unihibited movement which may endanger themselves! Eventually, one will have full mental consciousness will allowing chi to flow through the whole body unimpeded, one is also able to start/stop the chi movements at will. Chi has also been used as  a curative in Taoist medicine.
                  Closer to the point, is you are still no familiar with the chi coursing through your body, it is possible you have an aversion to chi or kundalini in your case. Since you are fully conscious, you need to tune in to your chi. You can practise activatiing your chi in a safe environment with a spotter or two until you are able to direct your chi. Otherwise, look for a sifu who is well versed in this field. My sifu has retired from teaching so I am unable to recommend you any. I know hong gar may have have practice and I've seen someone from this school student practise that! 
                  Another good practice is channel your consciousness during  your breathing sessions toward coursing through your  anterior chakras downwards to the sacrum over to posterior along your spine towards your crown!  Once your control directing your chi, you may direct your chi to front and downwards again amd collect your chi in your chakras!

              <p>Hi Weychin,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the tips. I've tried similar practices back then - doesn't seems to work well for me. Also what you've suggested seems too much "doing" for me - prefer the "non-doing" path.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p style="display: inline !important;">It is getting quite intense recently, even at work I feel like I am going to explode anytime. too much energy. I got spontaneous asana yesterday - really pushes me to my limits . Extreme bending and stretching - really hurts man. i am scare of having spontaneous asanas now. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wow, u guys should be really thankful that you are not going thru all this.  Am envious of people having a smooth spiritual journey. Haha</p>
              <p>l have read other people's experiences of Kundalini - some had it for decades. decades!!!! my nerve system will be cooked by then : )</p>

              <p>hi criable, it seems that you are having a rough ride with kundalini but not to worry, there are people with worse asanas than you. one person i met roll up into a ball and bounced off the walls of his room. he can chose not to share in case of being looked upon as insane but he told me the way he stopped such strong movements is to negotiate with his energy. he talked to it and compromised a gentler action with his kundalini energy.</p>
              <p>please do a search on this forum for a list of things you can do to have an easier time with your kundalini energy. someone has post a list here.</p>
