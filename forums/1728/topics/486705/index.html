              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.231;">Buddhistdoor International Tinley Fynn 2014-10-24</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">Tibetan Vajrayana imagery, for
              the most part, illustrates fantastical literary texts by reflecting metaphor
              and symbolism. Notions of aesthetic achievement and the sense of beauty within
              this tradition rest on complex foundations tied to the religious phenomena
              expressed in the artworks. Practically every object, from the highest to the
              humblest, reflects religious thought and contains symbolism that is often
              bewilderingly abstruse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">During the time I spent working
              in museums and galleries, I came to realize the difficulties of deciphering
              meaning in religious works of art, in particular for those who have no
              knowledge of the relevant tradition. What, for example, would one make of a
              highly iconographical work such as Millais’s </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">Christ in the House of His Parents</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;"> with no knowledge of Christianity or its iconography? Much of its spiritual
              affective power would be lost.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">One of the most common
              difficulties or misconceptions relating to Vajrayana imagery seemed to occur
              when people encountered the wrathful forms of enlightened beings for the first
              time. For example, I was working in a museum that had recently acquired an
              imposing image of the wrathful deity Mahakala. The piece attracted a lot of
              attention from staff as well as the public due to its heavy physical presence
              and exquisite detail, but particularly on account of Mahakala’s captivating,
              wild-eyed countenance and gruesome paraphernalia. After talking with visitors,
              it became clear that many were misinterpreting the image as a vision of brute
              destruction, a force to be feared. But Mahakala is in fact a fierce emanation
              of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, and is especially revered in his role as a
              compassionate protector.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">The confusion arose from
              Mahakala’s fierce appearance, with his inky, midnight coloring, curling beard,
              and fiery eyebrows. In the aforementioned image, he is depicted wearing a
              Brahmin cord of a live green snake coiled around his bulging belly. Beneath it
              rests a grisly garland of wonderfully individualized severed heads, strung by
              the topknots in their hair. As a fierce manifestation of Avalokiteshvara,
              Mahakala takes on such a fearsome form in order to conquer all emotional
              afflictions and to dispel spiritual obstacles for all sentient beings. These
              hindrances are embodied in the myriad dreadful creatures that surround Mahakala
              in the </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">thangka</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">In one hand he grasps a </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">vajra</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">-handled
              chopper, a blade symbolic of the wisdom of the Vajrayana vehicle and a common
              implement of wrathful deities. In his other hand rests an upturned skull-cup
              (Skt. </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">kapala</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">), in which he grinds all negativities. These consist of the
              afflictions that cloud the mind; the five “poisons,” or ignorance, attachment,
              anger, pride, and jealousy; and all other delusions. These impurities are
              symbolized by the blood and liquefied brains of demons, which fill the cup. The
              imagery reflects the actual use of the skull-cup in tantric ritual as an
              alembic for the transmutation of obstructions to enlightenment into the elixir
              of immortality (Skt. </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">amrita</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">) (“immortality” in the Tibetan Vajrayana
              tradition being understood as non-duality rather than corporeal deathlessness),
              wisdom, and compassion. It is one of the most profound ritual objects and
              symbols within Vajrayana iconography, and is imbued with extensive levels of
              meaning. Simply put, it is a metaphor for Mahakala’s true, enlightened nature
              as the ultimate embodiment of compassion, one of the core principles in
              Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">This lyrical and symbolic (rather
              than realistic) approach reflects the complex network of semiotic, doctrinal, and
              mythological associations in Vajrayana iconography. An understanding of the
              sophisticated imagery and metaphors contained within Tibetan art is crucial if
              we wish to appreciate its theological concepts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">At times, the problem viewers
              faced was not that they did not understand the dense religious iconography and
              symbolism in the paintings, but that they could not even clearly identify the
              imagery. I only realized this after I had given a talk on a depiction of a
              multi-limbed, multi-headed Vajrabhairava in sexual union (T. </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">yab-yum</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">),
              when a colleague from another department told me how many times she had walked
              past the work without being able to make out the deities’ interlocking forms.
              Once she was able to do so, the layers of meaning gradually unfolded before her
              as she spent more time contemplating the piece, and through further guidance,
              learned more about it. The depiction of deities in sexual union, or
              “father-mother” embrace, represents another central concept within Tibetan
              Buddhism: the non-dual nature of ultimate reality. It was only by identifying
              the figures and the concepts they represent that she was able to appreciate the
              mastery of the work’s dense but coherent design of spiritual clarity and
              rhythmic force.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">The way in which we display
              objects can also drastically alter our understanding of them. An example of
              this is the way we so often see traditional Tibetan </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">thangka</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;"> paintings
              displayed, removed from their original cloth backings and inserted into modern
              frames to appeal to a Western aesthetic sensibility. This deliberate alteration
              of an artwork, usually without indication on the labeling, could be seen to
              deprive the viewer of an authentic experience that includes a sense of place,
              history, and usage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">Furthermore, the current trend
              toward whitewashed galleries and increasingly spare supplemental information
              and labeling only exacerbates the issue and confuses many viewers who may need
              further guidance. Something as simple as providing photos of how a </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">thangka</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;"> is displayed in a monastery—usually alongside a panoply of ritual items—could
              help the viewer in understanding the </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">thangka’</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">s</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;"> place within the religious and ritualistic context for which it
              was originally intended. Whilst focusing on aestheticism, “art for art’s sake,”
              aesthetic distance, or formalism can be instructive and worthwhile endeavors,
              when taken in isolation these approaches tend to overlook the larger and often
              central meaning of a piece, which can potentially be of so much benefit to
              viewers.</span></p>
