              1,000-ft White Pyramid of Xian</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;  color: gray;">Ancient Origins</span><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: gray;'>‎</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;  color: gray;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">Scattered across an isolated, flat plain in Shaanxi Province,
              near the ancient capital of Xi’an, lie dozens of spectacular pyramid mounds
              that are little known outside China.  Mixed in with the reality of these
              impressive tombs, is a legend of an enormous 1,000-foot white, jewel-capped
              pyramid that would outshine even the Great Pyramid of Giza. While some
              researchers believe that aerial sightings of the ‘White Pyramid of Xi’an’
              correspond with the Maoling pyramid, tomb of Emperor Wu of Han, others maintain
              that the legendary pyramid is yet to be found.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">First Sighting – Fred Meyer Schroder, 1912</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Reported sightings of an enormous white pyramid in China date
              back more than a century to the diary entries of American travel agent and
              trader Fred Meyer Schroder, who spotted a set of pyramids in the distance while
              walking with a Buddhist monk guide in Shaanxi Province in 1912.  He
              reported seeing one giant pyramid, along with smaller pyramids surrounding
              it. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">"It was even more uncanny than if we had found it in the
              wilderness," he wrote. "But those [pyramids] were to some extent
              exposed to the eyes of the world - but still totally unknown in the western
              world."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Schroder estimated that the main pyramid was at least 300
              meters high (roughly 1,000 feet) with 500 meter side. Such dimensions would
              give the structure a volume ten times greater than that of the Great Pyramid in
              Egypt, which measures 140 meters (450 feet) in height. Schroder’s Mongolian
              guide, Bogdo, informed him that the pyramids are at least 3,000 years old and
              that information about them is recorded in ancient monastic documents and is
              well-known in local legend. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Second Sighting – James Gaussman, 1945</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The second and most famous sighting of the White Pyramid of
              Xi’an came from United States Army Air Corps pilot named James Gaussman, who
              was flying from China to Assam in India in the Spring of 1945, when he
              reportedly saw a huge white jewel-capped pyramid to the southwest of Xi’an. He
              later wrote:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #666666; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>I
              flew around a mountain and then we came to a valley. Directly below us was a
              gigantic white pyramid. It looked as if it were from a fairy tale. The pyramid
              was draped in shimmering white. </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #666666; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;"><br> </span></em><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #666666; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>It could have been metal, or some other form of stone. It was
              white on all sides. What was most curious about it was its capstone: a large
              piece of precious gem-like material. I was deeply moved by the colossal size of
              the thing.</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #666666;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Third Sighting – Colonel Maurice Sheahan, 1947</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Just two years after Gaussman’s supposed sighting of a white,
              jewel-capped pyramid, Colonel Maurice Sheahan, Far Eastern director of Trans
              World Airlines, was flying over a  valley near the Qin Ling Mountains,
              approximately 40 miles southwest of Xi’an in Shaanxi Province, when he saw a
              giant pyramid in the landscape below. Sheahan’s encounter was reported in the
              March 28 edition of the New York Times, under the headline ‘</span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #211b14; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>U.S. Flier Reports Huge Chinese Pyramid In Isolated Mountains
              Southwest of Sian [Xi'an]</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In the article, Sheehan is reported as having said that the
              pyramid was around 1,000-ft high and 1,500-ft wide and seemed to "dwarf
              those of Egypt". Two days after the report, the New York Times published a
              photo of the supposed pyramid, which was later attributed to Gaussman.
              Meanwhile, Chinese archaeologists were denying that any such pyramid existed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The photograph was somewhat disappointing – it was not pure
              white, nor was it jewel-capped, and it did not appear to be 1,000-ft high,
              making some question whether the photo was merely a filler added by the
              newspaper and not taken by Gaussman at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The photograph was later identified as the well-known Maoling
              burial mound (see</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #211b14;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/34%C2%B020'17.0%22N+108%C2%B034'11.0%22E/@34.3374993,108.5694451,1805m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0?hl=en"><strong><span style=" color: #a7691b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">google
              maps location</span></strong></a>), the tomb of Emperor Wu of Han (156–87 BCE),
              located in Xingping, Shaanxi Province, China, about 25 miles to the northwest
              of the provincial capital of Xi'an.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The Maoling Mausoleum</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Maoling is the largest of the western-Han Dynasty pyramids
              (or trapezoidal burial mounds) constructed as imperial mausoleums over 2,000
              years ago, but is still significantly smaller than the reported size of the
              ‘White Pyramid of Xi’an’. The tumulus is built with rammed earth and clay with
              a rectangular base of approximately 220 x 220 meters (720 x 720 feet) and a
              height of 50 meters (155 feet).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Construction of the tomb started in the second year of
              Emperor Wu’s reign (139 BC) and was completed upon his death some 53 years
              later. The tomb was filled precious grave goods, many of which are now on
              display at a nearby museum. Surround Maoling are a series of smaller tombs that
              belong to Emperor Wu’s favorite concubine, Lady Li; the military strategist,
              Hao Qubing; and other members of the royal court.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Does the White Pyramid really exist?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Many researchers who have explored both the legend and the
              sightings of the White Pyramid of Xi’an do not believe that corresponds to
              Maoling, citing the fact that the sightings placed the White Pyramid near the
              Qin Ling Mountains, while Maoling lies in an isolated, flat plain. 
              Furthermore, Maoling lies to the northwest of Xi’an, while Gaussman and Sheahan
              placed the pyramid to the southwest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The descriptions also do not match up, including the fact
              that Sheahan described the White Pyramid as having a “perfect pyramidal form”,
              which contrasts to the flat-topped appearance of Maoling. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Is it possible that the New York Times simply used a photo of
              Maoling as a stock photo to represent a pyramid in China, leaving open the
              possibility that a real White Pyramid is still out there waiting to be
              discovered? Or were Schroder, Gaussman, and Sheahan all mistaken in their
              descriptions and size estimations, and their sightings really were of Maoling?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Some believe that the White Pyramid may lie within the rugged
              terrain of the Qin Ling Mountains, difficult to spot among the towering
              mountains and deep gorges. Numerous researchers and explorers have pursued the
              White Pyramid of Xi’an, but none to date have been successful.</span></p>
