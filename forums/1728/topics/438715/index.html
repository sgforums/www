              <p>Beginning of Life on Earth is written in Agganna Sutta</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agga%C3%B1%C3%B1a_Sutta">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agga%C3%B1%C3%B1a_Sutta</a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">for Bardo, <br>Sarah Abbott writes:<br><br>“The Pali word for Bardo is 'antaraabhava' or the intermediate state of existence and there are many references to this term in the commentaries and seems to occur only in the Kathaavatthu text of the Tipitaka. There is an informative debate on this issue in Vagga VIII.2 where the Pubbaseliyas and the Sammitiyas maintain that there is an intermediate state of existence. The Theravadins refute this. You can read it in Points of Controversy, 212ff. which is a PTS translation of Kv. “<br><br>As the summary from the commentary reads “Some..., by a careless acceptation of the Sutta-phrase - ‘completed existence within the interval’ - held that there is an interim stage where a being awaits reconception for a week or longer. The counter-argument is based on the Exalted One’s dictum that there are three states of becoming only - the Kaama-, the Ruupa-, and the Aruupa worlds. (SN, 11, 3 etc).”<br><br>I tend to think the question of anatta is of relevance. Isn’t it only when there is an idea of ‘beings’ rather than a continuous succession of cittas, that these questions arise? Even in a dream-like or coma-like state, there is a succession of cittas and conditioned and conditioning rupas.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">1. Suffering as a result of Birth [jaati dukkha] </span></strong><br>The Lord Buddha taught that suffering as a result of birth is 'built in' suffering for every living being conceived in the realms of the Cycle of Existence. The arising of beings in the Cycle of Existence is by four possible modes of birth:</p>
              <p>1. Hatching from an egg [a.n.daja] e.g birds, lizards and snakes;<br>2. Birth from the womb [jalaabuja] e.g. mammals; <br>3. Arising in dampness or moisture [sa.msedaja] e.g. prokaryotic organisms e.g. mosquitos and some sorts of worms; <br>4. Spontaneous arising in adult form [pali: <strong>opapaatika</strong>] who are as developed as a sixteen-year old complete with adornment from the moment of birth e.g. angels, gods and denizens of hell.</p>

After bathing her in the lake, the devas clothed her in heavenly cloths, anointed her with perfumes, and bedecked her with divine flowers. Soon after a white elephant, holding a white lotus flower in its trunk, appeared and went round her three times, entering her womb through her right side.

              <p>Padmasambhava's Chinese name is called èŽ²èŠ±ç”Ÿ (born in a lotus flower). He was an Indian high monk (also known as Guru Rinponche) credited for spreading Vajrayana Buddhism into Tibet and establishing the foundation of Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
              <p>The buddhist story had it that there was a kingdom in India called å¥¥é‡‘. The king was å�°ç¬¬è�©æ�� (indhi bodhi) and he often practised generosity to his subjects. After his son passed away, there were many disasters in his kingdom such as drought and famine. He once make a prayer to Buddha hoping to salvage the situation.</p>
              <p>Avalotekiteshvara Bodhisattva (Guanyin) in Amitabha Pureland saw this situation and thus requested to Amitabha Buddha to help salvage this suffering. Thus, Amitabha Buddha shot out a red light towards a lotus flower in lake Dana ä¸¹é‚£æ¹–. In addition, he also shot out a HRI word (representing "generosity") towards the diamond seat. Within the rainbow showering of the lotus flower, there sit an 8-year old boy. Thus, was reborn (through spontanous generation) an incarnate of Buddha to save the sentient beings. When this boy grew up, he was said to be able to cure many disease and have supernatural power. This was essentiallly the basic story of Padmasambhava.</p>

              <p>i've heard of :-</p>
              <p><strong>Lotus birth,</strong> or <strong>umbilical nonseverance</strong>, is the practice of leaving the <a title="Umbilical cord" href="/wiki/Umbilical_cord"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">umbilical cord</span></span></a> attached to both the baby and the <a title="Placenta" href="/wiki/Placenta"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">placenta</span></span></a> following birth, without clamping or severing, and allowing the cord the time to detach from the baby naturally. In this way the baby, cord and placenta are treated as a single unit until detachment occurs, generally two to three days after birth.</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_birth">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_birth</a></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Lotus birth is the practice of non-violence. It is gaining more and more momentum nowadays, as parents realize the importance of birth for the psychological development and health of children. <br><br>During my first birth, I have read about Lotus birth and wished it for my newborn daughter. We have bought a special sieve, where we put the placenta. We kept the placenta in the sieve a little higher than Gabbie, while she had her first breastfeeding. The blood from the placenta quickly went down into the baby, providing her with the most precious nutrition. Having had an unassisted home birth, we did not rush to cut the umbilical cord. We waited for it to drain itself. Little by little the red throbbing stalk connecting Gabbie and the placenta became white. Gabbie was very calm and relaxed. She is still very self-confident and attentive. (Still my first birth was not such, which I hope the second one to be. When a doctor came, she cut the umbilical cord. I am thankful that at least we had the wisdom to postpone her coming at least an hour after the complete birth. Yet it was probably not wise to transfer to hospital after such a wonderful birth at home.)</p>
              <p class="AdSenseBoxRight">Lotus birth is a choice of non-violence. Not only the umbilical cord is not cut, it just withers away usually in the third day. The child has the time to accustom to the world, without the sudden breaking from this caring warm friend, it had in the womb for nine months. <br><br>The placenta is part of the baby. The placenta begins developing at implantation from the same source as the baby - the blast cyst. The fetus relies on the placenta, not only for nutrition, but also for gas exchange, waste removal, endocrine and immune support. The correct development of the placenta is important for the development of the embryo and fetus. <br><br>When born, the baby still relies on the placenta. Leaving it attached to the baby after birth, you make a natural transition to take place. There is no rush, no sudden severance, and no confusion. The baby has the feel for the placenta, and at the same time discovers in its own time the new source of love, warmth, nutrition in the mother. The gradual attachment to the mother helps the detachment from the placenta as it dries and naturally separates. The most precious nutrition, hormones, immune support substances enter the baby body. Leaving the placenta intact, you also keep the baby body from infection which might appear in early cord cut. <br>
              
              
              </p>
              <p>All lotus born babies are more mature, quite and happy. They are much more content, and faster maturing. <br><br>I myself embrace the notion of lotus birth for my current birth. It seems the most natural practice. It was first conceived in 1974 by Clair Lotus Day. She witnessed the way a mother Chimpanzee left the placenta attached to the baby until it dropped off. Seeing this, she thought it should not be harmful for a human baby and did the same after the birth of her son. <br><br>Leaving the cord attached was a practice also cherished by the Native Americans, the Thais. It was mentioned in Buddhist traditions as well.</p>
              <p class="AdSenseBoxLeft">Lotus birth is revived today as a practice of yoga parents, and many others who sense the benefit for their newborn baby. It has been practiced even in hospital settings, after Cesarean, or for premature babies.<br><a href="http://www.achildbirth.com/lotus-birth.html">http://www.achildbirth.com/lotus-birth.html</a></p>
