              of Tibetan Buddhism. Teachers of Dzogchen (the GreatPerfection) regard it as
              the innermost essence of the Buddha's teachings. During the last decades of his
              life, Rinpoche's hermitage above the Kathmandu Valley was frequented by
              visitors from all over the world. Today, his many monasteries and retreat
              centers are managed by his four sons who are lineage holders, including Tsoknyi
              Rinpoche. What follows is adapted from </span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Rainbow Painting<em> by Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, translated by Erik Pema Kunsang, and reprinted with

              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Buddhist practice involves three steps known as intellectual
              understanding, experience and realization. Intellectual understanding occurs
              when, for instance, we hear that emptiness, meaning empty cognizance, is our
              nature. The mental idea we get of this is called "understanding." In
              the case of experience, we are told how to recognize emptiness so that we can
              see exactly how this empty cognizance is. We have a taste of it, maybe no more
              than a glimpse, but, nevertheless, an experience of what is called
              "recognizing mind essence." That is what the word
              "experience" means in this context. When this glimpse is followed by
              training in repeatedly recognizing the nature of mind and avoiding being
              carried away by thoughts, we gradually grow more and more used to this
              experience. In this case, by recognizing the empty nature we are disengaging
              from its expression, the stream of deluded thinking. Each time the expression
              dissolves back into the state of awareness, progress is made, and realization
              finally occurs. Ultimate realization is when delusion has totally collapsed and
              there is no reoccurrence of discursive thought whatsoever.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Thoughts are like clouds and can vanish just as clouds naturally
              disperse into space. The expression, meaning thoughts, are like clouds, while
              rigpa the awakened state, is like sunlit space. I use the metaphor of sunlit
              space to illustrate that space and awareness are indivisible. You do not
              accomplish or create the sunlit sky. We cannot push the clouds away, but we can
              allow the clouds of thought to gradually dissolve until finally all the clouds
              have vanished. Ultimate realization occurs when there is no trace of the cloud
              layers whatsoever.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It is not as if we need to decide, "I hate these thoughts. I only
              want the awakened state! I have to be enlightened!" This kind of grasping
              and pushing will never give way to enlightenment. By simply allowing the
              expression of thought activity to naturally subside, again and again, the
              moments of genuine rigpa automatically and naturally begin to last longer. When
              there are no thoughts whatsoever, then you are a buddha. At that point the
              thought-free state is effortless, as well as the ability to benefit all beings.
              But until that time it does not help to think that you are a buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Listening to this explanation is merely getting the idea. We
              intellectually comprehend that emptiness is empty yet cognizant and that these
              two aspects are indivisible. It is like going to a buffet where we don't
              actually taste anything, but only receive a guided tour or explanation of the
              different dishes: "This is Indian food, that is Chinese food. Over there
              is French cuisine." Without eating anything your knowledge of the food is
              only intellectual understanding. Once you finally put the food in your mouth,
              that is experience. When your stomach is full, that is realization. Realization
              is the total and permanent collapse of confusion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Empty cognizance is our nature. We cannot separate aspect of it from the
              other. Empty one aspect of it from the other. Empty means "not made out of
              anything whatsoever"; our nature has always been this way. Yet, while
              being empty, it has the capacity to cognize, to experience, to perceive. It's
              not so difficult to comprehend this; to get the theory that this empty
              cognizance is buddha nature, self-existing wakefulness. But to leave it at that
              is the same as looking at the buffet and not eating anything. Being told about
              buddha nature but never really making it our personal experience will not help
              anything. It's like staying hungry. Once we put the food in our mouth, we
              discover what the food tastes like. This illustrates the dividing line between
              idea and experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In the same way, if we have correct understanding, the moment we apply
              what our master teaches, we recognize our nature. That there is no entity
              whatsoever to be seen is called "emptiness." The ability to know that
              mind essence is empty is called "cognizance." If it were only blank,
              bare space, what or who would know that it is "blank" or
              "empty" or "nothing"? There would be no knowing. These two
              aspects, empty and cognizant, are indivisible. This becomes obvious to us the
              very moment that we look; it is no longer hidden. Then it is not just an
              intellectual idea of how emptiness is; it becomes a part of our experience. At
              that moment, meditation training can truly begin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We call this training "meditation," but it is not an act of
              meditating in the common sense of the word. There is no emptying the mind
              essence by trying to maintain an artificially imposed vacant state. Why?
              Because mind essence is already empty. Similarly, we do not need to make this
              empty essence cognizant. All you have to do is leave it as it is. In fact,
              there is nothing whatsoever to do, so we cannot even call this an act or
              meditating. There is an initial recognition, and from then on we do not have to
              be clever about it or try to improve it in any way whatsoever. Just let it be
              as it naturally is—that is what is called meditation, or more accurately "nonmeditation."
              What is crucial is not to be distracted for even a single instant. Once
              recognition has taken place, undistracted non meditation is the key point of
              practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>"Distracted" means that once the attention wavers and loses
              itself, thoughts and emotions can take place. Distraction is the return of all
              these kinds of thoughts, in which the continuity of nondual awareness is lost.
              The training is simply to recognize again. Once recognition takes place, there
              is nothing more to do; simply allow mind essence to be. That is how the
              cloud-covers gradually dissolve.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The ultimate state is totally free from any obscuration, like the short
              moment of recognition. However, in the latter there is still the tendency for
              the obscurations to return. The state of realization, complete enlightenment,
              means that no cloud-cover can ever return; its causes are utterly and
              permanently eliminated. When the clouds vanish, what else can cover the sun?
              That is the final or ultimate realization—when there is only brilliant, pure
              sunshine throughout space without any cloud-cover whatsoever. In other words,
              everything that needed to be removed has been removed and everything that
              needed to be actualized is already present. The empty sky and the brilliant
              sunshine are not of our making. They have always been there and are fully
              actualized when the cloud-cover is eliminated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Please understand that there are three steps: recognizing, training and
              attaining stability. The first of these steps, recognizing, is like acquiring
              the seed of a flower. Once it is in your hands and you acknowledge it to be a
              flower, it can be planted and cultivated. When fully grown, flowers will bloom;
              but the seed needs the right conditions. However, we must first acknowledge
              that it is indeed a flower seed. In the same way, the naked awareness that has
              been pointed out by your master should be acknowledged as your nature. This
              recognition must be nurtured by the right conditions. To cultivate a seed, it
              must have warmth and moisture and so on; then it will certainly grow. In the
              same way, after recognizing we must train in the natural state: the short
              moment of recognition needs to be repeated many times. As the support for this
              training, have devotion to enlightened beings and compassion for unenlightened beings.
              Devotion and compassion are a universal panacea, the single sufficient
              technique. A famous quote says, "In the moment of love, the nature of
              emptiness dawns nakedly." Both compassion and devotion are included in the
              "love" mentioned here.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Training is simply short moments of recognition repeated many times and
              supported by devotion and compassion. In addition, there are practices called
              the development and completion stages. All these practices facilitate
              nondistraction. Repeatedly training in nondistraction is how to progress in the
              practice of mind nature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Finally comes the stage of stability. When this moment of nondistraction
              lasts unceasingly, day and night, what will that be like? When the three
              poisons are obliterated and the qualities of wakefulness become fully manifest,
              will we be ordinary human beings or divine? A single candle-flame can set the
              whole of a mountainside ablaze. Imagine what it would be like when our present
              experience of the wide awake moment free from thought becomes unceasing. Is
              there anything more divine than possessing all the wisdom qualities and being
              utterly free from the three poisons?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We can deduce from this that training is needed. We must grow up, just
              like a new-born baby. The infant born today and the adult 25 years later is
              essentially the same person, isn't he? He is not someone else. Right now, our
              nature is the buddha nature. When fully enlightened, it will also be the buddha
              nature. Our nature is unfabricated naturalness. It is this way by itself: like
              space, it does not need to be manufactured. But we do need to allow the
              experience of buddha nature to continue through unfabricated naturalness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>One sign of having trained in rigpa, the awakened state, is simply that
              conceptual thinking, which is the opposite of rigpa, grows less and less. The
              gap between thoughts grows longer and occurs more and more frequently. The
              state of unfabricated awareness, what the tantras call the "continuous
              instant of nonfabrication," becomes more and more prolonged. This continuity
              of rigpa is not something we have to deliberately maintain. It should occur
              spontaneously through having grown more familiar with it. Once we become
              accustomed to the genuine state of unfabricated rigpa, it will automatically
              start to last longer and longer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>What is meant by stability, then? First, to gain stability, we need to
              have recognized genuine rigpa. We should have clearly ascertained the true
              state. Through training, we should have gained some degree of stability in this
              so that we are no longer carried away by circumstances. These conditions can be
              either positive or negative. Negative circumstances such as difficulties,
              mishaps or illness, are much easier to recognize and not be overcome by. Thus,
              it is easier to practice during times of difficulty than it is when being
              successful. The worst obstacle for a practitioner is when obstacle for a
              practitioner is when crowds of followers begin to gather and say, "You are
              so wonderful; you're such a great practitioner. You are very special. Please give
              us teachings. Please guide us." Starting to have a great following causes
              the most difficult kind of obstacle because, unless one is the foremost type of
              practitioner, one will think, "Hey, maybe I am special. Maybe there is
              something to what they say." Only the foremost type of practitioner will
              not be carried away by such "positive" conditions. When we reach the
              point of not being carried away by either positive or negative circumstances,
              we have gained some stability.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>There are signs of accomplishment, such as having good health and long
              life or becoming famous and influential, but these belong to the superficial type
              of accomplishment. The true, unmistaken signs of accomplishment as established
              by the masters of the lineage, are to possess compassion, devotion and an acute
              sense of impermanence. Combined with this, thoughts grow less and less and the
              genuine awakened state lasts for increasingly longer periods. In the moment of
              unfabricated awareness thoughts do not have the power to remain, because that
              instant is totally free from the duality of perceiver and perceived. What we
              call <em>sem</em>, dualistic mind, is always involved in upholding the concepts
              of perceiver and perceived. Rigpa, however, is by nature devoid of duality. If
              the concepts of perceiver and perceived are not kept up, duality crumbles, and
              there is no way conceptual thinking can continue.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It's not hard to gain some intellectual understanding of the Dharma; as
              they say, talk is cheap. Anyone can talk about it. One can easily say,
              "The awakened state is amazing. It is endowed with all perfect qualities,
              totally free from any faults. In fact, nothing can ever harm the state of
              rigpa. It is totally untainted." Or it is very easy to say,
              "Everything is illusion. The whole world is merely an illusion. Nothing
              has any independent or true existence. It's all magical trickery." We can
              deliver these words from our mouths, but this is not enough to destroy the
              state of confusion, to make our delusion fall apart. To do this, we need the
              genuine experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Experience here, means to recognize the essence that is like space. In
              the moment of rigpa, any deluded state is seen as baseless, illusory and
              rootless. The false nature of thought becomes totally obvious, in a very
              immediate and personal way that is not just an idea that we have heard. At that
              moment we directly touch the truth of those statements. By attaining stability
              in this direct experience, the great masters of the Kagyu lineage could make
              statements like, "The rock here is totally transparent. Everything is the
              magical trickery of illusion." Due to their level of realization, these
              masters could pass through solid rock, drill themselves into the ground, walk
              on water, fly through the air and so forth. This was not because they had
              developed some special powers through their practice or because they were very
              strong or stubborn, but simply because everything is unreal from the very
              outset. Because of realizing the insubstantial nature of things, as it is,
              practitioners have been able to manifest such signs of accomplishment.
              Otherwise, we can study the teachings and say pithy things like, "There is
              nothing to worry about in the bardo. Everything that then occurs is an
              illusion; there is nothing real about it." But when we eventually arrive
              in the bardo states, we will be completely embroiled in the raging river of our
              fear.<br> <br> Let me reiterate the three steps, intellectual understanding, experience and
              realization. Intellectual understanding is, for instance, to have heard about
              the awakened state. Theory, is, of course, important, and we should definitely
              know the intent of the teachings. However, we should not leave it with that. We
              need to incorporate all three: theory, experience and realization.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Then there is recognizing, training and attaining stability. Of these
              three, "recognizing" is like identifying the authentic seed of a
              beautiful flower. "Training" is like planting the seed in fertile
              soil, applying water, and so on—not leaving the seed lying on bare stone. The
              seed needs the right circumstances to grow in. By applying these skillful
              means, nothing whatsoever can prevent the plant from growing. Likewise, we need
              to train in, to develop the strength of the recognition of mind nature. After
              applying water and creating positive nurturing conditions, the plant will
              certainly grow taller and taller. Eventually, it will fully blossom with
              beautiful brightly colored flowers, because this potential was inherent to the
              seed. But this does not happen all at once. In the same way, we hear about the
              amazingly great qualities of buddhahood, such as the fourfold fearlessness, the
              eighteen unique qualities of the buddhas, the ten powers, the ten strengths and
              so forth. We then wonder, "Where are those qualities? How come they are
              not apparent in a moment's experience of the awakened state! What is
              wrong!" It can be understood in the following way. Within a few seconds' glimpse
              of the state of rigpa, these qualities are not experienced the same as when
              recognition has been stabilized. Although inherently present in our nature,
              these qualities do not have time to be fully manifest. Just as the seed is the
              unmistaken element for the fully blossomed flower, so the moment of recognizing
              the awakened state is definitely the basis for buddhahood itself.</span></p>

              grow. But do not expect the moment of rigpa to be an amazing or spectacular
              experience. Actually, there is one aspect of the awakened state that is truly
              amazing—the fact that conceptual thinking and the three poisons are totally
              absent. If we look around, apart from rigpa, what can really bring an end to
              thought, the very creator of samsara! We can drop a million nuclear bombs on
              this world and blow everything to smithereens. If that stops conceptual
              thinking and delusion, let's do it! But it doesn't. It would be fantastic if we
              could simply blow up all the confused samsaric realms and end them permanently,
              but unfortunately that's not possible…Is there anything in this world that
              stops deluded thinking! Nothing other than the moment of recognizing the
              awakened state can truly cut through the stream of deluded thinking. That's
              quite amazing.</span></p>
