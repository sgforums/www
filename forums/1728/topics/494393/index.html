              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">China Tears Down the Tibetan City in the Sky</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Steve Shaw August 03, 2017 The Diplomat</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">China is demolishing homes and evicting thousands from Larung
              Gar, the world’s largest Tibetan Buddhist institution.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At the eastern end of the vast Tibetan Plateau lies a
              sprawling monastery named Larung Gar, which is the largest Tibetan Buddhist
              institute in the world and a monumental landmark to Tibetan culture, religion,
              and history.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is home to anywhere between 10,000 and 40,000 residents,
              including monks, nuns, and visiting students. Because Larung Gar sits at an
              elevation of over 13,000 feet (3,962m), it has become known as a “city in the
              sky.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But in June 2016, the Chinese government in Beijing issued an
              order that stated the site had become overcrowded and its population had to be
              reduced to a maximum of 5,000 by October 2017.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Within weeks, work teams descended on the peaceful community
              and began tearing down people’s homes, reducing cabins to nothing more than
              splintered wood and shattered glass. The owners were forced to sign documents
              agreeing not to return to the area again and to “uphold the unity of the
              nation.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">They were then forced to board buses and were taken away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Last year around 3,730 residents were made to leave and 172
              monks’ residences and 1,328 nuns’ residences were destroyed — a total of 1,500
              residences demolished. Further demolitions began earlier this year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The entire process — from eviction through to demolition and
              finally to forced removal by bus — is opaque,” said a spokesperson for advocacy
              organization Free Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The authorities within the area have shared no information
              on the plight of those who are removed, with people saying families are forced
              to house any relatives who have been bused out of Larung Gar.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As pictures began to emerge of the destruction, human rights
              groups and international organizations called it a crackdown on religious
              freedoms and an attempt by the Chinese government to destroy an icon of Tibetan
              culture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But with travel to the area severely restricted for
              international travelers, the media, and aid organizations, it was almost
              impossible to see first-hand what was taking place.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">However, one young Canadian-Chinese man was able to
              reach Larung Gar due to his Chinese background and ability to speak fluent
              Mandarin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Hidden Truth</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In early 2017, David Chan traveled to Chengdu, the
              capital of China’s Sichuan province and the closest major city to Larung Gar,
              where he joined a group of Chinese tourists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Chinese citizens are permitted to visit Tibet as part of
              China’s push to make the region an attractive destination for both tourism and
              resettlement.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I met a few Chinese tourists who wanted to go; I didn’t know
              them beforehand,” Chan said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“We then joined one of a number of very small tours. Drivers
              take groups of maybe three to five in SUVs and you need the driver’s knowledge
              to reach Larung Gar. Without these groups it would have been very difficult to
              get there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“It was a very long journey from Chengdu and as we traveled
              we all got to know one another. When I asked my companions about Tibet they
              gave me the state media’s account of things. I was told that Tibetan people are
              very prosperous, that the Chinese government takes good care of them, that they
              are given money by the government for their land, and that their livestock can
              be sold to the Chinese government at a very premium price, and they have large
              tax subsidies, many things like that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“They told me that Tibetans had no reason to oppose the
              Chinese government because their lives were very good. They told me the ones
              who protest were just troublemakers.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tibetans have campaigned for freedom ever since Chinese
              forces began an occupation of their land in 1950. The Chinese government claims
              that accusations of oppression in Tibet are a myth and they say that Tibet
              becoming part of the People’s Republic of China has been overwhelmingly good
              for the population.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When looking at Tibet’s economic development today it can be
              argued that China is correct in saying that they have improved the region by
              introducing things such as highways, railways, hotels, and electricity but that
              is only if you are looking at the situation on the surface.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In reality social and ethnic discrimination are prevalent,
              with ethnic Han Chinese being the main people to benefit from development. In
              2016 the independent watchdog Freedom House noted: “Under the Chinese
              constitution, autonomous areas have the right to formulate their own
              regulations and implement national legislation in accordance with local
              conditions. In practice, however, decision-making power is concentrated in the
              hands of senior, ethnic [Han] Chinese CCP [Chinese Communist Party] officials.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Freedom House added, “[T]he few ethnic Tibetans who
              occupy senior positions serve mostly as figureheads and echo official
              doctrine.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Jobs from tourism, infrastructure, and construction projects
              are also primarily awarded to Han Chinese migrants and in some areas Han
              Chinese migration has been so extensive that Tibetans have been made a minority
              their own country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">People face arrest and punishment for “crimes” as simple as
              displaying a Tibetan flag or publicly protesting.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It took two days for Chan to reach Larung Gar from Chengdu
              and he had to pass through two road blocks which were patrolled by armed
              sentries. Throughout the journey he was regarded as a domestic tourist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The tourist group arrived at a time of year when demolitions
              had not fully resumed after the winter season.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The level and extent of demolitions varied across different
              parts of the monastery complex. At some parts, it appeared as if strips of
              residences were being cleared out, and at some other parts, I saw numerous
              homes spray painted with numbers and earmarked for demolition. There was also
              debris lying around. I think I saw quite a lot of it. Bulldozers too,” Chan
              said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The demolitions were extensive but not widespread. By saying
              this, I mean to say that it was not all of the residences which were being
              destroyed. Some were, and some were not. There were also modern concrete
              residences being built by the government, alongside the original homes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“These demolitions appeared to be more about reducing the
              number of monks and nuns.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Unlike the tourists that accompanied him, Chan was keen to do
              more than just take photographs. To understand more about what was going on he
              wanted to talk to the monks and nuns directly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I separated myself from the rest of the group by going to a
              narrow alley way and I must have tried to speak to at least 20 different people
              but none would talk to me. Then I recalled that in the Brad Pitt movie Seven
              Years in Tibet, two European mountaineers managed to get through to a Tibetan
              village chief because they showed them a picture of the Dalai Lama. So I got a
              picture of him on my phone. It was by this method that I finally met a nun who
              was willing to engage with me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“This nun could converse in Mandarin. She told me that
              the devotees saw this problem [the demolitions] as one they could not stop
              because China was too powerful. She said that to say there was overcrowding was
              not right as they had been living fine on their own. I saw that if indeed
              overcrowding was a problem, then the government could easily just build more
              houses to the side of the mountain without demolishing anything. There is was
              so much land it would be so simple.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Free Tibet does not entirely dismiss the notion that Larung
              Gar may have become overcrowded but they say that the way that China is dealing
              with it is the problem. The group argues that evicting people and driving them
              thousands of miles away before forcibly destroying their homes does not
              demonstrate concern for safety and security, nor is it a policy that is seen
              elsewhere in major Chinese cities that also face problems with overcrowding.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Real Agenda</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Based on what he saw first-hand; Chan says that he believes
              that what was occurring was a case of economics and development trumping
              cultural and historical sensitivity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“This appeared to be more about rejigging the area for
              tourism and economic activity. The negative impact on the monks’ and nuns’
              chosen lives appeared incidental. I didn’t see this as an outright wiping out
              of the monks’ and nuns’ practices. But it was still an injustice because their
              voices had apparently not been given a fair and considered hearing by the
              Chinese government.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I was told by both the nun and my Chinese driver that the
              government wants to make the place popular for tourists. The government seems
              to recognize that the place is quite unique in the world and they want to play
              down the political problems with Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“They also want to keep much of the basic Tibetan
              architecture so when tourists come they can see all these nice buildings and
              history. Now, this is all well and good but the huge cultural cost is that
              eventually it will no longer be a pure Buddhist academic place, it will become
              a tourist attraction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Making this even more evident is the hotels, which are about
              a five-minute drive from Larung Gar in the township called Serthar. Our driver
              took us to one of the many new hotels that had been built here by Chinese
              companies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The place we were taken to had at least at the same interior
              finishing standard as as a three or four-star international hotel. You had
              marble flooring in the lobby, you had big and very comfortable beds, and with
              this place being about 4,000 meters above sea level, this hotel even had
              individual oxygen pumps in each room. If you come down with altitude sickness –
              which people often get at around 4,000 to 5,000 meters – this hotel had a pump
              and you can just attach a mask and you can then breathe pure oxygen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I had been on high-altitude mountain treks in the past and
              had never seen anything like this. I was so surprised going into the room. I
              reflected that this kind of thing is probably only found in the best hotels in,
              say, the Swiss alps.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The hotels are part of a much larger project, according to
              Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet (ICT), which released a
              report in March titled “Shadow of Dust Across the Sun: How Tourism is use to
              Counter Tibetan Cultural Resilience.” In this report the group claims that
              demolitions in Larung Gar and Yachen Gar — another Buddhist complex in Sichuan
              province — are aimed at transforming two of the world’s most famous Buddhist institutes
              into tourist destinations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Matteo Mecacci, president of ICT, said in a statement: “The
              evidence presented in this report calls into question the entire basis of the
              demolition of homes and expulsion of nuns and monks, which have caused such
              distress. It cannot be possible for the Chinese authorities to claim there is
              overcrowding and not enough space for genuine religious practitioners given the
              extent of construction over a vast area in this remote valley.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Chan felt that this development work appeared to not only be
              detrimental to important historical and cultural sites in Tibet but, as a side
              effect, also threatened to gradually dilute Tibetan culture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I noticed that Serthar likely used to be very Tibetan but
              these hotels were being built by people who don’t speak Tibetan. And then you
              also find that there are stalls beginning to appear selling Chinese goods.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I spoke to my driver about this and he said that the Chinese
              government will tell people go to Tibet, set up a life there, set up a farm, grow
              your own crops. It can be a fresh start away from the big cities and if you
              choose to live away from the cities you can have a good life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“For example, there are now thousands and thousands of Han
              Chinese citizens living in Qinghai province. They go there, build a house and
              they settle there. Over time this leads to the place becoming more Han than
              Tibetan. Perhaps many years ago it was 10 percent Han but then it grows to
              20 percent, 40 percent, 60 percent. I think the government wants to convert
              Eastern Tibet to make the Han population the majority. Not to eliminate the
              Tibetans but maybe make eastern Tibet 60 percent Han Chinese and 40 percent
              Tibetan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“It is important that people care about this because the
              local Tibetans don’t seem to have a voice. Many don’t speak English or Mandarin
              and as the government does all these things it has very large impact on their
              lives. I can appreciate the intentions of the Chinese government in wanting to
              develop the area, but the huge and irreparable cost in terms of undermined
              cultural heritage seems to be something that the officials do not fully
              appreciate.</span></p>

              about it and nothing is being done about it.”</span></p>
