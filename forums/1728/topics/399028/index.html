              <div style="font-style: italic;">you mean rebirth? Since your future
                                       this life has so much uncertainty, why think about next life?<br> <br> continue your good deeds with the right purpose in mind. Bring happiness
                                       to others...</div>

              Actually the poster is asking in the right direction.<br> <br> Because if we only concern ourselves with our current life situation, 
                                      then we lose sight of what's even more important: our future lives, and 
                                      our liberation.<br> <br> We all have lived countless lives. But due to our short sightedness (as a
                                       result of forgetting our past lives), we live each life over again, 
                                      concerning ourselves with accumulating things in our lives, only to lose
                                       them all at the end, and then restarting the cycle again. It is very 
                                      short sighted kind of living. In fact, as my Taiwanese teacher said, if 
                                      you can remember (and he can) your innumerable past lives, you will be 
                                      sick and tired of it and find it pointless, meaningless and full of 
                                      suffering.<br> <br> If we want to start learning dharma, we have to enlarge our scope. Our 
              scope cannot be just for the benefit of this life alone, e.g. making 
              your life better, as whatever conditioned things are impermanent and 
              eventually end. In fact as you said, your present life is uncertain: 
              there's no telling what will happen next day, next month, next year, 
              next decade. In fact, you cannot even guarantee you'll live to the next 
              day! However one thing is certain: There's nothing you can bring to your
               next life except wisdom, merits, karma, and other conditions. Therefore
               instead of totally investing our whole life on something so temporary 
              and uncertain, we should invest in something that is of long-term 
              benefit and certainty.<br> <br> Just think about it: It is likely that in this life, you will only life 
                      up to around 80 years. You may accumulate a lot of things in life, but 
                      then in the end, you cannot bring them into the next life. Not any 
                      possessions, not your money, your house, or your spouse, your children, 
                      your kins, your friends, etc. But if you have cultivated much merits, 
                      you can live thousands or milions of years next life in the celestial/heaven 
                      (deva) realm due to the ripening of wholesome karma. Isn't that 
                      infinitely better than anything you have accomplished in this short 
                      human life? And yet, in Buddhism that is *not* the ultimate aim because a
                       rebirth in heaven is still a temporary birth and limited by the 
                      'amount' of good karma we have (eventually it will be used up). Hence 
                      rebirth in heaven is not ultimate, it is not the end of samsaric cycles 
                      of rebirth, it is not the end of sufferings, it is not the end of birth 
                      and death.<br> <br> To attain a rebirth in heaven is already far better than any of the 
                      limited and short term comforts you can find in this life. And yet, to 
                      attain the first stage of enlightenment, Sotapanna, is hundred times 
                      better than rebirth in heaven as it assures one's liberation.<br> <br> And hence, the Buddha said:<br> <br> <em>Dhammapada 178:<br> <br> Sole dominion over the earth,<br> going to heaven,<br> lordship over all worlds:<br> the fruit of stream-entry<br> excels them. </em><br> <br> Hence, it is very important that we should aim to end the cycle of 
                          rebirth and samsaric sufferings. This should be the base-line aspiration
                           or scope for all Buddhists, and even higher than that, if one practices
                           Mahayana one should work for the liberation of not only oneself but all
                           other sentient beings as well, and attain Buddhahood.<br> <br> Buddhism isn't meant to let you live your life more comfortably, have 
                              more money, etc, as all these are conditioned and eventually comes to an
                               end.<br> <br> As Loppon Namdrol said:<br> <br> <em>Whoever is attached to a result for this life, is not a Dharma 
                                      person.<br> <br> The purpose of Dharma is liberation, not feeling better in this life. 
                                      The purpose of Dharma is not the cultivation of mundane compassion, and 
                                      so on.<br> <br> The purpose of Dharma is to control afflictions, then overcome them, and
                                       finally, to attain a state of total omniscience and freedom.</em></div>
