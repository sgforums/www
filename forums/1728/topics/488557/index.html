                  29, 2015 <strong><span style="color: #333333;">By
                  Frank Armstrong</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> and <strong>Michael Smith VILLAGE</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> attacks by individuals purporting to
                  represent Islam once again linked that religion to violent behaviour anathema
                  to Western, liberal values. From stoning of adulterers to beheadings and
                  burnings alive of infidels, flogging bloggers and even female genital
                  mutilation, a picture registers of a religion stubbornly rooted in a barbaric
                  past, even if those practices have little or no real justification in Islam,
                  and are abhorrent to most Muslims.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>What we generalise as ‘Islam’ is a constantly evolving and
                  diverse set of beliefs influenced by the varying settings of its over one
                  billion global adherents. A range of interpretations of Islam can be found,
                  many of course self-consciously malign. Nevertheless most Muslims in the West
                  find little difficulty reconciling their lifestyles with the norms of their
                  societies, albeit they may be highly critical of the foreign and domestic
                  policies of their governments.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Muslims may embrace the uniquely dangerous doctrine of Jihad the
                  place of which in Islam is mysterious to heathens.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Care is needed as the term Jihad for some refers to spiritual as
                  well as military conflict and where military it implies defence not attack.
                  Nevertheless again, some of those hostile to Islamists have cynically used the
                  term to their advantage.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>There are also various views as to whether Sunnis and Shias
                  differ on the concept. In Shia Islam, Jihad is one of the ten Practices of the
                  Religion, (though not one of the Angel-Gabriel-revealed mandatory Five
                  Pillars).</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>With the Islamic revival in the eighteenth century a
                  fundamentalist movement preaching Jihad was perpetrated by the Wahhabi movement
                  which spread across the Arabian peninsula starting in the 18th century,
                  emphasising Jihad as armed struggle. Wars against Western colonial forces were
                  often declared Jihad. For example the Mahdi in the Sudan declared Jihad against
                  the British and the Egyptians in 1881.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>In the twentieth century, one of the first Islamist groups, the
                  Muslim Brotherhood, emphasised physical struggle and martyrdom in its credo:
                  “God is our objective; the Quran is our constitution; the Prophet is our
                  leader; struggle (Jihad) is our way; and death for the sake of God is the
                  highest of our aspirations”.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The group called for Jihad against the new Jewish state of
                  Israel in the 1940s, and its Palestinian branch, Hamas, called for Jihad
                  against Israel when the First Intifada started in 1987.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>In the 1980s the Muslim Brotherhood cleric Abdullah Azzam,
                  sometimes called ‘the father of the modern global Jihad’, opened the
                  possibility of immediate Jihad against unbelievers. Azzam issued a fatwa
                  calling for Jihad against the Soviet occupiers of Afghanistan. In 1996,
                  al-Qaeda announced its Jihad to expel foreign troops and interests from what
                  they considered Islamic lands. Osama Bin Laden issued a Fatwa (compulsory
                  religious edict), calling for war against the US and its allies.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Before rising to indignation about this it is instructive to
                  recall Christianity’s history of justifying the Crusades, the Inquisition and
                  oppression of minorities. The Bible was even used to justify slavery before the
                  American Civil War. The corpora of works that constitute both Christianity and
                  Islam contain a wide range of possible interpretations, though the era and
                  ethos of crusading are now remote.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>So what at a minimum does religion mean for violence?</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Sociologist Emile Durkheim claimed that religions are: “a system
                  of ideas with which the individual represent to themselves the society of which
                  they are members”. This follows Aristotle’s dictum that: “men create the gods
                  after their own image”.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>A contrasting view, articulated by another sociologist, Max
                  Weber, is that religions of themselves generate socio-economic conditions: most
                  famously he argued that the Protestant work ethic led to modern capitalism.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>This brings us to the important question of whether religious
                  violence is a product of the religion itself or emanates from the wider
                  society.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The Christian Philosophical Anthropologist, René Girard,
                  identified a universal tendency towards what he termed “acquisitive mimesis”.
                  By this he meant that humans copy each other’s consumption (a version of monkey
                  see, monkey do) which naturally leads to rivalry over scarce resources.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Unlike other animals, from quite early in our evolution we
                  developed a capacity to employ weapons, beginning with stone projectiles. With
                  this capacity for wreaking destruction early humans found it necessary to
                  resolve potentially fatal conflicts brought about by competition for resources.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Girard identified the mechanism of the scapegoat across a whole
                  range of cultural contexts.  It serves to pacify the violent tendencies
                  that bedevil human societies. Jesus Christ’s crucifixion is an obvious example,
                  but he found this to be a near-universal feature of tribal societies.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Religions play a prominent role in scapegoating. According to
                  Girard: “<em>The sacred is violence</em>, but if religious man worships violence
                  it is only insofar as the worship of violence is supposed to bring peace;
                  religion is entirely concerned with peace, but the means it has of bringing it
                  about are never free of sacrificial violence”.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>With this apparent paradox in mind we may explore the origins of
                  violence in Islam in its socio-cultural context.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The harsh desert environment of post-nomadic Saudi Arabia where
                  literacy was rare and violence endemic preserved religious practices that we in
                  the West consider barbarous. The discovery of enormous oil reserves after World
                  War I thrust unimaginable wealth into the hands of the new state, and the
                  fundamentalist Wahhabi form of Islam has been used by the ruling Al-Saud family
                  to legitimise its rule.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Weber’s view of religion resonates here. The often intolerant
                  Wahhabi teachings emanating from Saudi Arabia over the last decades have had a
                  strong and worrying influence on many of the global Islamic community and on
                  Al-Qaeda and ISIS. The values of a violent, desert society remain influential.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Reflecting on the nature of, and differences between, global
                  religions is instructive. One distinguishing feature of the monotheistic faiths
                  of Christianity, Islam and Judaism is they firmly place man at the centre of
                  the universe with dominion over all life.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>This anthropocentrisim drives how they consume food – a
                  fundamental part of their relationship with the earth. It allows or mandates
                  carnivorousness.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Rene Girard observed: “Man is not naturally a carnivore; human
                  hunting should not be thought of in terms of animal predation”. He argues that
                  animals were first domesticated for their use in sacrifice, not for their value
                  as food, and believes that: “What impelled men to hunt was the search for a
                  reconciliatory victim”. And he concludes: “The common denominator is the
                  collective murder, whether attributed to animals or men, rather than the hunted
                  species or various techniques employed.”</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>In contrast most forms of Buddhism and other Eastern traditions
                  see humans as one among other animals and advocate restraint on the unnecessary
                  killing of other animals for food.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Of course, Buddhism is not universally pacifist. Buddhist
                  institutions supported Japanese militarism in their Russian war and World War
                  II. Buddhist monks were involved in the killing of 200 Muslims in Myanmar in
                  2012.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>At face value prohibitions on meat-eating may seem irrelevant to
                  inter-human violence, but if a religion restrains all intentional killing the
                  culture of inter-human violence in that society may not develop. Prohibiting
                  violence towards animals may remove the need to scapegoat other humans. We
                  might even begin to reverse the acquisitive mimesis that brings humanity to the
                  brink of self-destruction.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>We might expect to find that violence is pervasive in
                  meat-eating societies (ie all those active in violence in the Middle East and
                  other places where Jihad and colonialism reign) but that where religion is more
                  central to people’s lives there might be a greater prevalence of sacrificial
                  violence.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The twentieth century witnessed the emergence of a form of
                  politics divorced entirely from violence. This is the great achievement of
                  Gandhi who guided Indians to throw off the shackles of the British Empire in
                  India with non-violent resistance.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Pacifism and vegetarianism often go hand in hand. Leo Tolstoy
                  was another who recognised the need to reverse the acquisitive streak in human
                  nature claiming that: “as long as there are slaughterhouses there will be
                  battlefields”. The cycle of violence could begin at the dinner table.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Gandhi explicitly connected his political philosophy with how
                  other animals were treated when he said: “The greatness of a nation and its
                  moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated”. This moral
                  progress we assume involves the development of a society where other human
                  beings are valued and not seen in competitive terms: a curbing of the tendency
                  towards acquisitive mimesis.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Of course religion is not the only driver of violence in the
                  Middle East or the other flash-points of violence at the nexus of the Western
                  and Islamic worlds. In terms that progressives in the West identify with more
                  readily it is certainly the case that would-be-terrorists observe a global
                  environment where disproportionate wealth, power and indeed weaponry lie in the
                  hands of Western states whose foreign policies have often been directed against
                  Muslim countries. Jihad is tailored to suit these conditions: extreme and
                  seemingly gratuitous violence balances the wealth and power differential
                  between Western powers and Jihadists.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Many in the West affect understanding and liberal stances. For
                  example, even Marie Harf, spokesperson for the US  State Department,
                  proclaimed in February: “we cannot win this war by killing them. We cannot kill
                  our way out of this war. We need to go after the root causes that leads people
                  to join these groups. We can help countries work at the root causes of this –
                  what makes these 17-year-old kids pick up an AK-47 instead of trying to start a
                  business”.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Of course such rationalisation does not provide an explanation
                  for the atrocities committed in the name of for example Osama bin Laden, who
                  hails from one of the wealthiest families in Saudi Arabia.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Australian conservative blogger Andrew Bolt, a former associate
                  editor of the <em>Herald Sun</em>, disdains the very idea of  addressing
                  “root causes” of Islamists’ “insatiable anger”: “Islamic State releases a video
                  showing how gleefully it slaughters unarmed civilians and demonstrating that
                  there is no root cause that can be addressed that doesn’t involve Jews and
                  other unbelievers dying. There is nothing to talk about with such people, and
                  the only rational response is to shoot them before they shoot you”.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Irish journalist Kevin Myers simplistically distinguishes
                  followers of Chomsky who think that evil deeds must stem from some logical
                  cause or grievance from those of Edmund Burke who know evil when they see it:</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>“On the one hand, there were the Chomskyites, henceforth the
                  chumps, who felt that there was an underlying ‘reason’ for 9/11, which had been
                  ‘created’ by US policies. And there were the others, the Burkians, who felt
                  that 9/11 represented yet another occasion when evil had captured the souls of
                  men”. He also believes that “within, it seems, all ‘moderate’ Muslim
                  communities are some fundamentalists who hold the local franchise for the
                  global grievance of Islam. And no one really knows what such Islamic
                  fundamentalists want, because the demands change according to whatever market
                  the local Islamic franchisee is operating in. … somewhere inside the greater
                  Islamic mind is an absurd sense of victimhood: and where there is no local
                  grievance, why then there is always ‘Palestine’, as if those few disputed acres
                  in the vast Islamic landmass of Afro-Asia merited the unanimous and indignant
                  global furies of all Muslims”. Of course this logic fails to explain why the
                  sense of victimhood is absurd.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Effectively corroborating the Myers’ line, Philip Bobbitt, a law
                  professor and nephew of President Lyndon Johnson wonders why, if terrorism is
                  rooted in events-driven Muslim grievances about western support for Israel or
                  engagement in Afghanistan and Iraq, so few of those apprehended in the West for
                  terrorist crimes are Palestinians, Afghans or Iraqis.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The reaction may not be sophisticated at all. For example, a
                  2010 report from the International Council on Security and Development showed
                  that 92 percent of the Afghanis surveyed had never heard of 9/11. It also
                  showed that four in 10 Afghans believed the US was on their soil in order to
                  “destroy Islam or occupy Afghanistan”. The survey admittedly only canvassed
                  men, and relied primarily on respondents from Helmand and Kandahar, the two
                  most war-torn provinces in the country.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Nevertheless lack of sophistication is not needed in order to
                  drive anti-colonialism or even anti-Zionism. There is coloniser-imposed
                  injustice, enough to enrage a saint. The illegality of much of Israel’s
                  settlement, the dubious ethics of the secret 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement which
                  divided up spheres of influence in the Middle East among western colonisers and
                  the Balfour Declaration (1917) transmitted from the British foreign secretary
                  to Baron Rothschild imposing a new Israeli state in Palestine. And the
                  barbarity of escapades like Israel’s assault last year on Gaza, justify anger
                  and, for any thinking from a rational person inevitable rage.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>There are cultural and religious reasons, rational and
                  irrational motivations, driving antipathy to Western adventures in the Islamist
                  world. Violence characterises much of contemporary ‘civilisation’ not just the
                  Middle East or Jihadists. Beyond containment there are better ways to defuse
                  violence and even some ethoses and religions, like Veganism, Buddhism and
                  Humanism that enshrine them better than others.</span></p>
