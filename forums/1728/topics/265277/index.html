            <div class='col-md body'>Source: Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika with Commentary (You can msg me for a request of this E-Book, I think there are some very valuable teachings in there but I haven't got the time to read much. Sent by a friend.)<br><br><strong>7.1. Dependant Arising as a Central Notion in Buddhism</strong><br><br>The BuddhaÂ’s theory of dependent arising has an immediately obvious<br>significance Â— it is the only positive ontological theory expounded by<br>the Buddha.The formulations of the four Noble Truths and the Eightfold<br>Path are of course positive teachings,but they are not really philosophical<br>dogmas. They are descriptions of the condition of humankind, the ultimate<br>goal of humankind, and teachings about how to achieve that goal.<br>Only dependent arising describes the ontic status of the universe (dependence), its mode of creation (dispositions conditioned by ignorance), its<br>future fate (the appeasement of dispositions which reverses the cycle of<br>arising), the ontic nature of the individual (impersonal aggregates conditioned<br>by ignorance), and the future fate of the individual (extinction<br>through enlightenment). Scholar Gunapala Malalasekera has expressed<br>the status of these various formulations well in saying that Â“Just as the<br>Four Noble TruthsÂ… form the heart of the BuddhaÂ’s teaching, so does<br>the doctrine of dependent arising constitute its backbone.Â”1<br><br>Dependent arising was likewise of supreme importance for Nagarjuna.<br>As explained above, Nagarjuna opened his treatise with a dedication<br>that placed dependent arising at the center of his appreciation of<br>the Buddha and as central for Madhyamika thought. Indeed, renowned<br>scholar of Buddhism Gadjin Nagao has gone so far as to say that Nagarjuna<br>Â“regarded Sakyamuni as the great master precisely because of his<br>elucidation of dependent arising.Â”2 As with the above discussion of selfnature,<br>a prefatory presentation of the doctrine and its development is<br>necessary. Dependent arising is not a theory that the Buddha developed,<br>but one that he saw. As he sat under the Bodhi tree on the night of his<br>full awakening he discovered the fact of the mutual contingency of all<br>existent things.This awareness led him to the Â“threefold knowledgeÂ” that<br>marked his station as one who had achieved full enlightenment sambuddhah).<br>First, he saw, through his new- found knowledge of dependent<br>arising, the origin of suffering in ignorance and the end of suffering in<br>wisdom. Second, fixing Â“his mind upon the chain of causation, in direct<br>and reverse order,Â”1 he obtained the knowledge of all of his previous existences.<br><br>This provided him with the recollection of his previous actions<br>and their karmic consequences, enabling him to see that he had lived out<br>all of his accrued karma and that this would be his last existence. Third,<br>having so clearly perceived the origin of the cycle, he knewwith certainty<br>that he had fully erased the binding ignorance, and would surely never<br>return to existence.He knew himself to be Â“Thus Gone;Â” he was a Tathagata.<br>2<br><br>A key to the BuddhaÂ’s teaching is that he was not the only one privileged<br>to see dependent arising. Anyone who follows the path he recommended<br>can realize its nature and workings. More than this, individual<br>freedom requires that one verify these truths for him- or herself. The importance of and possibility of perceivingdependent arising isexemplified<br>by the story of the conversion of Sariputta and Moggallana related in<br>chapter one,above:all thatwas needed for each of them to realize nirvana<br>was to be told Â“all things that arise will cease.Â” The duty of the Buddhist<br>monk who is aware of the BuddhaÂ’s formulation of dependent arising is<br>to examine each of the links for him- or herself, discover how they are<br>conditioned, howthey arose, and howthey can be ceased.3 This is the key<br>to the Buddhist path. The import of this duty is far greater than merely<br>verifying one aspect of the BuddhaÂ’s teachings. Rather, one who follows<br>this will understand the entirety of the BuddhaÂ’s teachings, his Â“dharma,Â”<br>and, more, one who follows this is guaranteed to see the Buddha himself.<br>He once said Â“those who see dependent arising will see the dharma;those<br>who see the dharma will see dependent arising,Â” and another time he said<br>Â“those who see the dharma will see me; those who see me will see the<br>dharma.Â”4</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>7.2. The Meaning of Dependent Arising</strong><br><br>There are two main formulations of dependent arising, one general and<br>the other specific. In its most abstract form, the theory holds that Â“That<br>being, this comes to be; from the arising of that, this arises; that being<br>absent, this is not; from the cessation of that, this ceases.Â”1 The more specific<br>formulation details the process by which links in the chain arise, one<br>after the other, and which links directly influence which others.The most<br>common of these specific formulations is the twelve-link one described<br>in chapter two, but there are minor variations on this. The crux of all formulations of the theory is the mutual interdependence of all things.Every<br>element is both conditioned and is a conditioner, so every element is both<br>an effect and a cause. There is no transcendent law of cause-and-effect<br>ruling the process, for there is only a relative Â“beforeÂ” and Â“after,Â” only a<br>relative causal sequence. On the one hand no element is individually autonomous, and on the other hand neither is there a higher force ruling the<br>process. Since no thing exists on its own, no thing is real in itself.A thing<br>is dependent on another, then, not just for its identification, as Â“tallnessÂ”<br>is dependent on Â“shortness,Â” but for its very existence, as the piece of<br>clothing is dependent upon the threads which constitute it.<br>Thus far, the doctrine of dependent arising may seem clear and<br>obvious. If so, it is only because one does not yet understand it in all of<br>its implications.The BuddhaÂ’s attendant, ananda, once said to his master,<br>Â“It is surprising, sir, it is wonderful, sir, how profound this dependent<br>arising is and how profound is its illumination. Yet it seems to me as if<br>very simple.Â” Â“Say not so, ananda, say not so,Â” admonished the Buddha<br>in reply.2 The theory is abstruse and its ramifications vast.<br><br>In the eyes of Buddhism,the doctrine of dependent arising solves all<br>metaphysical philosophical problems.Etiology is solved because there is,<br>not an absolute beginning, but an temporally indeterminate welling up of<br>mutually-conditioned factors.Since no factor is temporally prior, as such,<br>the discussions of genesis manage to avoid positing an absolute beginning<br>without recourse either to a metaphysical entity like a transcendent<br>God or to causal priority ad infinitum. Eschatology is solved because,<br>since the ultimate end of existence is merely the appeasement of arising<br>through appeasement of ignorant dispositions, there is no need to predict<br>apocalypses or nihilistic destruction of existence. Things arose, but there<br>was no ultimate cause, and things will cease, but there is no ultimate fate.<br>Soteriology is likewise solved; one need not face either a final Judgment<br>Day nor mere annihilation, but rather one will just face the self-caused<br>abandonment of equally self-caused afflicted existence.When ignorance<br>ceases, birth ceases, and death ceases. Karma, metempsychosis, and the<br>nature of the soul are also all solved without recourse to abstract soul-<br>theories. Karma is neither an adventitious elemental defilement, like it is<br>for the Jains, nor a subtle and transcendental deterministic fate, like for<br>certain schools of Hinduism. Karma is simply the correlation between<br>cause and effect. Karma is determined by oneÂ’s actions and dispositions,<br>and when one appeases oneÂ’s dispositions then, when eventually the lingering effects of prior causes have come to fruition, existence will be no<br>more. The simple conditioning of one link by another link enables the<br>Buddhist karma to be determined without being deterministic,and subtle<br>without being transcendental. Reincarnation is similarly solved with no<br>recourse to atman-theories.Death is conditioned by birth, which is in turn<br>conditioned by ignorance.Thiscontiguous contingencyobviates the need<br>to posit a substantial and transcendently-enduring soul. The perceived<br>existence and continuity of the individual is likewise explained without<br>recourse to atman: since the aggregates of the individual arise together,<br>and these aggregates account for the entire nature of the individual, there<br>is no need to posit an extraneous metaphysical entity like the self.The debate<br>of free will versus determinism is also solved.There can be no Â“freeÂ”<br>will, for no element of existence is independent. All things are dependent<br>upon other things, and so is the will. This does not mean that the universe<br>is bound by inexorable determinism: the Buddha declared himself to be<br>an upholder of Â“free action,Â”1 for it is oneÂ’s will in the form of volitional<br>dispositions which both caused existence in the first place and will ultimately<br>bring about appeasement and freedom.2 Two more theories repugnant<br>to the Buddha, the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism,<br>are obviated by dependent arising. Nothing is eternal, for, when a thingÂ’s<br>conditioning factors cease, then it will cease.Neither is anything destined<br>to face destruction in non-existence for,as contingent upon other things, it<br>was never independently real in the first place. Finally, dependent arising<br>solves ontology. Things are empirically real, for they were arisen. However,<br>they are not ultimately real, for there is no substance, tÃ²n, on which<br>they are founded. There is Becoming, but no Being. Since things are not<br>ultimately real, the affliction of suffering can be vanquished; if suffering<br>were ultimately real, then it could never be abolished.<br><br>The Abhidharma schools were the first to offer an interpretation of the doctrine of dependent arising, but interpretation probably was not their intent. They understood the doctrine to mean the temporal succession of momentary and discrete elements (dharmas) which were in themselves real.1They did not see dependent arising to mean that the elements were only relatively real, but rather they saw it as describing the interactions<br>between already-existing elements. The point of the doctrine dependent<br>arising, they felt,was solely to negate soul-theories, not to negate<br>the elements themselves. Dependence was thus seen as referring to the<br>conditioning relations between the elements,which relations were meticulously<br>analyzed and systematized. It was these relations that became<br>seen as the dynamic force of becoming.<br><br>The Perfection of Wisdom (Prajnaparamita) writings criticized the<br>Abhidharma theory of relations as being, not an explanation of dependent<br>arising, but an interpretation of it, and an interpretation with which<br>they disagreed. The systematic hierarchy of relations was seen as being<br>no less metaphysical than the speculative theories of causality which the<br>Buddha was trying to avoid.2 A further problem was that, while it was<br>not explicitly wrong to describe the universe as made up of discrete elements,<br>it was misleading. To isolate an element temporally was to take<br>a first step towards conceptually reifying that element. The approach<br>adopted by the Perfection of Wisdom school was to elevate the theory of<br>dependent arising from the empirical to the conceptual by formulating a<br>two- truth theory, a theory later embraced by Nagarjuna. This approach<br>declared that the Abhidharma schools saw reality from the standpoint of<br>lower, conventional truth, and so they saw all as being composed of real<br>elements which are mutually dependent in terms of causal efficacy. The<br>Perfection of Wisdom, on the other hand, believed themselves to have<br>access to perfect prajna, Â“wisdomÂ” (hence the name of this school, Prajnaparamita).<br><br>From the standpoint of higher, ultimate truth afforded by<br>such wisdom, elements were seen as being, not just causally conditioned,<br>but even ontologically conditioned. That is, the elements did not merely<br>constitute conglomerate things which, as an assemblage, had no inherent<br>identity and real existence;moreover, rather, the elements themselves had<br>no inherent identity or real existence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The result of this interpretation of dependent arising is that the elements<br>are Â“empty;Â” as dependent arisen, they are not real and are without<br>self-nature. Furthermore, concepts, too, are unreal.3 All concepts are<br>based on dualities as Â“tallnessÂ” is dependent on Â“shortness.Â” The ultimate<br>implication of this interpretation is a shift from emphasis on logical reasoning,<br>as evidenced in the Abhidharma, to non-dual intuition, or prajna.<br>This non-dual intuition prefigured NagarjunaÂ’s use of comprehensive<br>four-fold negations and the later mysticism of Zen.1 In the writings of both the Perfection ofWisdom school and Nagarjuna, all propositions regarding<br>a subject are negated (e.g. something is, is not, both is and is not,<br>neither is nor is not), but no alternative proposition is offered. The only<br>way to grasp the subject is through non-dual, non-conceptual intuition.<br><br>(pls continue reading from the book...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While this book is a good read, I think we should also read with a pinch of salt, as the subtle meaning of Madhyamika is not easily understood. It's always best to read Nagarjuna himself, or read recognzied masters' commentaries, such as those by Chandrakirti.<br><br>With all due respect to the author, Jonah Winters may not be the best person to understand Madhyamika from. He has Bachelor in Buddhist Studies, but his background seems to be more of "Bahai Faith". Anyway, setting the author's biography aside, just wish to point out a few things that I find a little questionable in what your have quoted from him.<br><br>PS: My understanding of Madhyamika is very very limited. Only hope to highlight a few points that one may need to pay more attention to, in case we may develop wrong view. Just for your reference only. Please don't take my words too seriously, but rather go through proper training on Madhyamika under the guidance of authentic teachers.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points which I found questionable: </span><br><br>1. <blockquote>Karma is simply the correlation between cause and effect.</blockquote>Whether this was simply a poetic expression, or the author literally means that, it leans towards a mistaken view of cause and effect. There is no correlation between cause and effect.<br><br>On the ultimate level, there is no truly independently existing cause, and no truly independently existing effect. It is not a correlation, because there is no truly existing relationship either.<br><br>On the relative level, effect is merely the assembly of causes and conditions. It is not a correlation, because the fruition of causes depend on conditions, and thus causes may not at one point immediately ripen into effect.<br><br>Therefore, at both ultimate and relative levels, this statement is incorrect.<br><br>2. <blockquote>In the writings of both the Perfection ofWisdom school and Nagarjuna, all propositions regarding a subject are <strong>negated</strong> (e.g. something is, is not, both is and is not, neither is nor is not), but no alternative proposition is offered. </blockquote>When the term "negation" is used, one has to be extremely careful.<br><br>For Nagarjuna's point is not to affirm nor negate. For affirmation lends towards eternalism, while negation lends towards nihilism - both of which are extreme views.<br><br>In Nagarjuna's "No", there are always many many "Yes's".<br><br>When statements such as "there is no truly existing self and phenomena" are made, we readers often take it to mean a "negation of self and phenomena".<br><br>However, it is erroneous to think that Buddha and Nagarjuna ever "negated self and phenomena", because there are no "self" and "phenomena" to negate in the first place.<br><br>Because of the constraints of language, and our habitual tendency of clinging, we readers tend to think that there is actually a "self" that we have to "negate" using analysis and meditation and whatever.<br><br>But Buddha and Nagarjuna, with all their skilful means, such as listing the four extreme views to be avoided, are trying very hard to help us see that is no "self" in the first place, and therefore there is nothing to negate. And that "nothing" to negate, includes "nothing" itself. i.e. even "nothing" also doesn't truly exists. "Self", "phenomena", "nothing", "everything", "God", whatever..... all only exist as totally abstract ideas.<br><br>And of course no propositions are offered, because "the viewless view is the highest view". If with analysis, we end up finding a "view", then it is an indication that we are clinging.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>3. <blockquote>The only way to grasp the subject is through non-dual, non-conceptual intuition. </blockquote>As explained above, there is no way to "grasp" the "subject". There is no truly existing "subject" there in ultimate level;<br>and in relative level, Nagarjuna's "subject"/"view" is.......if one is being forced to make a statement to represent his view......it would be "view of viewlessness".<br><br>While "non-dual non-conceptual intuition" is a favourite phrase by many people trying to explain Prajnaparamita, due to our habitual tendency to grasp to concepts, most of us would immediately develop an idea of something known as "intuition" that would help us to "understand" the "subject/view". This in itself is grasping already, and is therefore based on wrong view.<br><br>4. <blockquote>This approach declared that the Abhidharma schools saw reality from the standpoint of lower, conventional truth, and so they saw all as being composed of real elements which are mutually dependent in terms of causal efficacy. The Perfection of Wisdom, on the other hand, believed themselves to have access to perfect prajna, Â“wisdomÂ” (hence the name of this school, Prajnaparamita).<br><br>From the standpoint of higher, ultimate truth afforded by such wisdom, elements were seen as being, not just causally conditioned, but even ontologically conditioned. That is, the elements did not merely constitute conglomerate things which, as an assemblage, had no inherent identity and real existence;moreover, rather, the elements themselves had no inherent identity or real existence.</blockquote>Firstly, I'm not so sure if the Abhidharma schools remaining today are being criticized by Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti, though they criticized the older Sravakayana schools of thought - mainly Vaibhashikan &amp; Sautrantrikan schools - which posited that there are valid objects of clinging, i.e. there is a smallest base which could be identified as "self". These schools are mostly extinct by now.<br><br>Some Buddhist teachers say that all schools of Buddhism that remain today do not hold this view anymore. Buddha also said before that to attain Arahanthood, Bodhisattva, and Buddhahood, one must always enter through the path of Prajnaparamita. Therefore, many great masters say that the Sravaka path also understands emptiness - Madhyamika.<br><br>As a point of clarification, with regard to Vaibhashikan &amp; Sautrantrikan view, and even with regard to the Mahayana Cittamatrin view, unlike what the author wrote, Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti <strong>do not </strong>regard these schools as only seeing things from the the conventional level. In fact, they criticized these schools to have mistaken view of both the ultimate and relative truths. Because in the view of Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti, ultimate and relative truths are not separate.<br><br>Indeed, Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti do not look down on conventional truth to be the "lower truth" (as stated by the author). Conventional truth (C.T.) is equally important as Ultimate truth (U.T.), because C.T. is U.T. ; U.T. is C.T. ; C.T. is none other than U.T. ; U.T. is none other than C.T. They are not different.<br><br>If not due to Ultimate Truth of emptiness, the Relative Truth of dependent arising cannot happen. It is due to emptiness that all phenomena can appear, grow and flourish. How so? If only one can find a single object that is truly and independently existing in the world, then the whole world cannot function. If for example, grass, is simply grass, and by its true nature is grass, and therefore cannot be anything else... then the whole world would collapse. Because goats cannot see it as food; insects cannot see it as house; all beings must see "grass" just as the same "grass" as we humans see. But because of emptiness - the lack of inherently existing grass, therefore dependent upon conditions, grass can appear as "greenery" to humans; "food" to cows; "home" to insects.<br><br>Similarly, if not due to the Relative Truth of dependent arising, the Ultimate Truth of emptiness would have become nihilism.<br><br>Relative Truth and Ultimate Truth are one and the same, but explained as two truths, due to the poverty of language, and the need for us sentient beings to rely on language as the only tool of communication, so as to help us sentient beings clarify and analyse the nature of our existence.<br><br>Prajna - the Perfection of Wisdom - sees both things as they are (true nature, aka ultimate truth) and things as they appear (appearance, relative truth). It is incorrect to think that our gross senses see relative truth and only by developing Prajna, we see ultimate truth.<br><br>All the various schools of thought criticized by Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti actually represent our own clinging and grasping thoughts - which is why the study of Madhyamika is a very good and important foundation for those who are interested in going further into the Dharma practice of non-duality.<br><br>The arguments put forth by Vaibhashika, Sautrantrika &amp; Cittamatra schools, when reduced to modern day simpler language, all sound very familiar to our own thought patterns - fully represently our mistaken perceptions of our self and the world.<br><br>Therefore, study of Madhyamika can begin as an intellectual pursuit, but its benefits go beyond it, as its actual aim is to target our grasping mind, our clinging.</div>

That is, is it relevant to explain Â‘karmaÂ’ this way Â–correlation between cause and effect?<br><br>On a relative level, the law of causation must always involve Â‘timeÂ’ and the definite recurrence of events.  That is, an event (E1) after time interval (T1) must occur without fail after the presence of conditions C1,C2,C3...  The law of cause and effect has been the main pillar of inductive science and is also our ruling Â‘belief systemÂ’ in this era.  The question is, is this merely a mechanism for the thinking mind to understand the phenomena universe or is this truth?  At the ultimate level, what role do time, cause and effect play is the question.  The answer must be experiential and alive, not theoritical.<br><br><blockquote><br>When the term "negation" is used, one has to be extremely careful.<br><br>For Nagarjuna's point is not to affirm nor negate. For affirmation lends towards eternalism, while negation lends towards nihilism - both of which are extreme views.<br><br>In Nagarjuna's "No", there are always many many "Yes's".<br><br>When statements such as "there is no truly existing self and phenomena" are made, we readers often take it to mean a "negation of self and phenomena".<br></blockquote>Very very well said young one.<br><br><blockquote><br>And of course no propositions are offered, because "the viewless view is the highest view". If with analysis, we end up finding a "view", then it is an indication that we are clinging.<br></blockquote>A moment arises and subsides instantly yet it is timeless.  Established no views so that timelessness can be experienced.  However thought always think that non-establishment of views equals demolishing all views and this is natural when the mind is dualistic.  It only knows either this or that, the many many "Yes's" are not seen.</div>
