              <p>Yes but not only that. If in that gap between two thoughts you are not aware, then you will simply fall asleep or enter an unconscious state.</p>
              <p>However if in that gap between two thoughts, you remain aware and turn the light around, you will realise Pure Awareness, your buddha-nature.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong>As Dzogchen teacher Tenzin Wangyal (1997, 
                      29) points out:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong>The gap between two thoughts is essence. But if in that gap 
                      there is a lack of presence, it becomes ignorance and we experience only a lack 
                      of awareness, almost an unconsciousness. If there is presence in the gap, then 
                      we experience the dharmakaya [the ultimate]. </strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And 19th Century Dzogchen Master Shambkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol writes:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em>Although these two states are similar,<br> Insofar as neither is intentional meditation,<br> Nonmeditation samadhi that is like a continuous stream<br> Is just remaining in a vivid clarity<br> That is like a bright, cloudless sky -<br> Limitless, pervasive, transparent.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>The other is merely a dull state of mind<br> That is nothing in particular:<br> A constricted, fragmentary, biased state<br> Lacking lucid clarity,<br> A vague and hazy stupefaction.</em></strong></p>

              <p>If you're talking about purely shamatha methods... then concentration is necessary to stabilize the mind in the object of contemplation (say: a candle flame, or a visualisation, etc). Solely shamatha methods are sometimes practiced to stabilize the mind first before moving on to vipashyana (insight) meditation. However I personally do not practice these kinds of methods nowadays.</p>
              <p>However if you are talking about insight meditation, then that kind of fixed-concentration is not necessary, however you need to abide in/as awareness. Abiding as awareness, as your buddha-nature, you do not focus on anything in exclusion to others... because Buddha-Nature is all pervasive and all encompassing, like a mirror it reflects everything as they are without choosing or rejecting.</p>
              <p>That's why Master Shen Kai says, ’‘å®š’æ˜¯å°†æ˜¾çŽ°ä¹‹è‡ªæ€§ï¼ŒæŒ�ä¹‹ä¸�åŠ¨ã€‚</p>

              <p>Yes but not only that. If in that gap between two thoughts you are not aware, then you will simply fall asleep or enter an unconscious state.</p>
              <p>However if in that gap between two thoughts, you remain aware and turn the light around, you will realise Pure Awareness, your buddha-nature.</p>

              <p>it is useful for many reasons because we can't just stop thoughts altogether so we utilise it for developing mind in a positive way. For eg, we analyse the nature of reality through Madhyamaka logic, or we contemplate love and compassion in a conceptual way with reasoning.. or we meditate on the flaws of desire by seeing that the body is actually composed of alot of disgusting material...</p>
              <p>All these analysis will transform mind gradually into a state that is calm, loving and free from the mental afflictions like desire, anger, ignorance, pride etc.</p>
              <p>Through all these analysis, one can tame or calm down the mind and make it conducive for realisation.  In certain cases, it triggers off realisation. As in the case of HH Dalai Lama. </p>
              <p>It is also useful as a preliminary for developing the qualities of renunciation.  For instance, to really go deep into the practice, one has to have some sense of sacrificing our usual worldly habits or activities, to have more time, so if we just try to go into samadhi meditation str8 away, we may find our initial strong motivation slagging after a while, we lose steam and don't know why we are doing this. So initial analysis develops in us the strong understanding of impermanence, the faults of samsara, the precious human birth and the infallability of karma. Then when we practise, the renunciation will drive us to greater heights.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is quite systematic and it leads one from one realisation to another and gradually leads to liberation, varying of course by peoples' needs and characteristics. But in general,  the system is very clear-cut and worked out, provided one is willing to follow it, it is a sure way to insight. Analysis is very important in Buddhism for most people.</p>

              <p><br>It is not entirely samadhi or insight but it contains elements of both.</p>
              <p>To contemplate any topic, one needs concentration (which is from samadhi), and if one is analysing based on Madhyamika on the nature of reality, at a certain point, it can become insight too. </p>

              <p>Yes, the person is trapped in a mental state of dullness. This state is free from conceptualization, so it appears to be thought-free, but that dull state is nevertheless still a mental state - it is a non-conceptual, dull mental state. Not a non-conceptual awake state.</p>

              <p>I will reply your questions in two posts.</p>
              <p>Your question: <em>Wad's dharma attachment? wad's self attachment?</em></p>
              <p>I wrote in my 'Actual Freedom and Buddhism' document:</p>
              <p>Theravadins and its commentaries tend to emphasize the realization of Anatta/Emptiness of Self [Thusness’s Stage 5] rather than the Emptiness of Dharmas [Thusness’s Stage 6], that is why in Mahayana it is said that Arahants only realize Anatta/Emptiness of Self but not the Emptiness of Dharmas, but this is a contestable point (and I’ve seen some Theravadin masters/teachers who are exceptionally clear even on Emptiness) and not the consensual understanding of all Mahayana/Vajrayana masters (but is the generally accepted understanding and there are reasons to believe this as all of the Theravadin Abhidhamma commentators who are supposedly ‘arhats’ only talk about the realization of the Emptiness of Self but not the Emptiness of Dharmas, but then again, whether those commentators are truly Arhats in Buddha’s own definition is another contestable point that cannot be resolved due to the Buddha’s passing – furthermore there are Mahayana and Vajrayana masters who follow the teachings of Mahayana sutras like Lankavatara Sutra that unambiguously states that the Hinayana Arhat has realized the twofold emptinesses and that the realization of Arhats correspond with the 6th Bodhisattva Bhumi, but I shall digress as it is getting too theoretical), but this also explains why the latter development about 400 to 600 years after the historical Buddha’s passing, of large scrolls [consisting hundreds of pages] of Mahayana sutras that emphasizes so much on the Emptiness of Dharma/Phenomena  [especially the early Mahayana scriptures; the Prajnaparamita scriptures which includes the famous Heart Sutra but many other larger ones as well] as they see something missing in the Hinayana schools’ understanding of Emptiness) – but anyway I want to clarify at this point that Thusness’s Stage 6 ‘Mahayana’ Emptiness is not contradictory to Thusness’s Stage 5 or AF experience, but as 'complementary' and a 'further insight' into the nature of experience/sensations. None of these implies a substance or essence as with the stages prior to Stage 5. For example, Stage 5 when realized overcomes the view of an ontological essence to Consciousness of Stage 4, but Stage 6 includes the previous insight and experience of Stage 5 (there is only sensations without a Subject) but further penetrates into the nature of Dependently Origination and the unlocatability/unfindability/ungraspability of phenomena/sensations.<br><br>As Thusness states,<br><em><br>“Phase 4 and 5 are the grayscale of seeing through the subject that it does not exist in actuality (anatta), there are only the aggregates. However even the aggregates are empty (Heart Sutra). It may sound obvious but more often than not, even a practitioner that has matured the anatta experience (as in phase 5) will miss the essence of it.<br><br>As I have said earlier, phase 5 do appear to be final and it is pointless to emphasize anything. Whether one proceeds further to explore this empty nature of Presence and move into the Maha world of suchness will depend on our conditions.”</em><br><br>Here is an excerpt from a Buddhist glossary site on the definition of twofold Emptiness which corresponds to Thusness’s Stage 5 and 6 respectively: <em><br><br>Two emptinesses (äºŒç©º) include (1) emptiness of self, the Ä�tman, the soul, in a person composed of the five aggregates, constantly changing with causes and conditions; and (2) emptiness of selves in all dharmas—each of the five aggregates, each of the twelve fields, and each of the eighteen spheres, as well as everything else with no independent existence. No-self in any dharma implies no-self in a person, but the latter is separated out in the first category. Realization of the emptiness of self in a person will lead to attainment of Arhatship or Pratyekabuddhahood. Bodhisattvas who have realized both emptinesses ascend to the First Ground on their Way to Buddhahood.</em><br><br>A more updated and shortened definition from the same glossary states:<br><br>http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#empty2 <br><em><br>two emptinesses (äºŒç©º). (1) The emptiness of a sentient being composed of dharmas, such as the five aggregates, and dependent on causes and conditions; (2) the emptiness of a dharma dependent on causes and conditions (see eighteen emptinesses).<br></em></p>

              <p>There is no problem with thinking per se, the only problem is when you are *attached* to your thinking.</p>
              <p>Once, a monk presented the following verse to the Sixth 
                        Patriarch, composed by the Chan Master Wo Lun.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span lang="EN-US"><em>Wo Lun has ways and means</em></span><em><span lang="EN-US"><br> To cut off the movements of many thoughts<br> When the mind does not rise in reaction to circumstances<br> The tree of enlightenment will steadily grow.</span></em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Hearing this verse, Master Hui Neng said, "This verse indicates 
                        that the person who composed it has not yet completely realized the 
                        essence of mind." The Sixth Patriarch then showed the monk the 
                        following verse.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span lang="EN-US"><em>Hui Neng has no ways and means<br> </em></span><em><span lang="EN-US">To cut off the movements of many 
                          thoughts<br> The mind is often rising in reaction to circumstances<br> How then, can enlightenment grow?</span></em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>From this verse, you can understand that Hui-Neng discourages any form of unnatural thought suppression. Supposed you stop all thoughts from arising, you are no different from a living dead person, incapable of functioning as a human being.</p>
              <p>Even though you may be able to temporarily suppress thoughts and defilements in a state of meditative absorption, nevertheless when you return to daily lives the thoughts will still continue to arise.</p>
              <p>Therefore thought suppression is not the means to gain liberation.</p>
              <p>What is the means to gain liberation? It is to be able to have thoughts but not grasp on them. Thoughts are also the manifestation of Buddha-nature in the same way that all the waves in the sea are water. Since all thoughts are the manifestation of Buddha-Nature, simply recognising thoughts as they are is enough for thoughts to self-liberate. Buddha-Nature is not something apart and separate from thoughts, for it is the nature and essence of all arising phenomena.</p>
              <p>All thoughts are the vivid self-luminosity of Buddha-Nature, and they are empty of any inherent existence or solidity.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Nietzsche relates
                                      the denial of a thinker to a denial of the process of thinking.
                                      Why; after all, do we believe that there is an act of thinking?
                                      Because that act is what the thinker does: stringing thoughts
                                      together by creating new thoughts on the basis of the old thoughts.
                                      If there is no such thinker, then there need be no such act. That
                                      leaves only thoughts, but one at a time, although the succession
                                      may be rapid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The significance of
                                      Nietzsche's remarks for us is that we find the same claim in the
                                      Asian nondual philosophies, particularly in Ch'an Buddhism. In The
                                      Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, Hui Neng explains what
                                      prajña is:</span></p>
              <blockquote>

                                      To know our mind is to obtain liberation. To attain liberation is
                                      to experience the Samadhi of Prajna, which is ''thoughtlessness".
                                      What is "thoughtlessness"? Thoughtlessness is to see and know all
                                      Dharmas (things) with a mind free from attachment. When in use it
                                      pervades everywhere, and yet it sticks nowhere....When our mind
                                      works freely without any hindrance and is at liberty to "come" or
                                      to "go", we attain Samadhi of Prajna, or liberation. Such a state
                                      is called the function of "thoughtlessness". But to refrain from
                                      thinking of anything, so that all thoughts are suppressed, is to be
                                      Dharma-ridden, and this is an erroneous view. <a rel="nofollow" name="%5B20%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#20">[20]</a></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The term
                                      "thoughtlessness" would seem to recommend a mind free from any
                                      thoughts, but Hui Neng denies this: rather, "thoughtlessness" is
                                      the function of a mind free from any attachment. The implication is
                                      that for someone who is liberated thoughts still arise, but there
                                      is no clinging to them when they do. Why the term "thoughtlessness"
                                      can be used to characterize such a state of mind will become clear
                                      in a moment. But the question that arises first is in what way one
                                      can ever be attached to thoughts if, as the ÅšiksÄ�samuccaya says, a
                                      thought has no staying power, that like lightning it breaks up in a
                                      moment and disappears. Hui Neng answers this later in the Platform
                                      Sutra when he says more about "how to think":</span></p>

                                      ourselves under restraint. On the other hand, if we never let our
                                      mind attach to anything, we shall gain liberation.<br> (my emphasis <a rel="nofollow" name="%5B21%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#21">[21]</a>)</span></p>

                                      According to the autobiographical first part of the Platform Sutra,
                                      Hui Neng became deeply enlightened and realized that all things in
                                      the universe are his self-nature, upon hearing a line from the
                                      Diamond Sutra: "Let your thought arise without fixing it anywhere".

                                      does, not exist. Such an "unsupported thought", then, is prajña,

                                      might well have been used by Hui Neng and Ma-tsu to describe the
                                      way in which thoughts are apparently linked up in a series. The
                                      difference is that Mahayana Buddhism encourages the arising of "an
                                      unsupported thought", whereas Ramana Maharshi understands
                                      unchangeable Reality as that which is realized only when it is out
                                      of contact with all objects and thoughts. This is consistent with
                                      the general relation between Mahayana and Advaita: Nirguá¹‡a Brahman
                                      is so emptied of any attribute ("neti, neti,...") that it becomes
                                      impossible to differentiate from ÅšÅ«nyatÄ�. "It is difficult indeed
                                      to distinguish between pure being and pure non-being as a
                                      category". (S. Dasgupta). <a rel="nofollow" name="%5B27%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#27">[27]</a> But there is still a difference in

                                      realizing the emptiness of all phenomena, whereas Advaita
                                      distinguishes between empty Reality and phenomena, with the effect
                                      of devaluing the latter into mere mÄ�yÄ�.</span></p>

                                      The image of a worm hesitant to leave its hold was used in a
                                      personal conversation I had in 1981 with a Theravada monk from
                                      Thailand, a meditation master named Phra Khemananda. This was
                                      before I discovered the passage from Ramana Maharshi; what
                                      Khemananda said was not prompted by any remark of mine, but was
                                      taught to him by his own teacher in Thailand. He began by drawing
                                      the following diagram:</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Each oval
                                      represents a thought, he said; normally, we leave one thought only
                                      when we have another one to go to (as the arrows indicate), but to
                                      think in this way constitutes ignorance. Instead, we should realize
                                      that thinking is actually like this:</span></p>

                                      understand the true nature of thoughts: that thoughts do not arise
                                      from each other but by themselves.</span></p>

                                      This understanding of thoughts-not-linking-up-in-a-series but
                                      springing up nondually is consistent with D. T. Suzuki's conception

                                      reflection or analysis or interpretation. Prajna for this reason is
                                      frequently likened to a flash of lightning or to a spark from

                                      immediate replies. That the reply is immediate is not itself
                                      sufficient; what is important is that each response be experienced
                                      as a nondual "presentation of the whole". Hesitation reveals lack
