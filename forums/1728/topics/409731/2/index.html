              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Your question:</p>
              <p><em>What does an arhat think abt? Why do some Pusa think too?</em></p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>He told me buddha does not think.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My answer:</p>
              <p>Actually, a Buddha thinks like anyone else. Someone who does not think cannot be able to function in the world.</p>
              <p>There is no problem with thinking per se, the only problem is when you are *attached* to your thinking.</p>
              <p>Once, a monk presented the following verse to the Sixth Patriarch, composed by the Chan Master Wo Lun.</p>
              <p>Hearing this verse, Master Hui Neng said, "This verse indicates that the person who composed it has not yet completely realized the essence of mind." The Sixth Patriarch then showed the monk the following verse.</p>
              <p>From this verse, you can understand that Hui-Neng discourages any form of unnatural thought suppression. Supposed you stop all thoughts from arising, you are no different from a living dead person, incapable of functioning as a human being.</p>
              <p>Even though you may be able to temporarily suppress thoughts and defilements in a state of meditative absorption, nevertheless when you return to daily lives the thoughts will still continue to arise.</p>
              <p>Therefore thought suppression is not the means to gain liberation.</p>
              <p>What is the means to gain liberation? It is to be able to have thoughts but not grasp on them. Thoughts are also the manifestation of Buddha-nature in the same way that all the waves in the sea are water. Since all thoughts are the manifestation of Buddha-Nature, simply recognising thoughts as they are is enough for thoughts to self-liberate. Buddha-Nature is not something apart and separate from thoughts, for it is the nature and essence of all arising phenomena.</p>
              <p>All thoughts are the vivid self-luminosity of Buddha-Nature, and they are empty of any inherent existence or solidity.</p>
              <div>
              <p>Excerpt from by Zen teacher David Loy:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm">http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Nietzsche relates the denial of a thinker to a denial of the process of thinking. Why; after all, do we believe that there is an act of thinking? Because that act is what the thinker does: stringing thoughts together by creating new thoughts on the basis of the old thoughts. If there is no such thinker, then there need be no such act. That leaves only thoughts, but one at a time, although the succession may be rapid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The significance of Nietzsche's remarks for us is that we find the same claim in the Asian nondual philosophies, particularly in Ch'an Buddhism. In The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, Hui Neng explains what prajña is:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The term "thoughtlessness" would seem to recommend a mind free from any thoughts, but Hui Neng denies this: rather, "thoughtlessness" is the function of a mind free from any attachment. The implication is that for someone who is liberated thoughts still arise, but there is no clinging to them when they do. Why the term "thoughtlessness" can be used to characterize such a state of mind will become clear in a moment. But the question that arises first is in what way one can ever be attached to thoughts if, as the ÅšiksÄ�samuccaya says, a thought has no staying power, that like lightning it breaks up in a moment and disappears. Hui Neng answers this later in the Platform Sutra when he says more about "how to think":</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">One clings to a thought by allowing the thoughts to link up in a series, which means having one's next thought "caused", as it were, by the previous thoughts, rather than letting each thought arise spontaneously and nondually.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    According to the autobiographical first part of the Platform Sutra, Hui Neng became deeply enlightened and realized that all things in the universe are his self-nature, upon hearing a line from the Diamond Sutra: "Let your thought arise without fixing it anywhere". <a rel="nofollow" name="%5B22%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#22">[22]</a> The passage just prior to this one-which Hui Neng must also have heard-puts this in context. Edward Conze translates it as follows:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">A thought is "Unsupported" because it does not arise in dependence upon anything else, not "caused" by another thought ("mind-objects") and of course not "produced" by a thinker, which the Bodhisattva realizes does, not exist. Such an "unsupported thought", then, is prajña, arising by itself nondually.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The image of the ego as a worm which leaves one hold only after catching another might well have been used by Hui Neng and Ma-tsu to describe the way in which thoughts are apparently linked up in a series. The difference is that Mahayana Buddhism encourages the arising of "an unsupported thought", whereas Ramana Maharshi understands unchangeable Reality as that which is realized only when it is out of contact with all objects and thoughts. This is consistent with the general relation between Mahayana and Advaita: Nirguá¹‡a Brahman is so emptied of any attribute ("neti, neti,...") that it becomes impossible to differentiate from ÅšÅ«nyatÄ�. "It is difficult indeed to distinguish between pure being and pure non-being as a category". (S. Dasgupta). <a rel="nofollow" name="%5B27%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#27">[27]</a> But there is still a difference in emphasis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">MahÄ�yÄ�na emphasizes realizing the emptiness of all phenomena, whereas Advaita distinguishes between empty Reality and phenomena, with the effect of devaluing the latter into mere mÄ�yÄ�.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    The image of a worm hesitant to leave its hold was used in a personal conversation I had in 1981 with a Theravada monk from Thailand, a meditation master named Phra Khemananda. This was before I discovered the passage from Ramana Maharshi; what Khemananda said was not prompted by any remark of mine, but was taught to him by his own teacher in Thailand. He began by drawing the following diagram:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;"><img src="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559-1.jpg" alt="jc26559-1.jpg (5220 bytes)" width="170" height="58"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Each oval represents a thought, he said; normally, we leave one thought only when we have another one to go to (as the arrows indicate), but to think in this way constitutes ignorance. Instead, we should realize that thinking is actually like this:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;"><img src="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559-2.jpg" alt="jc26559-2.jpg (5595 bytes)" width="285" height="78"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Then we will understand the true nature of thoughts: that thoughts do not arise from each other but by themselves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    This understanding of thoughts-not-linking-up-in-a-series but springing up nondually is consistent with D. T. Suzuki's conception of prajña:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">This gives insight into the many Ch'an dialogues in which students are criticized for their hesitation or praised for their apparently nonsensical but immediate replies. That the reply is immediate is not itself sufficient; what is important is that each response be experienced as a nondual "presentation of the whole". Hesitation reveals lack of prajña because it indicates either some logical train of thought or the self-conscious paralysis of all thought. That many approved replies are non-sequitur reveals one aspect of the enlightened mind, that its thoughts are free from reasoning and any methodology.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    Even more important, this also explains how meditation functions, since the "letting-go" of thoughts breaks up the otherwise habitual linking together in a series. Huang Po: "... Why do they [Ch'an students] not copy me by letting each thought go as though it were nothing, or as though it were a piece of rotten wood, a stone, or the cold ashes of a dead fire"? <a rel="nofollow" name="%5B29%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#29">[29]</a></span></p>

              <p>Dharma has two meanings: it can mean Buddha Dharma as in the teachings of Buddha.</p>
              <p>Or, it could mean phenomena, objects, any kind of phenomena. Wo Zhi and Fa Zhi are referring to what I explained above - attachment to self, attachment to objects.</p>

              <p>Heart Sutra is about emptiness of dharmas.</p>

              <p>Meditation takes a different role when you become highly enlightened. At that point, you no longer meditate with a goal or trying to achieve something... Meditation becomes like exercising, it's healthy, it helps your body and mind to relax and attain calmness. But nevertheless your meditative awareness actually permeates your entire waking and sleeping experience such that you no longer require sitting meditation to sustain any particular state... this is pretty advanced level. At that level you have already realised non-duality deeply.</p>
              <p>Buddha still meditate, but he no longer needs to. For us, before we reach such level of enlightenment, we still need to investigate and contemplate and meditate to reach certain insights/realisation...</p>
