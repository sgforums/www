              <p>The Five Paths and the Ten Grounds<br>There are five paths of/to Enlightenment:</p>
              <p>1.The path of Accumulation (Tib.) Tsog-Lam, (Skt. )Sambhara Marga<br>The path revealing the realization of the true phenomena.<br>2.The path of Preparation (Tib.) Jor-Lam, (Skt.) Prayoga Marga<br>The path revealing the realization of the true meaning of phenomena.<br>3.The path of Seeing (Tib.) Thong-Lam (Skt.) Darshana Marga<br>The path revealing the realization of the truth directly.<br>4.The path of Meditation (Tib.) Gom_Lam (Skt.) Bhavana Marga<br>The path revealing the realization of the aftermath.<br>5.The path of no more Learning (Tib.) Mi-Lob- Lam (Skt.) Vimukti Marga<br>The path revealing the realization of the liberation state.</p>
              <p>When a practitioner gathers the requisite accumulation of merit and awareness (puá¹‡ya-jñÄ�nasaá¹ƒbhÄ�ra) reached the path of accumulation. During the path of preparation one develops skill in meditation and reached deeper understanding of the nature of truth. The path of seeing is an attainment of a direct insight into the true nature of phenomena or emptiness (SÅ«nyatÄ�).</p>
              <p><br>The path of Meditation broadens one's experience of the truth and makes it a living<br>experience. The path of Ê»no-more-learningÊ¼ is reached when all defilement (kleÅ›a-varana) and imprints of defilement (JñeyÄ�-varaá¹‡a) are overcome. It is at this point one either achieve Enlightenment or Nirvana.</p>
              <p><br>According to the Bodhisattva path, When a practitioner developed their Bodhicitta naturally and spontaneously they obtained the first Path. Many spiritual powers such as clairvoyance that enables the Bodhisattva to read other people's mind, to fly, to have multiple bodies, and so forth. Three Wisdom that arises from listening, contemplation and meditation on understanding the emptiness nature of all phenomenas developed with others skills.</p>
              <p><br>During the path of preparation the Bodhisattva meditate further on true meaning of emptiness. The meaning becomes clearer and achieve the unity of Shamatha and Vipasana focused conceptually on the sixteen aspects of the four noble truths.<br>This path of preparation has four stages:<br>1. Heat (drod), with which they feel the warmness of the burning wisdom fire that directly perceiving emptiness nature. Here they spontaneously understand the truth while awake.<br>2. Peak (rtse-mo), with which they reached the top mountain of true existence and sees the emptiness nature with panoramic view. Here they spontaneously understand the truth even when dreaming,<br>3. Patience (bzod-pa), with which they have reached the calm state and they are free from fears of falling into the three lower realms.<br>4. Supreme Dharma (chos-mchog), with which they are in the state of dissolving their separation from the ultimate great truth. Then the realization arises within the Bodhisattva that the observer mind itself, object true nature of emptiness and action that meditates emptiness are non-dual, one like water poured<br>into water. This signifies the attainment of the path of seeing and they become Arya-Bodhisattva, a noble being. The Arya-Bodhisattva burn down all their Karma during this path. They still retains the imprints of old karma as well as some seeds of defilement, but no new karma is produced from this path.</p>
              <p><br>There are ten ground Bhumis of Arya-Bodhisattva:<br>1.<br>The joyous (Tib.Rab-Tu-Gawa, Skt. Pramudita)<br>2.<br>The stainless (Tib. Dri-ma-pa Skt. Vimala)<br>3.<br>The light-maker (Tib.Woe-jey-pa Skt.Prabhakari)<br>4.<br>The radiant (Tib. Woe-tro-wa, Skt. Arcishmati)<br>5.<br>The hard to purify (Tib. Junk-ka-wa Skt. Sudurjaya)<br>6.<br>The toward revealing (Tib. Ngon-du-gyur-pa Skt. Abhimukhi)<br>7.<br>The gone faraway (Tib. Ring-du-song-wa Skt. Durangama)<br>8.<br>The unshakable (Tib.Mi-yo-wa Skt. Acala)<br>9.<br>The Excellent Wisdom(Tib. Leg-pey-lo-dro, Skt. Sadhumati)<br>10.<br>The cloud of dharma (Tib. Cho-kyi-trin, Skt. Dharmamegha)</p>

Buddhahood is not a goal which is attained through the acquisition of a special conceptual understanding. Rather it is the end product of a fundamental internal transformation of all mental activity. In the language of Consciousness-Only, that process is referred to as the transformation of "consciousness" that has attachment to distinctions as its basic nature, into "wisdom" that is by its very nature totally free from attachment. "Wisdom", therefore, indicates a radically, qualitatively and totally different type of mental functioning. The purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to delineate briefly the stages of transformation, and 2) after transformation is complete and Buddhahood has been realized, to indicate how the immanent aspect of Buddhahood utilizes wisdom tofunction in the world. Below we shall try to give a sketch of the prescriptions given by the School to rid oneself of the basic obstacles on the pathway to Buddhahood and to indicate briefly the manner in which one functions in the world after those obstacles have been removed. </span></p>

              <p class="Default" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 10pt; '>The Consciousness-Only School describes the mind as a system of seven active consciousnesses (<em>vijnana</em>) which all develop out of the eighth, or storehouse, consciousness. The latter is passive and contains the potentials, or "seeds" (<em>bija</em>) for the development and activity of the first seven consciousnesses. The seventh consciousness contains the sense of self or of ego individuality with which it defiles the first six consciousnesses. The sixth consciousness is a perceptual and cognitive processing center, while the first five consciousnesses are the perceptual awarenesses of eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body. </span></p>

The eight are still basically "one." To use a simple analogy, let us think of a room with seven light-bulbs. You flick the light switch and seven distinct lights shine. Turn the switch off and the lights disappear. Yet there is just one electric current, and its source is comparable to the storehouse consciousness, or, as it is understood in the transformation of consciousness, to the enlightened mind. </span></p>

The system can be used to describe in a manner which is accurate and practical both mental functioning and the specific techniques employed on the Path to the enlightenment of Buddhahood. It provides a way to account for mental processes without recourse to the notions of a real, permanent self (atman) or of real, permanent external (and internal) objects (dharma). All actual and potential realms of experience are shown to be contained within the transformations of consciousness and appear as manifestations of the distinction-making mind. </span></p>

This distinction occurs on various levels and is reflected in each of the eight consciousnesses. The grasper corresponds to attachment to self and the grasped to attachment to dharmas. The former is often referred to as the obstacle of the afflictions and the latter as the obstacle of the knowable. These obstacles or attachments are of two types: 1) innate, and 2) distinguished or learned. The innate attachments are quite subtle and have existed from beginningless time as part of the human (or more generally, the sentient) condition. The distinguished attachments, on the other hand, are coarser and arise from the distinction-making of our cognitive and perceptual processes. These attachments, the innate and distinguished attachments to self and the innate and distinguished attachments to dharmas, are the only obstacles to the realization of Buddhahood. </span></p>

By taking the eighth consciousness, more specifically its "perceived portion," as its object, the seventh consciousness generates a continuous image of the eighth or storehouse consciousness as a real permanent self. Secondly, by taking the manifestation of the five aggregates (form, feeling, cognition, formation, and consciousness) as object, the sixth consciousness generates various non-continuous concepts of self. The distinguished attachment to self belongs solely to the realm of the sixth consciousness and is much coarser in nature than the innate attachment of the seventh consciousness. The sixth consciousness either takes various aspects of the aggregates as object and conceives them to be the real self or independently generates self-concepts and takes them to be the real self. Such wrong conceptualization is often the result of misinformed religious or philosophical teaching. </span></p>

As the seventh consciousness takes the eighth consciousness as its object, it can also use it, more specifically its "perceived portion," to generate a continuous mental image of the eighth consciousness as dharmas. Likewise, the sixth consciousness can take aspects of the aggregates and the perceptual faculties and their objects to be real dharmas; however, in contrast to the seventh consciousness, the functioning of the sixth consciousness in this manner is discontinuous. </span></p>

During this period the Bodhisattva is merely able to subdue the rise in consciousness of the coarse, learned aspects of the grasper and the grasped, that is, of attachment to self and dharmas. In other words, he learns to see through and replace with dharmic analysis the learned conceptual analysis of perceiving and thinking about the world in terms of a real self and real objects. He does this by learning to prevent such concepts from arising and then snowballing in- to verbal and physical activities (the creation of karma) . Thus he is able to utilize effectively the Consciousness-Only School's doctrinal framework in his everyday thinking and functioning in the world. </span></p>

The single exception is the very subtle seeds of what is known as the spontaneous aspect of the obstacle afflictions. The Bodhisattva must preserve those seeds all the way up to the moment of realizing Buddhahood because they are the primary cause of the Bodhisattva's continued rebirth and, therefore, necessary for continued progress on the Path of the Bodhisattva. </span></p>

Previous to this, the wisdom used as a guiding force in the meditational process was an impure, preliminary"applied" wisdom (<em>prayogajnana</em>) characterized by outflow. The first of the two components of the non-outflowing wisdom is called fundamental wisdom (<em>mulajnana</em>). It is characterized as non-distinction-making (nirvikalpa). In the process of its initial appearance, it naturally destroys the seeds of the distinguished attachment to self and dharmas.

Wisdom and distinction-making consciousness are like ice and water. As the water freezes, the ice appears; as the ice melts, the water appears. On the level of the phenomenal activity of the mind, the greater the attachment to distinctions, the weaker the functioning of wisdom; the stronger the functioning of wisdom, the less attachment to distinctions. For attachment to distinctions to be permanently eliminated, wisdom must operate with sufficient basis and power to supercede not only the manifestation of the distinctions but also their seeds, which are their basic cause. Another image often used to describe the process is that of light superceding darkness. If the light can not only fill the darkness but also fully and permanently penetrate the barriers to the light, then the darkness is permanently eliminated. </span></p>

That is, it tends to seek out the characteristics of mental objects, and by nature depends upon them for support. By treating True Suchness as a perceived characteristic of the mind, this provisional wisdom utilizes its own characterization of True Suchness as a support for meditation on the emptiness of the grasper and the grasped. In this way, the coarse aspects of the distinguished obstacles are eliminated and the other aspects of the distinguished and innate obstacles are subdued, that is, they are partially or fully prevented from rising into active awareness. </span></p>

Resolution, remorse, and shame are all technical "dharmas," which are included in the One Hundred Dharmas of the Consciousness-Only School. Resolution is explained as that mental state which examines dharmas and comes to a decision about their natures. Employing resolution helps the Bodhisattva to see the conditioned, empty nature of all dharmas so that he will not become attached to them. Remorse and shame are the inner and outer recognition of one's own improper behavior and of a desire to change it. </span></p>

The turning point is the entrance onto the Path of Vision. At that point wisdom no longer functions totally in dependence upon distinction- making consciousness. For the first time its non-outflow potential actually becomes operative as the basis for further progress on the Path. As we have already noted, the entrance onto the Path of Vision marks the initial experience of the nature of True Suchness. It is then fully realized as the Ten Grounds are passed through. With each step in the progressive elimination of the obstacles to Buddhahood, there is a corresponding step in the development of wisdom. </span></p>

By the moment of entry, the eighth consciousness has become so pure that it can no longer serve as support for the seeds of outflowing dharmas, no matter how fine. Although from the Eighth Ground, the eighth consciousness continues to act as the supporting basis for the extremely subtle spontaneous affliction that the Bodhisattva purposely preserves as the vehicle of his continued rebirth in the world, in every other sense the eighth consciousness is undefiled and no longer the cause of rebirth. From the latter point of view, the Eighth Ground marks the beginning of the laying of the groundwork for the Great Mirror Wisdom. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Consciousness-Only School teaches that our true nature and the true nature of the world is Consciousness-Only, which is ultimately under- stood to be True Suchness. True Suchness is covered over by the distinction-making consciousnesses' attachments to grasper and grasped, self and dharmas. These attachments are systematically overcome on the Bodhisattva Path by the use of wisdom. One component of wisdom, fundamental wisdom, knows True Suchness as the real, underlying nature of distinction- making consciousness. As such, it eliminates confusion about principle (deviant views, their accompanying afflictions, and the seeds of both), radically undermining it. The other component, subsequently attained wisdom, works on the level of the distinctions themselves to eliminate attachment to them. Based on fundamental wisdom, it acts to eliminate confusion about phenomena, particularly the dharmas of greed and other primary afflictions. Upon the total realization of True Suchness at Buddhahood, the subsequently attained component, previously used as a tool for progress on the Bodhisattva Path, is the modality through which the Buddha operates in the world of distinctions made by sentient beings and through which he teaches them the Buddhadharma, a Path for the transformation of distinction-making consciousness into True Suchness and its Four Types of Wisdom.</span></span><span></span></p>

              <p>If you wish to go Pure Land and you are still not enlightened, then you need ä»–åŠ›.</p>
              <p>Many Buddhists (e.g. Theravada, Zen, etc) rely only è‡ªåŠ›.... eightfold path is è‡ªåŠ›. Pure landers rely on ä»–åŠ›.</p>

              <p><br> ya, that say the very First thought is Pure/True/Real. there's
                      no mistake about it. but when the subsequent thoughts start to
                      wander off with dualism and attachment, that's not real already.
                      they become false thoughts.</p>
              <p>althought false and real are two opposite sides, but they are
                      one. without the real mind there's no false mind. just like a body
                      and a shadow. the body is real and the shadow is false. but they
                      follow each other.</p>

              <p>Yeah. The first thought vs subsequent thoughts is like the David Loy image of one thought chaining up to another vs each thought, spontaneous and unsupported, and in this way every thought becomes a 'first thought'. One is dualistic thinking, the other is 'wu zhu sheng xin'.</p>
