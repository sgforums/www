              <p>Hi fellow buddhists,</p>
              <p>I think everybody understands one of the precepts is not to
                  steal. Stealing, as everyone know, is to take away other's
                  possessions without approval...</p>
              <p>I think that including plucking a flower from a nature park,
                  even if no ones owns the park.</p>
              <p>Does downloading music considered stealing? Same goes to
                  watching movies online etc ...</p>
              <p>Since technology has greatly improved, should the definition of
                  the precepts change according to times.....?</p>
              <p>Thanks for your view... I have not taken precepts yet.... When I
                  thought of Buddha's theories of the 5 senses, ear(hearing) which
                  craves for pleasant sound, desires grow in the mind... how
                  true..</p>

              <p>Whether you have taken precepts or not is not the point. As a human being (Buddhist or not), we have to adhere to these five precepts as taught by the Buddha. Any lower than this will make us no different from a beast.</p>

              <p>I think we should not cite "karma" too readily. It makes
              Buddhism scary. Who is to judge that you have too much bad karma,
              but your current state of mind and happiness?</p>

              <p>You don't know, there are people who kill and murder, and they can still sleep well. They even get good at it.</p>
              <p>Does that mean they have no bad karma? No, it just means the karma is waiting to show itself next life.</p>

              <p>There are people who destroyed the world trade center for 'noble' reasons, doing the work of God, and getting their virgins after life in heaven.</p>
              <p>What does Buddha say of such people?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Apparently, headman, I haven't been able to get past you by saying, 
                                      'Enough, headman, put that aside. Don't ask me that.' So I will simply 
                                      answer you. <strong>When a warrior strives &amp; exerts himself in battle, his 
                                      mind is already seized, debased, &amp; misdirected by the thought: 'May 
                                      these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed. 
                                      May they not exist.' If others then strike him down &amp; slay him while
                                       he is thus striving &amp; exerting himself in battle, then with the 
                                      breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the hell called the 
                                      realm of those slain in battle. But if he holds such a view as this: 
                                      'When a warrior strives &amp; exerts himself in battle, if others then 
                                      strike him down &amp; slay him while he is striving &amp; exerting 
                                      himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is
                                       reborn in the company of devas slain in battle,' that is his wrong 
                                      view. Now, there are two destinations for a person with wrong view, I 
                                      tell you: either hell or the animal womb."</strong> </em></p>

              <p>My point is:</p>
              <p>You may think that your cause or motivation is great.</p>
              <p>But killing, stealing, is still killing and stealing. You will still get bad karma.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When formulating lay precepts based on his 
                      distinction between
                                              skillful and unskillful, the Buddha never made 
                      any allowances for
                                              ifs, ands, or buts. When you promise yourself to
                       abstain from
                                              killing or stealing, the power of the promise 
                      lies in its
                                              universality. You won't break your promise to 
                      yourself under any
                                              conditions at all. This is because this sort of 
                      unconditional
                                              promise is a powerful gift. Take, for instance, 
                      the first precept,
                                              against killing:</p>
              <div>
              <p>"There is the case where a disciple of the 
                      noble ones,
                                              abandoning the taking of life, abstains from 
                      taking life. In doing
                                              so, he gives freedom from danger, freedom from 
                      animosity, freedom
                                              from oppression to limitless numbers of beings. 
                      In giving freedom
                                              from danger, freedom from animosity, freedom 
                      from oppression to
                                              limitless numbers of beings, he gains a share in
                       limitless freedom
                                              from danger, freedom from animosity, and freedom
                       from oppression.
                                              This is the first gift, the first great gift — 
                      original,
                                              long-standing, traditional, ancient, 
                      unadulterated, unadulterated
                                              from the beginning — that is not open to 
                      suspicion, will never be
                                              open to suspicion, and is unfaulted by 
                      knowledgeable contemplatives
                                              &amp; brahmans."</p>

              </div>
              <p> If you make exceptions in your promise to 
                      yourself —
                                              trying to justify killing in cases where you 
                      feel endangered or
                                              inconvenienced by another being's existence — 
                      your gift of freedom
                                              is limited, and you lose your share in limitless
                       freedom. Thus the
                                              gift of freedom, to be fully effective, has to 
                      be unconditional,
                                              with no room for exceptions, no matter how noble
                       they may sound, of
                                              any kind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The dynamic of this kind of gift, of course, 
                  depends on an
                                          important principle, the teaching of karma and 
                  rebirth: If you act
                                          on unskillful motivations, the act will result 
                  in your suffering,
                                          now or in lives to come; if you act on skillful 
                  intentions, the act
                                          will result in your pleasure now or in lives to 
                  come. If you don't
                                          kill anyone, you are not creating the 
                  circumstances where anyone or
                                          anything will cut short your life span. Your 
                  past karma may still
                                          leave an opening for your murder or accidental 
                  death — you can't go
                                          back and undo what you've already done — but 
                  once you make and
                                          follow through with the promise not to kill 
                  again, you are creating
                                          no new openings for having your life cut short. 
                  As the Dhammapada
                                          says,</p>
              <div>

              <p>This is why the Buddha listed virtue as one 
                  of a person's
                                          greatest treasures. Kings and thieves can steal 
                  your material
                                          belongings and even take your life, but they 
                  can't take your
                                          virtue. If it's uncompromising, your virtue 
                  protects you from any
                                          true danger from now until you reach nirvana.</p>
              <p>Even if you're not ready to accept the 
                  teaching on karma and
                                          rebirth, the Buddha still recommended an 
                  absolute standard of
                                          virtue. As he told the Kalamas, if you decide to
                   act skillfully at
                                          all times, harming no one, then even if it 
                  turned out that there
                                          was no life after death, you'd still come out 
                  ahead, for you would
                                          have been able to live and die with a clear 
                  conscience — something
                                          that no amount of money or political influence 
                  can buy.</p>
              <p>So the Buddha's position on the precepts was 
                  uncompromising and
                                          clear. If you want to follow his teachings, 
                  there's absolutely no
                                          room for killing, stealing, or lying, period. 
                  However, in our
                                          current climate of terrorism and 
                  counter-terrorism — where
                                          governments have claimed that it's their moral 
                  duty to lie, kill,
                                          and torture in order to prevent others from 
                  lying, killing, and
                                          torturing — a number of Buddhist teachers have 
                  joined in the
                                          effort, trying to find evidence that there were 
                  some occasions, at
                                          least, where the Buddha would condone killing or
                   offer a rationale
                                          for a just war. Exactly why they would want to 
                  do this is up to
                                          them to say, but there's a need to examine their
                   arguments in order
                                          to set the record straight. The Buddha never 
                  taught a theory of
                                          just war; no decision to wage war can 
                  legitimately be traced to his
                                          teachings; no war veteran has ever had to 
                  agonize over memories of
                                          the people he killed because the Buddha said 
                  that war was okay.
                                          These facts are among the glories of the 
                  Buddhist tradition, and
                                          it's important for the human race that they not 
                  be muddied in an
                                          effort to recast the Buddha in our own less than
                   glorious
                                          image.</p>
              <p>Because the Pali Canon is such an unpromising
                   place to look for
                                          the justification of killing, most of the 
                  arguments for a Buddhist
                                          theory of just war look elsewhere for their 
                  evidence, citing the
                                          words and behavior of people they take as 
                  surrogates for the
                                          Buddha. These arguments are obviously on shaky 
                  ground, and can be
                                          easily dismissed even by people who know nothing
                   of the Canon. For
                                          example, it has been argued that because Asian 
                  governments claiming
                                          to be Buddhist have engaged in war and torture, 
                  the Buddha's
                                          teachings must condone such behavior. However, 
                  we've had enough
                                          exposure to people claiming to be Christian 
                  whose behavior is very
                                          un-Christian to realize that the same thing can 
                  probably happen in
                                          the Buddhist world as well. To take killers and 
                  torturers as your
                                          guide to the Buddha's teaching is hardly a sign 
                  of good
                                          judgment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a somewhat higher note, one writer has 
              noted that his
                                      meditation teacher has told soldiers and 
              policemen that if their
                                      duty is to kill, they must perform their duty, 
              albeit
                                      compassionately and with mindfulness. The writer
               then goes on to
                                      argue that because his teacher is the direct 
              recipient of an oral
                                      tradition dating back to the Buddha, we must 
              take this as evidence
                                      that the Buddha would give similar advice as 
              well. This statement,
                                      of course, tells us more about the writer's 
              faith in his teacher
                                      than about the Buddha; and when we reflect that 
              the Buddha expelled
                                      from the Sangha a monk who gave advice of this 
              sort to an
                                      executioner, it casts serious doubts on his 
              argument.</p>

              I just don't understand what you guys mean by 'tracing the source'. You do NOT need to trace the source. Just like you go to supermarket and buy your stuff, do you need to trace the source? No! You just buy them. Similarly in the internet, there are legal sites to make purchases. These sites will pay the record labels, the artistes, or whatever producers that made the products.

              <p>Many people kill as a job. Think: assassins, merceneries, executioners, what not. Maybe not just killing humans - just look at farms and slaughterhouses. They don't kill out of hatred or anger, they kill for the money, and they may think it is ok for a job and is just a means to make money. What they aren't aware of is Karma.</p>

              <p>It is impossible to abandon desires totally until you reach Anagami stage of enlightenment according to Buddha's ten fetter and four path model. Letting go is always part of the path from the beginning, but the seed of desire will not be uprooted until the arising of insight/realisation. Therefore, it is important to practice insight meditation, and ultimately these ten fetters only get uprooted via enlightenment/realisation, not by samadhi, jhanas (which only temporarily suppress them), etc. Of course as I said earlier: before liberation, we still create karma, so might as well make <em>good</em> karma. This means using antidotes - like cultivating metta as an antidote to hatred, cultivating the four immeasurables etc which the Buddha said can lead to the Brahma realms: but these are antidotes that turn bad into good karma, it does not lead to the <em>liberation</em> from the three poisons or the cycle of samsara (but it leads to a rebirth in heaven). Having these qualities will temporarily transform and weaken the fetters in the gross manifestations and hence important, but it does not mean that you will never become 'evil' again perhaps many lifetimes later, because the seed of ignorance is still present. In fact the ten fetters are still completely present, just that its gross manifestations become temporarily weakened/transformed. If you wish to remove the fetters you need to practice insight meditation and attain enlightenment. When you become enlightened all poisons self-liberate without using any antidotes and this is not a reversible state. They self-liberate via insight:</p>

              <p>Next. Buddha did not have to cultivate any more - his virtues are perfect, his wisdom and insight is perfect, his powers are perfect, everything is perfected, he is completely liberated. He meditates to set a good example to his students, and probably for a healthy body and mind. If everything is perfected, what else do you want to cultivate? Rather there is simply the insight that Spontaneous Perfection is already present from the beginning and fully manifested in this moment and there is no other 'further goals'. However it is true that Buddha is 'happily ever after', because once you are fully liberated, (mental) suffering can no longer <em>ever</em> arise. Even if his physical body gets sick, etc.</p>
              <p>Maybe let's not take Buddha as an example. I know of people who no longer need to meditate. When you reach non-meditation state of enlightenment, you no longer need to cultivate - meditation becomes like exercise, healthy to do it, but not for the purpose of achieving greater states of experience (and even if you want to meditate to experience higher states of consciousness or absorption, it is realised that ordinary experience and these jhanic experiences are all of One Taste, the same nature). There is absolutely no separation between meditation and post-meditation, and there is no longer any effort necessary to sustain mindfulness. Eating, walking, talking, is all the manifestation of Buddha-nature, and spontaneous self-liberation.</p>

              <p>Before the awakening of prajna wisdom, there will always be an unknowing

              <p>After the arising of Prajna Wisdom, we realise that All

                                                                                              is simply to experience whatever arises openly and unreservedly.  However this does not denote the end of 
                                                                                              practice; practice simply moves to become dynamic and

              <p>It is not that there is no need to do anything or practice is unnecessary.  Rather

                                                                                              mode and for this it requires the complete pervading of non-dual and 
                                                                                              emptiness insights into our entire being like how “dualistic and

              <p><strong>I'm not saying that meditation is not important for us. Of course, until you realise the stage of 'non-meditation', or the stage of Buddhahood, we should still meditate diligently. Non-meditation requires deep insight and is not something most beginners can immediately experience. I'm just saying that let's not put a judgement on something we have not realized yet. Let's not judge Buddha.<br></strong></p>
