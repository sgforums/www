              <p>Downloading music is considered stealing. I am not sure if watching movies online are, but I believe based on law it is.</p>
              <p>My advice is that in this modern age, it is hard to avoid using internet to download stuff (I do it myself) - but try to buy from paid sources, like ITunes, and other paid sites... so you aren't stealing but are paying the artiste and record labels their due.</p>
              <p>Plucking from nature park would depend on whether the trees belong to the government. I think it is considered a form of stealing. Imagine, would you steal from your neighbour? Like, would you pluck your neighbour's flowers, if you are living in landed and your neighbour has a garden? I don't think so... in the same way, the trees and flowers belong to the government for the public... so it is not right that we simply pluck them away.</p>

              <p>I think the basic precept still applies.</p>
              <p>The precept 
              <em>I undertake the training rule to abstain from taking what is not 
              given</em></p>
              <p>...still applies today, because it is not right to take what belongs to others. We will incur karmic debts by doing so.</p>

              <p>Stealing a packet of drink from a convenience store probably isn't going to bring much harm to anyone - yet it is a crime, an unvirtuous act, and a bad karma nonetheless.</p>

              <p>In that case, stealing music and materials for free and other things is also harmful.</p>
              <p>It will also incur karmic debt.</p>
              <p>Crimes are 99% of the time unvirtuous acts. There might be exceptions, but seldom.</p>

              <p>Issues about online downloads are more complicated than right or wrong. See http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity.html</p>
              <p>Whether it considers "stealing," of course, much depends on the reason that you take something and break the law (illegal).</p>
              <p>I think we should not cite "karma" too readily. It makes Buddhism scary. Who is to judge that you have too much bad karma, but your current state of mind and happiness?</p>
              <p>Laws do become outdated through time. When it does, and become irrelevant to what we do, breaking the law becomes a way of life. In many countries, this happen or there is no way to go about your livelihood. Of course, we are fortunate not to see this too much in Singapore. :) Perhaps our good karma.</p>

              <p>I am now attending a talk by a young Venerable. Few days ago, someone asked the same question. The Venerable replied that the definition of stealing today is not just physically stealing, due to the advanced technology, taking advantage (if need to pay but we did not)  is aslo considered stealing.</p>
              <p>However, he said at times we do not know who own it or who to pay to when doing online downloading. If that is the case, we can donate money to the temple or something positive instead. Good idea right? I found this young Venerable very knowledgeable, I have learnt a lot from him. Most importantly, he is at the same frequency as we people today and his replies are always very practical.</p>

              <p>It would be delusional to think that it is difficult to trace sources.</p>
              <p>In fact it is simple!</p>
              <p>And the thing is you don't even need to trace sources.</p>
              <p>The source is the record labels, which pay the artiste.</p>
              <p>If you get your downloads from a legal site that pays the record labels that pays the artiste, then it is not stealing.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you are taking free lunch without paying the originator.</p>

              <p><br>I think i going to AEN side (not because he is a mod) because stealing is stealing. I double checked and I think stealing without looking at motivation is still stealing. The action is there.</p>
              <p>But I think as times changes, should definition change? Stealing here sounds as in physical context. As downloading music might not involve physically, is still a form of stealing. Stealing intellectual property.</p>
              <p>Stealing need not to cause physical harm to someone. But the act might shows that you have the intention (greed?) to take? Greed for excitement? Greed for?</p>
              <p>Hope everyone can take it easy... chill ar... dont argue... the more i read the more i think the smell of tnt here very strong LOL</p>
