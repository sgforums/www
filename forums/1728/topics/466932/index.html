                  Dalai Lama's Advice Concerning Dolgyal (Shugden)</span></h1>
              <div>
              <p>Following long and careful investigations, His Holiness the
                  Dalai Lama strongly discourages Tibetan Buddhists from propitiating
                  the fierce spirit known as Dolgyal (Shugden). Although he once
                  practised Dolgyal propitiation himself, His Holiness renounced the
                  practice in 1975 after discovering the profound historical, social
                  and religious problems associated with it. He did so with the full
                  knowledge and support of his junior tutor, the late Kyabje Trichang
                  Rinpoche through whom His Holiness first became associated with the
                  practice. Even within the Geluk and Sakya schools - the Tibetan
                  Buddhist traditions to which majority of Dolgyal practitioners
                  belong - the propitiation of this spirit has been controversial
                  throughout its history. Historical investigation reveals that
                  Dolgyal practice, which has strong sectarian overtones, has a
                  history of contributing to a climate of sectarian disharmony in
                  various parts of Tibet, and between various Tibetan communities.
                  Therefore, from 1975 onwards, His Holiness has regularly made
                  public his view that this practice is inadvisable, based on the
                  following three reasons:</p>
              <p><strong>1. The danger of Tibetan Buddhism degenerating into a
                  form of spirit worship</strong>: Tibetan Buddhism originally
                  evolved from the authentic and ancient tradition upheld at the
                  great Indian monastic university of Nalanda, a tradition that His
                  Holiness often describes as a complete form of Buddhism. It
                  embodies the original teaching of the Buddha as developed through
                  the rich philosophical, psychological and spiritual insights of
                  such great Buddhist masters as Nagarjuna, Asanga, Vasubandhu,
                  Dignaga and Dharamakirti. Since the great philosopher and logician
                  Shantarakshita was instrumental in establishing Buddhism in Tibet
                  in its earliest stages in the 8th century, philosophical enquiry
                  and critical analysis have always been important hallmarks of
                  Tibetan Buddhism. The problem with Dolgyal practice is that it
                  presents the spirit Dolgyal (Shugden) as a Dharma protector and
                  what's more tends to promote the spirit as more important than the
                  Buddha himself. If this trend goes unchecked, and innocent people
                  become seduced by cult-like practices of this kind, the danger is
                  that the rich tradition of Tibetan Buddhism may degenerate into the
                  mere propitiation of spirits.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Obstacles to the emergence of genuine
                  non-sectarianism:</strong> His Holiness has often stated that
                  one of his most important commitments is the promotion of
                  inter-religious understanding and harmony. As part of this
                  endeavour, His Holiness is committed to encouraging
                  non-sectarianism in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism. In this His
                  Holiness is following the example set by his predecessors,
                  especially the Fifth Dalai Lama and the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. Not
                  only is a non-sectarian approach mutually enriching for all Tibetan
                  Buddhist schools, but it is also the best safeguard against a rise
                  of sectarianism that could have damaging consequences for the
                  Tibetan tradition as a whole. Given the acknowledged link between
                  Dolgyal worship and sectarianism, this particular practice remains
                  a fundamental obstacle to fostering a genuine non-sectarian spirit
                  within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.<strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>3. Especially inappropriate in relation to the
                  well-being of Tibetan society:</strong>Propitiating Dolgyal is
                  particularly troublesome, given the Tibetan people's present
                  difficult circumstances. Textual and historical research
                  demonstrates that the spirit Dolgyal arose out of hostility to the
                  great Fifth Dalai Lama and his government. The Fifth Dalai Lama,
                  who assumed both the spiritual and temporal leadership of Tibet in
                  the 17th century, personally denounced Dolgyal as a malevolent
                  spirit that arose out of misguided intentions and is detrimental to
                  the welfare of beings in general and the Tibetan government headed
                  by the Dalai Lamas in particular. The Thirteenth Dalai Lama and
                  other respected Tibetan spiritual masters have also spoken out
                  strongly against this practice. Therefore, in the current Tibetan
                  context, in which unity among the Tibetan people is vitally
                  important, engaging in this controversial and divisive propitiatory
                  practice is inappropriate.</p>
              <p>His Holiness has strongly urged his followers to consider
                  carefully the problems of Dolgyal practice on the basis of these
                  three reasons and to act accordingly. He has stated that, as a
                  Buddhist leader with a special concern for the Tibetan people, it
                  is his responsibility to speak out against the damaging
                  consequences of this kind of spirit worship. Whether or not his
                  advice is heeded, His Holiness has made clear, is a matter for the
                  individual. However, since he personally feels strongly about how
                  negative this practice is, he has requested those who continue to
                  propitiate Dolgyal not to attend his formal religious teachings,
                  which traditionally require the establishment of a teacher-disciple
                  relationship.</p>

                  Rinpoche (Head Of Gelukpa Sect) Regarding The Worship Of Gods And
                  Protectors</span><br> <br> As stated by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in his recent speeches
                  regarding the worship of gods and protectors, the six major
                  monasteries summoned gatherings at every level - monastic assembly,
                  monastic administrators, monastic sections, individual monks -
                  wherever deemed necessary. Signatures and finger prints of every
                  individual monk supporting the ban on worshipping such dubious
                  deities by any individuals or groups had been submitted. I myself
                  attended these meetings and made essential clarifications on merits
                  and demerits of such worship. Consequently, I had a deep
                  satisfactory feeling that this controversial issue was finally
                  solved, creating a peaceful atmosphere "as stainless as the sky and
                  as pure as the earth." But unfortunately a handful of monks from
                  certain monasteries committing "the downfall of negligence (breach
                  of an ordained monk for neglecting the correction of their faults)"
                  created more imbroglio and crisis in our community by sticking
                  misleading information and distributing pamphlets without any sense
                  of loss over their time, energy and money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br> This polemic is not similar to the communal conflicts between the
                  Hindus and the Muslims. This is an inter-sectarian theological
                  strife caused by misunderstandings, which certainly can be solved
                  through clarifications and correcting the things by reminding their
                  misunderstandings and the faux pas. Thus, everyone must strive in
                  understanding the truth by which we can gradually solve this issue.
                  By just stating the practise of its worship by the earlier great
                  lamas and vying for the right to faith and belief does not
                  validates the stand. As the great Lamas of the past visualised the
                  union of the mind of peaceful and the wrathful deities, it appears
                  to them in a pure form. It is completely different from the worship
                  by an ordinary person like us whose mind is filled with continuous
                  flow of deluded emotions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br> Contemptuously grave is the act of alleging rift between His
                  Holiness and the great masters of the past with reference to this
                  worship. This demeans act of presuming ones lama as an ordinary
                  person and misconceiving over-estimating and under-estimating the
                  realities is a heinous act, committed out of ones
                  delusion-ignorance. Thus, it is advisable to be
                  conscientious.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">If it
                  (shugden) were a real protector, it should protect the people.
                  There may not be any protector such as this, which needs to be
                  protected by the people. Is it proper to disturb the peace and
                  harmony by causing conflicts, unleashing terror and shooting
                  demeans words in order to please the Dharma protector? Does this
                  fulfils the wishes of our great masters? Try to analyse and
                  contemplate on the teachings that had been taught in the Lamrim
                  (stages of path), Lojong (training of mind) and other scriptural
                  texts. Does devoting time in framing detrimental plots and
                  committing degrading act, which seems no different from the act of
                  attacking monasteries wielding swords and spears and draining the
                  holy robes of the Buddha with blood, fulfil the wishes of our great
                  masters?<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">The Mahayana
                  teachings advocates altruistic attitude of sacrificing few for the
                  sake of many. Thus why is it not possible for one, who acclaims
                  oneself to be a Mahayana, to stop worshipping these dubious gods
                  and deities for the sake and benefit of the Tibetans in whole and
                  for the well-being of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. In the Vinaya
                  (Buddhist code of discipline), it is held that since a
                  controversial issue is settled by picking the mandatory twig by
                  "accepting the voice of many by the few" the resolution should be
                  accepted by all. As it has been supported by ninety five percent it
                  would be wise and advisable for the rest five percent to stop
                  worshipping the deity keeping in mind that there exists provisions
                  such as the four Severe Punishments (Nan tur bzhi), the seven
                  Expulsions (Gnas dbyung bdun) and the four Convictions (Grangs
                  gzhug bzhi) in the Vinaya (Code of Discipline).<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">If we abide
                  and adhere to the vows and teachings and is able to protect,
                  preserve and flourish the teachings, we need not feel doubtful and
                  confused when we have countless deities as numerous as the stars in
                  the boundless sky. And it is quite possible that a fake deity may
                  appear to us caused by our ignorance and contaminated actions. As
                  Horton Chenmo's (Hor ston chen mo) Mind Training Like the rays of

                  other universe to protect the teachings and the four categories of
                  Buddha's disciples. And on the other hand, the power and the spells

                  a slain Mongolian abbot of Sera Je monastery, too is said to have
                  had the vision of an image similar to that of Je Tsongkapa, but had
                  to undergo many obstacles. And, in our ritual texts, it had been
                  said that there are many demons and spirits who assumes the form of
                  a deceased and inflict sufferings to their surviving relatives. And
                  many fire sacrificial rites are meant to banish and ward off these
                  outer evil forces. Even amongst the retinue of the great protector,
                  Vaishravana, there hides many terrifying demons. And, as for the
                  fifteen directional protectors, there are `the fifteen evil
                  protectors' that are to be subdued through Phurba rituals and the
                  `fifteen godly protectors.' And as for the sixty two Chakrasamvaras
                  with reference to the subduables and the subdue-rs, it is held that
                  there are sixty two evils that are to be subdued.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">And if the
                  practitioner does not abide by the vows and if he were not free
                  from desire and attachment, the power of the evil deities would
                  increase and would cause more harm than good.If we worship or
                  invoke gods and protectors with a mind focusing on the nine
                  apprehensions of conceit as the centre of our meditation and
                  practise, then it is said that the god and protectors, if good and
                  real would never fulfil your wishes but would be as dangerous as
                  holding a burning thunderbolt in your hand. His Holiness clearly
                  quoted from the life story of Changkya Rolpai Dorjee, the
                  banishment of Dolgyal from the Gaden area by the great
                  throne-holder Ngawang Chokdhen out of his innately pure mind which
                  is free from any misconception.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">And, the life
                  story of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo written by Dho Drupchen
                  relates:<br> While Khyentse Wangpo was imparting Tantric teachings (rgyud brtag
                  pa gnyis pa) at Derge Lhundrup, Shugden approached to listen to the
                  teachings saying, "As your explanations are good and the teaching
                  are elegant, I felt desirous in listening to it." Thus not only
                  humans, but even the ferocious non-human too swarm around the
                  nectar of his teachings.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">When such
                  great Rimey Lamas (non-sectarian lama) forbids the worship, it must
                  be known that it is undoubtedly true that these arises out of our
                  own misconception. What certainty there is in such misconceived
                  appearances? Once when Arhat Upgupta was giving teachings, an evil
                  spirit tried to interrupt him but found him invincible. Upgupta
                  then said, "I had never seen the Buddha. Thus, evil one, assume the
                  form of the Buddha." The demon instantaneously assumed the form of
                  the Buddha. Out of deep reverence, when the great Arhat was about
                  to prostrate, it is said that the demon unable to bear the sight
                  changed himself into his real form. And in Khedrup Rinpoche's text
                  `The Great Explanation of Kalachakra (Dus' khor tik chen)' states
                  that the devil Garab Wangchuk tried to interrupt Galo in his
                  practise by assuming different forms and protecting him and at
                  times approaching him for teachings. But Gaol sought the initiation
                  of Shemar, and therefore, turned invulnerable. Thus, there are
                  numerous other analogies proving fallible nature of these spirits
                  and demons, who assume godly images and fulfil some trivial
                  wishes.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">And at times,
                  worshipping of gods even if it be real, had to be stopped. During
                  the 21 days Monlam festival in Lhasa, performing invocations and
                  trance rituals of deity Karmasha of Lhasa was prohibited. It is
                  held that Chushur Tenpa Tsering, a cruel chieftain, died and was
                  born as an evil spirit in the locality of Samye Pekar. This evil
                  spirit dropped poison in the utensil meant for the monk assembly at
                  the Monlam festival. But the Dharma protector Nechung perforated a
                  hole from beneath the utensil with cloth- spear by which the
                  afternoon tea could not be served. If candidly expressed, Karmasha
                  was held guilty as the accusation and allegement fell on him.
                  During the commencement of the Monlam congregation, the
                  disciplinarian of Drepung monastery sternly declared his warning in
                  the Karmasha invocation hall:<br> "No one shall, during the 21 days Monlam festival, burn even an
                  iota of incense as diminutive as the breath of a guinea pig nor
                  shall one offer Torma as small as the tiny thump. No musical
                  instrument shall be played. How can Chushar Tenpa Tsering, a man
                  who had entered the heart of evil-spirit, be the minister Jatri
                  Chanchik (Karmasha)?"<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Thus, there
                  is no certainty in the appearances caused by our Karmas as the
                  saying goes:<br> A single object conceived with disparate mind Is held to be a
                  non-established existence<br> When one is attached to the doctrines, it is no different for
                  getting attached to wealth and riches. It is stated in
                  Abhidharmakosa (Mngon pa mdzod) as:<br> Pride, arrogance and haughtiness Are out of attachment to ones
                  attributes [Thus,] such mind are fully obscured.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">And, the
                  great Je Tsongkapa had stated:<br> It had been said that if one does not meditate analytically on the
                  tenets with an unbiased analytical mind, by abandoning
                  discrimination out of attachment towards oneself and aversion
                  towards other, one would forever be tightly bound in this cyclic
                  existence. Thus, we must understand that this statement is a unique
                  teaching given to us out of great compassion.<br> Thus, our disputes and arguments are out of attachment and if
                  keenly examined with an unbiased mind, we would come to know that
                  there is not a single good thing that is in conformity with the
                  Dharma.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Whatever may
                  it be, god or evil spirit, there is no restriction in worshipping
                  it. One had not understood the basic definition of the universally
                  acclaimed `Right to faith and belief.' A short definition of it can
                  undo the knots and clarify the misunderstanding of this principle.
                  An individual has complete freedom whether to have faith in a
                  particular religion or not. Again, an individual has complete
                  freedom whether to have belief in a particular religion or not.
                  Thus, according to this principle, no one can be forced into
                  particular religious system. This itself becomes an answer to their
                  allegement.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">We most
                  probably say, " we have solemn faith and belief in our religion."
                  Whatever religion may it be, no difference of accessibility and
                  restrictions had been made. Everyone is guaranteed with the right
                  to faith and belief. One may insists, "I have complete right to
                  faith and belief and no one can restrict me from worshipping any
                  gods and protectors." But, if citizens feigning right to faith and
                  belief, violates the constitutional laws of his country in such
                  manner, it would cause an unruly state "where people violates the
                  law and horse shakes off its saddle." And to them, it might also be
                  appropriate for a Buddhist to practise the religion of the Hindu
                  and the Muslim. If one enters Buddhism but practises in an overtly
                  opposite manner to the Buddhist principles and tenets, then one
                  violates the principal hallmark of Buddhism and feigning right to
                  faith and belief does not help. Hence it is said, "When in Yala
                  Shampo, worship god Yala Shampo" and "When one drinks the water of
                  the land, so must one adhere to the laws of the land". Thus when
                  one seeks refuge in the Buddha, one does not seek refuge in other
                  gods; when one seeks refuge in the teachings of the Buddha, one
                  should not commit ill deeds: and when one seeks refuge in the
                  Buddha's community, one does not befriend a person with wrong and
                  distorted views. Thus, the enforcement of this right to faith and
                  belief encompasses only to a certain limited spheres.<br> If right to faith and belief had not been limited monastic rules
                  might have not been possible. In Tibet, law of the monastery
                  proclaims that postulant monks shall seek admission only in their
                  respective monastic sections. Law again states that the great Lamas
                  and Tulkus through their numerous incarnations shall not change
                  their monastic sections or monasteries, but had to stick to a
                  particular monastic section. Many cases caused by such
                  misunderstandings had been reported. Here too, some monastic
                  sections had been filing such cases. Thus, with a clear
                  understanding of this right to faith and belief, we should strive
                  to settle such cases and must prevent such false cases to
                  rise.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">The act of
                  pronouncing ones strong faith in worldly gods is no different from
                  publicising your faults and downfall in your adherent�e to "the
                  advice or refuge-seeking." Moreover, there is none amongst us who
                  had not received teachings from His Holiness. Likewise every of us
                  had received many Tantric initiation, instructions and
                  transmissions. Thus, disfiguring and demeaning ones Vajra Guru
                  would cause results so inconceivably grave and unbearable. And it
                  is sarcastic on finding a person, who upholding the laws of cause
                  and effect not having even the slightest regrets and doubts over
                  blindly committing a grave blunder and also drowning everyone in
                  it. It would be wise to contemplate and practise in cultivating
                  reverence to ones master as had been taught in Dorjee Chang's
                  Lamrim (stages of path). The root text of Guhyasamaja Root Tantra
                  (Gsang `dus rtsa rgyud) states:<br> If sentient beings commits an action<br> As grave as the heinous crimes<br> He [still] can attain the superior Vajra Vehicle<br> But who from within disregards his master<br> Shall never attain, even if exerted.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">And also in
                  the tantra of Vajrapani Initiation (Lag na rdo rje dbang bskur ba`i
                  rgyud):<br> If we, Tantric practitioners, do not think on the immensely grave
                  demerits of disregarding ones master, who would?<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">This demeans
                  act of ignoring the advice of His Holiness on spiritual and
                  temporal ground intended for the benefit of Tibetans and
                  masterminding certain detrimental activities in finding slightest
                  differences to your view clearly signifies ones lack of patriotism.
                  Does the sour reality of governmental official needing police and
                  security to escort them on their visit to the monasteries, centres
                  of peace and religion, not become a cause for shame and
                  embarrassment to the Tibetans in general and the monastic centres
                  in particulars? Thus, it is timely to stop this strife by being
                  aware of the grave outcome and essence less nature of this root of
                  disagreement. But without sound conscience, if one adamantly tries
                  to oppose it, then like "a hundred birds flying east: and the pak
                  bird flying west" one would turn into our enemy's best friend for
                  having a same adverse standpoint and strategy. And, one would face
                  the same consequences as did the adamant Pelsur Jholak. Thus, it is
                  wise for everyone, ordained and the laymen, to bear some minor loss
                  on this ground.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">If Je
                  Rinpoche had introduced this New Kadampa Tradition in order to
                  distinguish between the worshipper of this Red god and the rest,
                  then it would be appropriate. But, it should be known that Je
                  Rinpoche did not introduce this tradition in order to distinguish
                  the worshippers from the rest. It is quite improper if one does not
                  have any understanding on these extreme consequences. If one
                  continuously swaggers on acquiring some wealth and status like a
                  little son rejoicing on receiving some gifts from his parent, we
                  need not explore the whole world to find an example to wholly prove
                  and validate Je Rinpoche's prophecy:<br> "My teaching will be destroyed by wealth and riches."<br> Kindly ponder over the contents and practise it as this had been

This is an inter-sectarian theological strife caused by misunderstandings, which certainly can be solved through clarifications and correcting the things by reminding their misunderstandings and the faux pas. Thus, everyone must strive in understanding the truth by which we can gradually solve this issue. By just stating the practise of its worship by the earlier great lamas and vying for the right to faith and belief does not validates the stand. As the great Lamas of the past visualised the union of the mind of peaceful and the wrathful deities, it appears to them in a pure form. It is completely different from the worship by an ordinary person like us whose mind is filled with continuous flow of deluded emotions.</span></p>

              <p>As above explained - Misunderstanding ought to be clarified amongst the lama, Tibetan and Dalai Lama for an achieveable consensus and is not that complex.
