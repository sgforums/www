              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong></strong><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Media
                  watchdog David Edwards spurs Buddhists to action.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The one thing I have never fully understood about many Buddhists is why
                  they devote so much attention to the individual roots of greed, hatred, and
                  ignorance, yet so little attention to the manifestations of these poisons in
                  social institutions. Is it simply understood that the real work needs to be
                  done on our individual failings, with social greed, hatred, and ignorance being
                  someone else’s problem? Or is it that Buddhists, like so many people, have been
                  deceived into believing that political issues are “none of their business”?
                  Have they been trained to see problems and solutions solely in personal rather
                  than political terms?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The problem is that while we are struggling on an individual basis
                  toward selflessness and compassion, vast systems of economic and political
                  power are working to undermine the process. The astute political commentator H.
                  L. Mencken once observed, “The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the
                  public alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an
                  endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.” Fear and loathing pacify
                  the population, promoting mindless patriotism and obedience. They help justify
                  repressive policies that curtail democratic freedoms and boost centralized
                  power.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">But here’s the really bad news: because the corporate system is the
                  quintessence of greed—with corporate bosses legally <em>obliged</em> to maximize
                  profits for shareholders —discussions of the significance, power, and potential
                  of compassion, kindness, and generosity are virtually absent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">As retailing analyst Victor Lebow explains, “Our enormously productive
                  economy... demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert
                  the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction,
                  our ego satisfaction, in consumption.” You can’t have people recognizing the
                  piercing pain of desire, the tight agony of pride, the blissful release of
                  generosity and compassion, when you need everyone greedily consuming ever more
                  pleasures, ever more status, ever more things.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">When society subordinates its humanity to maximized revenues at minimum
                  cost, then that society is well on the way to becoming lost, falsified, and in
                  fact inhuman. If we are serious about combating selfishness and promoting
                  compassion in the world, then is it not <em>vital</em> that we develop the tools
                  of intellectual self-defense to deal with these assaults on our minds and
                  hearts? The solution must lie in reversing the priorities, in subordinating
                  dead things—money, capital, profits—to life: people, animals, the planet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">But how to communicate this message to the wider world? Part of the task
                  involves challenging the idea that the corporate media are communicating
                  anything approaching an honest view of the world. We have to expose the deep
                  structural biases of the media. Media activism, in essence, is simply an
                  attempt to relieve suffering. Of course we need to practice compassion in
                  individual thoughts and acts—these are the bread and butter of practice, the
                  real test. But where we see political and economic systems <em>guaranteed</em> to
                  generate tragedy and despair, we must also respond to transform and humanize
                  those systems.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">But if compassion is the solution, then what role the traditional anger,
                  hatred, even violence, of left progressive politics? What of class warfare? Should
                  we not, for example, be angry with journalists for their role in making the
                  attack on Iraq possible? Should we not be angry that they are facilitating
                  oil-funded global warming skepticism that may make a hell of our children’s
                  lives? If we want to bellow our anger as an indulgence, as a macho badge of
                  commitment—fine. If we want to do something that truly helps the victims of
                  greed and violence to dig up the deepest roots of their misery, then we must
                  try to remain focused on compassion, not anger.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">It is no accident that politicians and media commentators focus so much
                  attention on violent incidents, and even angry outbursts, no matter how few
                  they might be in the overall context of peaceful protest. When protestors’
                  rational arguments are associated with anger and violence, the ideas themselves
                  can be characterized as irrational, emotional and even dangerous. The focus on
                  violence provides a perfect excuse for journalists to avoid engaging with
                  arguments with which they in fact cannot deal, and to marginalize the effort to
                  challenge them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 13.1pt; text-align: justify;">The
                  antidotes to systemic greed, I am convinced, are political movements motivated
                  by unconditional compassion for suffering. This compassion needs to be rooted
                  in genuinely profound and authentic sources—the kind provided today by the best
                  Buddhist teachers and organizations. I think it is reasonable to accept a kind
                  of “division of labor,” with Buddhists teachers and practitioners working to
                  unearth and make available compassionate resources. Activists should then seek
                  to make the best possible use of these treasures not only by meditating on and
                  developing their own compassionate awareness, but also by seeking to entrench
                  this compassion in supportive systems of political and economic power. Perhaps
                  we can imagine meditators providing the compassionate raw materials and
                  activists working to build the political and economic structures that make
                  possible the further and increased mining of compassionate treasures—a sort of
                  perpetual compassion machine, if you will.</span></p>
