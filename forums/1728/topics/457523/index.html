              <p>Hi zhurav,</p>
              <p>i agree that our friends are very important in affecting our minds.  Besides looking for friends who could complement your path further, it is also important to avoid people who affect our minds negatively, at least until our mind has gained some strength and stability.  The degeneration of your mind that you described is quite common and is a sign of obscurations.  Sometimes, we collect obscurations from the energies of people, from our food, environment and this is worsened by our inability to maintain mindfulness in our lives.  The best way is to constantly have mindfulness  and introspection, read dharma books and listen to webcasts of authentic teachers online (eg, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche).  We also need to continually do practices that collect merits and purify obstacles.  Try to surround yourself with constant reminders through books, quotes, helpful friends, etc to withstand the onslaught of the distractions of life.</p>
              <p>For sure, it is very good that you are paying attention to this problem and trying to address it in some ways. Many people who are sliding are not even cognizant of that fact.</p>

              <p>Advice on Friends</p>
              <p>by Dza Patrul Rinpoche</p>
              <p>A Good Friend Induces Good Habits</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you rely on a friend with knowledge, your intellect will increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you rely on a friend with compassion, you will give birth to bodhichitta.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you rely on a friend with contentment, your desires will decrease.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you rely on a friend with generosity, you will give rise to a giving mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you rely on a friend with a peaceful and restrained temperament, your mind-stream will become good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From a friend with disillusionment with the world, you will become weary of samsara.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From a friend with renunciation, you will give rise to the wish for liberation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From relying on a friend who cares more about the next life, you will remember to practice the Dharma.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Relying on a friend with few desires, you will give rise to contentment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From a friend with diligence, your fortitude will become great.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you associate with a sacred friend, your good qualities will be drawn out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Relying on a friend with the wish for liberation, you will work for permanent happiness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From a friend with a virtuous mind, you will give rise to a wholesome attitude.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From a friend with pure perception, you will generate faith.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you associate with a friend endowed with wisdom, you will accomplish your ultimate aspirations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are the habits that come from good company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The meaning, therefore, is to rely on virtuous friends!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A Bad Friend Induces Bad Habits</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you rely on friend with mental darkness, your wisdom will decrease.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Relying on a friend with anger, your mind-stream will become bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following a friend with lust, you will be nostalgiac for youth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you follow a friend with avarice, stinginess will be born.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you follow a friend with pride, you will remember your haughty position.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following a friend without renunciation, you will be attached to this life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following a friend who seeks after the appearances of this life, you will forget about the next life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From following a base friend, you will be attentive to commerce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following a friend concerned with profit, you will have a business-mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following a friend with craving for wealth, you will be focused on collecting and hoarding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following a friend with laziness, you will become indolent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following a friend with distractedness, you will be carried away with this life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Associating with a friend suffused with negativity, you will generate destructive thoughts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Associating with a friend with no faith, you will be fixated on non-virtue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are the habits that come from bad company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The meaning, therefore, is to abandon evil friends!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And so, at the request of Lama Rigdzin Gyamtso, this was done by Patrul. Virtue! </p>

              <p>Laxness or lack of motivation is not that unusual among many of us.  I
               guess we just need to keep coming back again and again to practice.  On
               a micro level - say when doing breathing meditation - we have to keep 
              returning again and again to the breath even as our minds wander off and
               lose mindfulness.  In our everyday lives too, we just have to keep 
              renewing the commitment towards consistent practice. </p>
              <p>You 
              mentioned having doubts.  It may be of value to address those doubts by 
              seeking clarification from a teacher or other more knowledgeable 
              Buddhists.  If you really do not have easy access to these in person, 
              feel free to ask questions on this or other Buddhist forums.  It's good 
              to clear doubts so that one can have greater conviction and motivation 
              to practise. </p>
              <p>Just my thoughts... :)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Dharmadhatu, <br><br>thank you for your kind advice. I do agree with you that surrounding myself with constant reminders like books, pictures, etc. could be helpful. However, living in non-buddhist family and in non-buddhist environment, I'm afraid to be regarded as ostentatious or 'exotic'. That's why looking for Dharma friends seems important to me - I think talking to fellow buddhist may be a very effective reminder. <br>Thank you very much for really inspiring 'Advice on Friends' by Patrul Rinpoche. May it be helpful for many.<br><br>Sometimes, I return to practice after doing things that I despise. I hope to find some way to return to practice before doing bad things, not after...<br><br><br><br>realization,<br><br>thank you for your response :) And thank you for your invitaion to asking questions and talking about doubts on the forum.<br>I agree we just have to keep coming back to practice. Sometimes, however, I'm going through periods of strange 'numbness'. I guess talking to fellow buddhists can possibly be really helpful in such cases. Just as it is said in the text Dharmadatu made accessible above :)<br><br><br>AEN,<br><br>I live in Poland.<br><br><br>Dawnfirstlight,<br><br>thank you for such a warm welcome :)<br><br><br>Cheers</p></div>

              I begin to find facebook a good platform esp since i am also a regular facebook user. added happiness.org, michael Kewley, rinpoches and Dharma centre as friends. They post a daily dose of good stuffs. :)
              
              Spiritual friends help to motivate one another. For example, i have a friend who is a pure vegan. I feel she is very compassionate towards animals. While i can't resist the urge of good food, she can out of kindness for animals. I find there amazing and somehow her quality will eat into you (:
              
              Let say you have some problems and you seek help talk from wise friends whom you trust, they will give good advices. 
              
              Well, Spiritual friends does not necessary has to be Buddhist too :) 
              
              My best friends are not Buddhist but they are just good people. 
              
              Just remind myself that i have to cultivate better so that i can benefit them more. (:

              <p>Well... it's not really popular here. To be true it is hardly known in Poland. Buddhists here are more attracted to other teachings - Zen school is very popular.

              We also can seek inspiration from our environment. For example, in Poland, you may experience the four seasons of change. You may shave your beard everyday. You may find yourself grow older and tired. You may encounter sickness and even death of others. This reminds us of impermancein life. Then you may want to ask yourself. What is the most important and meaningful thing in life? To practise the Dharma and be liberated from suffering. You may want to recollect death, impermance, the faults of samsara and the preciousness of having this human life to keep oneself "back on track" .The tibetan tradition named this the four foundation practice.
                      
              If you has ever encountered any diffculties, seek refuge in the Triple Gems. A venerable has once shared whenever, he faced difficulties in his practice, he will pay a visit to the nearby stupa and seek strength and blessing from Buddha.
                      
              When we see ourselves as a friend, we also see others as friends. Just remind myself of a quote that i have learnt from a retreat. 
                  
              May all be well and happy!

                      What is the most important and meaningful thing in life? To
                      practise the Dharma and be liberated from suffering. You may want
                      to recollect death, impermance, the faults of samsara and the
                      preciousness of having this human life to keep oneself “back on
                      track” .The tibetan tradition named this the four foundation
                      practice.</p>
              <p>If you has ever encountered any diffculties, seek refuge in the
                      Triple Gems. A venerable has once shared whenever, he faced
                      difficulties in his practice, he will pay a visit to the nearby
                      stupa and seek strength and blessing from Buddha.</p>
              <p>When we see ourselves as a friend, we also see others as
                      friends. Just remind myself of a quote that i have learnt from a
                      retreat.</p>
              <p>May all be well and happy!</p>
