              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 17.95pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The founder of most of the world’s major religions are attributed
              with performing miracles. Jesus walked on the water, Muhammad flew to Jerusalem
              on the back of a winged horse-like creature, the Hindu gods performed too many
              miracles to mention. As spectacular as these and other miracles are, all of
              them pale into insignificance besides what is sometimes called the Miracle of
              Sankassa manifest by the Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 17.95pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What must have been one of ancient Sri Lanka’s largest, not to say
              finest, paintings graced the back right-hand wall of the great Tivanka Pilimage
              in Polonnaruwa and it depicts the Miracle of Sankassa. According to the Pali
              commentaries this is how this astonishing event unfolded. After preaching the
              Abhidhamma Pitaka to his mother in the Tavatimsa Heaven the time came for the
              Buddha to return to earth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 17.95pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Sakkya, the king of the gods, created what amounts to three
              celestial escalators stretching from above the clouds, suggesting that they
              must have been at least a kilometre long, all the way to the earth, and ending
              in the town of Sankassa. The central one was made of gems, the left one of
              silver and the right one of gold. In all his majesty and glory the Buddha
              descended to earth on the central escalator-like ladder, Brahma on the left one
              holding an umbrella over him, and the lesser gods on the right one.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 17.95pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The commentary adds that people from thirty yojana around flocked
              to witness this spectacle, and you can well believe it. This must have been the
              most astonishing and spectacular thing that had ever seen, they must have been
              dumbstruck with amazement. Since them the Miracle has been celebrated in
              sculpture, painting and poetry. It has been mentioned and described in
              countless sermons. In fact, one of the earliest representations of events of
              the life of the Buddha, a bas relief from the great Bharhutstupa (100/150 BCE)
              is of this miracle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 17.95pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">However, despite how amazing it was, there are a few decidedly
              curious facts about the Miracle of Sankassa. Firstly, it is hard to understand
              why the Buddha decided to descend to earth in the obscure town of Sankassa, and
              it was a very obscure place. If fact Sankassa is only mentioned twice in the
              whole Tipitaka and the Buddha only visited it once, passing through it while on
              his way to somewhere else (Suttavibhanga I,4 and Cullavagga XII). One would
              think that such an astonishing performance would be worth a large audience such
              as could be had in a major city such as Savatthi, Rahagaha or Kosambi. Again,
              it seems odd that the Buddha would set down a Vinaya rule saying that a monk
              who has developed psychic powers must not display them in public, and then go
              and break this veryrule. When Venerable Pindola demonstrated his powers of
              levitation in front of a large crowd the Buddha scolded him in the strongest
              terms. "You are like a cheap woman who exposes herself for a few miserable
              coins" (Cullavagga V.8).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 17.95pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Perhaps even more odd is this. Nearly all suttas in the Tipitaka
              have a preamble stating where the Buddha preached them. So for example, the
              well-known Mangala Sutta starts: "Thus have I heard. Once when the Lord
              was staying at the Jeta’s Grove in Anathapindaka’s Garden…etc." We are
              told that the seven books of the Abhi dhamma were taught by the Buddha in the
              Tavatimsa Heaven before his descent to Sankassa and later recited them all to
              Ananda, as was done with nearly all his sermons. But strangely, nowhere in the
              Abhadhamma Pitaka do we read the words: "Thus have I heard. Once when the
              Lord was staying at Sankassa, having descended from the Tavatisma
              Heaven…etc." One would think that given the Abhidhamma’s importance it
              would have been natural to record where it was taught and the amazing miracle
              that succeeded it. But, strangest of all is this. Nowhere in the whole of the
              Tipitaka, some 45 volumes in an English translation, is the Miracle of Sankassa
              mentioned. Not in the four Nikayas, not in the fifteen books of the Khuddhaka
              Nikaya, not in the Vinaya, and not even in the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the very
              place one would expect to find some mention of it. Why should this be so?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 17.95pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There are several possible explanations for this strange omission.
              The first is that Ananda forgot it and consequently did not mention it during
              the First Council. I think we can safely dismiss this theory. It seems
              increasable that anyone could forget such an amazing event. And even if Ananda
              had forgotten all about it surely at least some of the 500 arahats attending
              the First Council would have heard about it, perhaps even witnessed it and
              reminded Ananda of it. Another possible explanation is that there was an
              account of the Miracle in the Tipitaka but it was accidently lost due to
              carelessness. Again this does not appear to be likely. Many suttas are repeated
              twice, three times or sometimes even more. One would expect something as
              spectacular as the Miracle to be mentioned several times and in great detail,
              and given this it is unlikely that each and every account could be lost. Thus
              we arrive at what would seem to be the most compelling explanation – that the
              Miracle of Sankassa never happened, that it is a later legend, a phantasmagoria
              that was created in the centuries after the Buddha. Those who find this
              explanation unacceptable are left with the problem of explaining why a miracle
              so overwhelming and stupendous failed to get a mention in the sacred
              scriptures.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 17.95pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">However, if this conclusion is correct, if the Miracle of Sankassa
              is just a Cecil B. DeMille-like legend meant to arouse faith and a sense of
              wonder in a world and at a time bereft of science, this may not be a bad thing.
              Gently shedding glittering but improbable legends gives more room for the essentials
              of the Buddha’s Dhamma to get a hearing. Trying to convince young,
              well-educated people that three ladders made of precious metals and gems once
              appeared in the sky reaching from the clouds to the earth and the Buddha and
              dozens of heavenly beings walked down it to a small town in northern India,
              would be a very hard sell. And more so if they had just been told that
              "Buddhism is scientific."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 17.95pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Further, considering the Miracle of Sankassa to be a legend rather
              than fact may not weaken Buddhism but actually help strengthen it, particularly
              concerning the question of the authenticity of the Pali Tipitaka. Of course,
              traditional Buddhists believe that the suttas are an accurate account of what
              the Buddha taught, recited at the First Council and passed on without omission
              of error right up to today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Almost no Indologists or scholars of Buddhism accept this today.
              The better informed say that the core material in the Nikayas may date from the
              time of the Buddha to about 100 or perhaps 200 years after his passing, and
              that even the younger material reflects the ideas of the Buddha, if not
              necessarily his exact words. However, some scholars, mainly those following the
              American academic Prof. Gregory Schopen of the University of California LA are
              now saying that the Pali Tipitaka cannot be considered any older than later
              Sanskrit sutras which began appearing from around the turn of the first
              centuries CE. Schopen is a brilliant and prolific Buddhologist and argues his
              case well. But while scholars of Pali literature consider his position extreme
              he and others like him are having considerable influence on Buddhist studies in
              the West.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: 4.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: 4.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What has this
              scholarly debate got to do with the Miracle of Sankassa? Well, quite a lot
              actually. The story of the Miracle is recounted in numerous Mahayana sutras and
              early Buddhist Sanskrit literature. It is of course mentioned in the Pali
              commentaries, including the Jataka commentary, so we know it was accepted in
              the Theravada tradition. We know that the Miracle was widely considered to be
              part of the Buddha’s biography by at least 100/150 BC because it is represented
              in sculpture from Sanchi, Bharhut and Mathura. Most interesting of all is that
              king Asoka erected one of his mighty pillars in Sankassa where its broken
              remains with its elephant capital can still be seen. There is no inscription on
              the pillar so it is not known why Asoka chose this place to erect it, but it
              seems beyond argument that he did so to commemorate the Miracle. We don’t know
              when he erected it either but it must be sometime around 258 BCE when he is
              thought to have converted to Buddhism. Depending on when the Buddha died, and
              many scholars now consider about 483 BCE to be an acceptable date, this could
              mean that the Miracle was already widely known and considered
              "gospel" perhaps within 250 years of the Buddha’s passing. If this is
              so, then why wasn’t it included in the Pali Tiptaka? Why didn’t the Theravadins
              make a place for it in their sacred scriptures? To me the most compelling
              answer to this question is this – that the Pali Tipitaka was already closed, it
              was already considered so sacrosanct that no one would dare add anything new to
              it. Within approx. 250 years, and quite possibly much earlier, the doors were
              closed on the Miracle of Sankassa and the soon to be numerous other legends
              that were in the process of evolving. They were admitted into early Buddhist
              Sanskrit literature, into Mahayanasutras and into the Pali commentaries, but
              not into the Tipitaka. So paradoxically in classing the Miracle of Sankassa as
              a later legend one is at the same time asserting that the Pali Tipitaka is the
              oldest record we have of the Buddha and his Dhamma.</span></p>
