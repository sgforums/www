              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">by Dzongsar Jamyang
              Khyentse, The Huffington Post, April 6, 2015</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>New Delhi,
              India</span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.231; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"> - India and
              Nepal gave the world one of its most precious resources - the Buddha. Yet
              neither country truly values this extraordinary legacy, let alone takes pride
              in it. In the Buddha's own birthplace and homeland, his teachings are
              marginalised, his wisdom is unappreciated, and his legacy is invisible in
              society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The
              pervasive neglect of this treasured inheritance is an inestimable loss. After
              all, few products from this region have ever been so widely valued and
              respected, or travelled as far and as successfully, as the teachings of the
              Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Yes
              - yoga, curry, basmati rice and Bollywood have their global influence. But
              Buddhism has transformed whole societies in China, Thailand, Burma, Vietnam,
              Japan and more, is fast penetrating the Western world, and continues to touch
              the hearts and minds of millions around the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">And
              yet, amazingly, this intense global interest is barely evident in the lands
              where the Buddha himself was born, became enlightened, and taught. It is
              unfathomable that neither governments nor the vast majority of people here in
              India and Nepal truly cherish the Buddha today or hold him in their hearts and
              minds as one of their own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">This
              lack of concern for their Buddhist heritage is both a leadership failure and an
              endemic societal blindness. In Nepal, interest in Buddhism only seems to be
              roused when someone claims the Buddha was born in India, at which time the
              Nepalese zealously declare their own country as his birthplace - even though
              neither Nepal nor India existed as entities 2,500 years ago.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In
              India the blindness extends from the failure of India's educated elite to learn
              about, appreciate, and preserve their country's Buddhist heritage all the way
              to those who make a living selling Buddha's pictures and bodhi beads at
              pilgrimage sites, and to the fake monks and charlatans who score donations from
              unsuspecting Buddhist pilgrims. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">And
              this disregard for Buddhism is manifest everywhere, like at the bookstore at
              Varanasi airport - the gateway for countless pilgrims to the sacred site of the
              Buddha's first teaching - which carries not a single book on Buddhism in the
              midst of its rich Hindu and Indian collection.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">And
              it is manifest even at the most sacred Buddhist shrine in the world, the
              Mahabodhi Temple in Bodhgaya, where the Buddha became enlightened, which
              remains under majority Hindu management - a situation akin to having the
              Vatican or the Kaaba in Mecca run by a majority of Buddhists, or a Jewish
              congregation run by mostly Protestants.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Secularism
              and political correctness in India</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">It
              is not easy to explain this wilful neglect. To some extent the plight of
              Buddhism in India today may be a legacy of the country's long colonial history,
              which seems to have led to a wholesale embrace of secular values at the cost of
              forsaking India's own profound spiritual heritage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">One
              recent example is the supposed revival of Nalanda, the world's oldest and
              greatest Buddhist university, which predated the founding of Oxford University
              by 650 years. The project's first Chancellor, Amartya Sen - in the name of a
              firm "distinction between religious studies and the practice of
              religion"- indicated he would tone down any Buddhist or spiritual teaching
              in favour of a secular curriculum. Indeed Prof. Sen writes about Nalanda with
              no mention of its Buddhist heritage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">India
              purports to value its heritage, but in practice acts more in accord with
              Western, worldly, materialist and non-spiritual values than with the profound
              wisdom its traditions have bequeathed to the world. And so, while India proudly
              claims its place as the world's largest democratic country, the Buddha remains
              a stranger to most Indians. Indeed, India's educated intellectuals know more
              about Marx and Marxism than about Buddha and Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Western
              secular political correctness is on display even at the entrance to the Nalanda
              ruins, where the historical marker fails to mention that the university and its
              huge, invaluable library were actually destroyed in 1193 by Muslims on
              religious grounds because its texts did not uphold the Qur'an. The government
              prefers to tell visitors simply that the destroyer was a man by the name of
              Bakhtiyar Khilji.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Diluting
              the truth and watering down historical facts in the name of secular political
              correctness serves nobody. On the contrary, denying reality and burying the
              truth actually nurture extremism, even in traditionally non-violent cultures
              like Burma where Buddhists have acted violently towards Muslim neighbours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Imagine
              the anger and accusations of anti-Semitism that would erupt in New York City if
              the government and scholars actively toned down the history of the Holocaust.
              For that matter, imagine how Indians would react if officials and scholars
              toned down past British exploitation and misdeeds in India.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Scholars,
              journalists, panelists and experts will do more to serve peace and harmony
              today by telling the truth about the Muslim destruction of Nalanda and other
              Buddhist icons - historically in India and recently in Afghanistan - than by
              hiding it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Western
              and Indian apologists for Islam argue that they are promoting tolerance, and
              that other religions have also engaged in destructive behaviour, like the
              Christians during the Crusades. They also have a habit of praising Buddhists
              for their generally non-violent response to provocation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">This
              form of apparent tolerance is more akin to a sophisticated political
              correctness than to genuine tolerance and open-mindedness. Imagine covering up
              a brutal assault by praising the victim for not retaliating and by diverting
              attention to other assaults.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">By
              contrast, telling the truth, which includes naming the assailant, is essential
              to nurture true love and compassion, which in the Buddhist view is inseparable
              from wisdom. Such honesty would do much to temper the impulse for revenge and
              retaliation, and even to reveal the truly heroic and courageous nature of
              non-violent response. In fact, that's precisely how Indian historians salute
              Gandhi's greatness and fearless non-violence - by exposing, not covering up,
              British brutalities during India's Independence struggle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In
              the case of the Hindu and Muslim destruction of Buddhism in India, however,
              India has unfortunately opted for a more cowardly political correctness. It has
              given in to the pressure of violence and intimidation, but has failed to reward
              non-violence with any protective action. Thus, while the Delhi airport decks
              out a special terminal for hajj pilgrims, there is no comparable support for
              Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Only
              two religions matter in India</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">However,
              secularism alone cannot explain India's wanton neglect of its Buddhist
              heritage, as witnessed by ongoing Hindu-Muslim sensitivities that show religion
              still does matter in the country. Hindus, for example, are incensed by the
              Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi occupying the site of an ancient Hindu temple, and
              they even destroyed the Babri mosque in Ayodhya in order to build a Hindu
              temple; Muslims in Bengal and in neighbouring Bangladesh and Pakistan have
              attacked Hindu temples.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Yet
              India has no compunction about refusing to allow Buddhists to run the holiest
              of their sites, completely brushing off the fact that Bodhgaya is to Buddhists
              what Mecca is to Muslims. And so, perhaps it is not just secularism at play
              here, but rather that when push comes to shove, the only religion with
              influence in India has to be fanatical and violent-whether its adherents are
              orange-clad or green-clad.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In
              fact the demise of Buddhism in India is attributable to both the country's
              major religions, with Islam in effect finishing off what Hinduism began. Thus
              it was Brahmanic pressure from the 5th century onwards that converted so many
              Buddhist temples into Hindu places of worship, with Muslim invaders then
              destroying what remained.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The
              legacy of this ancient religious imperialism remains evident today not only in
              Hindu management of Buddhist sacred places but is even enshrined in the
              Constitution of India itself. There, Article 25 declares that "reference
              to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to persons professing the
              Sikh, Jaina or Buddhist religion, and the reference to Hindu religious
              institutions shall be construed accordingly".</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Whatever
              the historical antecedents, today's sad reality is that the governments and
              people of Nepal, India, and Bihar are notoriously poor hosts to the hundreds of
              thousands of pilgrims who come here every year to pay homage and respect to the
              life and teachings of Gautama Buddha. From the top echelons of leadership to
              the lowest beggar syndicates in the streets, there is no evidence of any
              inclination to accommodate, help or be kind to these pilgrims from afar, beyond
              extorting money from them in every conceivable way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">To
              be fair, we cannot blame the woes of Nalanda, Bodhgaya, or Sarnath entirely on
              non-Buddhists. Mahayana chauvinists and Theravada elitists also operate in
              their own worlds, and the Buddhist temples around Bodhgaya rarely join in
              solidarity on any issue less mundane than obtaining an electric line or
              improving water supply. Rather than celebrating their common heritage in shared
              teachings, meditation, devotional rituals and festivals, they often seem more
              intent on promoting their own sects and drowning out each other's prayers with
              their own particular liturgies on blaring amplifiers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In
              response to my criticisms of India's lack of care for its Buddhist heritage, my
              Hindu friends are quick to note that Buddhism is essentially part of Hinduism
              and that Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu. Regardless of philosophical issues,
              that argument falters on simple human, social and emotional grounds, since
              Hinduism's gains, glories, and leverage are never shared with Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Neglect
              of Buddhism is India's loss</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Whichever
              way one looks at it - whether merely through the worldly lens of business,
              politics, national pride, export opportunity, foreign policy or for deeper
              spiritual reasons - the pervasive neglect of its Buddhist inheritance is truly
              a sad loss for India.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Even
              from a purely secular, business perspective, places like Bodhgaya and Lumbini
              are potential gold mines. Just within my own short stay recently in Bodhgaya,
              two foreign heads of state visited the Mahabodhi Temple to pay their respects.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Indeed,
              foreign dignitaries, army generals, and other notables regularly come to
              Bodhgaya not for any conference or negotiation but simply to pay homage, not to
              mention the thousands of pilgrims who come on a daily basis from all over the
              world - Europe, Russia, south and southeast Asia, China, the Americas,
              Australia and more.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">And
              if some politics are inevitable, India actually holds a foreign policy trump
              card, because Bodhgaya and the other Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the country
              are assets that transcend all sectarian and political divisions, including on
              sensitive issues like Tibet. After all, these pilgrimage sites are sacred to
              all Buddhists of every tradition - without exception - and thus remain eternal
              reminders of the elemental truths the Buddha taught.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">From
              a simple export value perspective, compare the quality of India's rich Buddhist
              heritage and the respect it commands worldwide to the embarrassingly shoddy
              quality of so many of India's other products - from postage stamps that don't
              stick to door latches that don't fit. How sad that India does not cherish, let
              alone market, one of the greatest creations it has ever produced - the
              stainless teachings and wisdom of Gautama Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">And
              even from the point of view of simple national pride, it's worth remembering
              that neither Vishnu nor Shiva would attain Indian or Nepalese citizenship today
              because they are gods. By contrast the Buddha was an actual human being from
              their own land, whose wisdom, teaching and example continue to touch the hearts
              and minds of millions around the world, including in the land of India's
              arch-nemesis, China. It is almost incomprehensible that neither India nor Nepal
              today shows any vested interest in his legacy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">A
              matter of attitude</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Given
              this pervasive disinterest and neglect, it is not surprising that any real
              improvements in Bodhgaya and other Buddhist sacred sites are largely the
              initiative of foreigners or Tibetan refugees, who usually have to bribe their
              way at every step to get anything done.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The
              Indian government and people's lack of regard for such generous contributions
              from abroad is well illustrated by a recent incident in the impoverished region
              of Dhungeshwari, where the Buddha practised austerities for six years before
              attaining enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">There
              Delhi bureaucrats imposed a massive Rs 9 million fine on a school started by a
              Korean Buddhist monk for 500 local disadvantaged children, and thereby forced
              the school - unable to pay the fine and cut off from outside funds - to close
              temporarily.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">When
              the school went to court - a brave action, especially in Bihar - to appeal the
              unjust ruling, a high court judge to his credit quashed the fine and publicly
              upbraided the Government of India for penalising a Buddhist-run school that was
              helping India's poorest and doing what the government itself should have been
              doing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In
              this rare case, justice was eventually served. But the lengthy bureaucratic
              harassment that preceded the judgment points to a larger attitudinal problem in
              India's perspective on Buddhism altogether.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">One
              component of that attitude stems from caste issues that are still so powerfully
              dominant in India today. Millions of Buddhists in the state of Maharashtra, who
              were brought to the Buddhist path by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, are less committed to
              the teachings of the Buddha than to their wish to be free of the stigma of
              their low caste status. Important and understandable though that wish is, such
              a social and political agenda may not be helpful either to their own spiritual
              path or to Buddhism altogether.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Thus,
              a highly educated Indian friend accompanying me to my daily meditation at the
              Mahabodhi Temple in Bodhgaya was recently quizzed by the Indian security guards
              as to why he was coming there every day, and was he an authorised guide.
              Assuming that Buddhism was either for foreigners or for the lowest caste
              Indians, these security guards could not fathom what the interest of an
              educated high-caste Indian might be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">And
              if this puzzlement exists at the very entrance to Buddhism's most sacred
              shrine, there may be little hope for a change of attitude towards Buddhism in
              Indian society or in the Indian national psyche at large.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">India
              and China play the Buddhist card</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Recently
              India has started to show some signs of mild interest in relating to its
              Buddhist heritage, particularly in the Himalayan region, largely because China
              is so actively providing support for Buddhist sacred sites on the other side of
              the Himalayas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In
              that regard, it's worth recalling statistical estimates that about 20% of
              Chinese are Buddhists, compared to less than 1% of Indians in the land of the
              Buddha's enlightenment - a percentage that has not changed in centuries. In
              fact, China has by far the largest Buddhist population in the world (amounting
              to more than half of all the world's Buddhists), while India's Buddhists amount
              to less than 2% of the world's total.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In
              contrast to the long history of neglect of Buddhism in India, China celebrates
              a number of historic and iconic Buddhist scholars and patrons. For example, the
              Chinese revere Xuanzang, to whom Buddhists are indebted for keeping record of
              the most sacred sites of the Buddha's life and enlightenment. And the patronage
              of generations of Chinese dynasties and emperors (like Emperor Ming in the Han
              dynasty, Emperor Wu in the Lang dynasty, and Empress Wu Zetian in the Tang
              dynasty) has ensured the survival of Buddhism outside the land of its birth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">And
              this patronage is not just ancient or historical. Even today it's revealing to
              observe the sheer magnitude, detail, and scale of care and veneration lavished
              by China - a supposedly atheist country - on the preservation of the Buddha's
              finger bone at Famen Temple in Xi'an, for example, compared to the sub-standard
              way the Buddha's relics are treated at the National Museum in New Delhi, where
              even the reliquary was a donation from Thailand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Of
              course we will never forget that the Chinese destroyed Buddhist temples, texts
              and teachers, both in the 1950s and during the Cultural Revolution. But those
              actions, over a very short time period, were politically not religiously
              motivated, and a strong revival of Buddhism is now underway in China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">This
              is in sharp contrast to the historical Brahmanic persecution of Buddhists and
              the subsequent centuries-long decimation of Buddhism in India by the Muslims,
              from both of which Indian Buddhism has never recovered.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Yet,
              rather than emulate Buddhism's resurgence in China, India - ever suspicious of
              Chinese spying - still erects bureaucratic barriers for many of the hundreds of
              thousands of Chinese Buddhists eager to visit India on pilgrimage each year.
              But India should understand that just as an Indian Hindu might feel more
              comfortable with a British Hindu than with an Indian Muslim, Sri Lankan or
              Ladakhi Buddhists regard these visiting Chinese pilgrims simply as fellow
              Buddhist brethren.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">And
              just as Muslims, destitute, colonised or downtrodden in their own lands, might
              take pride as fellow Muslims in Saudi Arabia's power and wealth, or like Jews around
              the world might take pride in Israel, so Buddhists in Bangladesh, Indonesia,
              and other places that suffered foreign invasion, or in small, poor countries
              like Bhutan, might rejoice in China's emergence as a superpower.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In
              sum, rather than succumbing to old fear-driven habits and suspicions, India
              might learn from and even join with the Buddhist renaissance in China by
              proudly proclaiming its own land, heritage and sacred sites as the birthplace
              and source of the Buddha's enlightenment, wisdom and teachings.</span></p>

              this article, I've tried to point to some possible historical, political,
              strategic, religious, philosophical, caste and other explanations for this
              region's heedless squandering of its rich and profound Buddhist heritage. But,
              whatever the reasons to date, the bottom line is that it doesn't have to be
              this way.</span></p>

              conscious shift of view, not difficult to achieve, could not only acknowledge
              but take tremendous pride in the legacy of a man whose contribution to

              this materialist era in which greed is literally destroying the earth on which
              our survival depends, the need to hear and contemplate the Buddha's truth on
              the interdependent nature of all reality is more pressing than ever. At the
              policy and behavioural level, such contemplation might even temper excess
              consumption, prevent further resource depletion, preserve endangered habitats,
              and leave the planet in a habitable condition for our children.</span></p>

              relatively little effort, the extraordinarily rich ancient heritage of India
              and Nepal could merge with expanding current needs and interests in the world
