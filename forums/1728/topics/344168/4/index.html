                          particular institution and begin to take lessons, we are truly Buddhists only after we
                          have taken refuge in the Three Treasures and begin to learn and practise what the Buddha
                          taught. Taking refuge means to return to the Buddha's domain and to rely on the Buddha,
                          the Dharma and the Sangha as our teacher. An important aspect of being a Buddhist is to
                          observe the code of morality - that of 'benefiting others and self.' </span></strong></span></p>

                          code of ethics, so as to prepare ourselves as a useful member of the society. For a
                          university education, one first needs to register and take the required entrance
                          examinations. Upon qualifying, one needs to attend the lectures. Only then is one a
                          university student. If you read widely and is knowledgeable, and you attend the university
                          lectures from outside the lecture hall to the extent that you feel that you understand as
                          much as the students in the lecture hall, still, nobody believes nor are you recognised as

                          books on Buddhism and you may consider yourself a Buddhist. In reality, without taking
                          refuge you have not yet form a cause or basis with the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha.

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;"><br> What does taking refuge mean? In mandarin this phrase is made up of two characters:
                          "gui" meaning to return to and "yi" meaning to rely on. From the aeons
                          of births, from time immemorial, the Buddha-nature in each and everyone of us is an
                          integral part of the Buddha domain. It is because of ignorance that we are departed from
                          this domain and are caused to exist in the fire of the three planes of existence, namely,
                          the worlds of sensuous desire, form and the formless, and to transmigrate in the six
                          realms of existence, namely, deva, human being, asura, animal, ghost and hell. At times we
                          are in the heavenly realm, yet at others we may be human, ghost, animal or in hell. It is
                          like leaving the comforts of our home and parents to wander about as a vagabond. After
                          having encountered a lot of difficulties and sufferings, and being helpless, we finally
                          remember our parents at home and decide to return home to them.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">It is the same with Buddhism. After departing from the Buddha's domain and
                          having arrived at the three planes of existence, experienced the transmigration in the six
                          realms and a lot of suffering, we decide to return to the Buddha's domain. Having
                          returned, we then rely on the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, collectively termed as
                          the Three Treasures or Triratna, as our teacher. We rely on the Dharma expounded by the
                          Buddha as our compass in life. Regardless of our occupation, whether we are home or in
                          society, we use the Dharma as a guide to living and advance towards the direction of the
                          brightness of Buddhism. Just as a vagabond who has returned home rely on the material
                          support and the guidance of his parents to live a proper life of peace and well being, it
                          is the same principle with taking refuge.</span></strong></span></p>
              <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">To take refuge in the three treasures means taking refuge
                          in the precious Buddha, the precious Dharma and the precious Sangha. The precious Buddha
                          refers to all the Buddhas of the ten directions (eight directions of the compass, and the
                          nadir and zenith), and the three periods (past, present and future). To take refuge in the
                          Buddha means to sincerely become a disciple of the Buddha. It does not mean to buy an
                          image of the Buddha, place it on an altar and called oneself a Buddhist. The precious
                          Buddha is invaluable and therefore cannot be bought with money. The precious Dharma is the
                          teachings of all the Buddhas of the ten directions and the three periods and also cannot
                          be bought with money. It is the same with the precious Sangha, it also cannot be bought
                          with money. It is only when we sincerely take refuge in the three treasures that we can
                          call ourselves disciples of the three treasures. The precious Sangha are Buddhist monks
                          and nuns who renounced the worldly life to learn and practise the Buddha's teachings and
                          to promote the Dharma. Having taken refuge in the precious Sangha we address them as
                          "Masters". One has a master only after taking refuge. It is therefore obvious
                          that masters also cannot be bought. Thus, they are called treasures. </span></strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">We become disciples of the three treasures after taking
                          refuge. Disciples of the three treasures are Buddhists who learn and practise the correct
                          doctrines of the Buddha. We pay respect to the Bodhisattvas and learn from the
                          Bodhisattvas. We also need to be Bodhisattvas ourselves, eradicate our self-serving
                          temperaments, and practise according to the teachings. Bodhisattvas possess the virtuous
                          quality of great compassion. Thus, we need to emulate the great compassion of the
                          Bodhisattvas to consider ourselves as Buddhists. <br> </span></strong></span></p>

                          symbolic of morality. The significance of the practice is that we want to uphold the code
                          of ethics and morality and let its fragrance permeates across the entire universe. As
                          Buddhists, first and foremost, we need to examine ourselves if we are righteous in our
                          morality. Jen Chen Buddhism defines the principle morality as "Benefiting self and
                          others". For example, a doctor who excels in his studies and skills in practising
                          medicine is said to possess the correct principles of medical practice. If, as a doctor he
                          possesses such excellent knowledge and skills but he refuses to treat the sick even when
                          begged to, or he charges unreasonably high fees, then he is said to be lacking in medical
                          ethics. Similarly, if the patient is very poor and the doctor does not show compassion and
                          overcharges him, and perhaps even does not completely treat the sickness, then he is also
                          lacking in medical ethics. <br> <br> Students of law may excel in their law studies. These become their correct principles of
                          study. However, if having qualified as attorneys, they fail to observe these principles
                          and are dubious in character, then they are lacking in morality. Furthermore, if as an
                          attorney he overcharges or fails to discharge his duty in carrying out justice, then he
                          has no morals. A skilful swimmer has already acquired the correct principles of swimming.
                          Yet, if he fails to act to rescue a drowning person, then he has failed in morality. On
                          the other hand, you may be a person of great compassion, but you cannot swim. Yet, you
                          didn't hesitate to save a drowning person. In the end not only do you fail to save him,
                          but also you lose your own life. That is also being immoral.</span></strong></span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">The above are a few simple examples to illustrate the principles of
                          morality. Even scholars and authorities find it difficult to agree on a common definition
                          of morality. It is even more difficult for the masses to observe them. Thus, Jen Chen
                          Buddhism uses a very simple definition, 'Benefiting others and self'. It is hoped that in
                          future authorities of education would adopt this principle in the curriculum. Only then, I
                          believe, will we know and observe national and social morals. Thus, when we want to build
                          our country, each and everyone of us needs to understand the principle of morality, be
                          moral in our conduct and have an ethical culture.</span></strong></span></p>
              <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;"><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>When we have taken refuge we are students of the Buddha.
                          We need to be ethical and moral, and we need to zealously observe the code of morality. In
                          this way, as a human being, our conduct becomes complete and fulfilling. If, as a Buddhist
                          one is ignorant of the principles of morality, then taking refuge does not serve any
                          purpose. When we take refuge, therefore, it is to observe the code of morality.</strong><br> </span><br> <br> </span></p>

              <p>I have read past life regression accounts of people who were

              <p>Your own religion has a Church-based aspect as well as a
              Mystical aspect. The mystical aspect is vastly different from the
              church-based one. Perhaps, you need to understand your religion
              better by tracing its historical developments.</p>
