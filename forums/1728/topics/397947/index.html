              <p><strong>Joel Groover:</strong> Could we talk a bit about what you 
              have called dynamic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jh%C4%81na">jhana</a> vs. static jhana?</p>
              <p><strong>Kenneth Folk:</strong> Yes. There is a <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/Dynamic+Jhana+vs+Static+Jhana">Flash
               animation</a> on my website that shows a mountain and two yogis. The 
              one on the left is the dynamic yogi, and the one on the right is the 
              static yogi. The idea is that you want to get up and down through all 
              the strata of mind and objectify them all. So a dynamic yogi will go up 
              and down through all the strata of mind. In each sitting he is going to 
              get to every stratum of mind that is available to him and, over time, as
               the days and months and years go by, he gets higher and higher up the 
              mountain in each sitting. Eventually, he gets to the top. He has 
              objectified everything in the field of attention, and he is enlightened.</p>
              <p>Now, the static yogi, on the other hand—the yogi on the right—he just
               goes up to the first stratum of mind and sits there with this idea of 
              mastering it, with the idea of becoming a jhana master. He is not even 
              going to move up the mountain until he feels he has mastered the first 
              level. So eventually he moves up to the next level, and the next. But it
               is taking a long time. The upshot of this is that while the dynamic 
              yogi gets enlightened, the static yogi takes much longer and ends up 
              just getting old. His beard turns gray. He has a toothless, blissed-out 
              grin on his face, but he never actually gets enlightened.</p>
              <p>It is more important in my system to see the entire package of mind 
              than it is to achieve any particular, arbitrary level of mastery of any 
              particular level of mind.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> I have to laugh for multiple reasons here. It is
               a funny animation, but it is also such abstract territory for me. But 
              it is important because I am trying to figure out what is the role of 
              concentration practice here, for me.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> This is always tricky because, for most people 
              who are asking these questions, they are trying to understand something 
              they can’t see.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Exactly.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> And so they are turning to teachers and saying, 
              “Can you describe this to me?” It is sort of like the way a blind person
               would ask a sighted person to describe color or to describe the 
              landscape.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And what happens is they often are like a blind 
              person who has heard vivid and interesting descriptions of what it is 
              like to see and wants to explore that and is interested. But then you’re
               forced to make the decision—what is your approach? And assuming there 
              is a way for you to learn how to see, which way do you go? So it is 
              tricky.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> But the prognosis is good because people who 
              apply themselves will eventually be able to see this. What almost always
               happens when people do get to the point where they can see it, they 
              say, “Wow. I only half-believed there was such a thing as jhana.”</p>
              <p>Now they see that jhanas are actually very clear. This is something 
              that is hard, as a sighted person so-called—it is kind of hard to convey
               how clear these things are. So people will say, “Well I don’t know what
               you’re saying. It seems kind of speculative.” And I will say, “I’m 
              sitting in my living room right now looking at a bookshelf with all of 
              these different colored books on it.” That is not particularly 
              speculative. I’m just describing what I see. It’s the same with jhana.</p>
              <p>Because of the nature of jhana—even more than bookshelves—different 
              people will describe it in different ways, and different people will 
              emphasize different things about jhana. The question to ask is, “What is
               the relationship of jhana to this larger process of getting 
              enlightened?” So let’s go back to first principles: the idea is to 
              objectify the phenomena that are arising in the mind. When you do that, 
              you naturally dis-embed from those phenomena. You stop confusing 
              yourself with your experience. You develop what I think of as Teflon 
              mind, where nothing is sticking, and that is enlightenment. So what does
               jhana have to do with that?</p>
              <p>Well, jhana is really just a way of exploring and talking about the 
              territory of your mind. It is a way of describing the territory, and 
              because the mind is set up in these strata or layers, and because these 
              layers are recognizable, it’s possible to have these discrete 
              experiences depending on which layer you happen to be visiting at the 
              time. When we talk about jhana we are deliberately choosing from the 
              many different layers of mind and picking out the stable and pleasant 
              ones, the jhanas, and giving them special status. Well, that is an 
              arbitrary call. There is no particular reason to say that the levels of 
              mind that contain jhana are special, except that they are pleasant and 
              stable.</p>
              <p>So if you look at my model of <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/20+Major+Strata+of+Mind">20
               strata of mind</a>, some of them are pleasant and stable and some of 
              them are not. Those that are pleasant and stable have been traditionally
               categorized as jhana. So we’re picking and choosing. Let me explain 
              this in detail so that you can see what I mean.</p>
              <p>When you go to the first stratum of mind, it just so happens that 
              when you become absorbed in it you can have a pleasant experience, and 
              that is the first jhana. In addition, there is an insight knowledge to 
              be gleaned there: Knowledge of Mind and Body, the first of the insight 
              knowledges. Contrast that with the second stratum of mind—it is not 
              stable; there is no way to bliss out on it on it for hours and say, 
              “Here I am being happy in jhana.”</p>
              <p>But that second stratum of mind does contain an insight knowledge, 
              which is the second insight knowledge, traditionally called Knowledge of
               Cause and Effect. And the same with the third stratum of mind, which 
              contains an insight knowledge [Knowledge of the Three Characteristics] 
              but, because it is unstable, does not contain a jhana.</p>
              <p>At the fourth stratum of mind, which is stable, there is a jhana 
              there, which is the second jhana. So, the fourth layer of mind, like the
               first, has both an insight knowledge [Knowledge of the Arising and 
              Passing Away of Phenomena] and a jhana.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And the point is to be able to dis-embed from 
              all of those.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes. And when we talk about jhanas as jhana 
              practice, there is a tendency to privilege those states: “Those are 
              really so special. We really want to master those particular states.” 
              Well that is horse feathers. What you really want to do is dis-embed 
              from all of it. Why would you want to master jhana states more than you 
              would want to master unstable and unpleasant states? Why would you 
              settle for being a jhana master when you could be happy and free across 
              the entire spectrum of experience?</p>
              <p>Freedom has to be very flexible in order to be meaningful. You want 
              to have the capacity to be enlightened in heaven or hell.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> I see what you are saying. It is that we start 
              with gross objects and we dis-embed all the way up to the highest and 
              most subtle strata of mind, and that includes unpleasant, pleasant, 
              hellish, heaven-like, all along the way.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> That’s right. And as it happens, most of the 
              hellish situations are fairly low on the range. By the time you get into
               the higher strata of mind, they are all heavenly. For example, I teach 
              the five suddhavasa jhanas, which are above the eight jhanas that are 
              normally spoken about and are available to Third Path [of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_enlightenment">Four 
              Stages of Enlightenment</a>] practitioners and higher.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Territory that is very far from where I am! So, 
              for me, it is such an academic topic. It is something I would at least 
              like to have a conceptual understanding of, so that I can figure out 
              which way I want to go in terms of practice.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> There is a story from my own practice that might
               bring it home a little bit. My teacher Bill Hamilton talked about 
              jhanas from the time we first met, and I didn’t really believe—I was not
               sure whether they were quasi-imaginary phenomena. In my own experience,
               the practice did not look like that early on. My mind seemed more of a 
              chaotic jumble.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> I’m right where you are talking about. I have 
              enough confidence in others to feel that, at this point, we are not 
              talking about quasi-imaginary phenomena, but when you see the 
              disagreements [about jhana], you wonder what is going on.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> From my point of view, most of the disagreements
               are just semantic. But I do see what you mean: if people who can 
              supposedly see this stuff don’t even agree on what it looks like, then 
              how does it correspond to objective reality? But what happened for me 
              was that I was on retreat in Malaysia as part of a year-long retreat and
               after a couple of months in Malaysia I got First Path. And on that day I
               could suddenly see these four very discrete states that seemed like 
              rooms in my mind that I could go into.  And the only thing required to 
              go there was to want to go there.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> This point in and of itself seems important. I 
              just heard a dharma talk where someone was saying, you know, “Don’t 
              worry about enlightenment or Nirvana. You do not have to have long-term,
               lofty goals like that. Just practice, and it is okay. Try to get 
              whatever measure of freedom you feel comfortable with.” It was a talk 
              designed to kind of mollify skeptical students who refuse to believe 
              that enlightenment exists. But isn’t it important for people to know 
              that there are actually these Paths and that the qualitative nature of 
              your practice changes when you attain them?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Well, the Buddha sure thought it was important. 
              That is a big part of what he talked about. I think it is very 
              important. What would be the advantage of not telling people what 
              happens? It would be like not telling a child that adulthood is coming. 
              There is a lot to be gained by having a heads-up.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> I did not mean to interrupt. You were in the 
              middle of that. You got First Path, and at that point the jhanas became 
              no longer some abstraction where you had any doubt that…</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> That’s right. The very day that I got First 
              Path, the jhanas just showed up that day. I was able to pick them out. 
              If they arose spontaneously in my practice I could see them happening 
              while I was in them, and I also found that I could jump from one to the 
              other just by inclining the mind toward one or the other. So if I found 
              myself in the first I would say “Well maybe I will just go to the 
              third,” and I would suddenly be in the third. And then I could go to the
               second or the fourth—in any order this could happen. These states have,
               and traditionally are thought of as having, characteristic traits. For 
              example, the first jhana feels to me like quiet exhilaration. The second
               jhana is this deep, gurgling joy. The third jhana is chilled-out bliss,
               and the fourth jhana is equanimity and flow. So once you see that, you 
              can see that there is this fractal relationship, or this nested 
              relationship of jhanas, where each jhana has the aspects of the others 
              contained within it.</p>
              <p>So you can be in the first jhana and you can see the second [jhana] 
              aspect in the first jhana. You can see the deep, gurgling joy aspect of 
              the quiet exhilaration. And I could get—just by turning my mind toward 
              it—I could go into several layers of this. It is a very complex but 
              predictable relationship. I’m talking about this in past tense, but that
               ability has never left. That is a frankly trivial thing to do for me 
              now, to investigate the jhanas in terms of various combinations of 
              aspects.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Is this something that all practitioners who 
              attain First Path, or the majority of them, are able to do? I have seen 
              people on your discussion boards saying, “This is what happened to me. I
               got First Path. I was doing noting practice with no view of jhana 
              particularly, or goal of attaining jhana, and suddenly I discovered 
              access to these new strata of mind.”<br> <strong><br> KF:</strong> It is not unusual for it to happen that way, especially for
               people who have already heard that there is such a thing as jhana. On 
              the other hand, I talk to advanced practitioners who have come up in 
              some other tradition, or in no tradition at all, and already have one or
               more Paths. Yet they don’t recognize jhanas in their experience. And so
               I have to just take them through it from the point of view of 
              phenomenology and point out to them that they actually do have access to
               these states, which they did not really even notice.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And is that because they incline the mind only 
              toward the absolute all the time?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Possibly. Or possibly because these states have 
              been invalidated by their teachers.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makyo">Makyo</a>.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yeah. Exactly. In the Zen tradition they are 
              going to say that all of these states are just makyo, and don’t pay any 
              attention to it. If you do that, then you can be a very advanced 
              practitioner and not only not experience jhanas— you can convince 
              yourself that they don’t exist.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And maybe at times people even turn away from, 
              say, pleasant states that are arising—they sense some kind of absorption
               coming on—almost out of a fear of that as makyo or illusion. “This is 
              not what I’m interested in. I’m not interested in any states.”</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Right. And that comes from a misunderstanding of
               what the point of the practice is and how it works. There is a lot of 
              misunderstanding about the practices that actually lead to 
              enlightenment. That is something that I hope to clear up. What leads to 
              developmental enlightenment is the objectification of phenomena. That’s 
              it. [Realization of what is always already here, on the other hand, is 
              not developmental and happens in this moment through surrender.] And it 
              is laughable to me now to think how much I had to go through to get to 
              the point of understanding this. I’d like to clear this up for people, 
              because there are so many ideas to stumble over.</p>
              <p>Someone might say, “Oh, the most important thing is to become 
              absorbed in jhanas.” Well, actually that is about 180 degrees away from 
              the most important thing.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> You’re just embedded in a subtle stratum?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes. To be absorbed is to be embedded. The human
               mind allows us a vast range of experience. To get enlightened, we have 
              to access and objectify the entire range, and in order to access some 
              strata of mind you have to have a high degree of concentration because 
              that is what allows you to get to these subtle states. But to become 
              absorbed in them is the opposite of objectifying them. So what has to be
               done is, you have to be able to both access these strata of mind and 
              objectify them.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Someone on your discussion boards said something
               to the effect of, “let’s dispense with this myth of concentration.” I’m
               wondering what he was talking about?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> What he was talking about was this notion that 
              is coming either from certain jhana teachers or it is coming from 
              certain students who misunderstand what those teachers are saying—I’m 
              not sure which—that achieving some arbitrary level of absorption is 
              crucial to the path. That is a complete misunderstanding. We just need 
              to reframe the whole discussion here.</p>
              <p>The entire mind, the entire range of phenomena, has to be 
              objectified, and in order to do that you have got to access every 
              stratum of the mind. In order to do that, you have got to have a certain
               level of concentration, actually quite a high level of concentration. 
              Now that says nothing about sitting in one place, becoming absorbed in 
              pleasant states. And so anyone who is saying that there is a 
              prerequisite for enlightenment that includes sitting in one place as a 
              static jhana yogi, being absorbed in pleasant states for some period of 
              hours—that person is just flat wrong.</p>
              <p>Jhana is not a big deal.  We have got to stop taking it out of our 
              experience and making it special. Jhana is very natural and will happen 
              and does happen to anyone who gets even First Path. The fact that people
               are getting to First Path and only then understanding what jhana is—I 
              don’t know how much clearer it could be–this proves that it isn’t 
              necessary to achieve some arbitrary level of mastery over jhana before 
              getting First Path.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> You can see why the crucial distinction is 
              dis-embedding, and isn’t dis-embedding just another way of saying 
              vipassana.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes. Vipassana is objectification, and 
              objectification instantly leads to dis-embedding.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> But if you do not really have a clear 
              understanding of what you’re doing…for example when I was a college 
              student and I started doing raja yoga, the teacher said “Meditation is 
              about absorption.”</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Ha!</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> These were Indian graduate students, pretty 
              serious meditators who I’m sure were getting into deep absorption 
              states, but there was no explicit understanding of the need to 
              investigate those states or to dis-embed from them, at least that I 
              could see. So at one meeting a person stood up and was just like “I do 
              not know what has happened. What is going on? My meditation has left 
              me.” He was just so agitated because he was probably hitting one of 
              these stages.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes. So look what happened there. That person 
              was probably investigating his experience and actually making progress. 
              He had probably entered one of these unstable states, which happen after
               some of the stable states. (Stable and unstable layers of mind 
              alternate or are sandwiched in-between each other in the lower levels. 
              Later on in the higher levels, they are all stable.) But the point is, 
              if you are in stable states in the first three jhanas and then suddenly 
              you get into the unstable states, developmentally, between the third 
              jhana and the fourth, you might be very tempted—and let’s face it, most 
              people do have this experience of saying, “Oh my meditation used to be 
              so good and now it has all gone to hell.”</p>
              <p>Unless your teacher understands how these stages line up 
              developmentally, you could get some really bad advice. Your teacher 
              might say, “Oh no, you are doing it wrong. You have to do this to get 
              back to stability.” That is not true. You are doing it right and if you 
              continue on, accepting the instability and becoming free within what now
               appears to be a hell realm—that is the way forward.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> OK, so we have the one extreme view of somehow 
              absorption for its own sake having value. And then you have this other 
              view that seems to be predominant, and you can see why it arose, which 
              has to do with extreme suspicion of anything related to this stuff: 
              jhana, concentration practices. So I guess the flaw there is you have 
              all of these subtle strata of mind that people are saying “Don’t even 
              pay attention to this. Don’t dis-embed from it,” and if you don’t 
              recognize its existence you cannot, by definition, dis-embed. So there 
              is the danger of becoming attached to pleasant states, yes, but there is
               also the unrecognized danger in not being able to dis-embed from those 
              states.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> That’s right. Pleasant states are not the 
              problem at all. The problem is being embedded. You can be just as 
              embedded in pleasant states as you can be in unpleasant states. It is 
              very common for us to be embedded in anxiety and anger and various 
              hell-realm phenomena. And it is frankly not so common for us to be 
              embedded in the pleasant states of jhana because most people do not have
               access to those states.</p>
              <p>But once we get this main idea that embeddedness itself is the 
              problem, irrespective of the state, we have solved it, conceptually. Now
               in order to actually get enlightened, we have to take that knowledge 
              and apply it, and actually do it—actually objectify things and 
              dis-embed. But once you know that your job is to objectify and 
              dis-embed, it doesn’t matter what the state is. So you work all day long
               to objectify phenomena in daily life and when you’re sitting, you go 
              deep and you objectify phenomena at more subtle levels. It just so 
              happens that when you sit your mind often quiets down and you access 
              subtler states, which also have to be objectified.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Wow. Well that is very clear.</p>
