However, the wife scolded him for sitting and dirting the sofa set.  already very unlucky liao, some more get scolding. i kind of feel sorry for him.<br><br>kind of think of it, our enviroment lack loving kindness and care. added with stress in work. double the unhappiness.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

I personally feel that creating merits should be secondary to our intention, and we should act on compassion towards the receiving party.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Do u think you are morally obligated to be a happy person ?</strong></blockquote>No, we are not morally obliged to be happy because being happy is an individual choice.  But you definitely have happiness when you have compassion and have rightful thoughts (ie. managing your desires).  If you could eradicate the negative thoughts, you'll be happy.</div>

However if we are attached to the fruits of the actions, or the act itself, then it cannot be considered as Merits anymore. Real Merits come from Dharmakaya, it comes from spontaneity and naturalness, non-arising is 'Gong', non-cessation is 'De'. Therefore my taiwanese teacher said - to an enlightened person, everything he does creates merits.<br><br>My Shi Fu, Master Shen Kai says - <span style="font-style: italic;">Merits are consequences of the non-orignation and non-cessation of the mind. During the Tang Dynasty in ancient China, Emperor Liang Wu-Ti asked the patriarch Bodhidharma, "Venerable One, I have built many monasteries for the well being of the Sangha and I have also performed many virtuous deeds. What merits have I accumulated? Bodhidharma answered, "You have no merits." Why is that so? It is because when Emperor Liang Wu-Ti performed those acts of giving, he was attached to them. Thus, even though he had performed many virtuous deeds, because he had not cultivated the purity of his mind, he did not attain "non-origination and non-cessation". Therefore, his actions can only be considered as cultivation of blessings, not merits. Without liberation there are no merits. On the other hand, when there is liberation, all virtuous deeds will reap merits.</span><br><br>More info that can also be found in Platform Sutra, Chapter 3, Q&amp;A answered by the 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng.<br><br>Furthermore... if we give with expectations of getting something in return, it can only be called 'Leaking Blessings', and the results is very little compared to true merits.</div>

If you can't recognise this truth, you can't proceed on to cultivate.  To appreciate this problem, you need to seek awakening.  This is the basic of Buddhadharma, the lifeline of Ch'an.   No matter which technique of  Ch'an you've chose to undertake, they arosed because of this problem.
