In fact, when Germany conquered back Austria, Britain and France were preparing a punitive expedition to bring Germany back into line. So Hitler knew that Germany had to become stronger and Germany must wage a total war to keep its status quo. There was no correct choice once Hitler started the rearmament program for Germany's defence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Excerpted from Wiki:<br><br><strong>After the world war one, the allies imposed a series of peace treaties on the defeated Central Powers. The 1919 Versailles Treaty ended the war with Germany. Germany was kept under a food blockade until it signed the treaty, which declared that Germany (and Austria) were responsible for the war and therefore had to pay all its costs. The treaty required Germany to pay enormous annual cash reparations, based on factors including the value of a soldier's life, which it did by borrowing from the United States, until reparations were suspended in 1931. The Â“Guilt ThesisÂ” became controversial in Britain and the United States. It caused enormous bitterness in Germany, which nationalist movements, especially the Nazis, exploited in the 1920s. (See Dolchstosslegende). Due to this treaty, one of the worst economic collapses in history took place in Germany, resulting in widespread famine, and inflation.</strong><br><br>According to my history teacher,if Britain and France hasn't gone too far in exploiting Germany in this treaty, world war II could be avoided.<br><br>In buddhism point of view, the three poisons are the main causes of negative karma and sufferings.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you might want to read on "aryan" before saying that the jews are traitors who did not contribute to germany. The truth is that hitler is pretty much messed up in his head, germany's army was strong due its generals rather than hitler. in fact, he sealed the fate of the war pretty much by giving stupid orders that serve no purpose, for example, hitler ordered to build more fighters-bombers instead of interceptors when germany clearly has the upper hand in aerojet technology.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hitler and many such people thereof are at the ethnocentric level of consciousness.<br><br>There are several stages of consciousness and one usually progresses as they age until a certain level (but this stops at different stages for different people, or it may be impeded by a pathology, and also usually one does not reach transpersonal levels unless one has done spiritual practises, with a few exceptions)<br><br><blockquote>What Is Enlightenment Magazine<br>Evolving Worldviews, Expanding Self<br><br>Although the spectrum of consciousness includes twelve colors to denote<br>twelve specific levels, stages, structures, or waves of development, for<br>ease of explanation Wilber often uses a simpler, three- or four level scheme<br>pioneered by developmental psychologists like Lawrence Kohlberg and Carol<br>Gilligan. Tracing the most general contours of psychological growth, this<br>scheme highlights the fact that increasing consciousness corresponds to a<br>broadening of worldviews and an expansion of one's sense of self.<br><br>Egocentric ("me"): A stage characterized by narcissistic self-absorption,<br>bodily needs and desires, emotional outbursts, unsocialized impulses, and an<br>incapacity to take the role of the "other"; seen today predominantly in<br>infants and young children, rebellious teens, wild rock stars, and<br>criminals. (Infrared to red)<br><br>Ethnocentric ("us"): An expansion of self-identity to include one's family,<br>peers, tribe, race, faith group, or nation; the adoption of socially<br>conformist rules and roles; commonly seen in children aged seven to<br>adolescence, religious myths and fundamentalism, the . ,'moral majority,"<br>Nazis, the KKK, right-wing politics, patriotism, sports teams, school<br>rivalries. (Amber)<br><br>Worldcentric ("all of us"): An even greater expansion of self to embrace all<br>people, regardless of race, gender, class, or creed; a stage of rationality<br>that questions rigid belief systems and transcends conventional rules and<br>roles; commonly seen in late adolescence, social activism, multiculturalism,<br>science, moral relativism, liberal politics, the "global village," New Age<br>spirituality; the emergence of integral cognition. (Orange to teal)<br><br>Kosmocentric ("all that is"): An identification with all life and<br>consciousness, human or otherwise, and a deeply felt responsibility for the<br>evolutionary process as a whole; "superintegral" cognition and values;<br>innate universal morality; spirituality beyond merely personal motivations;<br>an emergent capacity, rarely seen anywhere. (Turquoise to clear light)<br>------------------------------------------------------------<br>WILBER: Now these stages, which we also call structures or levels, show up<br>in all human beings, so we have to take them into account. One of the real<br>problems is that you can have a spiritual experience Â– a profound taste of<br>emptiness, or pure nonduality, or absolute oneness, or radiant, luminous<br>absolute bliss/love Â– and when you come out of that experience or even while<br>you're in it, you'll interpret it according to the level or stage you're at.<br>The evidence for this is now just overwhelming.<br><br>So understanding stages is the first piece of the puzzle. The second piece<br>is states of consciousness. States of consciousness generally tend to come<br>and go; they are temporary. The natural/meditative ones are waking (gross),<br>dreaming (subtle), deep steep (causal), witnessing, and nondual. And then<br>there are nonordinary states, such as drunken states and stoned states. And<br>you can have any of these state experiences at virtually any level or stage<br>you're at. You can be at any level and have a waking, dreaming, or deep<br>steep state. You can be at any level and experience a meditative state. You<br>can be at any Level and actually go through Zen training. What's so<br>astonishing is that a Nazi can complete Zen training. That's the point Â–<br>states can be experienced at any stage you're at.<br>[End Quote]</blockquote>Those interested to read more should grab the book 'A Brief History of Everything' by Ken Wilber from bookstores or library.

My article is based off DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria which easily exposes Ken Wilber's book as being illogical. If you should know, SPD is not some dark part of a person's psyche or conciousness but a part of a person's normal life. A SPD sufferer is not egocentric as described by Ken Wilbur but dislikes company of people and the joys of life which can also mean that this person is enlightened.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Herzog_Zwei:<br><br>AEN, you read up my article on SPD and yet you claim Ken Wilber's book is being accurate. My article is based off DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria which easily exposes Ken Wilber's book as being illogical. If you should know, SPD is not some dark part of a person's psyche or conciousness but a part of a person's normal life. A SPD sufferer is not egocentric as described by Ken Wilbur but dislikes company of people and the joys of life which can also mean that this person is enlightened.</blockquote>No, Ken Wilber did not say anything about schizoid being a egocentric pathology. I added that part which I think is a possibility, although it might be completely wrong. Also I am not saying that a person with such pathologies are completely egocentric but are influenced by it because certain parts of his consciousness development gets into problems or some part of his 'self' gets stuck somewhere... and many forms of psychotic disorders are linked to this.<br><br>Usually a pathology happens when a person starts to transcend a previous stage of consciousness but during that process something wrong happened with one of the steps and this causes a pathology.<br><br>Egocentric does not necessarily have to mean a dark part of one's psyche but more like a worldview and perspective of things, and a part of an individual's development of consciousness which progresses as they age. This usually isn't a problem until something goes wrong in an individual's development and turns into a pathology.</div>
