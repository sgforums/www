              <p>Night after lights switch off, light appear for seconds.    Saw a block of light shining next to my bed.   Will be glad if any buddhists practising buddhism will help me know what buddhism say about this.  Puzzles me a lot.     </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Witnessing “light orbs” are subject to many interpretations.<span>  </span>In photography, it is common to explain it as an artefact of water droplets on the lens, filter or window that the cameras shot through.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">While many Buddhists wish to believe there were miraculous phenomena associated with sightings of lights, so that they may develop some faith in their religion, I think that the interpretations of such images were nonetheless very much misinterpreted.<span>  </span>It is not my intention to disparage anyone for their devotion to their religion/beliefs, however, too often, people are quick to seek the miraculous and may interpret every day phenomena as miracle, even though it may not be.<span>  </span>For example, when one look at the clouds and see images formed, no one would react or think it is special if the clouds look like some animal figures but if it looks like some deity, there is a tendency to misinterpret it and some may even perceive it as miraculous phenomena.<span>  </span>Changes in temperature, sunlight and water vapour, etc. may cause all these to happen in the sky.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Although I am a skeptic, I am willing to believe what you have seen because I have experienced it.<span>  </span>It was not rounded luminous orbs though but a yellowish white light about 2 inch thick and 8 inch long, shining down 45 degrees on the Sakyamuni Buddha while I was doing my daily practice, in the morning.<span>  </span>I was not meditating at this point but was chanting mantras and doing my usual prostrations.<span>  </span>This happens just a few seconds and too short for me to grab my camera to capture this brief occurrence. Usually, you don’t get to see it the second time after it happens each time. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However, in my case, there isn’t any clap of thunder as <span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 11pt;     '>shared <span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 11pt;     '>by </span></span>someone I personally know from her personal experience.<span>  </span>In her case, she witnessed the “Buddha’s Light”, which was a round, huge and luminous ball, followed by a clap of thunder, in a few seconds, in mid-afternoon. She was washing dishes when it appeared in front of her, not in any meditation session though.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Very beautiful sight indeed! Inspiring but I have to agree with Aik TC that such sightings should not be regarded as a sign of some supramundane attainment and as such I personally do not regard it significant and did not let any such phenomena affect my daily practice.<span>  </span>I believe the miraculous is possible even though it may be difficult to prove the authenticity of these phenomena.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">My advice is, continue diligently with your daily practice, with the right motivation and correct understanding of the fundamentals of the Buddhist path to enlightenment [i.e. renunciation, bodhicitta and the correct view of emptiness], come what may.</span></p>
