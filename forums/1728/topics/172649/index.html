            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ratana Sutta is a very powerful Sutta spoken by Buddha Himself 2548 years ago...If u wanna know more about this Sutta, please refer to the following website: </strong><br><br>http://www.samadhi-buddhist.com/Ratana%20Sutta.pdf#search='ratana%20sutta'<br><br><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~mpaw1234/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ratanasutta.jpg"><br><br><strong>Introduction: -<br><br>We ask why do Monks and laities recite RATANA SUTTA, since some accept the statement that Buddha gave to Shin Ananda as applicable for both mundane and supramundane concerns? That statement read thus: Buddha taught Ananda to have confidence in our own action and its results, and encourages us to depend on no one but ourselves. This statement was made relevant to the supramundane achievement in the context of instructing Ananda in post parinibbana. Buddha taught us to recite maha paritta sutta when we seek to achieve mundane benefits.  In the case of relieving sickness and famine , Buddha recommended that Ratana Sutta be recited as exemplary, Buddha asked Ananda to recite this Sutta at the city of Vesali that was struck by pestilence. Obviously, we cannot use the statement in this instance:<br><br>"Ã�nanda, be dependent on yourself, take refuge in yourself and not in others, by this mean be dependent on the Dhamma, goes for refuge to the Dhamma -- the righteous principles".<br><br>Buddha said this in the context of supramundane achievement and not meant to be applicable to concerns relating to mundane achievement.  We need external protection either from deva or Brahma or any magical force generated resulting from this recitation. </strong><br></div>

Due to the presence of decaying corpses the evil spirits haunted the city, and led to inevitable pestilence. Plagued by these three perils of famine, devils and pestilence, the Vesalians sought the help of the Buddha who was then dwelling at Rajagaha. Moved by deep compassionate love, Lord Buddha marched to the plagued city of Vesali, followed by hundreds of monks including the Venerable Ananda. No sooner had the Lord arrived at the city, than the torrential rains poured down and swept away the rotting dead bodies. So the city was cleansed and the atmosphere became purified. Then the Buddha delivered the Discourse on Precious Jewels to the Venerable Ananda and instructed him to tour the city reciting the discourse as a means of protection to the citizens of Vesali.<br><br>The Venerable Ananda obeyed the command and sprinkled the holy water from the alms-bowl of the Lord, to banish the evil spirits consequently. And eventually the pestilence subsided.<br><br>Thereafter the Venerable Ananda reported the events promptly to the Lord, who was awaiting his arrival at the City Hall of Vesali. Then again Lord Buddha recited the same discourse and explained the intrinsic value of the text to the assembled disciples. Thus the recitation of the discourse had been delivered by the Lord and accepted by the assembly.<br><br>According to the standard Burmese Version, this discourse is composed of twenty-one blank verses including the introductory prelude. This sutta is usually treated as an example of the virtues of three Precious Jewels or triple gem: namely, Buddha, Dhamma and Samgha.<br><br>RATANA  SUTTA<br><br>Discourse on the Precious Jewels<br><br>25. Observation of all these virtues of the Lord Buddha such as: commencing from the time of his Noble Vow (pledged in the presence of Lord of, to become a Buddha) the Tathagata had fulfilled all the thirty (Paramitas) Perfections, viz: the ten ordinary Perfections, the ten (Upaparamitas) superior Perfections, and the ten (Paramattha Paramitas) supreme Perfections; the five Great Sacrifices; the three modes of Practice, viz: the practice for the welfare of the world, for the welfare of kinsmen and relatives, and for the benefit of his attainment of Buddha hood; and that he had been naturally conceived in his motherÂ’s womb in this last existence; his nativity; the Great Renunciation; the experience of Austerity; the Conquest upon (five types of) Death (Mara) being seated under the Bo tree; the Discernment of Omniscient Wisdom; expounding the sermon of the Rotating of the Wheel of Law (Dhammacakkappavattana sutta);and the nine supramundane laws: Reverend Ananda the Elder, the protective recitation through the three watches of the night, within the three walls of the city of Vesali. Having established such a sympathetic mind as Reverend Ananda did.<br><br>26. The glory of which had been accepted by the deities who have assembled in the hundred thousand crores of universes, and in the city of Vesali,<br><br>27. By the power of which the three types of disasters, that broke out due to epidemic diseases, inhuman beings, and famine were also eradicated promptly, Let us all recite this discourse of protection<br><br>28.With so many beings assembled here both from terrestrial and celestial, all beings have been peaceful and also listen attentively to these words.<br><br>29.Therefore, All listen closely. Radiate loving-kindness to your fellow beings. By day and by night, to those that bring offerings to you, protect them well with diligence.<br><br>.<br><br>30. Whatever treasure there is either here or in the world beyond; whatever precious jewel there is in the heavenly abodes; none is there equal to the Perfect One. This precious jewel (holiness) is the Enlightened One (Buddha). By this assessment of the Truth, may there be the perfect bliss.<br><br>31. That Cessation, Detachment, and holy Immortality has been realized by the perfectly meditated Sakyan-Sage. There is no equal ideal to this Dhamma. This holy jewel indeed lies in the Dhamma.  By this assessment of the Truth, may there be the perfect bliss.<br><br>32.The concentration (samdhi) in the purest leads one to enlightenment and thus is supreme; it is also supreme among all the worldly wealth.  By this assessment of the Truth may there be the perfect bliss.<br><br>33. The eight noble persons are inscribed by holy men; and they constituted four pairs, they are the disciples of the Sublime Lord worthy of offerings. Gifts offered to them yield rich results. This holy jewel, indeed lies in the Sangha. By this assessment of the Truth may there be the perfect bliss.<br><br>34.Striving well with a steadfast mind, they are liberated during the Dispensation of Gotama Buddha. They have attained the highest state, having encountered the Immortality. They enjoy the Perfect Peace that they obtained without obligation. This precious jewel (holiness) is in the Sangha. By this assessment of the truth may there be the perfect bliss.<br><br>35.Like a post deep planted in the earth stands unshaken by the winds blast from four quarters. So also I declare the righteous man is unshaken who sees the Noble Truths through discriminating wisdom. This precious jewel (holiness) is in the Sangha. By this assessment of the Truth, may there be the perfect bliss.<br><br>36. Those who developed the Noble Truths well expounded by the Lord of Profound Wisdom even though they may be exceedingly heedless; Still they do not take an eighth existence (in the realm of Kama bhumi). This precious jewel (holiness) is in the Sangha. By this assessment of the Truth may there be the perfect bliss<br><br>37. Simultaneously with his accomplishment of Insight Three mental aspects are abandoned namely individualism, doubt, and Indulgence in futile rites and rituals, and other defilements if there be any.<br><br>38. He is also emancipated from the four states of deprivation. And can no more commit the six major sins. This precious jewel (holiness) is in the sangha.  By this assessment of the Truth may there be the perfect bliss<br><br>39. Though he may still do evil deed physically, verbally or mentally yet he cannot conceal it. Since it has been promulgated that such concealing is impossible for one who has seen the Path, this precious jewel (holiness) is in the Sangha By this assessment of the Truth may there be the perfect bliss<br><br>.<br><br>40.Just like (the glory of) the woodland groves crowned with blossoms in the early heat of the warm summer month, even so the glory of the sublime (Dhamma) principle was expounded for the supreme prosperity leading towards Nibbana. This precious jewel (holiness) is in the Buddha. By this assessment of the Truth may there be the perfect bliss<br><br>41. The Glorious One, who knows the glory, delivers the glory, brings the glory and is the peerless, expounded the glorious principle. This precious jewel (holiness) is in the Buddha. By this asseveration of the Truth may there be the perfect bliss.<br><br>42. Their former (kamma) is exhausted and the new one arises no more. The lust for future becoming is detached. The seed germ (of rebirth) has exhausted and they have no more desire to grow. As this lamp-flame extinguishes away, the wise men pass away (into Nibbana). This precious jewel (holiness) is in the Sangha. By this assessment of the Truth may there be the perfect bliss.<br><br>43. All beings that are assembled here, so be they terrestrial (earthly) or celestial, (heavenly) come, let us worship the Buddha; (the Perfect One), whom do gods and men honor. May they enjoy the perfect bliss.<br><br>44. All beings that are assembled here so be they terrestrial (earthly) or celestial (heavenly) come, let us worship the Dhamma (Teaching); (the Perfect One) which do gods and men honor. May they enjoy the perfect bliss.<br><br>45. All beings that are assembled here, so be they terrestrial (earthly) or celestial, (heavenly) come, let us worship the Sangha (Order) ;(the Perfect One) which is honored by gods and men. May they enjoy the perfect bliss.<br><br>-- Ratana Sutta End --<br><br></div>
