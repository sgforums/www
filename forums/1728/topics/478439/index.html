              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="savatthi">Savatthi</a> in Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha">Anathapindika's monastery</a>. Then <a id="subha">Subha</a> the student, <a id="todeyya">Todeyya's son</a>,
               went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings 
              with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he 
              sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: 
              "Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness 
              &amp; excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race? For 
              short-lived &amp; long-lived people are to be seen, sickly &amp; 
              healthy, ugly &amp; beautiful, uninfluential &amp; influential, poor 
              &amp; rich, low-born &amp; high-born, stupid &amp; discerning people are
               to be seen. So what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness 
              &amp; excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race?"</p>
              <p>"Student, beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, 
              related through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what
               creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness &amp; 
              refinement."</p>
              <p>"I don't understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's statement
               spoken in brief without explaining the detailed meaning. It would be 
              good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I might understand 
              the detailed meaning of his brief statement."</p>
              <p>"In that case, student, listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
              <p>"As you say, Master Gotama," Subha the student responded.</p>
              <p><a id="kill">The Blessed One said</a>: "There is the case, student, 
              where a woman or man is a killer of living beings, brutal, 
              bloody-handed, given to killing &amp; slaying, showing no mercy to 
              living beings. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on
               the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of
               deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, hell. If, on the 
              break-up of the body, after death — instead of reappearing in the plane 
              of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, hell — he/she 
              comes to the human state, then he/she is short-lived wherever reborn. 
              This is the way leading to a short life: to be a killer of living 
              beings, brutal, bloody-handed, given to killing &amp; slaying, showing 
              no mercy to living beings.</p>
              <p>"But then there is the case where a woman or man, having abandoned 
              the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living beings, and 
              dwells with the rod laid down, the knife laid down, scrupulous, 
              merciful, &amp; sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings. 
              Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up 
              of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination, in the
               heavenly world. If, on the break-up of the body, after death — instead 
              of reappearing in a good destination, in the heavenly world — he/she 
              comes to the human state, then he/she is long-lived wherever reborn. 
              This is the way leading to a long life: to have abandoned the killing of
               living beings, to abstain from killing living beings, to dwell with 
              one's rod laid down, one's knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, &amp; 
              sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings.</p>
              <p>"There is the case where a woman or man is one who harms beings with 
              his/her fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives. Through having 
              adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, 
              after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation... If instead 
              he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is sickly wherever reborn. 
              This is the way leading to sickliness: to be one who harms beings with 
              one's fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives.</p>
              <p>"But then there is the case where a woman or man is not one who harms
               beings with his/her fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives. 
              Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up 
              of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination... If 
              instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is healthy wherever
               reborn. This is the way leading to health: not to be one who harms 
              beings with one's fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives.</p>
              <p>"There is the case, where a woman or man is ill-tempered &amp; easily
               upset; even when lightly criticized, he/she grows offended, provoked, 
              malicious, &amp; resentful; shows annoyance, aversion, &amp; bitterness.
               Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up 
              of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of 
              deprivation... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she 
              is ugly wherever reborn. This is the way leading to ugliness: to be 
              ill-tempered &amp; easily upset; even when lightly criticized, to grow 
              offended, provoked, malicious, &amp; resentful; to show annoyance, 
              aversion, &amp; bitterness.</p>
              <p>"But then there is the case where a woman or man is not ill-tempered 
              or easily upset; even when heavily criticized, he/she doesn't grow 
              offended, provoked, malicious, or resentful; doesn't show annoyance, 
              aversion, or bitterness. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such 
              actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a
               good destination... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then 
              he/she is beautiful wherever reborn. This is the way leading to beauty: 
              not to be ill-tempered or easily upset; even when heavily criticized, 
              not to be offended, provoked, malicious, or resentful; nor to show 
              annoyance, aversion, &amp; bitterness.</p>
              <p>"There is the case where a woman or man is envious. He/she envies, 
              begrudges, &amp; broods about others' gains, honor, respect, reverence, 
              salutations, &amp; veneration. Through having adopted &amp; carried out 
              such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears
               in the plane of deprivation... If instead he/she comes to the human 
              state, then he/she is not influential wherever reborn. This is the way 
              leading to not being influential: to be envious, to envy, begrudge, 
              &amp; brood about others' gains, honor, respect, reverence, salutations,
               &amp; veneration.</p>
              <p>"But then there is the case where a woman or man is not envious. 
              He/she does not envy, begrudge, or brood about others' gains, honor, 
              respect, reverence, salutations, or veneration. Through having adopted 
              &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after 
              death, he/she reappears in a good destination... If instead he/she comes
               to the human state, he/she is influential wherever reborn. This is the 
              way leading to being influential: not to be envious; not to envy, 
              begrudge, or brood about others' gains, honor, respect, reverence, 
              salutations, or veneration.</p>
              <p>"There is the case where a woman or man is not a giver of food, 
              drink, cloth, sandals, garlands, scents, ointments, beds, dwellings, or 
              lighting to brahmans or contemplatives. Through having adopted &amp; 
              carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death 
              he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation... If instead he/she comes 
              to the human state, he/she is poor wherever reborn. This is the way 
              leading to poverty: not to be a giver of food, drink, cloth, sandals, 
              garlands, scents, ointments, beds, dwellings, or lighting to brahmans or
               contemplatives.</p>
              <p>"But then there is the case where a woman or man is a giver of food, 
              drink, cloth, sandals, scents, ointments, beds, dwellings, &amp; 
              lighting to brahmans &amp; contemplatives. Through having adopted &amp; 
              carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, 
              he/she reappears in a good destination... If instead he/she comes to the
               human state, then he/she is wealthy wherever reborn. This is the way 
              leading to great wealth: to be a giver of food, drink, cloth, sandals, 
              garlands, scents, ointments, beds, dwellings, &amp; lighting to brahmans
               &amp; contemplatives.</p>
              <p>"There is the case where a woman or man is obstinate &amp; arrogant. 
              He/she does not pay homage to those who deserve homage, rise up for 
              those for whom one should rise up, give a seat to those to whom one 
              should give a seat, make way for those for whom one should make way, 
              worship those who should be worshipped, respect those who should be 
              respected, revere those who should be revered, or honor those who should
               be honored. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on 
              the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of 
              deprivation... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she 
              is low-born wherever reborn. This is the way leading to a low birth: to 
              be obstinate &amp; arrogant, not to pay homage to those who deserve 
              homage, nor rise up for... nor give a seat to... nor make way for... nor
               worship... nor respect... nor revere... nor honor those who should be 
              honored.</p>
              <p>"But then there is the case where a woman or man is not obstinate or 
              arrogant; he/she pays homage to those who deserve homage, rises up... 
              gives a seat... makes way... worships... respects... reveres... honors 
              those who should be honored. Through having adopted &amp; carried out 
              such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears
               in a good destination... If instead he/she comes to the human state, 
              then he/she is highborn wherever reborn. This is the way leading to a 
              high birth: not to obstinate or arrogant; to pay homage to those who 
              deserve homage, to rise up... give a seat... make way... worship... 
              respect... revere... honor those who should be honored.</p>
              <p>"There is the case where a woman or man when visiting a brahman or 
              contemplative, does not ask: 'What is skillful, venerable sir? What is 
              unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be 
              cultivated? What should not be cultivated? What, having been done by me,
               will be for my long-term harm &amp; suffering? Or what, having been 
              done by me, will be for my long-term welfare &amp; happiness?' Through 
              having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the 
              body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation... If 
              instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she will be stupid 
              wherever reborn. This is the way leading to stupidity: when visiting a 
              brahman or contemplative, not to ask: 'What is skillful?... Or what, 
              having been done by me, will be for my long-term welfare &amp; 
              happiness?'</p>
              <p>"But then there is the case where a woman or man when visiting a

              having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the 
              body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination... If instead 
              he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is discerning wherever 
              reborn. This is the way leading to discernment: when visiting a brahman 
              or contemplative, to ask: 'What is skillful?... Or what, having been 
              done by me, will be for my long-term welfare &amp; happiness?'</p>
              <p>"So, student, the way leading to short life makes people short-lived,
               the way leading to long life makes people long-lived; the way leading 
              to sickliness makes people sickly, the way leading to health makes 
              people healthy; the way leading to ugliness makes people ugly, the way 
              leading to beauty makes people beautiful; the way leading to lack of 
              influence makes people uninfluential, the way leading to influence makes
               people influential; the way leading to poverty makes people poor, the 
              way leading to wealth makes people wealthy; the way leading to low birth
               makes people low-born, the way leading to high birth makes people 
              highborn; the way leading to stupidity makes people stupid, the way 
              leading to discernment makes people discerning.</p>
              <p>Beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, related 
              through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what creates
               distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness &amp; refinement...</p>
              <p>When this was said, Subha the student, Todeyya's son, said to the Blessed One: "<a id="magnif">Magnificent</a>,
               Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what 
              was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who 
              was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could
               see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama — through many lines of 
              reasoning — made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to 
              the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me
               as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day 
              forward, for life."</p>
