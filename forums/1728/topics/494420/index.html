              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">David Dale Holmes Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-08-11 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Venerable Nyanatiloka Mahathera cites the Word of the Buddha
              on the contemplation of feelings (Diga Nikaya 22):</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But how does the disciple dwell in contemplation of the
              feelings?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In experiencing feelings, the disciple knows: “I have an
              agreeable feeling;” or: "I have a disagreeable feeling,” or: "I have
              an indifferent feeling;” or: “I have a worldly agreeable feeling,” or: “I have
              an unworldly agreeable feeling,” or: “I have a worldly disagreeable feeling,”
              or: “I have an unworldly disagreeable feeling,” or: “I have a worldly
              indifferent feeling,” or: “I have an unworldly indifferent feeling.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Thus he dwells in contemplation of the feelings, either with
              regard to his own person, or to other persons, or to both. He beholds how the
              feelings arise; beholds how they pass away; beholds the arising and passing
              away of the feelings. “Feelings are there:” this clear awareness is present in
              him, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness; and he lives independent,
              unattached to anything in the world. Thus does the disciple dwell in
              contemplation of the feelings. (Nyanatiloka 1967, 64–65)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The word “feeling” here indicates how the mind is “disposed”
              when it encounters an object or experience. When a pleasant feeling arises, it
              may arouse greed and desire. An unpleasant feeling may arouse fear, hate, or
              aversion. Neutral feelings may arouse delusion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The secret to this meditation exercise is to look at
              experience and cut off the root of unwholesome volition when it begins to arise
              and interact in feeling. If we just let the mind play in an uncontrolled
              manner, the defilements will exert a role in coloring experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If, however, through mindfulness, we watch an experience as
              it arises and as it passes away, we can catch unwanted kamma and defuse the
              attachment, aversion, or indifference. Through mindfulness we can turn the
              experience back into a bare mental event.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The secret is to learn to let the flow of events arise and
              dissolve without being subjectively involved. When the unwholesome root of
              feeling loses its hold on events, events lose their illusory sense of
              permanence and become part of the impermanent flux of the stream of events.
              With subjective feeling thus suppressed in connection with observation, there
              is no sense of a permanent ego interacting with events. This is what
              non-involvement means. It is the detachment necessary for right mindfulness.
              (For more details see Bhikkhu Bodhi 1984, 45-46)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Venerable Nyanatiloka comments :</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The disciple understands that the expression “I feel” has no
              validity except as a conventional expression . . .; he understands that, in the
              absolute sense (paramattha), there are only feelings, and that there is no ego,
              no experiencer (sic) of the feelings. (Nyanatiloka 1967, 65)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Venerable Nyanaponika Mahathera in his Contemplation of
              Feeling explicates in more precise detail:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Feeling (vedana) is understood as the bare sensation
              experienced as pleasant, unpleasant (painful), or neutral (indifferent). It is
              distinguished from emotion, a more complex phenomena which arises from the
              basic feeling but adds to it various overlays of an evaluative, volitional, and
              cognitive character. Feeling in the Buddhist sense is the second of the five
              aggregates constituting what is conventionally called “a person.” The specific
              factors operative in emotion belong to the aggregate of mental formations
              (sankhara-khandha) the fourth aggregate. . . .</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Feeling arises whenever there is the arising of three
              factors—sense-organ, object, and consciousness. The meeting of these three is
              called . . . sense-impression, contact, or impact (phassa). Sense-impression is
              a mental, not a physical event.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is six-fold, as being conditioned either by one of the
              five physical senses or by the mind. This six-fold sense-impression is the
              chief condition for the corresponding six kinds of feeling borne of contact
              through the five physical senses and of mind contact.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the formula of dependent origination (paticca-samuppada),
              this relationship is expressed by the line, “Sense-impression conditions
              feeling” (passa-paccaya-vedana). When emotions follow, they do so in accordance
              with the next link of dependent origination, “Feeling conditions craving.”
              (vedana-paccaya-tanha). . . .</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Feeling is one of those mental factors (cetasika) common to
              all types of consciousness. In other words, every conscious experience has a
              feeling tone, pleasant, painful, or neutral. . . .</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The subsequent emotional, practical, moral, or spiritual
              values attached to any particular feeling are determined by the associated
              mental factors belonging to the aggregate of mental formations. It is the
              quality of those other mental functions that makes the co-nascent feeling
              either good or bad, noble or low, kammic or non-kammic, mundane or
              supramundane.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Since feeling in its primary state simply registers the
              impact of the object, in itself it is quite devoid of any emotional bias. Only
              when volitional evaluations are admitted will there appear emotions such as
              desire and love, aversion and hate, anxiety and fear, as well as distorting
              views.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But these admixtures need not arise, as the emotions are not
              inseparable parts of the respective feelings. . . .</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This shows that it is . . . possible to stop at the bare
              feeling and that this can be done intentionally with the help of mindfulness
              and self-restraint. . . .</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Through actual experience, it can be confirmed that the
              ever-revolving round of dependent origination can be stopped at the stage of
              feeling, and that there is no inherent necessity for feeling to be followed by
              craving.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Here we encounter feeling as a key factor on the path of
              liberation and we can see why, in the Buddhist tradition, the contemplation of
              feeling has always been highly regarded as an effective aid on the path.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The contemplation of feeling is one or the Four Foundations
              of Mindfulness (satipatthana). As such it may be undertaken in the framework of
              that meditative practice, aiming at the growth of insight (vipassana).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is, however, essential that this contemplation should also
              be remembered and applied in daily life whenever feelings are prone to turn to
              unwholesome emotions. . . . There will be many such occasions, provided the
              mind is alert and calm enough to notice the feelings clearly at their primary
              stage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the contemplation of feelings there should first be a
              mindful awareness of the feelings when they arise. One should clearly
              distinguish them as pleasant, unpleasant (painful), or neutral. There is no
              such thing as “mixed feelings.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mindfulness should be maintained throughout the short duration
              of a specific feeling, down into its cessation. If the vanishing point of
              feelings is repeatedly seen with increasing clarity, it will become much easier
              to forestall the emotions, thoughts, and volitions which normally follow them
              so rapidly and so often become habitually associated with them.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pleasant feeling is habitually linked with enjoyment and
              desire; unpleasant feeling with aversion; neutral feeling with boredom and
              confusion—and also serving as a background for wrong views. But when bare
              attention is directed towards the arising and vanishing feelings, these
              polluting additives will be held at bay. (Nyanaponika 1983, 3–5)</span></p>
