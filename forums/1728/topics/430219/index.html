              <div class="firstPar">
              <p>According to police the 39-year-old victim was 
              trembling with fear when she reached the police station to report the 
              attack on Tuesday afternoon. The monk, 17-year-old Thorn Sophoan, was 
              immediately arrested and defrocked. Police said that he has confessed to
               the crime.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>"While the monk was 
              guiding the British woman to see caves on the top of Phnom Sam Pov 
              mountain, he raped her," the local police chief Mey Chhengly said.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>The
               victim reportedly told the monk that she did not want a guide but he 
              insisted on following her anyway. The attack took place in Battambang 
              province in the north west of Cambodia.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>The
               victim's right leg was injured as she attempted to fight off her 
              attacker, who also stole her money, camera and mobile telephone.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buddhist monks in Cambodia are frequently accused of sexual assaults.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p>This week two other monks were arrested for allegedly raping two teenagers in a school classroom.</p>
              <p>In
               January a monk was arrested for allegedly molesting an 8-year-old 
              French girl at the famous Angkor ruins and in August a monk was arrested
               and defrocked after being accused of the rape and murder of a 
              10-year-old child.</p>
              <p>There is also a problem with fake monks, who 
              police say deceive the public into giving alms or disguise themselves as
               holy men before committing crimes such as armed robbery.</p>
              <p>"Buddhism
               educates monks to have physical, verbal and mental purity," said Nun 
              Nget, supreme patriarch of the Mohanikaya Buddhist sect in Cambodia. 
              "[Such crimes] heavily affect our religion, which is why it is necessary
               to defrock bad monks."</p>
              <p>Thorn Sophoan had been a monk for only a 
              few days month before he was arrested. Many young Cambodians become 
              monks for short periods of time without necessarily devoting their lives
               to the clergy. They could be briefly ordained to show gratitude to 
              their parents, honour a dead relative, or study Buddhism.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Luckily last year when in Thailand, i rejected monk advice when he pointed me to some "black Temple" which said to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tourist spot.    God knows wats waiting for me there!<br></span></strong></p>

              <p>The last  paragraph tell the whole story. The monks they are referring to actually not the ordained monks but short term "monks" which are not out of their own will but rather it is their custom that they must be a monk for a short period of time.</p>
              <p>In poor countries, many become monks or their parents send them to the temples to become monks because their parents cannot afford to raise them.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thorn Sophoan had been a monk for only a few days month before he was arrested. Many young Cambodians become monks for short periods of time without necessarily devoting their lives to the clergy. They could be briefly ordained to show gratitude to their parents, honour a dead relative, or study Buddhism.</span></p>
