Have a mentality of acceptance of the inevitable situation helps. Learn to make the best out of the situation.<br><br>Usually a person who have depression &amp; psychosis do not reveal others their problems and tend to think too much which lead to misuse of their own imagination {worry}.Sometime it's due to chemcial imbalance in the brain, it better to consult a professional doctor/psychologist to seek help.<br><br>sometime, in this kind of battle, u can't really fight alone cos u will get entangled with your own negative emotion and can't see the facts clearly. Try to communicate your problems if you haven't or read up postive self-helping books.. or dharma books or books written by sangha.. ect etc<br><br>Be more thankful that you can see, hear, talk and walk while some physically and mentally handicapped can't. I have been to a home of severe physically and mentally handicapped. Trust me, we are considered very much lucky than them. I have also known some blind people who are more cheerful then me, whom give the heartiest laugh i have ever seen, who amazingly possess a cheerful and strong disposition despite their handicapped. i once read a guy who lose both legs who manage to conquer mountain everest.<br><br>Attending dharma talks or reading 'power of now' help prevent depression and lighten some sufferings cos enlightened teachers in dharma talk give very wise teachings.<br><br>My past experience in my own 'personal suffering', buddhism helps to alleviate my own sufferings at a certain stage of my life, that is when i start learn to learn more about buddhism, broaden my understanding and starting to integrate some aspects of buddhism teachings into my life. If you are keen to change the way u see the world, or how the world see u, start to change within yourself and the rest will happen.<br><br>Some people cultivate through different ways. There are 84000 dharma doors. Some chant to gain peace. Some meditate.<br><br>Some snap out of their depressed mood by taking things easy and a postive mental attitude. Start today by being be cheerful, making someone their day, live as if today is ur last days, always encourage urself when you are down and never give-up.. =)<br><br>Cheerz..<br><br></div>

To suffer is not enough. Please don't be imprisoned by your suffering. If you have experienced hunger, you know that having food is a miracle.

Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry - all forms of fear - are caused by to much future, not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, not enough presence.<br><br>Most people find it difficulty to believe that a state of consciousness totally free of all negativity is possible. And yet this is the liberated state to which all spiritual teachings point. It is the promise of salvation, not in an illusory future by right here and now.<br><br>You may find it hard to recognise that time is the cause of your suffering or your problems. You believe that they are caused by specific situations in your life, and seen from a conventional viewpoint, this is true. But until you have dealt with the basic problem-making dysfunction of the mind - its attachment to past and future and denial of the Now - problems are actually interchangeable. If all your problems or perceived causes of suffering or unhappiness were miraculously removed for your today, but you had not become more present, more conscious, you would soon find yourself with a similar set of problems or causes of suffering, like a shadow that follows you wherever you go. Ultimately, there is only one problem: the time-bound mind itself.<br><br>I cannot believe that I could ever reach a point where I am complete free of my problems.<br><br>You are right. You can never reach that point because you are at that point now.<br><br>There is no salvation in time. You cannot be free in the future. Presence is the key to freedom, so you can only be free now.<br><br>Finding The Life Underneath Your Life Situation<br><br>I don't see how I can be free now. As it happens, I am extremely unhappy with my life at the moment. This is a fact, and I would be deluding myself if I tried to convince myself that all is well when it definitely isn't. To me the present moment is very unhappy; it is not liberating at all. What keeps me going is the hope or possibility of some improvement in the future.<br><br>You think that your attention is in the present moment when it's actually taken up completely by time. You cannot be both unhappy and fully present in the Now.<br><br>What you refer to as your "life" should be more accurately be called your "life situation." It is psychological time: past and future. Certain things in the past didn't go the way you wanted them to go. You are still resisting what happened in the past, and now you are resisting the is. Hope is what keeps you going, but hope keeps you focused on the future, and this continued focus perpetuates your denial of the Now and therefore your unhappiness.<br><br>It is true that my present life situation is the result of things that happened in the past, but it is still my present situation, and being stuck in it is what makes me unhappy.<br><br>Forget about your life situation for a while and pay attention to your life<br><br>What is the difference?<br><br>Your life situation exists in time.<br><br>Your life is now.<br>Your life situation is mind-stuff.<br>Your life is real.<br><br>Find the "narrow gate that leads to life." It is called the Now. Narrow your life down to this moment. Your life situation may be full of problems - most life situations are - but find out if you have any problem at this moment. Not tomorrow or in ten minutes, but now. Do you have a problem now?<br><br>When you are full of problems, there is no room for anything new to enter, no room for a solution. So whenever you can, make some room, create some space, so that you find the life underneath your life situation.<br><br>Use your senses fully. Be where you are. Look around. Just look, don't interpret. See the lights, shapes, colours, textures. Be aware of the silent presence of each thing. Be aware of the space that allows everything to be. Listen to the sounds; don't judge them. Listen to the silence underneath the sounds. Touch something - anything - and feel and acknowledge its Being. Observe the rhythm of your breathing; feel the air flowing in and out, feel the life energy inside your body. Allow everything to be, within and without. Allow the "isness" of all things. Move deeply into the Now.<br><br>You are leaving behind the deadening world of mental abstraction of time. You are getting out of the insane mind that is draining you of life energy, just as it is slowly poisoning and destroying the Earth. You are awakening out of the dream of time into the Present.<br><br>[Pause and meditate]<br><br></strong><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Jesus did say not to worry abt tomorrow &amp; to forgive the past hurts &amp; to live in the NOW.</div>

Either He is a mad man or He is a liar or He is really God &amp; Saviour. You can't treat Him anywhere in b/w or as a great teacher or enlightened bodhisattva etc.</div>

The Dalai Lama seemed at ease with the questioning, even while admitting that this was possibly the toughest area for exploration between evangelical Christians and Buddhists.<br><br>I reminded him of his belief that Jesus is "a fully enlightened being" and asked, "If Jesus is fully enlightened, wouldn't he be teaching the truth about himself? Therefore, if he is teaching the truth, then he is the Son of God, and there is a God, and Jesus is the Savior. If he is fully enlightened, he should teach the truth. If he is not teaching the truth, he is not that enlightened."<br><br>As the Dalai Lama felt the momentum of the question, he laughed more than at any other time in the interview. He obviously understood the argument, borrowed from C. S. Lewis' Mere Christianity.<br><br>"This is a very good question," he said. "This is very, very important, very important." Even in Buddha's case, he said, a distinction must always be made between teachings that "always remain valid" and others that "we have the liberty to reject."<br><br>He argued that the Buddha knew people were not always ready for the higher truth because it "wouldn't suit, wouldn't help." Therefore, lesser truths are sometimes taught because of the person's ignorance or condition. This is known in Buddhist dharma as the doctrine of uppayah, or 'skillful means.' The Dalai Lama then applied this to the question about Jesus.<br><br>"Jesus Christ also lived previous lives," he said. "So, you see, he reached a high state, either as a Bodhisattva, or an enlightened person, through Buddhist practice or something like that. Then, at a certain period, certain era, he appeared as a new master, and then because of circumstances, he taught certain views different from Buddhism, but he also taught the same religious values as I mentioned earlier: Be patient, tolerant, compassionate. This is, you see, the real message in order to become a better human being." He said that there was absolutely no lying involved since Jesus' motivation was to help people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My personal favourite gospel is Gospel of Thomas. I personally do believe that there are higher teachings taught by Jesus Christ apart from the others. Like all Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, all dharmas are taught as 'skillful means' according to the causes and conditions to preach different dharmas.<br><br>Anyway this is just my personal belief, others may not have to share my belief.</div>
