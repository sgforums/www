              To bhikkhu: kundalini practice is a gradual practice that can lead to the experience of "cosmic consciousness" and self-realisation. This is what they mean by "realising god", god does not mean deity but the ground of being, the consciousness that gives rise to form. This is stil far from the end of the path. See our moderator's map http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html and my own ebook, http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html
              
              P.s. I don't know if I asked you this before, but are you a monk?

              <p><br>i am interested to know how you think Buddha achieved his enlightenment since we are on this topic now.</p>
              <p>Personally i realise that each nomination will define enlightenment in different way. Mahayana will define as being able to go to Pureland with sariras to prove after cremation as the ultimate goal of enlightenment.  Zen will define it in another way. Same goes for Theravanda and Taoism.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">2. Anger</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">3. Sloth and torpor;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">4. Agitation and worry</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">5. Extreme skepticism</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">Listed above are the five hindrances to meditation. Each one or a combination of more than one can prevent a successful practice. If you have too much sense desire you will find your mind wandering in meditation toward those things which you crave. If you are full of anger, you will be agitated and it will be very difficult to stay concentrated on your meditation subject. Sloth and torpor refers to sluggish-ness. You may just be tired and in need of rest. After you are rested, you can return to your meditation practice. Agitation and worry will keep your mind occupied away from your subject the same way that anger works in that way. Extreme skepticism refers to your doubts in the Dhamma or your ability to practice. This is normal for any meditator, but as you learn more, the doubt will fade and you will proceed with your practice.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">Very few people can eliminate all five hindrances all the time, except for enlightened ones. But there may be times when your concentration is strong and you can eliminate the five hindrances for at least a meditation session. When this happens there is the opportunity to enter some advanced states known as jhana.</span></p>

              <p>For the Vajrayana , Enlightenment is Rainbow Body.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is impossible to count exactly how many students in Tibet received empowerment from Padmakara in person, but the most renowned are the original 25 disciples, the intermediate 25 disciples and the later 17 and 21 disciples. There were 80 of his students who attained rainbow body at Yerpa and also the 108 meditators at Chuwori, the 30 tantrikas at Yangdzong, the 55 realized ones at Sheldrag. Of female disciples there were the 25 dakini students and seven yoginis. Many of these close had bloodlines that have continued until the present day.</p>
              <p>At present he dwells on the vidyadhara level of spontaneous presence in the form of the regent of Vajradhara, unshakable for as long as samsara remains. Full of compassion he sends out emanations to benefit beings. Even after the teachings of the Vinaya have perished he will appear among the tantric practitioners. There will be many destined disciples who attain rainbow body. In the future, when Buddha <a title="Maitreya" href="/wiki/Maitreya"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Maitreya</span></a> appears in this world, Padmakara will emanate as <a class="new" title="Drowa Kundul (page does not exist)" href="/w/index.php?title=Drowa_Kundul&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="color: #ba0000;">Drowa Kundul</span></a> and spread the teachings of Secret Mantra to all worthy people."</p>

This is common in many religions.  Meaning there is realisation of mind's luminous presence but insight of anatta has not arisen.  Anatta is Thusness Stage Five and what Bahiya Sutta taught is realised - in seeing there is just the seen, no seer, in hearing there is just the heard, no hearer. "Self" then is seen to simply be a label collating the five skandhas with no substantial entity to be found in the same way that the word "weather" does not refer to a self-existing entity anywhere and is merely a label collating the various everchanging weatherly phenomena.
                                
              Lastly, foundation of morality and precepts is important for a stable mind conducive for the cultivation of jhanas. It is not necessary however that if one makes some minor mistakes then one will lose their ability to enter jhanas. Its best however to reflect and repent on one's mistakes. Also as we all know, devadatta has mastery of jhanas and powers and yet is capable of having evil thoughts and committing heinous sins, causing his downfall to avici hell.

              <p>No, it means one realises the luminous essence of consciousness. But then the aggregate of consciousness, being vivid, present and intimate as it is, is mistaken to be a true self. That is why other religions teach a true atman and not anatta.
              When self-view is destroyed, life goes on with much greater clarity, wisdom and liberation.
              Action is seen to arise via dependent origination and not an agent. There is no doer, but action is. No seer, but seeing happens.</p>
              <p>As what Ven Buddhaghosa said:</p>
              <p>"Mere suffering is, not any sufferer is found</p>
              <p>The deeds exist, but no performer of the deeds:</p>
              <p>Nibbana is, but not the man that enters it,
              The path is, but no wanderer is to be seen."</p>
              <p>"Everywhere, in all the realms of existence, the noble disciple 
                     sees only mental and corporeal phenomena kept going through the 
                     concatenation of causes and effects.</p>
              <p>No producer of the 
                     volitional act or kamma does he see apart from the kamma, no

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a matter of perspective, look at the animal kingdom, they don't have religion but the sexual needs is natural like breathing, drinking eating etc. So everyone has such needs, just different degree of intensity or frequency. And it is important to satisfy this need, just satisfy it from the correct perspective I.e. When you are hungry, eat. When you are tired, rest....it's alright for monks and nuns to satisfy this need too.</div>

              <p><a href="/forums/1728/topics/index.php?itemid=1728"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Buddhism : <span style="background-color: white;">MTV</span> Generation</span></strong></span></a></p>
              <p>Being the teacher of many teachings, the Buddha gave no fixed teaching,<br>though all teachings centre around compassion and wisdom. - <em>Stonepeace</em><br><br>A <span style="background-color: white;">Buddhist</span> friend asked, “Which <span style="background-color: white;">Buddhist</span> tradition do you practise?” I always hesitate to give a direct answer - simply because there is really no direct answer that is fair. The usual answer I give is - I'm an “<span style="background-color: white;">MTV</span> <span style="background-color: white;">Buddhist</span>”. “M” stands for the Mahayana tradition, “T” for Theravada and “V” for Vajrayana. (Together, these are the three main living <span style="background-color: white;">Buddhist</span> traditions.) It's kind of an fitting answer because many of my generation lived at the advent of colourful <span style="background-color: white;">MTV</span> culture - a metaphor for the melting pot of multiple genres of mish-mash “stuff”. It was “traditional” to mix and match teachings of various traditions, though there is the danger of it being merely frivolous “window-shopping”. Usually, the next question asked is - “How is it possible not to choose one <span style="background-color: white;">Buddhist</span> tradition after years of studying and practising Buddhism?” <br><br>Yes, one should focus eventually, so as to cultivate deeper. I focus on “tradition X”. It's Pure Land Buddhism in my case, as my main practice - but with Theravada meditation foundations, some Vajrayana flavouring, a touch of Zen etc... That's what I meant by “mish-mash”! If you can synthesise various teachings comfortably, why not? But I would still hesitate to pronounce myself as an “X-practitioner” - because there are more to the <span style="background-color: white;">Buddhist</span> teachings I try to live up to, than only the teachings popularly ascribed specifically to “X Buddhism”. It is perfectly natural that after exploring various <span style="background-color: white;">Buddhist</span> traditions, one eventually settles on one that one has strong afinity with. But it is also perfectly natural that the more one explores that tradition, one eventually discovers how it is interlinked to aspects of the Dharma found emphasised in other traditions. <br><br>As in the Hua-yen (Avatamsaka) teachings of universal interconnectivity, the stucture of the Dharma is a case of intricate “all-in-one” and “one-in-all”. As such, it is difficult to pigeon-hole personal <span style="background-color: white;">Buddhist</span> practice in terms of one single tradition. As a monk I met once mentioned that though he is Theravadin in appearance, he considers himself not so much as “non-sectarian” in outlook, but “pre-sectarian” - adhering to Buddhism before segregation in terms of traditions. Me? “Multi-sectarian” sounds nicely inclusive. It would seem ridiculously small-minded to miss wonderfully useful teachings that are conventionally outside of the illusory boundaries of one's tradition. Why not keep an open heart and mind, and make the best of whatever you encounter? After all, as the Buddha put it, just as the sea is salty everywhere, the universal “taste” of all his teachings is that of spiritual freedom.</p>

              <p>Personally i realise that each nomination will define
                                enlightenment in different way. Mahayana will define as being able
                                to go to Pureland with sariras to prove after cremation as the
                                ultimate goal of enlightenment.  Zen will define it in another
                                way. Same goes for Theravanda and Taoism.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>first of all, zen is mahayana. mahayana is not a sect, anyone that wishes to attain buddhahood can be considered mahayana. the school that wishes to go pure land is pure land school, one of the sub schools of mahayana. secondly they all understand enlightenment in the same way. there is no different understandings in different school. hinayana path realises anatta, no self, this is their enlightenment. mahayana realise twofold emptiness, this is their enlightenment. zen aims to realise twofold emptiness through meditation and koan this life, this is their aim. pure land sch generally aims to obtain birth in pure land and then attain enlightenment there. what is their understanding of enlightenment? when the flower opens, the inhabitant of pure land sees the buddha and realises birthlessness. meaning at that time he realises emptiness and becomes enlightened. same thing, only that pure land people seek to attain it in afterlife.</p>
