              <p>There is a very good book titled "The Buddha and his teachings - by Ven Narada". I got a hardcopy of this book.</p>
              <p>The link can be found here</p>
              <p>http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/budtch/budteach00.htm</p>
              <p>The book talks about historical Buddha and his teachings to his contemporaries, from birth to his Enlightenment, to his Parinibbana (death) from Theravada point of view. It's really a good read, a bit deep.</p>
              <p>If you prefer a lighter material, you can the works of Ven Dhammananda which is widely available on the net.</p>

              <p>i ever read a simple and thin book on Life of Buddha - written very beautifully by a Japanese writer...that makes the Buddha a real living human and not just scriptures here and there....</p>
              <p>The one paragraph i recalled vividly was the moment (after enlightenment) when Buddha rushed back to see his dying father....he eventually shed tears on his father's feet (away from visibility of his disciples)...while his wife hid in her room crying with their only son..pointing out of the window saying: "Son, go and greet your father"...and her little son asked:"Mother, please go with me together"..and she replied:" No, son, you go...for your father is now the enlightened one..i cannot show my emotions to him before his disciples.."</p>
              <p>This is the nearest human account of the life of Buddha....</p>

              <p>personally, i believe Buddhism is best understood to gain surprising insights from human accounts and perspectives than pure readings of only his teachings....</p>

              <p>You have to be more precise.</p>

              <p>Tibetan/Vajrayana Buddhism is also considered Mahayana.</p>

              <p>I see. Then I suggest you be open to the different traditions including Mahayana, find out what they are about first before making your decision.</p>

              <p>Excerpts from Ajahn Chah Dhamma talk...</p>
              <p>Ditthi-mana is a harmful thing. Ditthi means "view" or "opinion". All forms of view are called ditthi; seeing good as evil, seeing evil as good... any way whatsoever that we see things. This is not the problem. The problem lies with the clinging to those views, called mana; holding on to those views as if there were the truth. This leads us to spin around from birth to death, never reaching completion, just because of that clinging. So the Buddha urged us to let go of views.</p>
              <p>If many people live together, as we do here, they can still practise comfortably if their views are in harmony. But even two or three monks would have difficulty if their views were not good or harmonious. When we humble ourselves and let go of our views, even if there are many of us, we come together at the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha ( the Monastic Order, or those who have realised the Dhamma).</p>
              <p>It is not true that there will be disharmony just because there are many of us. Just look at millipede. A millipede has many legs, doesn't it? Just looking at it you'd think it would have difficulty walking, but actually it doesn't. It has its own order and rhythm. In our practice it's the same. If we practise as the Noble Sangha of the Buddha practised, then it's easy. That is <em>supatipanno </em>- those who practise well; <em>ujupatipanno -</em> those who practise straightly <em>nayapatipanno </em>- those who practise to transcend suffering, and <em>samicipatipanno</em>- those who practise properly. These four qualities, established within us, will make us true members of the Sangha. Even if we number in the hundreds or thousands, no matter how many we are, we all travel the same path. We come from different backgrounds, but we are the same.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Even though our views may differ, if we practise correctly there will be no friction. Just like all the rivers and streams which flow to the sea...once they enter the sea they all have the same taste and colour. It's the same with people. When they enter the stream of Dhamma, it's the one Dhamma. Even though they come from different places, they harmonise, they merge. But the thinking which causes all the disputes and conflict is ditthi-mana. Therefore the Buddha taught us to let go of views. Don't allow mana to cling to those views beyond their relevance.</strong></em></p>
