              <p><span style="font-size: large;"> Stand With Tibet</span><br> <br> Dear friends,<br> <br> After decades of repression under Chinese rule, the Tibetan people's
              frustrations have burst onto the streets in protests and riots. With
              the spotlight of the upcoming Olympic Games now on China, Tibetans are
              crying out to the world for change.<br> <br> The Chinese government has said that the protesters who have not yet
              surrendered "will be punished". Its leaders are right now considering a
              crucial choice between escalating brutality or dialogue that could
              determine the future of Tibet, and China.<br> <br> We can affect this historic choice--China does care about its
              international reputation. China's President Hu Jintao needs to hear
              that the 'Made in China' brand and the upcoming Olympics in Beijing can
              succeed only if he makes the right choice. But it will take an
              avalanche of global people power to get his attention--and we need it
              in the next 48 hours.<br> <br> The Tibetan Nobel peace prize winner and spiritual leader, the Dalai
              Lama has called for restraint and dialogue: he needs the world's people
              to support him. Click below now to sign the petition--and tell
              absolutely everyone you can right away--our goal is 1 million voices
              united for Tibet:<br> <br> http://www.avaaz.org/en/tibet_end_the_violence/97.php/?cl_tf_sign=1 <br> <br> China's economy is totally dependent on "Made in China" exports that we
              all buy, and the government is keen to make the Olympics in Beijing
              this summer a celebration of a new China, respected as a leading world
              power. China is also a very diverse country with a brutal past and has
              reason to be concerned about its stability -- some of Tibet's rioters
              killed innocent people. But President Hu must recognize that the
              greatest danger to Chinese stability and development comes from
              hardliners who advocate escalating repression, not from Tibetans who
              seek dialogue and reform.<br> <br> We will deliver our petition directly to Chinese officials in London,
              New York, and Beijing, but it must be a massive number before we
              deliver the petition. Please forward this email to your address book
              with a note explaining to your friends why this is important, or use
              our tell-a-friend tool to email your address book--it will come up
              after you sign the petition.<br> <br> The Tibetan people have suffered quietly for decades. It is finally their moment to speak--we must help them be heard.<br> <br> With hope and respect,<br> <br> Ricken, Iain, Graziela, Paul, Galit, Pascal, Milena, Ben and the whole Avaaz team<br> <br> PS - It has been suggested that the Chinese government may block the
              Avaaz website as a result of this email, and thousands of Avaaz members
              in China will no longer be able to participate in our community. A poll
              of Avaaz members over the weekend showed that over 80% of us believed
              it was still important to act on Tibet despite this terrible potential
              loss to our community, if we thought we could make a difference. If we
              are blocked, Avaaz will help maintain the campaign for internet freedom
              for all Chinese people, so that our members in China can one day rejoin
              our community.<br> <br> Here are some links with more information on the Tibetan protests and the Chinese response:<br> BBC News: UN Calls for Restraint in Tibet - http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7301912.stm <br> Human Right Watch: China Restrain from Violently Attacking Protesters - http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/03/15/china18291.htm <br> Associated Press: Tibet Unrest Sparks Global Reaction -
