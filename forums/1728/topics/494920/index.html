              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Shradha Ghale Nov 4, 2017 The Kathmandu Post</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A fascinating new book explores how Nepal was rebranded as a
              destination for trekking and dharma tourism</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Generations of tourists have been drawn to Nepal since it
              opened its doors in the 1950s. Those from Europe and America came seeking what
              they imagined had been lost in the West. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">From maharajas and palaces, to countercultural utopia, to
              Himalayan adventure and spiritual enlightenment, Nepalis quickly learned to
              sell them the version of Nepal they yearned for. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“What tourists think of as a quest is for Nepalis an
              industry,” Mark Liechty writes in the preface of his recent book Far Out:
              Countercultural Seekers and the Tourist Encounter in Nepal. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The book traces how different generations of Western tourists
              have projected their fantasies onto Nepal and how Nepalis turned those
              fantasies into business ventures. Nepali tourism represents a “fortuitous
              convergence” between disparate longings.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Among the various phenomena Liechty analyses, one that
              struck me most was the rebranding of Nepal as a destination for
              Western trekkers and seekers. Here I focus on this theme. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tourists arriving in Nepal in the 1960s differed from the
              current breed. They were mostly middle-class American and European youth in
              search of a land uncontaminated by modernity. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">They had left home to escape the materialism and war
              mongering that afflicted their societies, and found what they sought in the
              “exotic, cannabis-friendly, cheap, and welcoming streets of Kathmandu.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">These hippies and backpackers had little money and plenty of
              time. They travelled by road all the way from Europe, stayed at cheap lodges on
              Freak Street, smoked hashish, read, dreamed and hung out with the locals. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As public transportation barely existed at the time, most of
              them just walked all over the city soaking up the local atmosphere. “Even the
              most dazed potheads managed to meander over to the Central Post Office…or down
              New Road to check out the propaganda at the Chinese bookstore or American
              library.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By the early 1970s the ethos of the global youth culture had begun
              to change. The sixties’ anti-establishment spirit gradually gave way to
              conservative and consumerist values. In the new social and economic climate,
              “‘experience’ was not something to be sought existentially, but to be bought in
              packaged form.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The face of Nepali tourism changed accordingly. Realising
              tourism’s meaning lay in money making, Nepalis sought to replace the scruffy
              and unprofitable hippies with clean-cut and free-spending foreigners. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To that end, Nepali entrepreneurs and authorities harnessed
              an available resource: Westerners’ historical infatuation with the Himalayas. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Once abhorred as desolate and dangerous terrain, mountains
              had undergone a radical reassessment during the nineteenth-century Romantic
              era. Now they symbolised not just physical courage but also moral and
              spiritual purity. For those looking for a cure for the malaise of modern
              civilisation, there could be no grander destination than the remote Himalayas. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Nepal geared up for the task of fulfilling such Himalayan
              fantasies. Its already world-renowned mountain and jungle landscapes were now
              rebranded as “trekking” areas for adventure-loving foreigners. Fittingly, the
              government lost no time in declaring these areas “national parks” for “wildlife
              conservation.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As environmentalism gained momentum across the globe,
              conservation became a reliable means of promoting tourism interests in Nepal.
              It is no coincidence that all the commercial trekking routes in Nepal lie in
              protected areas.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By the 1970s Freak Street’s appeal had worn off and Thamel
              emerged as the hub of Nepal’s adventure tourism market. A full-scale service
              economy featuring trekking companies, gear shops, restaurants and mountain
              flight operators took shape. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Guidebooks arrived to help trekkers carry out their adventure.
              These guidebooks “made possible the thrill of getting into beautiful and remote
              parts of Nepal without the uneasy sense of unpredictability.” The number of
              trekkers multiplied each year. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Coverage of Himalayan adventures in the western media further
              boosted the industry. In the late 1990s, amid the success of Jon Krakauer’s
              book Into Thin Air and the IMAX movie Everest, the Everest region witnessed a
              “virtual stampede” of trekkers. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“A trek is something one not only does but, crucially, buys,”
              Liechty writes. “Unlike the hippies, trekkers came to Nepal in search of a
              commercial service—an adventure.” These adventure consumers were “more
              cautious, less open to conversation, more afraid of being cheated, and
              seemingly less curious.” There was another difference: hippie travellers had
              little money but lots of time; adventure tourists were cash rich and time poor,
              and wanted to squeeze out maximum experience within the shortest possible time. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The hippies had romanticised Nepal as a timeless land that
              offered a refuge from the hectic and cutthroat world back home. In contrast,
              the new tourists saw the country’s “backwardness” as a condition that tested
              their endurance. Here intrepid souls could “time-travel, experience the thrill
              of alterity, and then return to the comforting if monotonous routines of their
              modern lives.”  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Liechty sees “dharma tourism” as just another variety of
              adventure tourism. “Like other adventure tourists, dharma types come to Nepal
              seeking expert (spiritual) guidance in an exotic landscape and pay for the
              privilege. In lieu of trekking guides and mountain experiences, they seek Lamas
              and meditation retreats.” Seen in this way, the craze for Tibetan Buddhism and
              the desire for a packaged Himalayan trek are essentially the same phenomenon. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For Liechty it is not surprising that the dharma tourists
              have reduced Buddhism to a tool of self-therapy. Underlying their reductive
              understanding of Buddhism is the modern Western fixation on “self.” In this
              view, the self is an autonomous agent entirely responsible for its “own
              success, happiness, improvement and—if you’re Buddhist—liberation.” The answers
              lie within the individual. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One achieves transformation not through engagement and
              action, but through a solitary inner quest.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This “profoundly heavy cultural baggage” stands between
              Western seekers and the basic tenets of Buddhism. Madhyamaka Buddhist
              philosophy holds that all things and phenomena are interdependent; nothing
              exists as an isolated, fixed entity, and the “self” is ultimately an illusion. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Yet many people from the West are drawn to Buddhism precisely
              because they see it as a path to “self-healing” and “self-discovery,” to be
              achieved through the practice of “meditation.”  “In this light,” Liechty
              writes, “‘meditation’ appears much less an ancient spiritual practice and much
              more an artifact of late modernity as the modern ‘self’ seeks solace and
              healing in a tradition that fundamentally denies its very existence.” Within Tibetan
              Buddhism, meditation is chiefly associated with incarnate lamas or serious
              renunciants who have achieved advanced states of consciousness. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The emphasis is on living a life of non-attachment and
              compassion rather than on sitting cross-legged and gazing inward. “Ironically,”
              writes Liechty, “Western Buddhists have elevated ‘meditation’ to a place it
              never had within Tibetan Buddhism.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Like Nepalis who cashed in on the mountain obsession of
              foreigners, Tibetan Buddhists reimagined their religion to satisfy the demand
              of Western consumers. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To illustrate this point, Liechty traces the origin and
              evolution of Kopan Monastery on the outskirts of Kathmandu. The monastery was
              established in 1969 by a group of Tibetan refugee monks and the disillusioned
              granddaughter of a New York City billionaire. From the start, Kopan’s aim was
              to bring Buddhism to the West. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The monastery “explicitly welcomed” students from the
              West, offered Buddhist studies accessible to them, and rigorously adapted
              Buddhist teachings to their requirements. Over time Kopan became an
              international hub of “Tibetan Buddhist outreach to foreign seekers.” As more
              and more seekers flocked to Kathmandu, various other Buddhist enterprises
              cropped up in Thamel. “Not to be outdone, in 1982 Kopan Monastery established a
              branch in Thamel.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The “seeker scene” in Kathmandu witnessed a gradual “hippie”
              to “yuppie” shift. Early students at Kopan mostly included young “hippies,
              freaks and travelers.” By the 1980s Kathmandu had started receiving clean-cut and
              well-heeled dharma tourists. Hotels sprung up in the Bodhanath area, including
              ones run by local monasteries. Increasingly Buddhism was marketed as a cure for
              the suffering self. Lamas turned into therapists. Monks took part in
              experiments that measured the health benefits of meditation.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Liechty’s critique of dharma tourism has special relevance at
              a time when yoga, meditation and “mindfulness” have become a
              multibillion-dollar industry. Today there are companies that offer a dizzying
              range of Buddhist experience, from “spiritual adventure tours” and “yoga treks”
              to “enlightened travel” in Nepal. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Affluent seekers can spend the day meditating and listening
              to lectures by Tibetan lamas, dine at a fancy restaurant in town and then
              retire to a luxurious suite at the Hyatt Regency, a short distance from
              Bodhanath Stupa. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Just as Nepali business people have tapped into tourists’
              fascination for the Himalayan wilderness, enterprising Tibetans have
              “transformed Tibetan Buddhism into a branded product and peddled it worldwide.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Liechty shows how the longings of tourists who come to Nepal
              are historically constituted. Still, while he offers a critical yet sympathetic
              portrait of the earlier hippies and budget travellers, his assessment of
              trekkers and seekers might seem a little uncharitable at times. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One might also ask whether the tourists who visit Nepal can
              be divided into such neat categories. That said Far Out is an academic work of
              the rare kind —clear, riveting, theoretically grounded yet free of unwieldy
              jargon. Liechty treats his subject matter with a touch of irony. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Most importantly, his analysis of tourism trends in Nepal
              sheds light on one of the defining phenomena of our age, namely the
              commodification of experience. As someone attracted to both trekking and
              meditation, I found the book fascinating and thought-provoking for the most
              part. </span></p>
