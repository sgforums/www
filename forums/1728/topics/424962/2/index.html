              <p>How do you know your present sufferings at the hands of an "abuser" is not the result of <strong>you</strong> abusing someone else in a past life?</p>
              <p>It's not up to us to decide who gets what punishment, because our wisdom
                   has not been perfected.  As long as our wisdom is not perfected, we 
                  will lack objectivity to see what is the most optimal solution to a problem.  Hence, vengeance is not ours to mete out.</p>

              <p>______________</p>
              <p>No.  I will tell her to remove herself from the ugly situation and seek shelter from those who can help her.  First things first, take oneself away from a dangerous situation. </p>
              <p>Ultimately, this girl will have to let go of her hatred and anger.  Not to do so will be to ensure rebirth, wherein in a future life, she will be seeking to exact revenge.  She will be stuck in the endless cycle of birth and death.  <strong>Stuck within samsaric suffering.  </strong></p>
              <p>Most certainly though, I won't tell her to stick a knife into her father.</p>

              <p>No.  I will tell her to remove herself from the ugly
              situation and seek shelter from those who can help her.  First
              things first, take oneself away from a dangerous
              situation.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, this girl will have to let go of her hatred and
              anger.  Not to do so will be to ensure rebirth, wherein in a
              future life, she will be seeking to exact revenge.  She will
              be stuck in the endless cycle of birth and death. 
              <strong>Stuck within samsaric suffering. </strong></p>
              <p>Most certainly though, I won't tell her to stick a knife into
              her father.</p>

              <p>can only work if the person accepts karma and rebirth.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, it is to solve modern problems with practical solutions first, like asking her to leave the father and go to a safe place.</p>
              <p>Then using psychology may help this girl better than karma talk.</p>

              <p>Yes, there are people who are out to make life difficult for others. These people usually suffer and have a difficult death. I'm not cursing them, it is true. I've seen people who were like that, they would have long term sickness. Whereas I had seen some of my relatives who were good natured, they would either die in their sleep or passed away after a fall. No long term sufferings.</p>

              <p>I had an ex-colleague who was in HR and liked to make things difficult for others whom she did not like. She also liked to criticise and make fun of Buddhism. She was a Christian. So, there were many people curse and swear at her but when her husband passed away and she was widowed at young age (30+) with 2 young kids we felt sorry for her.</p>

              <p>Set new goals in your life to achieve.  For eg picking up new hobby like a musicial instrument, a sport to focus your attention and mind on.</p>
              <p>Through participating in new found interests, you may find your attention on your previous grievances fading slowly into the background as time pass.</p>
