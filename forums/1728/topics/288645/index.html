My question is why so secretive?<br>Since an audit is going to reveal the annual income, does it make any difference not to answer the ST's query?

            <div class='col-md body'>Religious clergies are nowadays earning quite a huge sums too. I am not familiar with what a pastor of a christian-faith suppose to do but for buddhists monks, I can only see that more money are been wasted on unimportant issues.<br><br>Once, a friend of mine told me he saw an abbot from a particular big monastry in Singapore driving a Mercedez E-class (or C-class? I'm not sure with the car model but I was told it is an expensive car). He asked some of the people in the monastry is the abbot earning big money, they said no, but the car is provided by the temple. But apparently, only the abbot is the only one driving the car.<br><br>More money should be channelled into grooming buddhist workers and/or leaders in doing propogation work. Instead of just building mock relic stupa or just bigger statues. More active activities should be planned in order to attract youth and young working adults.<br><br>Like Campus Crusade (CC), if I'm not wrong, they are the ones supporting all these Campus Crusade for Christ in the various tertiary instituitions in Singapore. I will say that the money is well raised and used as I believe the CC would have groomed and trained appropriate christian workers to spread the Word of God.</div>
