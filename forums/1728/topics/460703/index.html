              <p>1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at 
              RÄ�jagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Then, when it 
              was evening, the venerable SÄ�riputta rose from meditation and went to 
              the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side. 
              The Blessed One then said to him:</p>
              <p>2. “SÄ�riputta, your faculties are clear. The color of your skin is 
              pure and bright. What abiding do you often abide in now, SÄ�riputta?”</p>
              <p>“Now, venerable sir, I often abide in voidness.”</p>
              <p>“Good, good, SÄ�riputta! Now, indeed, you often abide in the abiding 
              of a great man. For this is the abiding of a great man, namely, 
              voidness.</p>
              <p>3. “So, SÄ�riputta, if a bhikkhu would wish: ‘May I now often abide in
               voidness,’ he should consider thus: ‘On the path by which I went to the
               village for alms, or in the place where I wandered for alms, or on the 
              path by which I returned from the almsround, was there any desire, lust,
               hate, delusion, or aversion in my mind regarding forms cognizable by 
              the eye?’ If, by so reviewing, he knows thus: ‘On the path by which I 
              went to the village for alms, or in the place where I wandered for alms,
               or on the path by which I returned from the almsround, there was 
              desire, lust, hate, delusion, or aversion in my mind regarding forms 
              cognizable by the eye,’ then he should make an effort to abandon those 
              evil unwholesome states. But if, by reviewing, he knows thus: ‘On the 
              path by which I went to the village for alms, and in the place where I 
              wandered for alms, and on the path by which I returned from the 
              almsround, there was no desire, lust, hate, delusion, or aversion in my 
              mind regarding forms cognizable by the eye,’ then he can abide happy and
               glad, training day and night in wholesome states.</p>
              <p>4-8. “Again, SÄ�riputta, a bhikkhus should consider thus: ‘On the path
               by which I went to the village for alms, or in the place where I 
              wandered for alms, or on the path by which I returned from the 
              almsround, was there any desire, lust, hate, delusion, or aversion in my
               mind regarding sounds cognizable by the ear?...regarding odors 
              cognizable by the nose?...regarding flavors cognizable by the 
              tongue?...regarding tangibles cognizable by the body?...regarding 
              mind-objects cognizable by the mind?’ If, by reviewing, he knows thus: 
              ‘On the path by which I went to the village for alms…there was desire, 
              lust, hate, delusion, or aversion in my mind regarding mind-objects 
              cognizable by the mind,’ then he should make an effort to abandon those 
              evil unwholesome states. But if, by reviewing, he knows thus: ‘On the 
              path by which I went to the village for alms…there was no desire, lust, 
              hate, delusion, or aversion in my mind regarding mind-objects cognizable
               by the mind,’ then he can abide happy and glad, training day and night 
              in wholesome states.</p>
              <p>9. “Again, SÄ�riputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: ‘Are the five 
              cords of sensual pleasure abandoned in me?’ If, by reviewing, he knows 
              thus: ‘The five cords of sensual pleasure are not abandoned in me,’ then
               he should make an effort to abandon those five cords of sensual 
              pleasure. But if, by reviewing, he knows thus: ‘The five cords of 
              sensual pleasure are abandoned in me,’ then he can abide happy and glad,
               training day and night in wholesome states.</p>
              <p>10. “Again, SÄ�riputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: ‘Are the five 
              hindrances abandoned in me?’ If, by reviewing, he knows thus: ‘The five 
              hindrances are not abandoned in me,’ then he should make an effort to 
              abandon those five hindrances. But if, by reviewing, he knows thus: ‘The
               five hindrances are abandoned in me,’ then he can abide happy and glad,
               training day and night in wholesome states.</p>
              <p>11. “Again, SÄ�riputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: ‘Are the five 
              aggregates affected by clinging fully understood by me?’ If, by 
              reviewing, he knows thus: ‘The five aggregates affected by clinging are 
              not fully understood by me,’ then he should make an effort to fully 
              understand those five aggregates affected by clinging. But if, by 
              reviewing, he knows thus: ‘The five aggregates affected by clinging are 
              fully understood by me,’ then he can abide happy and glad, training day 
              and night in wholesome states.</p>
              <p>12. “Again, SÄ�riputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: ‘Are the four 
              foundations of mindfulness developed in me?’ If, by reviewing, he knows 
              thus: ‘The four foundations of mindfulness are not developed in me,’ 
              then he should make an effort to develop those four foundations of 
              mindfulness. But if, by reviewing, he knows thus: ‘The four foundations 
              of mindfulness are developed in me,’ then he can abide happy and glad, 
              training day and night in wholesome states.</p>
              <p>13-19. “Again, SÄ�riputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: ‘Are the 
              four right kinds of striving developed in me?...Are the four bases for 
              spiritual power developed in me?...Are the five faculties developed in 
              me?...Are the five powers developed in me?...Are the seven enlightenment
               factors developed in me?...Is the Noble Eightfold Path developed in 
              me?...Are serenity and insight developed in me?’ If, by reviewing, he 
              knows thus: ‘Serenity and insight are developed in me,’ then he can 
              abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome states.</p>
              <p>20. “Again, SÄ�riputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: ‘Are true 
              knowledge and deliverance realized by me?’ If, by reviewing, he knows 
              thus: ‘True knowledge and deliverance are not realized by me,’ then he 
              should make an effort to realize true knowledge and deliverance. But if,
               by reviewing, he knows thus: ‘True knowledge and deliverance are 
              realized by me,’ then he can abide happy and glad, training day and 
              night in wholesome states.</p>
              <p>21. “SÄ�riputta, whatever recluses and brahmins in the past have 
              purified their almsfood have all done so by repeatedly reviewing thus. 
              Whatever recluses and brahmins in the future will purify their almsfood 
              will all do so by repeatedly reviewing thus. Whatever recluses and 
              brahmins in the present are purifying their almsfood are all doing so by
               repeatedly reviewing thus. Therefore, SÄ�riputta, you should train thus:
               ‘We will purify our almsfood by repeatedly reviewing thus.’”</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable SÄ�riputta was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</p>
