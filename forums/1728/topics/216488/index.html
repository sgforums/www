            <div class='col-md body'>2 weeks ago i saved or sort of " catch " a budgerier near lakeside mrt while cycling , at first i thought strange how come a budgerier can be sitting on the side of the pacement without flying away , so as i approach it i tried to use my hand to touch it and it fly just 3 meters ahead into the path of a auntie whom use her slipper to nudge it to make it fly , then the budgerier only fly 2 meters across the open drain to the grass n sit there agn . Sensing something must be wrong with the bird , i get off my bike n walk a small loop to the other side of the drain to get nearer to observe and found that it sort of unable to walk at all , perhaps it can only manage to jump abit to fly short distance which means it should be injured somhow . So being aware that the area has alot of big birds such as crows which will attack and kill smaller birds which i have seen before , a crow pecking out the brain of a adult size pigeon . I put on my cycling gloves and catch it , as expected it was scared and tried to bite me only to find it useless at all bcos of my glove . I manage to get a small plastic bag n make some small holes to bring it home without suffocating it . And now it has grown used to my home already as it din attempt to fly away when my father bring it out to the living rm to let it get some exercise . Instead it just wander ard my house , even when i tried to chase it or catch it , it will ony run instead of fly which i'm sure it still can if it wants to . When i use my bare-hand to catch it to put back into its cage , it ony make some noise as i believe it wants to run abt my house . But i notice that it is unable to land properly ( always falling to its left side ) whenever it jump from our hand or from the water container , but i notice it has been recovering cos i rem it was not even able to walk when i catch it .<br>Now my question is , should i release it into the wild or should i continue to rear it in my home occasionally play with it when free . Because i know my jurong area has got many bigger size birds like eagle and crows which will attack smaller birds , and also it doesn't seem to want to fly anymore , when we bring catch it with our hands to let it play in our living rm , it doesn't even bite but just looks ard nia as if it like to stay here .<br>Can anyone advise ? I don't mind releasing it but i am only worried over its safety if it is released in the wild .<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TWE, you might also want to bring it to see a vet. During my army days, we tried to save an apparently injured bird which strayed into our barrack room... but it died after a couple of days. I really regretted not bringing the bird to a vet then...<br><br>Also, just to protect yourself &amp; your family incase there is bird flu.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya if it is injured may consider bringing it to a vet. Anyway i was reminded of an old relative of mine...<br><br>A budgerier used to follow her wherever she go so she thought the bird has affinity with her so she put it in a cage and occasionally let it out for a while but she never flies away from her house. And the bird used its beak to choose toto number for her and she won some money a few times also, hundreds of dollars hehe.. I guess the bird is sort of repaying its debts.<br><br>But somehow years later the budgerier used its beak and opened the cage and left.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems that the budgeriar have finished paying its debt to her , everybody have a certain duration of yuan , if you try to " kill the goose for its golden eggs " the yuan will be depleted prematurely . And well , i don't like to do such things though , i don't gamble not to mention use it to pick 4d nos . Well it it wants to fly away i will feel happy for it no doubt i will of cos miss it , but as for bringing it to the vet .... as a matter of fact i still have a case to settle with my previous employer which left me with a monthly corporate subscription of $65 per month and i am still waiting for MOM to contact me abt it . i am having some money problem now , if that thing can't be settle , i will have to fork out $600 to terminate the subscription on top of me being jobless right now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> . It seems that the bird is recovering and its walking well now , will keep on monitoring it for its progress of recovery . If it really were to unable to recover fully then i send it to the vet ba , sigh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> . All the unlucky things always fall on me .

            <div class='col-md body'>haha sorry don misunderstand i am not trying to promote toto or gambling. Its best not to do anything with these.<br><br>Anyway human life in buddhism is very precious, and to attain a human life is a very great rarity... There are much much more sentient beings in the animal, spirit and hell realms (lower realms). We should appreciate life not because we can achieve things like good career, family, etc and enjoy luxury. All these things can only last tens of years before we pass away so whether we have them or not doesn't really matter much ultimately.... Tens of years from now, none of these matters at all.<br><br>Rather, every human life means an opportunity to practice the dharma and attain liberation, enlightenment, the highest bliss of nirvana. Human life is an opportunity to cultivate wisdom (most important), blessings, yin1 yuan2. (see everyone is so stupid topic in forum) And these are things that can be brought to next life, not a cent of material possesions can be brought away. Even if you are billionare, tens of years later they will be useless, you will have to leave them and the money cant buy you a good rebirth either. Or you are rich, but next day doctor said you got cancer and will die in a year, confirm you got no mood to enjoy your money. Therefore to be poor is even better than to indulge.. The sufferings that resulted from being rich due to attachment will be far greater and serves as distraction from cultivation. Although it is still possible and there are rich people who cultivate (rare and harder)<br><br>Another teaching from buddhism is the teaching of impermanence. My master shen kai says, shan yin yuan ji shi er yin yuan, er yin yuan ji shi shan yin yuan. Bad condition may serve as good condition, good condition may also serve as bad condition. Nothing is ultimate and always subject to change. Therefore we should not grasp at any extreme, because they are ungraspable due to impermanence nature. Because everything is in a state of flux, ever changing. Good and bad is never fixed, they are interchangeable. Therefore good conditions is bad conditions, bad conditions is good conditions. There is this story taught by my master and also mentioned elsewhere and in eckhart tolle's book also. Its about this horse which escaped his owner, but it returned with many other horses.. And at cant instances of losing and gaining the horses, he said something in a book manner which i liked... But just cant remember what was it. Could cenarious please post that part from 'a new earth' as i don have that book with me now. We must cultivate non-dualism, not abiding in what is good or what is bad. Because they are illusory. Thats why buddhism says 'shan er jie fan nao' - good or bad, if you are attached to them, is sufferings.</div>

But none of these guarantees one's happiness and neither do you have to have money to be peaceful and happy.<br><br>Those who are live in the nepal region i've read, and many poor places are home to the happiest people in the world even though in the material level they insufficient.. They are happier than say, people living in new york. Therefore quality of life does not mean possessions... Studies have shown that those developed countries have much more unhapiness than some poor countries... their quality of life, hapiness, satisfaction is much less.. lots of problems, divorce, etc too. It shows the Buddhist truth that Dukkha is always there if anything is grasped, clinged, or sought - too much craving and seeking in these nations.<br><br>And it is the mental story, thoughts, not the absence of money that is causing the greatest pain. In this very moment, nothing is really that bad. Even say you are bankrupt right now.... if you do not know cultivation, you may feel anxiety and stress all the way to the court to sign your bankruptcy and all the way back. But if you are a more awakened person, it will not be so. You are bankrupt, you pack up your belongings, you leave your house, while waiting for a bus, there is no mental story. You are alert, the birds chirping, the traffic, the people walking around you, you are completely aware. Then you arrive at court... you sign the paper, and move to perhaps your friend's house to stay. Smaller room, smaller place, but nevertheless you are still as happy. Being poor is therefore not ultimately bad if one knows the dharma. And things might change better.. Thats what i mean. And what i mean is, its better not have something than indulge in it... otherwise there will be Dukkha.<br><br>And again i hope cenarious would post something from eckhart, who left his job and almost became peniless, stayed for years in the park but nevertheless living completely in bliss and stillness. only recent years his books became national bestsellers... Selling millions</div>

It feels now as if I am talking about some past lifetime or somebody else's life.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Awakening</span><br>One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday, I woke up in the early hours with a feeling of absolute dread. I had woken up with such a feeling many times before, but this time it was more intense than it had ever been. The silence of the night, the vague outlines of the furniture in the dark room, the distant noise of a passing train Â– everything felt so alien, so hostile, and so utterly meaningless that it created in me a deep loathing of the world. The most loathsome thing of all, however, was my own existence. What was the point in continuing to live with this burden of misery? Why carry on with this continuous struggle? I could feel that a deep longing for annihilation, for nonexistence, was now becoming much stronger than the instinctive desire to continue to live.<br><br>Â‘I cannot live with myself any longer.Â’ This was the thought that kept repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought it was.. Â‘Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the Â‘IÂ’ and the Â‘selfÂ’ that Â‘IÂ’ cannot live with.Â’ Â‘Maybe,Â’ I thought, Â‘only one of them is real.Â’<br><br>I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I was fully conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what seemed like a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at first and then accelerated. I was gripped by an intense fear, and my body started to shake. I heard the words Â‘resist nothing,Â’ as if spoken inside my chest. I could feel myself being sucked into a void. It felt as if the void was inside myself rather than outside. Suddenly, there was no more fear, and I let myself fall into that void. I have no recollection of what happened after that.<br><br>I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I had never heard such a sound before. My eyes were still closed, and I saw the image of a precious diamond. Yes, if a diamond could make a sound, this is what it would be like. I opened my eyes. The first light of dawn was filtering through the curtains. Without any thought, I felt, I knew, that there is infinitely more to light than we realize. That soft luminosity filtering through the curtains was love itself. Tears came into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room. I recognized the room, and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it before. Everything was fresh and pristine, as if it had just come into existence. I picked up things, a pencil, an empty bottle, marvelling at the beauty and aliveness of it all. That day I walked around the city in utter amazement at the miracle of life on earth, as if I had just been born into this world.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bliss</span><br>For the next five months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted deep peace and bliss. After that, it diminished somewhat in intensity, or perhaps it just seemed to because it became my natural state. I could still function in the world, although I realized that nothing I ever did could possibly add anything to what I already had.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Understanding</span><br>I knew, of course, that something profoundly significant had happened to me, but I didn't understand it at all. It wasn't until several years later, after I had read spiritual texts and spent time with spiritual teachers, that I realized that what everybody was looking for had already happened to me. I understood that the intense pressure of suffering that night must have forced my consciousness to withdraw from its identification with the unhappy and deeply fearful self, which is ultimately a fiction of the mind. This withdrawal must have been so complete that this false, suffering self immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled out of an inflatable toy. What was left then was my true nature as the ever-present I am: consciousness in its pure state prior to identification with form. Later I also learned to go into that inner timeless and deathless realm that I had originally perceived as a void and remain fully conscious. I dwelt in states of such indescribable bliss and sacredness that even the original experience I just described pales in comparison. A time came when, for a while, I was left with nothing on the physical plane. I had no relationships, no job, no home, no socially defined identity. I spent almost two years sitting on park benches in a state of the most intense joy.<br><br>But even the most beautiful experiences come and go. More fundamental, perhaps, than any experience is the undercurrent of peace that has never left me since then. Sometimes it is very strong, almost palpable, and others can feel it too. At other times, it is somewhere in the background, like a distant melody.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sharing</span><br>Later, people would occasionally come up to me and say: Â‘I want what you have. Can you give it to me, or show me how to get it?Â’ And I would say: Â‘You have it already. You just canÂ’t feel it because your mind is making too much noise.Â’ That answer later grew into my book, Â‘The Power of NowÂ’.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">From The Power of Now, copyright 1999 by Eckhart Tolle, published in the UK in 2001 by Hodder and Stoughton.</span></strong><br><br>Photographs Â© Cygnus Books 21-Feb-2001[/b]</blockquote>Maybe you should get this book too. Another good one is 'A New Earth'. The Power of Now is found in all major bookstores and also library.

"Spare some change?" mumbled the beggar, "I have nothing to give you," said the stranger. Then he asked: "What's that you're sitting on?" "Nothing, " replied the beggar. "Just an old box. I've been sitting on it for as long as I can remember. "Ever look inside?," asked the stranger. "No," said the beggar. "What's the point, there's nothing in there." "Have a look inside," insisted the stranger. The beggar, reluctantly, managed to pry open the lid. With astonishment, disbelief, and elation, he saw that the box was filled with gold.<br><br>I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look inside. Not inside any box, as in the parable, but somewhere even closer: inside yourself.<br><br>Eckhart Tolle, from The Power of NOW</div></blockquote></div>
