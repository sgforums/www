Knowing what his message meant, in the third watch of the night I went to his room. Using the robe as a screen so that none could see us, he expounded the Diamond Sutra to me.

It was not until he heard yin wu shuo zhu... then he realized 'there is something that is nothing'.<br><br>BTW, when the fifth patriarch covered him with his robe, it was not only for screening but also for mind to mind transmission. ThatÂ’s the main reason why Master Hui Neng can be enlightened at that moment. Imaging how many times it would takes us to listen to that to be enlightened?<br></div>

[b]sleeping is not sleeping</strong> ... exactly ... when you said this, did you realised something has happened in your mind, should be a sharp transition??<br><br>the first 'sleeping' is the PHYSICAL state (like lying on the bed ... of which you may be thinking in your head)<br><br>the second 'sleeping' should not be intrepreted as the same as the first 'sleeping' but actually the opposite of the first, not like awake and not being conscious, but the MENTAL state.<br><br>opposite not in terms of the usual way of opposites (like fat and thin), but states of mind!!! States of mind!<br><br>In a way, by you saying "seeping is not sleeping" you have generated your own KOAN to trigger a transition in your mind where the truth is caused to be 'released' ... you just need to 'catch' it ... although it's better that this happens without actually doing it this way.<br><br>I once helped someone 'see' the TRUTH which he later shared his experience with me. I saw that I can take advantage of a situation. I noticed that we are in a big crowd of people. I asked him to be aware of his mind, what it is thinking ... then I told him that his zip is down!!! He was so embarrased. I told him not to think of what's outside but what's his mind is thinking. The 'huge' transition that occured in his mind ... like a big KOAN, although in a different form, made him see the TRUTH.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Yes, your approach sounds very Ch'an to me. IÂ’m glad you shared it with us. That's something used very often by many ChÂ’an masters before our time. But I donÂ’t use this approach often now. Because ppl are not as simple as before now. But I still use it when I think itÂ’s the right time for a particular person. Because that would depend on what stage of mind the person is in now. If he is ready, then itÂ’s a piece of cake.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Eye in the Sky:</div><div class="quote_body">wonderful 'description'!<br><br>ever wondered why the symbol of Buddhism, the swastika, is like that?</div></blockquote>Very good question indeed.<br><br>But I am not talking about the question as a koan or finger to find the TRUTH. Because the truth is when we find out about the TRUTH, we only know what the TRUTH is. We still donÂ’t know how it works. What does swastika have to do with our Buddha nature in terms of science? Why Buddhism and many other cultures use it as an important symbol? I would like to cover some of that.<br><br>I think swastika is something worth studying for scientists. And I think it has very much to do with the original topic here. How does our awareness work? In this world of duality, whatÂ’s its physical characteristics?<br><br>This is what I have speculated so far. It works something like anti-matter such as a positron. As a matter of terminology, we identify the electron as having the left hand spin. The positron then spins to the right. Scientists had proved the existence of anti-matter although it cannot be captured so far. Figure below shows the collision trace of a positron and electron when they smash each other.<br><br><img src="http://home.pchome.com.tw/life/anshiang/positron.gif"><br>PositronÂ’s trace is the pink one.<br><br>When a positron hits an electron, both particles will vanish and release huge amount of energy. Our awareness may have the same physical characteristics as anti-matter. For instance, a special form of light that canÂ’t be detected by our modern instruments yet. The light creates mirrored matter or reflection of itself so to constitute the universe. So that at the molecule level, they spin reversely. When our awareness is enhanced through practicing Buddhism, it will Â‘hitÂ’ and remove our karma and consciousness the same as anti-matter destroys matter, so that weÂ’ll be enlightened again.<br><br><img src="http://home.pchome.com.tw/life/anshiang/right_swastika.png"><br><br>BuddhismÂ’s swastika spins to the right which I think may have something to do with anti-matter like light vortex that is capable of destroying all our barriers and make us An-Hsiang. So the swastika could be dynamic and spinning all the time. But this is purely a speculation. Since you asked, so I answered.<br></div>

But this is purely a speculation. Since you asked, so I answered.<br></div></blockquote>The entire universe which consumes us all is based on a set of laws dualistic in nature - gravity (attraction and repulsion), electromagnetism, weak and strong molecular bonds, etc.<br><br>In 'The life of the Cosmos' by Lee Smolin, our universe in our current state and form, existed because it has to obey and operate within a very restricted region of requirements. Without this strict obedience and adherence, our universe as we know it will never exist.<br><br>Meaning ... outside this region of restriction, moleculars will not be able to bond for e.g. No Hydrogen, Oxygen, Helium, etc 'nuclear fuels' for stars, and of course life on earth as we know it simplistically said.<br><br>What this discovery is saying is that because of this restriction, the 'Creator' of the universe had the hands tied when 'creating' this universe and us, so to speak. That is if you believe in a 'Creator', then another way of saying, is that the powers are actually limited, and not so all-powerful as believed by people.<br><br>I don't think one should relate or find a scientific analogy or meaning to the swastika, as doing so is limiting Zen/Ch'an/Buddhist philisophy to what it is not intended to be from the beginning of its transmission to the people by Buddha.<br><br>"In our minds, can we really fly ... beyond the limits of the universes"<br><br></div>
