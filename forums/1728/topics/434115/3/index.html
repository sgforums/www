                  human. Why must be born through virgin birth. To prove he is
                  God's son, don't you think descending from heaven is more
                  convincing than virgin brith. Anyway, it  has nothing to do

                  Jesus did descended to heaven and will descend from heaven in the future in his second coming.

                  There will surely be ppl in hell because not all people who hear the gospel accepts It.

Buddhism does begin as a philosophy in a way<br>and became religion by the traditional schools of thoughts.  Buddhism is<br>evolved out of Hinduism.  Pls read my arguments in other forum post.  A lot<br>of ppl switch from Buddhism to Christianity, and also Christainity to Buddhism.<br>Why is this so?  You ask a Christian or a Buddhist, that their faith is a religion..<br>they will deny and say their faith is not a religion at all.. for a<br>buddhist will say it is spiritual endeavour.. for a christian will say<br>it is a personal relationship with a personal God ..</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, there are many erroneous things so people turn to christianity.<br>In Christainity, there are also many erroneous things so people turn to Buddhism.<br>If they have been seriously practising their faith and thinking rationally<br>on the facts, they will come out as good atheist.  This is a very true saying.<br>But many do not actually practise, but think they are wholesome.  that is why<br>they hop from religion fallacy to another religion fallacy.  When you put<br>your heart to practise the principles of your religion, you will then be able to<br>appreciate the fallacies of your faith.  And when you are able to objectively<br>and open-mindedly identify the fallacies you have appreciated yourselves, you<br>then can be free of bondage to religion.</p>
              <p>For example, i heard.  devout buddhist after years of practitioner burnt down<br>their quan yin statues to turn to christianity.  and hallucinate that evil ghost<br>make trouble their switch of religion.  It is all in your mind...</p>
              <p>For free thinkers who never consider deeply a religion, will often at moment<br>of death turn to certain form of religion, because their rejection of religion<br>is very superfluous.</p>

              <p>Hi Dawn</p>
              <p><br>Virgin birth imply Jesus is not tainted by the original sin. The original sin mean the corruption of Adam and Eve in the garden of eden. That's why, it was said, the first time Christ came by virgin birth, the second time he will came as the King to judge the living and the dead.</p>
              <p>Anyway that's Christian school of thought. Every religion will has it own spectrum of mystery story which can be own understand by faith. Just like Buddhism, the life story of Shayamuni mentioned that a White Elephant entering the Queen Maya womb. Subsequently, the Queen was pregnant, when she give birth to the Buddha. He walk seven steps and mentioned that</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Buddhism did not start out as a philosophy. It is the revelation of one man through his personal <strong><em>experience</em></strong> of life, that experience was then in later centuries put to words, complied and later become what we called the Suttas. The Abdhidhamma, a later compilation is the philosophical aspect of the Suttas, setting out to explain and analyze the early Buddhist teachings in a logical and systematic way. <span> </span>This is the first stage in the development of Buddhism itself. It is a doctrine of the Saint.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Buddhism became what we called a religion during the second period of its development when the Mahayanist forsake the ideal of a human Buddha and replace it with a divine Buddha in a Nirvana full of life.<span> </span> Instead of just individual salvation, it is replaced by the ideal of Universal salvation of every life. The Buddha here ceased to be human, under the name of his Body of Highest Bliss (Sambhogakaya), he became a God. He however was not the Creator of the world.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Buddhism is a religion of Experience to this day and that is why the practice of Meditation is such an essential part of the religion itself.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";      '>To me, Buddhism is a philosophy because it began with examining a <strong><em>fundamental problem</em></strong> – ‘birth, aging, sickness and death’.  And this issue is <strong><em>connected with existence</em></strong>.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Noble Truth states: Existence is Suffering.  This is arrived at by theorising in deep contemplation.  It did not come about by some practice or experience.  Prince Siddhartha was searching for <strong><em>wisdom</em></strong> – to know ‘what is life or existence’, and why there is ‘aging, sickness and death’.  Expanding this further (Dependent Origination), it was about ‘old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair’.  Prince Siddhartha indeed was searching for insights as to what irks this world.</span></p>

              <p><br>conventional speaking, medicine may be different for different sick people, hence the different Buddhism school. yet ultimately speaking, disatisfactionè‹¦ is still a core illness for all people, no matter what religion/no religion, race, gender u are.</p>
              <p>and Buddha's <strong>4 noble truth</strong> is perfect, even in all school of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>no other person/founder pin this root problem. <strong>4 noble truth</strong> is not philosophy though.</p>
              <p>happiness can become disatisfactionè‹¦, but disatisfactionè‹¦ cannot become happiness. hence disatisfactionè‹¦ is true/real. and happiness is false/unreal.</p>
