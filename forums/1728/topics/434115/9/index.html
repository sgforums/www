                                there is a significant conceptual difference between the two. On
                                the whole, Buddhists believe in rebirth while Hindus, Jains, and
                                some Christians believe in reincarnation. Strictly speaking,
                                reincarnation means the assumption of another body by a permanent,
                                eternal self (the Hindu notion of <strong><span style="color: maroon;">atman</span></strong> or the Christian notion of
                                <strong><span style="color: maroon;">soul</span></strong>). Most
                                Buddhists do not believe in a permanent self
                                (<strong>anatman</strong> or <strong><span style="color: maroon;">anatta,</span></strong> without enduring self) but
                                believe human consciousness (the "I" or self) dissolves at death
                                and that only a subtle mindstream remains. The mindstream carries
                                with it karmic imprints from prior lives (but not memories and
                                emotions associated with prior lives, unless the person is a highly
                                developed spiritual practitioner, in which case reincarnation is
                                possible) and it is this subtle mindstream that conjoins with a new
                                life-form after death. Thus, rebirth does not mean an identifiable
                                human being assuming a new human body. Moreover, in Buddhism,
                                rebirth is not always accomplished in human form. Depending on
                                karmic circumstances, a human being can be reborn as an animal or
                                as a being in any of the upper or lower realms.</span></p>

                                Under your definition, all Buddhist traditions teach rebirth, since no Buddhist schools posit the existence of a soul.
                                
                                There is an ancient Buddhist school called the pudgalavadins (pudgala means 'person') who asserts a soul that reincarnates. But this school died out a long long time ago, never gained acceptance because their theory is so flawed and in disaccord with the Buddha's teachings.

              <p>The eighth consciousness:-</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Alayavijnana - Store Consciousness</span><br>By Venerable Dr.Walpola Rahula<br>In the Yogacara (Vijnanavada) School of Buddhism, alayavijnana is one of the most important doctrines developed by Asanga (fourth century A.C.). He divides the vijnanaskandha (Aggregate of Conciousness) the fifth of the five skandhas, into three different aspects or layers, namely, citta, manas and vijnana. In the Theravada Tipitaka as well as in the Pali Commentaries, these three terms - citta, manas, vijnana - are considered as synonyms denoting the same thing. The Sarvistivada also takes them as synonyms. Even the Lankavatarasutra, which is purely a Mahayana text, calls them synonyms although their separate functions are mentioned elsewhere in the same sutra. Vasubandhu, too, in his Vimsatikavijnapti-matratasiddhi considers them as synonyms. Since any one of these three terms - citta, manas, vijnanas - represents some aspect, even though not all aspects, of the fifth Aggregate vijnanaskandha, they may roughly be considered as synonyms. <br>However, for Asanga, citta, manas and vijnana are three different and distinct aspects of the vyjnanaskandha. He defines this Aggregate as follows: <br>'What is the definition of the Aggregate of Consciousness (vijnanaskandha)? It is mind (citta), mental organ (manas) and also consciousness (vijnana). <br>"And there what is mind (citta)? It is alayavijnana (Store-Consciousness) containing all seeds (sarvabijaka), impregnated with the traces (impressions) (vasanaparibhavita) of Aggregates (skandha), Elements (dhatu) and Spheres (ayatana) . . . <br>'What is mental organ (manas)? It is the object of alayavijnana always having the nature of self-notion (self-conceit) (manyanatmaka) associated with four defilements, viz. the false idea of self (atmadrsti), self-love (atmasneha), the conceit of 'I am' (asmimana) and ignorance (avidya) ... <br>'What is consciousness (vijnana)? It consists of the six groups of consciousness (sad vijnanakayah), viz. visual consciousness (caksurvijnana), auditory (srotra), olfactory (ghrana), gustatory (jihva), tactile (kaya), and mental consciousness (manovijnana) <br>Thus we can see that vijnana represents the simple reaction or response of the sense-organs when they come in contact with external objects. This is the uppermost or superficial aspect or layer of the vijnanaskandha. Manas represents the aspect of its mental functioning, thinking, reasoning, conceiving ideas, etc. Citta, which is here called alayavijnana, represents the deepest, finest and subtlest aspect or layer of the Aggregate of Consciousness. It contains all the traces or impressions of the past actions and all good and bad future potentialities. The Sandhinirmocana-sutra also says that alayavijnana is called citta (Tibetan sems). <br>It is generally believed that alayavijnana is purely a Mahayana doctrine and that nothing about it is found in Hinayana. But in the Mahayanasangraha Asanga himself says that in the Sravakayana (= Hinayana) it is mentioned by synonyms (paryaya) and refers to a passage in the Ekottaragama which reads: 'People (praja) like the alaya (alayarata), are fond of the alaya (alayarama), are delighted in the alaya (alayasammudita), are attached to the alaya (alayabhirata). When the Dharma is preached for the destruction of the alaya, they wish to listen (susrusanti) and lend their ears (srotram avadadhanti), they put forth a will for the perfect knowledge (ajnacittam upasthapayanti) and follow the path of Truth (dharmanudharma-pratipanna). When the Tathagata appears in the world (pradurbhava), this marvellous (ascarya) and extraordinary (adbhuta) Dharma appears in the world.' <br>Lamotte identifies this Ekottaragama passage with the following passage in the Pali Anguttaranikaya (A II, p.131): Alayarama bhikkhave paja alayarata alayasammudita, sa Tathagatena analaye dhamme desiyamane sussuyati sotam odahati annacittam upattapeti. Tathagatassa bhikkhave arahato sammasambuddhassa patubhava ayam pathamo acchariyo abbhuto dhammo patubhavati. <br>Besides this Anguttara passage, the term alaya in the same sense is found in several other places of the Pali Canon. The Pali Commentaries explain this term as 'attachment to the five sense-pleasures", and do not go deeper than that. But this also is an aspect of the alayavijnana. <br>In the Lankavatarasutra the term tathagatagarbha is used as a synonym for alayavijnana and is described as 'luminous by nature' (prakrtiprabhasvara) and 'pure by nature' (prakrtiparisuddha) but appearing as impure 'because it is sullied by adventitious defilements' (agantuklesopaklistataya). In the Anguttaranikaya, citta is described as 'luminous' (pabhassara), but it is 'sullied by adventitious minor defilements' (agantukehi upakkilesehi upakkilittham). One may notice here that alaya-vijnana (or tathagatgarbha) and citta are described almost by the same terms. We have seen earlier that the Sandhi-nirmocana-sutra says that alayavijnana is also called citta. Asanga too mentions that it is named citta. <br>It is this alayavijnana or citta that is considered by men as their "Soul', 'Self', 'Ego' or Atman. It should be remembered as a concrete example, that Sati, one of the Buddha's disciples, took vinnan (vijnana) in this sense and that the Buddha reprimanded him for this wrong view. <br>The attainment of Nirvana is achieved by 'the revolution of alayavijnana' which is called asrayaparavrtti. The same idea is conveyed by the expression alayasamugghata 'uprooting of alaya' which is used in the Pali Canon as a synonym for Nirvana. Here it should be remembered, too, that analaya 'no-alaya' is another synonym for Nirvana. <br>The alayavijnanaparavrtti is sometimes called bijaparavrtti 'revolution of the seeds' as well. Bija here signifies the 'seeds' of defilements (samklesikadharmabija) which cause the continuity of samsara. By the 'revolution of these seeds' one attains Nirvana. Again the Pali term khinabija, which is used to denote an arahant whose seeds of defilements are destroyed', expresses the same idea. <br>Thus one may see that, although not developed as in the Mahayana, the original idea of alayavijnana was already there in the Pali Canon of the Theravada.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Don't think that consciousness is not real. If you think it is unreal, then you will not see the pure luminous presence of Mind.</p>
              <p>Therefore ask yourself, 'Who am I' until you discover the luminous aware presence that is your mind-essence.</p>
              <p>After that, there are more steps before you realize what emptiness is.</p>
              <p>But if you merely establish a conceptual knowledge of emptiness, you will not have a direct experiential realization of the nature of mind. You will neither know what luminosity or emptiness is in real time.</p>

              <p>In the first place Buddhism is not a religion . Sidharta Gautama who later became Buddha has never once said that he is god or associated with god . he only proclaim that he had meditated (think vigorously on many matters and reached conclusions) and reached enlightenment and is a teacher.</p>

              <p>It is the same with confusianism and Tao de ching .

              <p>In the first place Buddhism is not a religion . Sidharta Gautama who later became Buddha has never once said that he is god or associated with god . he only proclaim that he had meditated (think vigorously on many matters and reached conclusions) and reached enlightenment and is a teacher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is the same with confusianism and Tao de ching . Confucius never mentioned that he is messenger of god or anything . it was after his death that people start to immortalize him by giving him the deity title . what he had been preaching all the time was about to do good deeds and to respect others .</p>

              <p>Buddha was not a thinker per se, he was someone who discovered the human condition and the solution to the human condition of suffering by experiential realization.</p>

              <p><br>Im not saying there is God . I believe when we die nothing is left but energy . energy cannot vanish . it can only transform in to other sort of energy but it will never disappear . it could be in the ethereal and enter the womb when someone is pregnant and become a new energy in that womb or it could be other sort of energy but it never disappear . it merely transform . and it does not carry a brain so energy does not recoqnize and is itself not self-conscious . which is to say it is just energy not a living thing .</p>
              <p>According to you Buddha does not <em>'subscribe' </em>to the idea of god and he teaches reincarnation and cause&amp;effects(Karma). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From what I know Buddha never deny God . at that time when he start teaching,  India was already worshipping Brahmana/Brahma for ages . he merely perfected the way .</p>

              <p>Someone who realized or saw a flaw in the system and proceeded to formulate a solution (in this case meditate) . Definetely sounds like a thinker . now I do not doubt his philosophy . it is good like the rest of the philosophy in this world .<strong> but it is wrong for man to make buddhism into a religion .  </strong></p>
