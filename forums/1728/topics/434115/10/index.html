              <p>1) The Buddhist view is that consciousness, due to power of karmic conditions, continue to arise and take birth in samsara. Consciousness is substanceless, and arise due to requisite causes and conditions (such as karma, etc). It is not that an inanimate, non-sentient substance passes from one body to another... that is not the Buddhist view.</p>
              <p>2) Buddha did not deny the existence of a celestial being called Maha Brahma, but he denied that he was the creator:</p>

              <h4>John Reynolds, among western scholars I am familiar with, has written with
                  clarity on this issue:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>As for the existence of God, of the Creator of heaven and earth, this is
                  the concept central to religion as we know it in the West. Was the Buddha
                  an atheist or an agnostic in relation to the existence of a Supreme Being
                  or God? ...</h4>
              <h4>In the Suutras there is found a Buddhist account of Genesis. [This account
                  appears in several sources both in the Mahayana and the Theravada Canons.]
                  In reply to questions from His disciples, the Buddha explained that the
                  humanity found on this planet earth once inhabited another planetary system.
                  Ages ago when the sun of that world went nova and the planet was destroyed
                  in the ensuing solar eruptions, the bulk of its inhabitants, as the result
                  of their arduously practicing the Dharma for ten thousand years, were reborn
                  on one of the higher planes of the Form World or <em>Ruupedhaatu</em>, a
                  plane of existence known as <em>Aabhaasvara</em> or “clear light.” Here they
                  enjoyed inconceivable bliss and felicity for countless aeons. Then, when
                  their great store of past karma came onto maturity, our own solar system
                  and planet earth began to evolve and some among their numbers were reborn
                  on the lower planes of the <em>Ruupadhaatu</em> in the vicinity of the nascent
                  earth. This plane of existence where they found themselves reborn is known
                  as <em>Brahmaaloka</em>. The first of these beings to reawaken and be reborn,
                  upon seeing the solar system evolving below him, exclaimed in his delight,
                  “I am the Creator!” In this way, he came to believe that he was the actual
                  creator of the universe which he saw about him, for he did not remember
                  from whence he came and was born without any parents. But in actuality
                  the manifestation of this universe was due to the collective karma of all
                  in that company and his own individual manifestation, which was a case
                  of apparitional birth, was due to his own great stock of meritorious karma
                  coming into maturation at that time because the requisite secondary conditions
                  were present.</h4>

              <h4>The principle here, derived from the core insight of Interdependent Transformation,
                  is that all things appear from a causal base. This understanding is extended
                  to the existence of entire universes or world systems. The Dalai Lama makes
                  this same point in his commentary on Shantideva’s <em>Guide to the Bodhisattva’s
                  Way of Life</em>, the Ninth Chapter on Wisdom. Verse 124 speaks directly
                  to this discussion:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>124. ... [I]f Creation were dependent upon conditions, the complete collection
                  of those causal circumstances would be the cause, and not <em>Ishvara</em> [Note: <em>Ishvara</em> was a common name for God in ancient India, similar
                  to <em>Yahweh</em>.] If the complete conditions were assembled, <em>Ishvara</em> would be powerless not to create; and if they were absent, there would
                  be no creation.</h4>
              <h4>The Dalai Lama’s Comment:</h4>
              <h4>If creation and destruction are dependent upon a collection of causal conditions,
                  the totality of those conditions would be the cause, and not a God who
                  is independent of and uninfluenced by events. If the causal conditions
                  were assembled, <em>Ishvara</em> would be powerless not to create the resultant
                  phenomena; and if they were not assembled, those phenomena would not be
                  produced.</h4>

                                          understood what the body is, and how it arises, and passes away. He
                                          has understood what feeling is, and how it arises, and passes away.
                                          He has understood what perception is, and how it arises, and passes
                                          away. He has understood what the mental formations are, and how

                                          invent medicine to make a philosophy out of it.</em></p>
              <p><em>Just like you can't say medicine, biology, physics, chemistry,
                                          art, maths, began as a philosophy. It's what people observe,
                                          tested, experienced, and then applied...</em></p>
              <p><em>Therefore see Buddhism as having a very specific purpose - to
                                          teach sentient beings their own condition and the remedy to their
                                          condition.</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>One main reason why Buddhism is not a philosophy in its
                                          essence, is because the truth of Buddhism does not derive from
                                          conceptual inference, but direct experience.</strong></em></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Let me ask you: medicine and
                                          biology is not a philosophy, do you say it is a religion? If you
                                          say medicine is philosophy, you're missing the point of medicine.
                                          If you say medicine is religion, you're missing the point of
                                          medicine. That is not the purpose.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Of course medicine and biology is
                                          neither a philosophy or a religion. They have very specific
                                          purposes, they treat specific conditions and help humanity in their
                                          ways.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Buddhism is such a thing... it is
                                          neither philosophy nor religion, it has a specific purpose which is
                                          to teach us the human condition and the way to end the human
                                          condition of suffering.</p>

              <p>1) The Buddhist view is that consciousness, due to power of karmic conditions, continue to arise and take birth in samsara. Consciousness is substanceless, and arise due to requisite causes and conditions (such as karma, etc). It is not that an inanimate, non-sentient substance passes from one body to another... that is not the Buddhist view.</p>
              <p>2) Buddha did not deny the existence of a celestial being called Maha Brahma, but he denied that he was the creator:</p>

              <li>
              <h4>John Reynolds, among western scholars I am familiar with, has written with clarity on this issue:</h4>
              <h4>The principle here, derived from the core insight of Interdependent Transformation, is that all things appear from a causal base. This understanding is extended to the existence of entire universes or world systems. The Dalai Lama makes this same point in his commentary on Shantideva’s <em>Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</em>, the Ninth Chapter on Wisdom. Verse 124 speaks directly to this discussion:</h4>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>3) The reason why I said Buddhism is not philosophy is this (and note that I do not, therefore assert that Buddhism is a religion):</p>
              <ul>
              <li>a) <em>The Perfect One is free from any theory, for the Perfect One has understood what the body is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what feeling is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what perception is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what the mental formations are, and how they arise, and pass away. He has understood what consciousness is, and how it arises, and passes away.<br><br>Therefore, I say, the Perfect One has won complete deliverance through the extinction, fading away, disappearance, rejection, and getting rid of all opinions and conjectures, of all inclination to the vainglory of I and mine.</em> <em><br><br>- Majjhima Nikaya, 72</em></li>
              <li>b)
              <p><em>Lets say... you have an illness. A method is proven to work to heal/remove the illness. You go to that doctor, you take the medicine, consume according to instructions, and your illness is cured.</em></p>
              <p><em>This is like Buddhism. The four noble truths isn't just some thoughts... it's actually what the Buddha realized and observed through his own experience, the problem that plagues mankind (suffering), its cause, and its remedy.</em></p>
              <p><em>Philosophy is just one small component of Buddhism... just like philosophy (?) is not the main component of medicine, or science, or chemistry. For example, medicine has its own purpose, and the 'philosophy of medicine' if such things exist is not the main purpose of medicine which is to treat illnesses - people didn't invent medicine to make a philosophy out of it.</em></p>
              <p><em>Just like you can't say medicine, biology, physics, chemistry, art, maths, began as a philosophy. It's what people observe, tested, experienced, and then applied...</em></p>
              <p><em>Therefore see Buddhism as having a very specific purpose - to teach sentient beings their own condition and the remedy to their condition.</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>One main reason why Buddhism is not a philosophy in its essence, is because the truth of Buddhism does not derive from conceptual inference, but direct experience.</strong></em></p>
              </li>
              <li><em>.....</em>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Let me ask you: medicine and biology is not a philosophy, do you say it is a religion? If you say medicine is philosophy, you're missing the point of medicine. If you say medicine is religion, you're missing the point of medicine. That is not the purpose.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Of course medicine and biology is neither a philosophy or a religion. They have very specific purposes, they treat specific conditions and help humanity in their ways.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Buddhism is such a thing... it is neither philosophy nor religion, it has a specific purpose which is to teach us the human condition and the way to end the human condition of suffering.</p>

              <p>I shall irrefutably prove to you that Buddha has never used logical inference at all:</p>
              <p>1) <em>"Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, 
                  <strong>by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through 
                  pondering views,</strong> by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative 
                  is our teacher.'"</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) <em>"This Dhamma that I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to 
                  understand, peaceful and sublime, <strong>not within the sphere of reasoning, 
                  subtle, to be experienced by the wise.</strong>  But this generation [<em>pajâ</em>] delights in adhesion [<em>âlaya</em>], takes delight in adhesion, rejoices in adhesion.  For such a generation this state [<em>thânam</em>]
                   is hard to see, that is, specific conditionality, dependent 
                  origination.  And this state too is hard to see, that is, the stilling 
                  of all formations, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the 
                  destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation and Nibbana.”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) The Buddha said 'Four Noble Truths' - not 'Four Noble Problem Solving Analysis' - which means, the Truth of Suffering, The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the End of Suffering, The Truth of the Path towards the End of Suffering.</p>
              <p>Implying that, the Buddha discovered these truths for himself directly and experientially. In other words, he KNEW all these from experience already - otherwise how can he state them as truths?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, since the Buddha was already for quite some time enlightened and liberated when he taught the four noble truths and not prior, he obviously <strong>does not need</strong> to brainstorm some 'new problem solving ideas' as obviously, he just needed to speak from experience, what worked for him, what led to his enlightenment. If it was not what he experienced or what worked for him, it would be useless and inappropriate.</p>
              <p>Since he is already liberated at that time, why does he need to 'infer' that there is an end to suffering? He is already freed from suffering, why would he need to infer or logically think of a goal? He already experienced it, therefore he states that the end of suffering is a Truth.</p>
              <p>Since he is already liberated from suffering and enlightened, he must obviously know what is the cause of suffering as well, he must have experienced how suffering arise, he must certainly have discovered what was absent which resulted in the end of suffering (i.e. delusion). All these must be very clear to an awakened person by experience, otherwise how can he be called 'perfectly awakened'?</p>
              <p>And as I explained earlier, 4th NT was entirely by his own experience and observation of what is the necessary conditions for awakening.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) You said: <em>"<span>if one had the experience, it wouldn’t take 49
                                          days to come up with the 4NTs."</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span> </span></em><span>And my reply is "Huh? Who said he took 49 days to come up with the 4NTs"?</span></p>
              <p>I said, he took 49 days to attain enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. In other words, he attained true realization and experience 49 days after sitting under the Bodhi tree.</p>
              <p>I did not say he had an experience, after which he took 49 days to come up with the 4 NTs. Obviously once he attained enlightenment, he already gained knowledge of the four noble truths simultaneously with his enlightenment, otherwise it would not be called enlightenment!</p>

              <p><br> In our normal day to day life we usually try to understand things by 
                  thinking about them, by applying logic and reasoning, by making 
                  inference, by deducing, etc. All these involve the power of the 
                  intellect. In this way we derive knowledge, understanding, and even 
                  wisdom. But vipassanÄ� wisdom does not arise in this way. How then does 
                  it arise?<a name="more"></a> It arises simply through the process of 
                  deep observation. But when we say deep observation one must not think 
                  that this observation involves thinking or pondering about the object 
                  being observed. For normally when we observe something we tend to also 
                  think and ponder about it. But for vipassanÄ� wisdom to arise this 
                  observation must be a pure process of observation freed from all kinds 
                  of intellectual thought activities. One simply open up the mind with 
                  mindfulness and be aware of the object of observation as it really is 
                  without adding anything (imputing any subjective values) to the object 
                  or subtracting anything from it. One simply receives and watch the 
                  object as it is, as it appears to the observing mind.</p>

              <p>I said Siddhartha sat under the Bodhi tree for 49 days before attaining enlightenment...

              <p>I can accept that some of his teachings came from experience but not 'entirely' as you claimed.  There were situations in which the Buddha had to answer questions where it was clear that he had no prior incident to recall or rely on.

              <p>Going by experiential realization: in order to tackle incident X, I must have been in a similar situation as incident X or expose to it.  However, it is possible to solve incident Y using experience in incident X, by extension, logic, inference, extroplation, common-sense, wisdom.</p>
              <p>One good example is the Vinaya rules which were made as and when a situation arise.  If experential realization was available, the Buddha would have made all the rules at once.</p>

              <p>I said Siddhartha sat under the Bodhi tree for 49 days before attaining enlightenment... I did not say he attained enlightenment and afterwards took 49 days to figure out the 4 noble truths. All the while during the 49 days he was not thinking or intellectualizing: he was practicing anapanasati and entering deep states of meditation absorption.</p>
              <p>And by the way why does 49 days matter? Some people knew 4 noble truths but intellectually took many years of practice before attaining enlightenment, whereas some got it in an instant, what are you trying to prove?</p>

              <p>Buddha, after remembering and experiencing the first jhana, and finding that meditative absorption to be the way to insight, he abandoned the 5 companions and sat under the bodhi trees for 49 days. In short: 49 days, after he abandoned the 5 companions. And he did not 'come up' with 4NT: he realized it in his own experience.</p>
              <p>Like I said, your assumption is wrong.</p>
              <p>To attain experiential realization, a long time is not required. Bahiya got it immediately! Many others got it immediately. Some took weeks. Some took months. Some took years. Buddha happened to take 7 weeks.</p>
              <p>First of all, do you understand that the attainment of enlightenment in Buddhism is not an intellectual realization but an experiential realization? Secondly, don't you know that Buddha attained enlightenment after 49 days? So what are you even refuting?</p>
              <p>Here's what Buddha said in the Mahasatipatthana regarding experiential realization:</p>

              <p>And here's what Steven Norquist says:</p>
              <p><em><a href="http://www.spiritualteachers.org/norquist_article.htm">http://www.spiritualteachers.org/norquist_article.htm</a><br></em></p>
              <p><em>Basically any practice that can shock you into seeing what is really going on is acceptable. 
                                        But understand, you want to know what's really going on, to feel it, to contact reality. It 
                                        shouldn’t take long, a few years at most, less for some. If a practice or a teacher tells you 
                                        it will take 10 or 20 years, find a new practice or teacher. Remember you are your own 
                                        salvation, ultimately it is you who will wake you up. Any method that can shock you into seeing
                                         what is really going on is acceptable but the perspective shift must occur. </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just as I can tell you, the direct path contemplation such as self-inquiry and anatta contemplation does indeed lead to realization in a matter of few years. (less than 2 years for me)</p>
              <p>If someone tells you that you need to sit in caves for decades to gain enlightenment, don't listen to that person, don't follow that person. A lot of unenlightened people are spreading misinfo about enlightenment nowadays.</p>

              <p>7 days, or if more... then 7 years to reach experiential knowing of Anatta.</p>

              <p>Yup.</p>
              <p>He only took 49 days after he remembered his jhanas, left his companions and set out on this path. You should not count 6 years... you should count 49 days.</p>
              <p>By the way, Buddha's path of entering through jhanas is not the only path... some start with insight before going into jhanas. Buddha's path is to start with jhanas and shamatha and proceed into insight. His path is gradual, and it is a wonder he only took 49 days (and attained all kinds of knowledges through this path), obviously because this is not the first life he has been doing this. Usually you need a lot of retreat time and a few years of practice for gradual path to show its results. Whereas some people like Bahiya took the direct path realized immediately. Anyway, I digress.</p>

              <p>2. 'Now there comes a time, monks, when, sooner or later, after the 
              lapse of a long period, this world-system passes away. And when this 
              happens beings have mostly been reborn in the World-of-Radiance, and 
              there they dwell made of mind, feeding on joy, radiating light from 
              themselves, traversing the air, continuing in glory; and they remain 
              there for a long period of time.</p>
              <p>3. Now there comes also a time, monks, when, sooner or later, this 
              world-system begins to re-evolve. When this happens an empty Palace of 
              Brahma appears. And some being or other, either because his span of 
              years has passed or his merit is exhausted, falls from that 
              World-of-Radiance, and comes to life in the Palace of Brahma. And there 
              also he lives made of mind, feeding on joy, radiating light from 
              himself, traversing the air, continuing in glory; and thus does he 
              remain for a long period of time.</p>
              <p>4. 'Then there arises in him, from his dwelling there so long alone, a 
              dissatisfaction and a longing: "O! if only other beings might come to 
              join me in this place!" And just then, either because their span of 
              years had passed or their merit was exhausted, other beings fall from 
              the World-of-Radiance, and appear in the Palace of Brahma as companions 
              to him, and in all respects are like him. [18]</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> 5. 'On this, monks, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to himself:
               "I am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Supreme One, the Mighty, the 
              All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the 
              Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days the 
              Father of all that is and is to be <a name="BM154"></a>[<a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn1.htm#n154">154</a>].
               'These other beings are of my creation. And why is that so? A while ago
               I thought, 'If only they might come!' And upon my mental aspiration, 
              behold these beings came." </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>'And those beings themselves, too, think thus: "This must be Brahma,, 
              the Great Brahma, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, 
              the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to
               each his place, the Ancient of days, the Father of all that is and is 
              to be. And we must have been created by him. And why? Because we see 
              that he who was here first and we came afterwards."</p>
              <p>6. 'Because of this, monks, the one who first came into existence there 
              is of longer life, and more glorious, and more powerful than those who 
              appeared after him. And it might well be, monks, that some being on his 
              falling from that state, should come to this world. And having come to 
              this world he might go forth from the household life into the homeless 
              state. And having thus become a recluse he, by reason of ardour of 
              exertion of application of earnestness of careful thought, reaches such a
               state of concentration that, rapt in heart, he calls to mind his last 
              dwelling-place, but not the previous ones. He says to himself: "That 
              illustrious Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Supreme One, the Mighty, the 
              All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the 
              Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days, the 
              Father of all that is and is to be, he by whom we were created, he is 
              steadfast immutable eternal, of a nature that knows no change, and he 
              will remain so forever and ever. But we who were created by him have 
              come to this world as being impermanent, mutable, limited in duration of
               life.</p>

              <p>I still think Buddhism is just a teaching and should not be made into religion in the first place .</p>
              <p>You know . all these debates about maha brahma, sutta and all . we're missing the point here . THE ONLY TRUE RELIGION DEBATE . how could any of them be if in the first place they are not even religion ?? ask Dalai Lama himself and he will tell you that Buddhism is not a religion but rather a teaching to live life and to percept it in specific way .</p>
              <p>Human used to live in another planet and then it went nova and human are spiritually reborn in a new world where they live for aeons and when their karma caught up with them they are reborn to earth and all . those are merely thots ! thinker thinks . some thinker went on to experiement and to prove and they are called <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">scientists .</span></strong> some just think and conclude and proclaim that he is the all-righteous and all-knowing being.</p>
