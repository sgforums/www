              <p>Buddha never said that other religions are completely wrong, however he has disagreed with the 'thicket of views' found in other religions which leads towards either eternalism or nihilism.</p>

              <p>Other religions are true but incomplete. Buddhism is the ultimate truth. Most of the religions only talk about the 2 realms (heaven and hell) but some of the followers in these religions have ecnounters with ghosts. Their religion deny the existence of ghosts and only Buddhism explain them in details.</p>
              <p>I have friends who turn to Buddhism because of their encounters with ghosts. They found out what they wanted to know in Buddhism. Other religion explanation that ghosts are demons in disguise is simply not true and does not explain their encounters.</p>

              <p>Its ad naseum really. However, that does not stop people from seeking truths. It's be impossible to prove other religions false though. Truths and false are relative, absolutes are not.</p>

                      death’.  Expanding this further (Dependent Origination), it
                      was about ‘old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and
                      despair’.  Prince Siddhartha indeed was searching for insights

                      problems, such as those connected with existence, knowledge,
                      values, reason, mind, and language. It is distinguished from other
                      ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally
                      systematic approach and its reliance on rational argument.

              <p>funny to be disputing on "Buddhism began as a philosophy".</p>
              <p>yes, it became a religion <strong>by</strong> the common not-informed society. though to the Buddhists it's not a religion.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span class="ptext"><span class="ptitle">Buddhism is Not a Religion</span><br><br>According to the Webster's Dictionary, the definition of religion is as follows, "An organized system of beliefs, rites, and celebrations centered on a supernatural being power; belief pursued with devotion."<br><br>Buddhism is not a religion because: First, the Buddha is not a 'supernatural being power'. The Buddha is simply a person who has reached Complete Understanding of the reality of life and the universe. Life refers to ourselves, and universe refers to our living environment. The Buddha taught that all beings possess the same ability to reach Complete Understanding of themselves and their environment, and relieve themselves from all sufferings to attain utmost happiness. All beings can become Buddhas, and all beings and the Buddha are equal by nature. The Buddha is not a God, but a teacher, who teach us the way to restore Wisdom and Understanding by conquering the greed, hatred, and ignorance which blind us at the present moment. The word 'Buddha' is a Sanskrit word, when translated it means, "Wisdom, Awareness/Understanding". We call the founder of Buddhism Shakyamuni Buddha because He has attained Complete Understanding and Wisdom of life and the universe. Buddhism is His education to us, it is His teaching which shine the way to Buddhahood.<br><br>Buddhism is not a religion because: Second, the 'belief' in the Buddha's teachings is not blind belief, or blind faith. Shakyamuni Buddha taught us not to blindly believe what he tells us, he wants us to try the teachings and prove them for ourselves. The Buddha wants us to know, not merely believe. The Buddha's teachings flow from his own experience and understanding of the truth, and shows us a path of our own to taste the truth for ourselves. The just Buddha uses a perfectly scientific way of showing us reality in its true form.<br><br>Third, Buddhism is not a religion because all the 'rites and celebrations' are not centered on a supernatural being, but rather the people attending the assemblies. The ceremonies and celebrations in Buddhism all serve an educational purpose, a reminder of the Buddha's teachings and encouragement to all students who practice it. The point of the ceremonies is to help others awaken from delusion and return to Wisdom and Understanding.<br><br>Finally, Buddhism is not a religion because the 'devotion' used in Buddhism is not one based on emotion, but one based on reason. Students of the Buddha are devoted to their practice of maintaining Purity of Mind because this practice brings true happiness. We are devoted to helping both ourselves and others attain Complete Understanding and Wisdom. Our devotion is to become Buddha. </span></p>

              <p>Buddhism is to me, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">religion</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">philosophy</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #008000;">psychology</span></strong> and <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>method</strong></span> all rolled into one.  At present though, I find that a good short 
                  description of what Buddhism is was said in recent times by meditation 
                  teacher Kenneth Folk. </p>
              <p>Here's what he said in a recent talk he gave to students about Mahamudra:</p>
              <p>"<em> There was a time in the early to mid-90s when my mother had
                                          to... she felt she had to explain to her friends and relatives what
                                          I was doing with my life.  Because I was doing a lot of
                                          intensive retreats, as much as a year at a time; and I suppose it
                                          might have looked pretty odd to people who didn't know what I was
                                          doing.  They didn't know what Buddhism was and so my mother
                                          said to me one time that she had explained to her friends that
                                          Buddhism is not a religion, it is a philosophy.  And she said,
                                          "Is that right?"  And I said, well, as I understand it, there
                                          certainly is religion in Buddhism.  In fact, when you go to SE
                                          Asia, mostly what you're going to find is religious
                                          Buddhists.  They believe the doctrine of Buddhism and they
                                          make regular offerings to deities.  And so yeah, Buddhism is
                                          definitely a religion, but that's not all it is.  There
                                          certainly is the philosophical component of it.  You can think
                                          all kinds of really interesting things about Buddhism and talk
                                          about it.  And it's also psychology.  There is a very
                                          sophisticated psychology; the Abhidamma or Abhidharma depending on
                                          whether you're talking about Pali or Sanskrit.  So it's all of
                                          that.  <strong>It's a religion and it's a philosophy and it's a
                                          psychology, but for me, all of that is secondary to what I think
                                          Buddhism really started out as; which is a technology for
                                          awakening.  And so I would say that everything else was for
                                          supporting this awakening; these practices that we do to awaken. </strong></em>"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think most of us on this forum will agree that we are not here to
                   wrangle over semantics.  Rather, we are here to share our knowledge 
                  about Buddhism in a manner which supports liberation from our cyclic 
                  existence, and also to share ideas which lead to the betterment of our 
                  lives here and now; according to Buddhist teachings, mores and values.  Why get caught up in overly intricate details? </p>

              <p>I will not add or take away any aspect of the NEP.  However, to rank them in importance is quite tricky.  A practitioner would have to find his own way the order (sequence) of the 8 steps which he/she could achieved.  For instance, he/she might find it easiest to choose the right livelihood.  To perfect one's speech will take some training or mindfulness.  By choosing the right livelihood, it may help to perfect one's speech because the job doesn't involve having to tell lies!</p>
