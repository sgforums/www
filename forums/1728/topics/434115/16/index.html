              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>This is most insightful, as the actual content of the Buddha's teaching was properly established by his contemporaries. The 'supernatural' accounts have nothing to do with the body of teachings; they are the hagiographies that were written about him later, over the centuries. The teachings themselves are on philosophical or metaphysical subjects - the nature of being, ignorance, the causes of suffering, the nonexistence of either the self or phenomena as autonomous entities, the law of causality, and so forth. Such subjects hardly lend themselves to lots of supernatural embellishment.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, this is not to deny the reason usually given for the Buddha's historical importance in that he founded one of the world's great religions. Unfortunately, our secular and pluralistic age has contracted the word ‘religion’ so far in the direction of individual belief and practices that to define the Buddha as the founder of a religion is to miss the full scale of his achievement. </span></p>

              Well, i once heard this from a Geshe and i really think HH Dalai Lama put it in a very skillful way and with much common sense.
              
              Someone once asked HH Dalai Lama this Question: Is Buddhism the best religion?
              Dalai Lama answer: This is a stupid question! Why? It is like asking whether is this medicine the best medicine? The most common sense and intelligent answer is no. Why? Because different medicine applies most effectively to different illness.

              <p>hmmm ... I won't see it the way the Dalai Lama put it.  A drug is developed for a particular ailment.  Not only that, its efficacy also depends on the metabolism of one who takes the drug.</p>
              <p>The person who ask "Is Buddhism the best religion?" is very specific unless he is asking a broad question like "Which is the best religion?"</p>
              <p>Here is another example of 'skilful mean' when a question is not directly answered but projected it in another way as to make it look so noble and wise!  What I can see is that the Dalai Lama was put in a difficult position and did not wish to be caught up in controversy.  Saving his own skin is the best way to ensure a return invitation to USA!</p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, the Dalai Lama could have answered the way Buddha did.</p>

              <p>In fact, Buddhism is both philosophy and religion, it also never separate of politic either, as the wise put it, samsara is bodhi.  In this regards, the involvement of politic is not improper. If you would to explore Zen master Bao Zhi Gong, Yong Ming Yan Shou amongst others who were with the rulers, they exercised the politic of loving-kindness. Trantric master Zhang Jia was being strongly regarded as politic monk, but was cremated with over 10000 relics.</p>
