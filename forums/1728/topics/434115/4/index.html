              <p>hahaha, I know the dhamma about finger and signpost pointing to something.  Let's not get pedantic.  I have said: "Buddhism began as a philosophy and became a religion."  Isn't it clear that I made the distinction?  I have also provided the meaning of philosophy, so I am not framed nor disturbed.  No one has defined religion here in this thread, so what is religion to you?  You are making a no brainer statement: truth is truth.  Isn't it the same as 'lie is lie'?   Don't you think a lie is a lie??</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #1f497d;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The practice of meditation does not just involved contemplating, deep in thoughts only. Any Tom, Dick and Harry would be able to understand the simple phase that ‘Life is Suffering.’ How far they are prepared to believe in it is another issue. The unsatisfactory nature of life itself has to experience first before it can be fully realized and understood. The practice of meditation is used by the Buddhists to actually experience this suffering itself.</span></span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #1f497d;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Prince Siddhartha may be moved by the four sights and when on to find the meaning of existent. He <strong><em>did not</em></strong> theorize about the meaning of existence. He experiences the 1<sup>st</sup> Noble Truth himself and then spread those experiences in words to his disciples. It does not need any of our senses to experience suffering itself. Anyone who has been practicing meditation for some years will be able to tell you it is so. <span> </span><span> </span></span></span></p>

              The Perfect One is free from any theory, for the Perfect One has understood what the body is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what feeling is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what perception is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what the mental formations are, and how they arise, and pass away. He has understood what consciousness is, and how it arises, and passes away.
              
              Therefore, I say, the Perfect One has won complete deliverance through the extinction, fading away, disappearance, rejection, and getting rid of all opinions and conjectures, of all inclination to the vainglory of I and mine.

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way there is a difference between dukkha as a dharma seal and as an affliction. As a dharma seal, all phenomena are unsatisfactory and impermanent and without self. As an affliction, it is the mental suffering caused by clinging and craving and identifying. The latter can be removed through enlightenment. The dharma seal cannot be removed as it is simply the nature of all transient phenomena to be unsatisfactory. It is a truth that exhibits every moment but only realized or discovered through meditation, along with the subtle impermanence and lack of self.</div>

              <p>i just thought that the 4NT,</p>
              <p><span class="style53" style="color: #990000; font-size: 12px;">The First Noble Truth is the effect of suffering.<br>The Second Noble Truth is the cause of suffering.<br>The Third Noble Truth is the effect of the end of suffering.<br>The Fourth Noble Truth is the cause of the end of suffering.</span>
              </p><p>is more practical; systematic or even "scientific" than "abstract" or merely a way of thinking as in philosophy, that's all. that's a problem, find the cause of problem and find a solution to solve the problem. pretty simple as that.</p>
              <p>yes, a doctor’s role(like the Buddha) is to prescribe the most effective medication for the sick.<span> </span>Therefore, what works for one patient may not work for another. the one sickness of suffering is same for all. u see it as a poor illustration, but i see it as a skillful mean, hence we have the saying of 84000 method/door. example an illiterate person can also use other form of method(like precept/pureland school) to practice buddhism and still acheive enlightenment. not necessary that one must be well educated to study the sutra word by word. All method also does not leave the criteria of the Eightfold Path.</p>

              Aik TC, your efforts at learning and sharing is applaudable. Perhaps if you have practiced the direct path to self-realization, simply asking yourself Who am I? You will attain realize the luminous essence of mind by now. It took me less than two years, and a lot shorter for many others.

              <p>"You have a problem understanding English and you put words in my mouth.  That is despicable!  Which part of this sentence: "Buddhism began as a philosophy and became a religion." do you have a problem?"</p>
              <p>Yay! Ad hominem... Problem? No. You evading answering? Yes. To put it in simpler terms, you claimed Buddhism began as philosophy and became a religion, I asked you to proof.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This thread may be about religion - so what?  Is there such a thing as true religion?  Define true religion please!"</p>
              <p>You seemed to be implying religions are wrong. If your brand of Buddhism is a philosophy then make a new thread about the true philosophy if you like. Unlike you, I have many questions, not answers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If you have no idea why Siddharta Gotama left the palace, then I suggest you do Google search.  And if you know the answers why accused me of pretending?  You are pretentious!"</p>
              <p>You don't understand the burden of proof, do you? Another attempt pretending to know the answers... Btw, I never claimed or implied that I have answers. Oh, nice ad hominem...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S: Correct me if I'm wrong, truth and lie is not to be considered each a singularity. They have to coexist to be meaningful. Enlightenment or absolute truths, however, are independent.</p>

              <p>"You have a problem understanding English and you put words in my mouth.  That is despicable!  Which part of this sentence: "Buddhism began as a philosophy and became a religion." do you have a problem?"</p>
              <p>Yay! Ad hominem... Problem? No. You evading answering? Yes. To put it in simpler terms, you claimed Buddhism began as philosophy and became a religion, I asked you to proof.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This thread may be about religion - so what?  Is there such a thing as true religion?  Define true religion please!"</p>
              <p>You seemed to be implying religions are wrong. If your brand of Buddhism is a philosophy then make a new thread about the true philosophy if you like. Unlike you, I have many questions, not answers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If you have no idea why Siddharta Gotama left the palace, then I suggest you do</p>
              <p>Google search.  And if you know the answers why accused me of pretending?  You are pretentious!"</p>
              <p>You don't understand the burden of proof, do you? Another attempt pretending to know the answers... Btw, I never claimed or implied that I have answers. Oh, nice ad hominem...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S: Correct me if I'm wrong, truth and lie is not to be considered each a singularity. They have to coexist to be meaningful. Enlightenment or absolute truths, however, are independent.</p>
