              <p>To I no stupid:
                                                  
                                                  "There are, bhikkhus, other dhammas, deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, which the TathÄ�gata, having realized for himself with direct knowledge, propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the TathÄ�gata in accordance with reality would speak</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>"Then, monks, the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha VipassÄ« thought: "Suppose now I were to teach Dhamma?" And then he thought: [36] "I have attained to this Dhamma which is profound, hard to see, hard to grasp, peaceful, excellent, beyond reasoning,31 subtle, to be apprehended by the wise. But this generation delights in clinging,32 rejoices in it and revels in it. But for those who so delight, rejoice and revel in clinging this matter is hard to see, namely the conditioned nature of things,33 or dependent origination.34 Equally hard to see would be the calming of all the mental formations,35 the abandonment of all the substrates of rebirth,36 the waning of craving, dispassion, cessation and NibbÄ�na. And if I were to teach Dhamma to others and they did not understand me, that would be a weariness and a trouble to me."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>obviously "wisdom" does not mean "clever" since buddhism is not a truth comprehensible by the intellect but only through intuitive, experiential realization. there was once a low iq monk who attained arhantship, not because he was clever but because he was wise. on the other hand a lot of clever people dont attain enlightenment.</p>
              <p>By the way I noticed you said you are only concerned about what buddha said. But when I show you what buddha said, you say you cannot read them.
                                                  
                                                  What does this prove? You aren't even concerned about what buddha said! You are only concerned about protecting your false, ignorant views of buddhism which I have proven again and again to be baseless.</p>

              If buddhism is a philosophy comprehended by intellect and reasoning, this monk certainly could not have attained enlightenment:
              
              From a Teaching by Surya Das:
              
              One of my favorite stories is about the Arhat Chunda. He was quite stupid. When his brother became a monk, Chunda just wanted to do what his brother did. So he went to Ananda, Buddha's attendant. But holy Ananda said, "Sorry. You're too stupid." Ananda thought this kid was too stupid to become a monk because he couldn't remember the rules, the chants, the teachings. So the elder brother and his stupid little brother went to the Buddha, for the Buddha was extremely wise, kind, and compassionate. He scanned the past lives of this young, stupid boy, Chunda. He saw in there one tiny root of merit that could help him get enlightened. He said it didn't matter how dull-minded he was. It didn't matter that he couldn't memorize anything. It didn't matter if he could remember even one rule. The Buddha said to Ananda, "Ananda, you're not the Buddha, so you couldn't see that this kid can get enlightened. But I'm the Buddha and I'm going to ordain him because he can get enlightened. He has one good root of merit from a past life. He can do it, too. Watch over this little child." (This story always brings tears to my eyes.)
              
              So Buddha ordained the kid. The kid couldn't remember even one rule, or how to wear his robes. You know, it's complicated to be a monk. All the monks were studying and memorizing. There were a lot of teachings. There were 253 rules of monastic ordination. But the stupid, youthful Chunda couldn't remember anything.
              
              Finally, the brethren gave him the job of cleaning off the sandals of the monks. Chunda cleaned the sandals while the other monks were getting teachings. Since there weren't any books in those days, 2500 years ago in India, nothing was written down; the monks had to memorize the teachings. Chunda wanted to practice like the other monks, and get this enlightenment thing he heard about every day. So he asked the Buddha how he could get this enlightenment thing. The Buddha said, "When you're scraping mud and sweeping the floors, just think, 'Now I am purifying all the obscurations of the mind.'" So he gave him a little two-line verse. "With each cleaning of the sandals, I am cleaning off the obscurations of the shining, perfect mind." The Buddha asked him to repeat it. He repeated it. The Buddha said, "Can you remember that?" He said, "Yes."
              
              Then dumb Chunda went out and tried to repeat the verse. "With each scraping of the dirt, I am cleaning..." And he couldn't remember it. But he had good karma and had gentle Ananda around to remind him of the verse. Still, Chunda forgot again. Then Sariputra the learned came out, and Chunda asked him to remind him. Finally, the Buddha came back and said to Chunda, "Are you cleaning the sandals?" He said, "Yes." Buddha asked, "Are you cleaning the dust off the floor?" Chunda said, "Yes." And Buddha asked, "Have you cleaned the obscurations off the shining, perfect mind?" Suddenly Chunda was enlightened! He realized that the sandals with the dirt are still the sandals. The floor even with the dust is still the floor. Everything is just as it is. He became an arhat, a fully liberated sage.
              
              In those days, wherever the Buddha went, the people would always try to serve lunch, the main meal of the day, to him and the arhats. They thought if they gave Buddha lunch they would get the most merit, and if they gave the arhats lunch they would get almost as much merit. But if they couldn't catch any arhats, they would feed the ordinary monks and get a little less merit. Everyone knew how stupid Chunda was, and they didn't believe he was an enlightened arhat. But wherever Buddha went, he saved a seat for Chunda, because he said he was the purest-minded, least proud arhat. Purest-minded because he didn't know anything. And least proud because he was so simple, so humble, so undemanding and easy to be with.
              
              Unfortunately, we are not that stupid. We know too much. Or should I say, we think so much, we know so little. If we could just be ourselves, and take the path that is genuinely for us, it would be so easy. Imagine if Chunda was trying to become a Buddhist scholar, he never would have gotten enlightened. But he was content to clean the monks' shoes because he loved his brother and Buddha and the other monks. And it had to be done, so he did it. And he had a little teaching, a little verse that fit into that. That's why Thich Nhat Hanh gives everybody a little verse. He has a little verse for eating, for waking up, for toilet, for going to sleep, because one little verse can be enough to fully awaken you to the fullness and richness of the present moment.
              
              Spiritual life has nothing to do with how smart you are. In fact, being smart can be an obstacle. You can become proud and have more clutter in your brain.

              <p>Arbitrariness is a term given to choices and actions subject to individual will, judgment or preference, based solely upon an individual's opinion or discretion.[1][2]</p>
              <p>Arbitrary decisions are not necessarily the same as random decisions. For example, during the 1973 oil crisis, Americans were allowed to purchase gasoline only on odd-numbered days if their license plate was odd, and on even-numbered days if their license plate was even. The system was well-defined and not random in its restrictions; however, since license plate numbers are completely unrelated to a person's fitness to purchase gasoline, it was still an arbitrary division of people. Similarly, schoolchildren are often organized by their surname in alphabetical order, a non-random yet still arbitrary method, at least in cases where surnames are irrelevant.</p>

                                Honestly, I cannot read all the details.  Supernatural powers
                                were attributed to the Buddha.  I don't believed them. 
                                Because if I believed the Buddha had supernatural power, then I
                                have to believe many other gods/Gods which too have supernatural
                                powers - Brahma, Tua Pek Kong, Kitchen God, Creator-God, etc. and
                                especially the one with the power to send me to hell !!!!</p>
                                <p>Buddha is no god/God.  Until you hear his voice you cannot
                                say whatever that is written in the sutta is absolutely true. 
                                Did you hear the Buddha said "Buddha has clearly stated himself
                                that those who think his insights come from logical inferences and
                                that he is just an ordinary person, are heading for hell (due to
                                holding onto wrong view which is in itself bad karma)."?</p>
                                <p>Perhaps, you can try answering this question: Is the Buddha a
                                human being or some other kind of being?</p>

              Buddha has time and time again revealed, explained, and demonstrated his powers. But supernatural powers cannot overcome karmic force, and there is no creator God. As for        all those deities you mentioned probably exist but Buddhists aren't superstitious about them. But they certainly exist - just go to a taoist temple and see their medium being possessed, etc.
              
              Buddha was once a human being, that after enlightenment, transcended the human condition of suffering and delusion and is called "the awakened one".
              
              The sutta is absolutely true as pali suttas authenticity reliable and consistent, and by the way many suttas have talked about hell, karma, rebirth, supernatural powers which in your materialistic viewpoint does not exist, and therefore you have rejected some of the core teachings of buddha himself.

              <p>hmmm ... I say your question " ... you believe its confluent with Buddha's teaching?" is pathetic.  Many other teachings are in congruent with Buddha's but are those teachings uttered by Buddha?</p>

              After Shakyamuni buddha, the lineages of his buddha teachings continued on....
              
              Da Mo . . .
              The Indian Buddhist monk Da Mo Or as he is also known, Bodhidharma, Bodhitara, P'u-t'i Ta-mo, Ta-mo, Bodai Daruma, and Daruma to mention a few of his names... 
              
              "The essence of the Way is detachment. And the goal of those who practice is freedom from appearances." Taken from Bodhidharma's Wake-Up Sermon as translated by Red Pine. 
              
              Bodhidharma was born around 440 A.D. in Kanchi, the capital of the Southern Indian kingdom of Pallava. He was a Brahman by birth, the third child of King Sugandha, was a member of the Kshatriya or warrior caste, and had his childhood in Conjeeveram (also Kanchipuram or Kancheepuram), a Buddhist province south of Madras. He received his religious training from the Dhyana Master Prajnatara, and was considered very wise in the way of Dhyana or Zen practices. 
              
              Da Mo is said to also have been proficient in Kalaripayat (an ancient karate-like art that was influenced itself by vajramushti) which while including some weaponry included weaponless forms that were practiced in conjunction with the controlled breathing techniques of pranayama. Pranayama is part of the "Eightfold Path of Discipline" in Astanga yoga. 
              
              In most of East Asia, today, Da Mo is revered as the spiritual father of Zen Buddhism, having been the twenty-eighth patriarch after Sakyamuni (the historic Buddha) and the first patriarch of Zen Buddhism in China. He started what eventually became the Ch'an school of Buddhism in China. He is also the founder of a weaponless fighting art that was the precursor of modern-day martial arts. 
              
              During the Chinese Southern Liang dynasty [502-557 A.D.] the Emperor Liang Wu invited the Buddhist monk Da Mo to preach Buddhism in China. Da Mo arrived in China around 520 A.D., although accounts have it that he arrived during the Sung dynasty (420-479 A.D.), and eventually met Emperor Wu at Chin-ling (now Nanking). 
              
              When Da Mo met Emperor Wu, the Emperor asked, "What is the holy ultimate truth?" Da Mo answered, "It is Emptiness itself and there is nothing holy." "Who then is the one who at present stands confronting me," responded the Emperor? "I do not know (fushiki, pu-shih)!" was Da Mo's response. This now-famous question-and-answer dialogue "I know not," is considered a reverent allegory for explaining specific Zen tenets.
