              <p>I will not add or take away any aspect of the NEP. 
              However, to rank them in importance is quite tricky.  A
              practitioner would have to find his own way the order
              (sequence) of the 8 steps which he/she could achieved. 
              For instance, he/she might find it easiest to choose the right
              livelihood.  To perfect one's speech will take some training
              or mindfulness.  By choosing the right livelihood, it may help
              to perfect one's speech because the job doesn't involve having to
              tell lies!</p>

              <p>Yeah, certainly every step on the 8fold Path is important, but if I may add, I reckon that staying close to the teachings of the Buddha while traversing the 8fold Path is of especial importance. </p>
              <p>In the past, I'd met a teacher who told us that while meditation is important, knowing <strong>why</strong> you are meditating is just as important.  Otherwise, one could spend ten years being very disciplined in cross-legged contemplation and still get no where (unfortunately for me, this teacher didn't have much substantial to offer us by way of doctrine).  More recently, fellow Buddhists on the forum have also been emphasizing the importance of Right View.  It's really the first and foremost step on the Path and one that should continue to sustain us throughout our entire spiritual journey to awakening and freedom from suffering.</p>

                                exactly a disease, so I won't equate it with medicine. It will be

                                cancer to be an issue to philosophize about! To philosophize about
                                an issue is to think, to contemplate, to gain insight.  Also,
                                to philosophize does not mean just 'philosophizing' and nothing
                                else.  That is a very narrow take.  A serious thinker
                                will go beyond just postulating, and in his search for answer will
                                learn, discover, experiment, examine other's views and conduct

                                single one of them. No one can prove that they have spoken to
                                Buddha, am I right? Has anyone here attained full enligjhtenment?

                                none of you have realized the Truth yet, correct?  So that
                                means you are not enlightened yet, right? You have not reach

                                and say this is this and that is that? The basic fundimental truth

                                to first be fully enlightened like what the Buddha did, before you
                                can represent anyone's teaching and not before that.

              <p>actually the pali suttas are almost completely accurate depictions of the original words of the historical appearance of buddha (cant say for other canons but the pali canon are maintained by a tradition emphasizing on the authenticity of the original words of buddha), having an unbroken oral and textual tradition backdating to the buddha's times. comparing the various versions of the pali suttas we find almost no discrepencies and changes.</p>
              <p>that said, i have also verified what the buddha said through personal experience (im sure many can say the same) so it is not just faith and belief for me.</p>

              <p>Right view is the beginning and the end of the path, it simply means to see and to understand things as they really are and to realise the Four Noble Truth. As such, right view is the cognitive aspect of wisdom. It means to see things through, to grasp the impermanent and imperfect nature of worldly objects and ideas, and to understand the law of karma and karmic conditioning. <strong>Right view is not necessarily an intellectual capacity, just as wisdom is not just a matter of intelligence.</strong> Instead, right view is attained, sustained, and enhanced through all capacities of mind. It begins with the intuitive insight that all beings are subject to suffering and it ends with complete understanding of the true nature of all things. Since our view of the world forms our thoughts and our actions, right view yields right thoughts and right actions.</p>

              Buddha has clearly stated himself that those who think his insights come from logical inferences and that he is just an ordinary person, are heading for hell (due to holding onto wrong view which is in itself bad karma).
              
              He also stated that there is literally nothing he hasn't experienced, except the pure abode realms.
              
              So how can you say he is inexperienced?
              
              Incidentally, one of his three knowledges is his knowledge of his past lives. He recalled ninety one aeons of his past lives. His "knowledge of life" or more accurately "lives" certainly exceeds everybody. He is also admittedly "omniscient".
              
              Therefore, your statements have no basis at all.

              The sutta described the three knowledges that the buddha gained on his enlightenment, and that the 4nts are *discerned* "as it has come to be" in other words in experience and not via logical inference, reasoning or postulation:
              
              http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.027.than.html
              
              The Three Knowledges
              "With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives.[3] He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting,] 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details.
              
              "This, too, is called a footprint of the Tathagata, a scratch mark of the Tathagata, a tusk slash of the Tathagata, but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion, 'The Blessed One is rightly self-awakened; the Dhamma is well-taught by the Blessed One; the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly.'
              
              "With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees â€” by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human â€” beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings â€” who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views â€” with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings â€” who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views â€” with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus â€” by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human â€” he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.
              
              "This, too, is called a footprint of the Tathagata, a scratch mark of the Tathagata, a tusk slash of the Tathagata, but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion, 'The Blessed One is rightly self-awakened; the Dhamma is well-taught by the Blessed One; the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly.'
              
              "With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.'
              
              "This, too, is called a footprint of the Tathagata, a scratch mark of the Tathagata, a tusk slash of the Tathagata. A disciple of the noble ones has not yet come to conclusion, but he comes to the conclusion,[4] 'The Blessed One is rightly self-awakened; the Dhamma is well-taught by the Blessed One; the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly.'[5]
              
              "His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'
              
              "This, too, is called a footprint of the Tathagata, a scratch mark of the Tathagata, a tusk slash of the Tathagata, and it is here that a disciple of the noble ones has come to conclusion: 'The Blessed One is rightly self-awakened; the Dhamma is well-taught by the Blessed One; the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly.'"

              <p>Buddha has clearly stated himself that those who think his insights come from logical inferences and that he is just an ordinary person, are heading for hell (due to holding onto wrong view which is in itself bad karma).</p>
              <p>He also stated that there is literally nothing he hasn’t experienced, except the pure abode realms.</p>
              <p>So how can you say he is inexperienced?</p>
              <p>Incidentally, one of his three knowledges is his knowledge of his past lives. He recalled ninety one aeons of his past lives. His “knowledge of life” or more accurately “lives” certainly exceeds everybody. He is also admittedly “omniscient”.</p>
              <p>Therefore, your statements have no basis at all.</p>

              <p>You are referring to a recent post by @realization.  Honestly, I cannot read all the details.  Supernatural powers were attributed to the Buddha.  I don't believed them.  Because if I believed the Buddha had supernatural power, then I have to believe many other gods/Gods which too have supernatural powers - Brahma, Tua Pek Kong, Kitchen God, Creator-God, etc. and especially the one with the power to send me to hell !!!!</p>
              <p>Buddha is no god/God.  Until you hear his voice you cannot say whatever that is written in the sutta is absolutely true.  Did you hear the Buddha said "Buddha has clearly stated himself that those who think his insights come from logical inferences and that he is just an ordinary person, are heading for hell (due to holding onto wrong view which is in itself bad karma)."?</p>
              <p>Perhaps, you can try answering this question: Is the Buddha a human being or some other kind of being?</p>

              <p>I understand nothing by your claim that Buddhism started out as a philosophy <span>'but it didn't stop there'.  To begin with, I have thought of Buddhism as a set of teachings that help people to come to certain essential insights about the nature of experience, and that these teachings contain combined elements of psychology, philosophy, religion and method.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span>As I'd said previously, I like how Kenneth Folk has described Buddhism :-</span></p>
              <p><em><em>It's a religion and it's a philosophy and it's
                                      a psychology, but for me, all of that is secondary to what I think
                                      Buddhism really started out as; which is a technology for
                                      awakening.  And so I would say that everything else was for
                                      supporting this awakening; these practices that we do to
                                      awaken.</em></em></p>
