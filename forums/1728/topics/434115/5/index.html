              <p>Thank you for sharing the 'scientific' definition of religion.  Is this what most people understood religion to be?  Would Buddhism falls into this definition?</p>
              <p>I was using lie in the same way as truth was used (earlier).  Is there a link?  Is there a link between truth and religion [from the definition you borrowed?]</p>

              <p><span style="color: #990000; font-size: 12px;">This is one of many impressive thought. It deals directly and instaneously in the cause and effect of reincarnation, rebirth of realization and ultimate acutalization of buddha-self. The first &amp; second truth from Buddha for living beings is to discover the non-lovingkindness nature that they do not possess. Whereas, the Forth noble truth is for living beings to realize its inherent loving-kindness. And finally, just steadfastly dwell on loving-kindness, regardless the degree of your realisation and actualization. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> This is also very scientific and philosophical on the well beings for all.</span></p>

              <p>While loving-kindness is an important virtue and a sign of progress in one's practice, to emphasize loving-kindness over wisdom would be a mistake. Loving-kindness alone is a mundane virtue that leads to rebirth in the samsaric heaven, deva, or Brahma realms. Without wisdom it does not lead to liberation.</p>

              <p>Whoever is attached to a result for this life, is not a Dharma person.  The purpose of Dharma is liberation, not feeling better in this life.</p>
              <p>The purpose of Dharma is not the cultivation of mundane compassion, and so on. </p>
              <p>The purpose of Dharma is to control afflictions, then overcome them, and finally, to attain a state of total omniscience and freedom.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>I
                                  understand why many regarded Buddhism as not a ‘philosophy to begin
                                  with’.  Allow me to reiterate again: Buddhism began as a
                                  philosophy when I looked at its origin.  How Buddhism evolved
                                  and the subsequent developments, interpretations and degeneration
                                  is another matter.  If I take a hard look at Buddhism today, I
                                  would certainly call it a religion because of its many beliefs,
                                  rituals, mysticism, fairy tales, esotericism, reverence, worship,
                                  offering,  and even mysteries.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Prince
                                  Siddhartha was certainly delving on down-to-earth issues and not on
                                  some spirituality or higher knowledge or high-end ‘aero’ plane or
                                  esoteric experience.  That down-to-earth issues are also
                                  something present today and which many of us would philosophise
                                  about – why there is aging, sickness and death?  As a matter
                                  of fact, our daily to and fro is all about endeavours to overcome
                                  or mitigate these three aspects on top of many other social ills,
                                  problems and challenges.  If I can put Buddhism into a
                                  nutshell and strip it off its other shelves, it is about how to
                                  live the clean and good life.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In this respect, it is not different
                                  from many other philosophies and teachings of many great sages,
                                  including my late grandmother!</span></span></p>

                                  agree that theory without practice is of little use and emphasis
                                  should be on practice rather than just knowledge and no
                                  application, I cannot see <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">why this emphasis should
                                  disqualify</span></em></strong> Buddhism as a ‘philosophy to begin
                                  with’.  Let say you are not a Buddhist by inheritance
                                  (hand-down faith) or blind faith (those who embraced Buddhism by
                                  just following) and you do not know its teachings, practices, and
                                  so forth but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you want to
                                  be a ‘Buddhist’</span>.  Would you just walk into a Buddhist
                                  temple and say I want to be a Buddhist, take Refuge and viola!
                                  you’re a Buddhist?  If so, what motivates you?  Is it the
                                  knowledge, the practices or the experience?  You have none of
                                  these.  Or is it the external regalia, flags, chants, gongs,
                                  suttas, monks, nuns, golden temples, tooth relics?  Or do you
                                  look at its philosophy - the founder's thoughts?</span></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Not the founder's thoughts, but the founder's experiential insight, not just for you think about, but for you to actually *End suffering*.</p>
              <p>Lets say... you have an illness. A method is proven to work to heal/remove the illness. You go to that doctor, you take the medicine, consume according to instructions, and your illness is cured.</p>
              <p>This is like Buddhism. The four noble truths isn't just some thoughts... it's actually what the Buddha realized and observed through his own experience, the problem that plagues mankind (suffering), its cause, and its remedy.</p>
              <p>Philosophy is just one small component of Buddhism... just like philosophy (?) is not the main component of medicine, or science, or chemistry. For example, medicine has its own purpose, and the 'philosophy of medicine' if such things exist is not the main purpose of medicine which is to treat illnesses - people didn't invent medicine to make a philosophy out of it.</p>
              <p>Just like you can't say medicine, biology, physics, chemistry, art, maths, began as a philosophy. It's what people observe, tested, experienced, and then applied...</p>
              <p>Therefore see Buddhism as having a very specific purpose - to teach sentient beings their own condition and the remedy to their condition.</p>
              <p><strong>One main reason why Buddhism is not a philosophy in its essence, is because the truth of Buddhism does not derive from conceptual inference, but direct experience.</strong></p>

              <p>Lets say... you have an illness. A method is proven to work to heal/remove the illness. You go to that doctor, you take the medicine, consume according to instructions, and your illness is cured.</p>
              <p>This is like Buddhism. The four noble truths isn't just some thoughts... it's actually what the Buddha realized and observed through his own experience, the problem that plagues mankind (suffering), its cause, and its remedy.</p>
              <p>Philosophy is just one small component of Buddhism... just like philosophy (?) is not the main component of medicine, or science, or chemistry. For example, medicine has its own purpose, and the 'philosophy of medicine' if such things exist is not the main purpose of medicine which is to treat illnesses - people didn't invent medicine to make a philosophy out of it.</p>
              <p>Just like you can't say medicine, biology, physics, chemistry, art, maths, began as a philosophy. It's what people observe, tested, experienced, and then applied...</p>
              <p>Therefore see Buddhism as having a very specific purpose - to teach sentient beings their own condition and the remedy to their condition.</p>
              <p><strong>One main reason why Buddhism is not a philosophy in its essence, is because the truth of Buddhism does not derive from conceptual inference, but direct experience.</strong></p>

                                  existence.</span></strong><span style="color: #666666;"> </span>Dukkha is a 
                                  multi-faceted word. Its literal meaning is "that which is 
                                  difficult to bear". It can mean suffering, stress, pain, 
                                  anguish, affliction or unsatisfactoriness. Each of the English 
                                  words is either too strong or too weak in their meaning to be 
                                  a universally successful translation. Dukkha can be gross or very 
                                  subtle. From extreme physical and mental pain and torment to subtle 
                                  inner conflicts and existential malaise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><strong><span style="color: #666666;">2. 
                                  The Noble Truth that Dukkha has a causal arising.</span> </strong>This 
                                  cause is defined as grasping and clinging or aversion. On one 
                                  hand it is trying to control anything and everything by grabbing 
                                  onto or trying to pin them down, On the other hand it is control 
                                  by pushing away or pushing down and running away or flinching 
                                  away from things. It is the process of identification through 
                                  which we try to make internal and external things and experiences 
                                  into "me and mine" or wholly '"other" than 
                                  Me. This flies in the face of the three signs of existence - Anicca, 
                                  Dukkha. Anatta - Impermanence. Stress or Suffering and No-Self. 
                                  Because all conditioned existence is impermanent it gives rise 
                                  to Dukkha, and this means that in conditioned existence there 
                                  is no unchanging and permanent Self. There is nothing to grasp 
                                  onto and also in reality, nothing or no 'one' to do the grasping! 
                                  We grab onto or try to push away ever changing dynamic processes. 
                                  These attempts to control, limit us to little definitions of who 
                                  we are.</span></p>

                                  The Noble Truth of the end of Dukkha,</span></strong> which is Nirvana 
                                  or Nibbana. Beyond grasping and control and conditional existence 
                                  is Nirvana. "The mind like fire unbound." The realisation 
                                  of Nirvana is supreme Bodhi or Awakening. It is waking up to the 
                                  true nature of reality. It is waking up to our true nature. Buddha 
                                  Nature. The Pali Canon of Theravada, the foundational Buddhist 
                                  teachings, says little about Nirvana, using terms like the Unconditioned 
                                  the Deathless, and the Unborn. Mahayana teachings speak more about 
                                  the qualities of Nirvana and use terms like, True Nature, Original 
                                  Mind, Infinite light and Infinite life. Beyond space and time. 
                                  Nirvana defies definition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Nirvana literally 
                                  means "unbound' as in "Mind like fire unbound". 
                                  This beautiful image is of a flame burning by itself. Just the 
                                  flame, not something burning and giving off a flame. Picture a 
                                  flame burning on a wick or stick, it seems to hover around or 
                                  just above the thing burning. The flame seems to be independent 
                                  of the thing burning but it clings to the stick and is bound to 
                                  it. This sense of the flame being unbound has often been misunderstood 
                                  to mean the flame is extinguished or blown out. This is completely 
                                  opposite to the meaning of the symbol. The flame "burns" 
                                  and gives light but is no longer bound to any combustible material. 
                                  The flame is not blown out - the clinging and the clung to is 
                                  extinguished. The flame of our true nature, which is awakening, 
                                  burns independently. Ultimately Nirvana is beyond conception and 
                                  intellectual understanding. Full understanding only comes through 
                                  direct experience of this "state' which is beyond the limitations 
                                  and definitions of space and time.</span></p>

                                  The Noble Truth of the Path that leads to Awakening.</span></strong> The path is a paradox. It is a conditioned thing that is said 
                                  to help you to the unconditioned. Awakening is not "made" 
                                  by anything: it is not a product of anything including the Buddha's 
                                  teachings. Awakening, your true nature is already always present. 
                                  We are just not awake to this reality. Clinging to limitation, 
                                  and attempts to control the ceaseless flow of phenomena and process 
                                  obscures our true nature.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><strong><span style="color: #666666;">The 
                                  path is a process</span></strong><span style="color: #666666;"> </span>to help 
                                  you remove or move beyond the conditioned responses that obscure 
                                  your true nature. In this sense the Path is ultimately about unlearning 
                                  rather than learning - another paradox. We learn so we can unlearn 
                                  and uncover. The Buddha called his teaching a Raft. To cross a 
                                  turbulent river we may need to build a raft. When built, we single-mindedly 
                                  and with great energy make our way across. Once across we don't 
                                  need to cart the raft around with us. In other words don't cling 
                                  to anything including the teachings. However, make sure you use 
                                  them before you let them go. It's no use knowing everything about 
                                  the raft and not getting on. The teachings are tools not dogma. 
                                  The teachings are <em>Upaya</em>, which means skillful means or 
                                  expedient method. It is fingers pointing at the moon - don't confuse 
                                  the finger for the moon.</span></p>

                                  absorption or one-pointedness of mind. None of these translations 
                                  is adequate. Samadhi literally means to be fixed, absorbed in 
                                  or established at one point, thus the first level of meaning is 
                                  concentration when the mind is fixed on a single object. The second 
                                  level of meaning goes further and represents the establishment, 
                                  not just of the mind, but also of the whole being in various levels 
                                  or modes of consciousness and awareness. This is Samadhi in the 
                                  sense of enlightenment or Buddhahood.</span></p>

                                  The word Samma </span></strong>means 'proper', 'whole', 'thorough', 
                                  'integral', 'complete', and 'perfect' - related to English 'summit' 
                                  - It does not necessarily mean 'right', as opposed to 'wrong'. 
                                  However it is often translated as "right" which can 
                                  send a less than accurate message. For instance the opposite of 
                                  'Right Awareness' is not necessarily 'Wrong Awareness'. It may 
                                  simply be incomplete. Use of the word 'right' may make for a neat 
                                  or consistent list of qualities in translations. The down side 
                                  is that it can give the impression that the Path is a narrow and 
                                  moralistic approach to the spiritual life. I use variant interpretations 
                                  so you consider the depth of meanings. What do these things mean 
                                  in your life right now?</span></p>

              <p><br>I am using from social science definition because it can be applied generally, universally. To make things easy to categorize, buddhism will fall under this category. Easy to relate to people or identify with.</p>
              <p>But AEN has already got better explanation. I think most people (non-buddhists) would have difficulty understanding it. Social science perspective is more neutral. You can stick to your view whatever. It's your choice.</p>

              <p>The basic fact of awareness is already fully present and complete.</p>
              <p>Contemplate on this:</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 100%;">There
               are many things that I can doubt, but I cannot doubt my own 
              consciousness in this moment. My consciousness IS, and even if I tried 
              to doubt it, it would be my consciousness doubting. I can imagine that 
              my senses are being presented with a fake reality – say, a completely 
              virtual reality or digital reality, which looks real but is merely a 
              series of extremely realist images. But even then, I cannot doubt the 
              consciousness that is doing the watching…<br><br>The very undeniability 
              of my present awareness, the undeniability of my consciousness, 
              immediately delivers to me a certainty of existence in this moment, a 
              certainty of Being in the now-ness of this moment. I cannot doubt 
              consciousness and Being in this moment, for it is the ground of all 
              knowing, all seeing, all existing…<br><br>Who am I? Ask that question over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is it in me that is conscious of everything?<br><br>If
               you think that you know Spirit, or if you think you don’t, Spirit is 
              actually that which is thinking both of those thoughts. So you can doubt
               the objects of consciousness, but you can never believably doubt the 
              doubter, never really doubt the Witness of the entire display. 
              Therefore, rest in the Witness, whether it is thinking that it knows God
               or not, and that witnessing, that undeniable immediacy of 
              now-consciousness, is itself God, Spirit, Buddha-mind. The certainty 
              lies in the pure self-felt Consciousness to which objects appear, not in
               the objects themselves. You will never, never, never see God, because 
              God is the Seer, not any finite, mortal, bounded object that can be 
              seen…<br><br>This pure I AM state is not hard to achieve but impossible 
              to escape, because it is ever present and can never really be doubted. 
              You can never run from Spirit, because Spirit is the Runner. To put it 
              very bluntly, Spirit is not hard to find but impossible to avoid: it is 
              that which is looking at this page right now. Can’t you feel That One? 
              Why on earth do you keep looking for God when God is actually the 
              Looker?<br><br>Simply ask, Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?<br><br>I am 
              aware of my feelings, so I am not my feelings – Who am I? I am aware of 
              my thoughts, so I am not my thoughts – Who am I? Clouds float by in the 
              sky, thoughts float by in the mind, feelings float by in the body – and I
               am none of those because I can Witness them all.<br><br>Moreover, I can
               doubt that clouds exist, I can doubt that feelings exist, I can doubt 
              that objects of thought exist – but I cannot doubt that the Witness 
              exists in this moment, because the Witness would still be there to 
              witness the doubt.<br><br>I am not objects in nature, not feelings in 
              the body, not thoughts in the mind, for I can Witness them all. I am 
              that Witness – a vast, spacious, empty, clear, pure, transparent 
              Openness that impartially notices all that arises, as a mirror 
              spontaneously reflects all its objects…<br><br>You can already feel some
               of this Great Liberation in that, as you rest in the ease of witnessing
               this moment, you already feel that you are free from the suffocating 
              constriction of mere objects, mere feelings, mere thoughts – they all 
              come and go, but you are that vast, free, empty, open Witness of them 
              all, untouched by their torments and tortures.<br><br>This is actually 
              the profound discovery of… the pure divine Self, the formless Witness, 
              causal nothingness, the vast Emptiness in which the entire world arises,
               stays a bit, and passes. And you are That. You are not the body, not 
              the ego, not nature, not thoughts, not this, not that – you are a vast 
              Emptiness, Freedom, Release, and Liberation.<br><br>With this discovery…
               you are halfway home. You have disidentified from any and all finite 
              objects; you rest as infinite Consciousness. You are free, open, empty, 
              clear, radiant, released, liberated, exalted, drenched in a blissful 
              emptiness that exists prior to space, prior to time, prior to tears and 
              terror, prior to pain and mortality and suffering and death. You have 
              found the great Unborn, the vast Abyss, the unqualifiable Ground of all 
              that is, and all that was, and all that ever shall be.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">But why is that only halfway home? </span>Because
               as you rest in the infinite ease of consciousness, spontaneously aware 
              of all that is arising, there will soon enough come the great 
              catastrophe of Freedom and Fullness: the Witness itself will disappear 
              entirely, and instead of witnessing the sky, you are the sky; instead of
               touching the earth, you are the earth; instead of hearing the thunder, 
              you are the thunder. You and the entire Kosmos because One Taste – you 
              can drink the Pacific Ocean in a single gulp, hold Mt. Everest in the 
              palm of your hand; supernovas swirl in your heart and the solar system 
              replaces your head…<br><br>You are One Taste, the empty mirror that is 
              one with any and all objects that arise in its embrace, a mindlessly 
              vast translucent expanse: infinite, eternal, radiant beyond release. And
               you… are… That…<br><br>So the primary Cartesian dualism – which is 
              simply the dualism between… in here and out there, subject and object, 
              the empty Witness and all things witnessed – is finally undone and 
              overcome in nondual One Taste. Once you actually and fully contact the 
              Witness, then – and only then – can it be transcended into radical 
              Nonduality, and halfway home becomes fully home, here in the 
              ever-present wonder of what is…<br><br>And so how do you know that you 
              have finally and really overcome the Cartesian dualism? Very simple: if 
              you really overcome the Cartesian dualism, then you no longer feel that 
              you are on this side of your face looking at the world out there. There 
              is only the world, and you are all of that; you actually feel that you 
              are one with everything that is arising moment to moment. You are not 
              merely on this side of your face looking out there. “In here” and “out 
              there” have become One Taste with a shuddering obviousness and certainty
               so profound it feels like a five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It
               is, shall we say, a feeling hard to miss.<br><br>At that point, which 
              is actually your ever-present condition, there is no exclusive identity 
              with this particular organism, no constriction of consciousness to the 
              head, a constriction that makes it seem that “you” are in the head 
              looking at the rest of the world out there; there is no binding of 
              attention to the personal bodymind: instead, consciousness is one with 
              all that is arising – a vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely 
              Free and infinitely Full expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so 
              that every single subject and every single object are erotically united 
              in the Great Embrace of One Taste. You disappear from merely being 
              behind your eyes, and you become the All, you directly and actually feel
               that your basic identity is everything that is arising moment to moment
               (just as previously you felt that your identity was with this finite, 
              partial, separate, mortal coil of flesh you call a body). Inside and 
              outside have become One Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like that!<br><br>(Source:

              <p><br>I am using from social science definition because it can be applied generally, universally. To make things easy to categorize, buddhism will fall under this category. Easy to relate to people or identify with.</p>
              <p>But AEN has already got better explanation. I think most people (non-buddhists) would have difficulty understanding it. Social science perspective is more neutral. You can stick to your view whatever. It's your choice.</p>

              <p>The definition you have taken maybe just one social scientist's definition of religion. Are you sure it is universally agreed by ALL social scientists?  You did not answer my question on whether this is the definition most people would see religion as.  Nowhere in the definition does it include morality.  How do you reconcile this with what most religions would include?</p>
              <p>AEN has not defined religion.  I would like to know what explanation.</p>
              <p>I can see that no one here will change his/her view posted here.  Therefore, don't you think it is wasting words to tell people they can stick to their views?</p>
