              <p>Of course 4nt sounds logical, but the truth certainly isn't derived from logic. Enlightenment means to realize truth in direct experience. Knowing this by logic alone is pointless!</p>
              <p>I.E. Why does craving and clinging cause suffering? It is simply realized to be so! This is the nature of experience! There is no deep logic to it, you simply realize that this is how experience unfolds via dependent origination.</p>
              <p>What is the truth of the end of suffering? Obviously this can only be discovered in direct experience! Only a person who has ended suffering such as Buddha is able to describe the truth about nirvana!</p>
              <p>What is the truth of the path that ends suffering? Again, obviously only someone who has walked this path will be able to describe it. Just like doctors don't just produce medicine out of their imagination, they had to test it on someone first.</p>
              <p>As for supernatural powers and rebirth, I think it is hardly unbelievable. There are countless research studies on children's past lives by scientists like dr ian stevensons whose studies were published in well known scientific and medical journals. These childrens' past lives could be traced and proven to be true.</p>
              <p>There are also a lot of people even today who has experiences with powers, recalling of past lives etc, even in this forum. But I digress. But I have to say powers are a very common thing in Buddhism but fortunately/unfortunately, there is a rule by Buddha that monks cannot openly display powers to lay persons. Why? I guess its because he didn't want buddhists to sidetrack and turn buddhism into a circus.</p>

              lols.....that is so well expressed.  Unfortunately Lu Sheng Yen has turned Buddhism into a cult using supernatural stories to lure ignorant into his True Buddha School.

              <p>If you read European history, there was a struggle to separate Church from State. Thank 'God' the struggle succeeded and both Church and State stays at arms' length, not embracing each other!</p>

              <p>//I don't mean that all monks can don't eat. Some can, some cannot.//</p>
              <p>You mean there are 'eating' monks and 'non-eating' monks?  How do you distinguish them when you offer dana?</p>
              <p>//I doubt hungry children would want to spend years meditating. They rather want an immediate solution such as real food.//</p>
              <p>So meditation is dummy food?  How do you know hungry children won't meditate?  If they can be full and not hungry by meditation ... that is better - no need to ask for food aid.</p>
