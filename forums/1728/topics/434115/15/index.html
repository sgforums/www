              <p>I have always answered you unfailingly. But it seems like your questions are getting pointless.</p>
              <p>Buddhas and monks can don't eat if they have that yogic ability. Not all monks have that yogic ability. The 16 year old Buddha boy in the Discovery channel documentary is an example of someone who can choose not to eat, and actually does not eat for 6 years. There are others like Prahlad Jnani, etc. It is actually quite common for yogis.</p>
              <p>I did not say Buddha did not eat. I said, he can choose not to eat, but he chooses to eat in order to act normal.</p>

              <p>96 hours is 4 days.  Have you not heard of survivor in a disaster who hadn't eaten or drunk for more than 7 days which is the 'medical' limit.</p>
              <p>I contend that Buddha's choosing to eat or not to eat (as you put it) is a fallacy.</p>

              <p>I am disproving that the boy is a wonder!  A survivor trapped in a collapsed building is in far worse conditions than the show drama that was filmed.  You are very naive as compared to my "narrow-mindedness"!</p>

              <p>how many meals a person partake is not an issue and for that matter is there a standard? a glutton may eat all day.  a cow has to graze all day.  a python doesn't eat for weeks after swallowing a goat.</p>
              <p>I can do with one meal a day if that meal is a buffet spread lasting 2 hours!</p>
              <p>let's get real and not wishy-washy.  if Buddha or bodhisattva (as human beings) can live without food, we have an answer to starvation problem for this world. if they are divine beings I can accept that they don't eat.  You get the point?</p>

              <p><strong>According to the <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Guinness Book of Records" href="/wiki/Guinness_Book_of_Records"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Guinness Book of Records</span></span></a></em> the longest time a human has survived without water is 18 days.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> Bomjon, on the other hand, does not appear to break his meditation to eat or drink.</strong></p>
              <p>Skeptics point out that claims of surviving after several month fasting are unsubstantiated <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> as a screen was placed in front of him between dusk and dawn; they also claim that, besides the lack of proof, such a feat would be physically impossible. Bomjon was observed remaining at the tree at least during the daytime, though no one was allowed to approach him too closely. <strong>Under such circumstances, he could have eaten at night when no one could have witnessed his doing so.</strong></p>
              <p>Some supporters believe that claims of <a title="Inedia" href="/wiki/Inedia"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">inedia</span></span></a> are less relevant than Bomjon's undisputed ability to remain nearly motionless in the same position day after day, with no regard for extremes of weather including a cold winter and a monsoon season. For example, American writer <a title="George Saunders" href="/wiki/George_Saunders"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">George Saunders</span></span></a> visited Bomjon and observed him through a single night, and was impressed by Bomjon's perfectly still stature, even during an evening climate that seemed unbearably cold to the much better clothed journalist.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In December 2005, a nine-member government committee led by Gunjaman Lama watched Bomjon carefully for 48 hours and observed him not to take any food or water during that time. A video recording was also made of this test. However, they were unable to approach closer than 3 meters or take readings of his vital signs.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup>The Nepalese government planned a more careful scientific study, but the study was never carried out.</p>
              <p><strong>In 2006, </strong><a title="Discovery Channel" href="/wiki/Discovery_Channel"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Discovery Channel</strong></span></span></a><strong> showed a 45-minute documentary titled <em>The Boy With Divine Powers</em>. One of the aims was to establish whether Ram was indeed abstaining from all sustenance, water included, by filming him continuously for four days and nights.</strong> On their first attempt, in January 2006, the film crew was required to stay outside a guarded barbed-wire fence, and their camera's <a title="Infrared" href="/wiki/Infrared"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">infrared</span></span></a> capabilities did not pick up evidence of a body at the base of the tree where Bomjon sat during their non-stop recording. On a second attempt a few weeks later, however,<strong> the film crew was able to film Ram continuously for 96 hours, day and night, during which time he did not change his position and did not drink any fluids or eat any food. As Discovery Channel's commentator concluded: "After 96 hours of filming, Ram has defied modern science by continuing his meditation and remaining alive."</strong> <strong>According to scientists on the documentary, <em>an average person would be expected to die from kidney failure after four days without drinking any fluids</em> (although cases of inedia lasting for a whole week have been observed and the recorded Guinness World Record of inedia is eighteen days). The boy showed no signs of classical physical deterioration caused by dehydration. A close inspection by the film crew of the area around the tree where Ram was sitting revealed no hidden food supply or water pipes</strong>.</p>
              <p>In 2008, Min Bahadur Shakya of the <a title="Nagarjuna" href="/wiki/Nagarjuna"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Nagarjuna</span></span></a> Institute of Exact Methods in Kathmandu, stated that Buddhist priests have yet to investigate Ram.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>
