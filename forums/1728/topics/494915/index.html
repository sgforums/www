              Children</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">BD Dipananda Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-10-30 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Venerable Hui Li, a Buddhist monk from Taiwan, is raising
              thousands of underprivileged children from several southern African countries,
              who are now growing up at Amitofo Care Centres (ACCs). Many of the children
              staying at the ACCs came from remote villages and became orphans after their
              parents died of HIV/Aids. Alone, the children were missing the care of a loving
              family and had little access to proper food and healthcare. Observing this
              situation first hand on a visit to the continent in 1992, Venerable Li decided
              to establish the ACCs, which include orphanages, schools, and clinics, to
              provide the necessary livelihood for those children.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The guiding principles that lie at the core of the ACCs draw
              on local African culture, Chinese culture, and Buddhist philosophy. The
              children also learn Chinese as part of their curriculum, to help them secure a
              future. The Chinese language is becoming more important in today’s world, and
              learning Chinese may provide the children with the means of obtaining a good
              job and to end the cycle of poverty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ven. Li is an advocate for humanistic Buddhism, a new
              religious movement that originated in Chinese Buddhism, and is one of the
              founding members of the African Buddhist College, which has trained more than
              500 monastics from the Congo, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, South
              Africa,  Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> “I am truly grateful
              to Venerable Hui Li and to everyone who has contributed positively to the
              propagation of Buddhism in Africa as it has not only given me an opportunity to
              study and practice the profound teachings of the Buddha, but has also enabled
              many students from across Africa to study the Dharma,” said Ven. Ben Xing, a
              Buddhist monk who grew up in the ACC in Malawi, in an article he wrote for
              Buddhistdoor Global. “Buddhism still needs more support in terms of local
              pioneers who understand the teachings and its concepts on a deeper level and
              who can pass them on to others.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The first ACC was established in Malawi 12 years ago and now
              houses 500 children. ACCs have also opened in a number of other African
              countries, including Burkina Faso, Gambia, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and and
              there are plans to open more in the region. The ACCs include dormitories for
              children and youths, a kindergarten, preparatory school, library, medical
              center, vocational training center, religious center, kung fu training center,
              and more. Not all the centers have a high school, for instance the center in
              Swaziland, so the children go to a secondary school in the area. The ACCs are
              associated with two charity organizations; the Yuan Tong Culture and Care
              Association and the ACC African Executive Association, which continuously
              organize and manage ACC activities. Most of the funding for the centers—70 per
              cent—comes from donors in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The ACCs are organized like a “big family” or a “children’s
              village.” Groups of 16–20 children stay together, living under one roof with
              one nanny or one “mommy,” and one childcare teacher. These adults manage the
              home and take care of the children.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To date, the ACCs have adopted some 8,000 children, who live
              at the centers until they reach 18, when they go university or on to other
              vocational training. Twenty-six students from the center in Malawi are
              currently studying in universities in Taiwan, and according to forecasts, the
              centers in Lesotho and Swaziland, which have been running for five and six
              years respectively, will have similar numbers.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Through a “sponsor parents” scheme, people can support the
              children financially throughout their secondary and tertiary education. Last
              August, some sponsor parents in Malaysia had the chance to meet the children
              they sponsored when they visited Malaysia for a cultural program. “These
              children are here to show gratitude to their sponsor parents and let them know about
              their wellbeing,” said Kimmy Wong, vice-secretary of ACCs Malaysia.</span></p>
