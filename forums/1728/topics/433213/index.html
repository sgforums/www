              <p>During my first weeks with my teacher, Ajaan Fuang, I began to 
              realize that he had psychic powers. He never made a show of them, but I 
              gradually sensed that he could read my mind and anticipate future 
              events. I became intrigued: What else did he know? How did he know it? 
              He must have detected where my thoughts were going, for one evening he 
              gently headed me off: "You know," he said, "the whole aim of our 
              practice is purity of heart. Everything else is just games."</p>
              <p>That one phrase — purity of heart — more than intrigued me. It 
              reverberated deep down inside. Although I was extremely disillusioned 
              with Christianity, I still valued Kierkegaard's dictum: Purity of heart 
              is to will one thing. I didn't agree with Kierkegaard as to what that 
              "one thing" was, but I did agree that purity of heart is the most 
              important treasure of life. And here Ajaan Fuang was offering to teach 
              me how to develop it. That's one of the reasons why I stayed with him 
              until he died.</p>
              <p>His basic definition of purity of heart was simple enough: a 
              happiness that will never harm anyone. But a happiness like that is hard
               to find, for ordinary happiness requires that we eat. As the first of 
              the Novice's Questions says: "What is one? All beings subsist on food." 
              This is how the Buddha introduced the topic of causality to young 
              people: The primary causal relationship isn't something gentle like 
              light reflecting off mirrors, or jewels illuminating jewels. It's 
              feeding. Our bodies need physical food for their well-being. Our minds 
              need the food of pleasant sensory contacts, intentions, and 
              consciousness itself in order to function. If you ever want proof that 
              interconnectedness isn't always something to celebrate, just contemplate
               how the beings of the world feed on one another, physically and 
              emotionally. Interbeing is inter-eating. As Ajaan Suwat, my second 
              teacher once said, "If there were a god who could arrange that by my 
              eating I could make everyone in the world full, I'd bow down to that 
              god." But that's not how eating works.</p>
              <p>Ordinarily, even well-intentioned people may not see eating as 
              harmful. We're so compelled to eat that we blind ourselves to its larger
               impact. Our first pleasure, after the terror of being born, was getting
               to feed. We did it with our eyes closed, and most people keep their 
              eyes closed to the impact of their feeding throughout life.</p>
              <p>But when you go to a quiet, secluded place and start examining your 
              life, you begin to see what an enormous issue it is just to keep the 
              body and mind well fed. On the one hand, you see the suffering you 
              create for others simply in your need to feed. On the other, you see 
              something even more dismaying: the emotions that arise within you when 
              you don't feel that your body and mind are getting enough to eat. You 
              realize that as long as your source of physical or mental food is 
              unreliable, <em>you're</em> unreliable, too. You see why even good people 
              can reach a point where they're capable of murder, deceit, adultery, or 
              theft. Being born with a body means that we're born with a huge bundle 
              of needs that compels and can overwhelm our minds.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, we human beings have the potential to civilize our 
              eating habits by learning to wean ourselves from our passion for the 
              junk food of sights, sounds, smells, etc., and look instead for good 
              food within. When we learn to appreciate the joy that comes from 
              generosity, honor, compassion, and trust, we see that it's much more 
              fulfilling than the pleasure that comes simply from grabbing what we can
               for ourselves. We realize that our happiness can't be independent of 
              the happiness of others. We can give one another our belongings, our 
              time, our love, our selves, and see it not as a loss but as a mutual 
              gain.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, <strong>these qualities of the heart are conditional</strong>, for they
               depend on a tender web of beliefs and feelings — belief in justice and 
              the basic goodness of human nature, feelings of trust and affection. 
              When that web breaks, as it so easily can, the heart can turn vicious. 
              We see this in divorce, broken families, and society at large. When the 
              security of our food source — the basis of our mental and material 
              well-being — gets threatened, the finer qualities of the mind can 
              vanish. People who believe in kindness can suddenly seek revenge. Those 
              who espouse non-violence can suddenly call for war. And those who rule 
              by divisiveness — by making a mockery of compassion, prudence, and our 
              common humanity — find a willing following for their law-of-the-jungle 
              agenda.</p>
              <p>This is why compassion based only on belief or feeling is not enough 
              to guarantee our behavior — and why the practice of training the mind to
               reach an unconditioned happiness is not a selfish thing. If you value 
              compassion and trust, it's an imperative, for only an unconditioned 
              happiness can guarantee the purity of your behavior. Independent of 
              space and time, it's beyond alteration. No one can threaten its food 
              source, for it has no need to feed. When you've had even just a glimpse 
              of this happiness, your belief in goodness becomes unshakable. That way 
              other people can totally trust you, and you can genuinely trust 
              yourself. You lack for nothing.</p>
              <p>Purity of heart is to know this one thing.</p>
