              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This is a
                  unique time in the history of Buddhism. Different Buddhist traditions are
                  meeting and interacting with one another here in the West, often for the first
                  time in centuries. Just as the dharma spread from India through many countries
                  in Asia, each one finding its own voice, here, too, we're seeing the emergence
                  of a Western Buddhism, something that is unique to our own time and culture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The defining
                  characteristic of this emerging Western Buddhism is a basic pragmatism, rather
                  than an adherence to some philosophical system or sectarian viewpoint. What
                  most characterizes the One Dharma of the West is an allegiance to a very simple
                  question: What works? What works to free the mind from suffering? What works to
                  accomplish the heart of compassion? What works to awaken us from the dream
                  states of our ignorance?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As Western
                  Buddhist practitioners, we've been brought up to question and investigate, and
                  this exploration can become a great strength of our dharma practice. The
                  different teachings that are coming together and interacting here in the West
                  are being tested and challenged by each other. We're hearing different
                  teachings, we're reflecting on them, and we're practicing them and testing them
                  in our own lives, in our own meditation experience. Many of us are practicing
                  in several of these different traditions. It's not uncommon for people to list
                  as their various teachers Tibetan Rinpoches, Chinese, Korean, or Japanese Zen
                  masters, Thai ajaans, Burmese sayadaws, and Western teachers of every school.
                  We may have various opinions about whether or not this mixing is a good idea,
                  but it <em>is</em> what is happening. And so our challenge is to understand it
                  and craft it in such a way that it becomes a vehicle for awakening.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As these
                  ancient traditions meet, pressing questions emerge. Is the melting pot approach
                  simply creating a big mess? Or is something new emerging that will revitalize
                  dharma practice for us all? How much of our spiritual practice and discipline
                  is embedded in cultural overlays from the East that are neither relevant nor
                  helpful to us in our Western society? And on the other hand, do we sometimes
                  water down, or even leave behind, the essence of the teachings simply because
                  they take us beyond our Western physical or psychological comfort zone? How
                  much can we pare away or alter before we start missing the point of it all?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Other
                  questions, too, more personal and immediate, arose as I began my exploration of
                  different traditions: What do you do when two of your most respected and
                  beloved teachers say opposite things about that which is most important to you?
                  What to do when you come to a fork in the road and both signposts seem to be
                  pointing in the right direction? As I struggled with these dilemmas, one
                  question began to emerge: Is there One Dharma of liberation, One Dharma of
                  freedom, that embraces all the viewpoints, even apparently contradictory ones?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In considering
                  this question—Is there One Dharma underlying the various teachings and
                  schools?—the first step for all of us is a willingness to let go of sectarian
                  viewpoints. If we hold on to the idea that our way is the best, the highest,
                  the fastest, the truest, it becomes impossible to consider a One Dharma of freedom.
                  David Brinkley wrote a book with a wonderful title that captures the irony of
                  the sectarian stance. The title of the book is: <em>Everyone Is Entitled to My
                  Opinion</em>. And often we go through life with just that bias.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>For many years
                  I studied in the Theravada tradition, practicing vipassana meditation in India
                  and Burma. Then, ten years ago, I also began some practice and study of Tibetan
                  dzogchen meditation, with two very great dzogchen masters, Tulku Urgyen
                  Rinpoche and Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche. They were wonderful beings and tremendously
                  inspiring. But especially in that first year, as I was beginning this new
                  practice, I was tormented by the comparing mind. Some Theravada teachings
                  seemed quite different from the Tibetan teachings I was hearing. I was caught
                  in the dilemma of trying to judge which was right, and then wondering how I
                  could know? I went back and forth. Some Zen literature describes koan practice
                  as swallowing a red hot iron ball that you can neither expel nor digest, and
                  that's what this dilemma felt like to me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>After a month
                  of intense questioning—Who's right? Which teachings are true?—my mind came to a
                  sudden resolution, providing the framework for understanding the possibility of
                  One Dharma. It was the understanding that all the teachings, all the words, all
                  the sutras, are skillful means for liberating the mind, rather than statements
                  of absolute truth. When we take words to be statements of ultimate truth, then
                  differences of opinion will inevitably result in conflict. This is where ideological
                  wars come from, and we see in the history of the world an endless amount of
                  suffering because of it. But if we see the words and the teachings as different
                  skillful means for liberating the mind, then they all become part of a great
                  dharma feast. How can I use this teaching to free my mind? How can I use this
                  to open my heart?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>All the
                  Buddhist traditions converge in one understanding of what liberates the mind.
                  It is summed up very succinctly in one teaching of the Buddha: "Nothing
                  whatsoever is to be clung to as 'I' or 'mine.' Whoever has heard this has heard
                  all the teachings. Whoever practices this has practiced all the teachings.
                  Whoever realizes this has realized all the teachings." Nothing whatsoever
                  is to be clung to as "I" or "mine." Non-clinging can be
                  understood on two levels. The first level is non-clinging as a non-sectarian
                  instruction for practice. What to do? Don't cling. There's no Buddhist school
                  that says, "Cling." How to practice in the world? Don't cling. It
                  hardly matters what form we build around that. We can not-cling in a Tibetan
                  house, we can not-cling in a Zen house, we can not-cling in a Theravada house.
                  The essence of One Dharma is the same. But non-clinging is not only an
                  instruction of practice. On the second level, it is also a description of the
                  awakened mind. If we want to know what enlightenment is like, what awakening is
                  like, we can practice the mind of non-clinging, non-fixation, nonattachment to
                  anything at all. It's the mind of open groundlessness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So how can we
                  practice this? How do we practice the mind of non-clinging? Clearly, the more
                  quickly we recognize where we do cling, the more quickly we can relax the mind
                  into that space of openness, of ease, of freedom. And the Buddha was very
                  helpful in pointing out where we do cling, just in case we're missing it. The
                  first arena of clinging is the obvious one: we cling to pleasant experience. We
                  like what's pleasant. We like pleasant sights and sounds and tastes, pleasant
                  sensations in the body, pleasant feelings. We like pleasant meditative states.
                  There's no problem with the pleasantness of them; it's part of our life
                  experience. The problem is that we often devote our life energy to the getting,
                  sustaining, accumulation, and repeating of these pleasant experiences. It's as
                  if our life revolves around getting one more hit of pleasantness. But, as we
                  all know, these pleasant experiences don't last, so they don't really have the
                  capacity to bring us happiness, to bring us completion, to bring us
                  fulfillment. We're always seeking more—that's samsara, the endless wheel of
                  becoming, fueled by wanting. The force of desire is not just a trivial habit;
                  the habit of wanting what's pleasant is rooted so deeply in our conditioning.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>At one point I
                  had been practicing in India for quite some time, and as can happen in times of
                  long-term, intensive meditation, my mind had become very open, clear, and
                  shining; my body was open, the energy flowing. It was the kind of sitting where
                  you think you will get enlightened any minute. I was happily in that state,
                  sitting away, waiting for the big moment...and then the tea bell rang. What was
                  served for tea in the evening was a cup of tea and a very small banana. So I'm
                  sitting in this glorious state and the tea bell rings. What is my first thought?
                  "I need my banana." And, sure enough, I got up from my
                  "enlightenment-in-the-next-moment sitting" and went for the momentary
                  pleasant experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Even someone
                  as remarkable as His Holiness the Dalai Lama speaks of the strong force of
                  desire in the mind. He told one story at a conference in Los Angeles. Every day
                  on the way to the conference, he was driven down a street with shops selling
                  the newest technological toys. As you know, he has a great interest in the
                  latest technologies. On the last day of the conference, he recounted what had
                  been going on in his mind as he was being driven past these stores. He said
                  that by the end of the week he found himself wanting some of these things,
                  although he didn't even know what they were.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Again, it's
                  not that there's a problem with having pleasant experience—it's just part of
                  our lives. But when we make it the focal point of our lives, it becomes the
                  basis for tremendous frustration, because it can never fulfill its promise for
                  happiness. At the time of death, what meaning will all the various pleasant
                  experiences have? What really will be of value at that time? What will be of
                  most value is the ability of the mind to not hold on, to not grasp, to not
                  cling. But we can't wait until the time of death to accomplish this. We need to
                  practice it now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The second
                  arena of clinging that the Buddha pointed out is one that has tremendous
                  consequences both in our own lives and in the world. This is the attachment we
                  have to our views and opinions about things. We're very attached to our own
                  points of view. We're attached to being right. What's so amazing is that we're
                  often attached to our opinions regarding things we know nothing about. But that
                  does not seem to weaken our attachment.</span></p>

                  this attachment to view—and the possibility of relinquishing it—happened when I
                  was teaching at Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, in the first years after
                  it opened. His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche was due to speak, and there was a
                  poster announcing the talk. Dudjom Rinpoche was the head of the Nyingmapa
                  lineage of Tibetan Buddhism and revered as a great enlightened being. It said
                  on the poster that Rinpoche was the incarnation of Shariputra, who was one of
                  the two chief disciples of the Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>From the
                  Theravada point of view, when you're fully enlightened you don't take rebirth.
                  As I had been steeped in these teachings, I was sure that Shariputra, second
                  only to the Buddha himself in wisdom, certainly didn't come back. But then I
                  saw this poster about Dudjom Rinpoche, incarnation of Shariputra. My mind went
                  on tilt. How to hold this contradiction? In a moment of inspiration I suddenly
                  realized that I had no idea whether or not Dudjom Rinpoche was the incarnation
                  of Shariputra. I really didn't know. And it was such a relief to realize that
                  because I didn't know, I didn't have to have an opinion about it.</span></p>

                  a lot. We don't know much more than we know. And it's a relief to let go of our
                  attachment to views, our attachment to opinions, especially about things we
                  don't know. A new mantra began to form in my mind: "Who knows?" This
                  not-knowing is not a quality of bewilderment, it's not a quality of confusion.
                  It actually is like a breath of fresh air, an openness of mind. Not knowing is
                  simply holding an open mind regarding these very interesting questions to which
                  we might not yet have answers.</span></p>

                  even more difficult is letting go of our attachment to things we think we do
                  know. Even when our opinion is based on some experience, it's still limited.
                  When we don't hold on to our viewpoints quite so tightly, it allows for the
                  possibility of seeing from other perspectives. We might actually learn
                  something from someone else. One of the great Japanese Zen masters, Bankei, had
                  a wonderful line in his teachings. He said, "Don't side with
                  yourself." This is a good reminder to keep an open mind. This is part of
                  our practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The last
                  attachment and clinging that I want to mention is the one that is the most
                  deeply rooted, the most difficult to see through and understand—that is the attachment
                  we have to the concept of, or belief in, self. Seeing through this illusion of
                  self is the heart of the One Dharma of liberation. Every Buddhist tradition
                  will talk of this, because it is this insight, this understanding, which is
                  ultimately liberating; it is the seeing through the illusion, the concept, the
                  belief, the idea of a self-center. But selflessness is also the most puzzling
                  aspect of the Buddha's teachings. If there's no self, who's sitting here? Who
                  gets angry? Who falls in love? Unlike many other aspects of the teachings,
                  selflessness is not easily accessible to our normal level of understanding. It
                  takes a disciplined practice to investigate and explore the deepest nature of
                  this mind/body process.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>One image
                  might help us understand the meaning of selflessness. Think back to the last
                  time you saw a rainbow. You look up at the sky, see this beautiful rainbow, and
                  feel the momentary joy that comes from that experience of beauty. But is there
                  something in and of itself that is the rainbow? Or, is the rainbow an <em>appearance</em> arising out of the coming together of different conditions? There is air,
                  moisture, and light arranged in a certain way, and out of those conditions a
                  rainbow appears. But there's no substantial thing-ness to the rainbow: it's
                  simply an appearance arising out of conditions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Self, Joseph,
                  each one of us, is like the rainbow. There is, indeed, an appearance of self,
                  and on that level of appearance, self exists. Just like it is true that we have
                  the experience of what we call rainbow. On the relative level, we do relate to
                  one another as individuals. So it's not to deny the appearance of self, but to
                  realize that it is only an appearance. When we go beyond, or see through, or
                  begin to understand the conditions that are giving rise to the appearance, then
                  we come to taste the profound teachings of the Buddha on emptiness. Emptiness
                  does not mean that things aren't there; it means that they do not have some
                  self-existing nature independent of conditions. When we see this in our experience,
                  we begin to understand the selflessness of this whole life process. And the
                  deeper the wisdom of selflessness, the more love and compassion flow freely. A
                  Sri Lankan monk summed up the great value of realizing emptiness when he said,
                  "No self, no problem."</span></p>

                  2,500 years ago, the Buddha set in motion this great wheel of the dharma. It
                  has rolled across continents and oceans and has touched the lives of countless
                  beings. The dharma has been expressed in so many different culrures, each with
                  its own language and idiom, expressing skillful means for liberating the heart
                  and mind from grasping. Nothing whatsoever is to be clung to as "I"
                  or "mine." This is the One Dharma of liberation, and all the
                  teachings, all the words, point to that freedom.</span></p>
