                          even if the vows are true, i'm fine, just depend on interpretation.
                          to me, the website's messager that slander, name calling, take
                          word out of context and using harsh words are the

                          don't target on MCK. he's not the only masters who advocate
                          oneness of religion. last time also have, now also have. if u only

                          they really teach evil, killing sucide and stuff. if

              <p>Why MJK? Because he's quite influential in Singapore and his teaching got some serious problem in it, thats why I address those problem here in this spore buddhism forum. If dun address those problem, more and more people will be mislead by him. Even if I speak out here, maybe it wont matter, 'cause maybe more people would still be mislead by him. But at least I try. I can sleep well at night with a clear conscience.</p>
              <p>Teach people to go one big round learning Confucianism and Daoism, instead of go straight and study Buddhism, is that orthodox Buddhism?</p>
              <p>Is Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism, are the teachings all interchangable? Can we substitute Buddhism teaching with Daoism and Confucianism teaching?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Dhamma was a term for "teachings" not a word for Buddhists only. The same goes for the word "Sangha", monastics from jainism were also called sanghas and their teachings of Mahavira are called Dhamma. <br><br>Also from the basic point of Buddhism, we can and should always recongise the goodness and values of another faith, may it be taoism, christianity, confuscious etc, there is no truth in Buddhism condemning another religion or their teaching just because it is not taught by the Buddha. However, we need to make clear that respecting and honouring/ spreading them are different. When Venerable Jing Kung crossed the line to start preaching and spreading non buddhist stuffs, he is polluting Buddhism. <br><br>Do not mistake me, I see the absolute goodness and value in Di Zi Gui and Tai Shang Gan Yin Pian but sorry I do not agree with Buddhists promoting them and practising them, esp when Tai Shang Gan Yin Pian's "Karmic" system of a personal deity above one's head compiling one's goodness and deeds does not comply with the Karmic system of Buddhism. <br><br>Namo Amituofo ~<br></p></div>

              <p>Thats bias. So many entry level Buddhist textbook out there. Any entry level Buddhist textbook would be able to take care the basic moral teachings of Buddhism. Why need to resort to Confucianism's Di Zi Gui, and Daoism's Tai Shang Gan Yin Pian as entry to Buddhism?</p>

              <p>roughly translated+edited:</p>
              <p>We have been learning Buddhism for so many years, and been to many countries, but what we see is that those household buddhists are not practicing the Ten wholesome deed, hence no good root; those ordain are not practicing the ordain preceptsï¼Œhence also no good root. if you ask why Buddhism is degenerating, it is because the foundation is gone or is very weak. like a tree without it's root. it can fall anytime. </p>
              <p>This few years, we went around advocating the importance of Buddhist's foundation.  Please don't differentiate that "Standards for being a Good Student and Child" is based on Confucius; the "Induction papers" is based on Daoism. Buddhism, especially Mahayana is not that dogmatic. If so, it'll be Opposition and it's Prejudice View, which is one of the criteria of arhathood to get rid of Prejudice View.</p>
              <p>Those who practice Pureland school - the highest guide is Contemplation sutra's teaching of the Three pure meritorious karmic conditions.  The first is "Be filial and care and provide for parents". The second is "Be respectful to and serve teachers". How to practice? The third is "Be compassionate and do not kill."</p>
              <p>The hinayana sutras did said a lot about foundation, but it's very very big. Do u have the time to read? If so, ok. if not, Confucius already consolidated 113 things to do in &lt;&lt;Standards for being a Good Student and Child&gt;&gt;.  It's as good as practicing "Be filial and care and provide for parents".</p>
              <p>"Be compassionate and do not kill" can be learned from &lt;&lt;Induction papers&gt;&gt;. There are 190 over stories of good and evil karma. All real teaching of Cause and Effect.  With all these practice, practicing Ten wholesome deeds of avoiding killing, stealing, bad mouth, cheating, sexual misconduct, greed, hatred, ignorance etc will be easy. If u cannot do that, u would not be able to practice the Ten wholesome deeds. then how? Really practice hinayana? FINE. Ten wholesome deeds opened up is 3000 manner! Mahayana opened up is 84000 fine practice. Then u turn around and see if the 84000 fine practice is really consolidated in Dizigui? yes it is. 84000 fine practice is it really consolidated in the &lt;Induction papers&gt;? yes it is.  </p>
              <p>So, there's a close relationship between Buddhism and worldly teaching. All the dharma of the world does not exclude out of the mind. Mara also does not exclude out of the mind. In Mahayana, Buddha and Mara is one same mind. When one is confuse, u are mara. when one is not confuse/awaken, one's Buddha. Where's Buddha and mara? All in the mind. t'is the meaning of don't seek Dharma out of the mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ps: now then i know æ„Ÿæ‡‰ç¯‡ is just 190++ stories of cause and effect. ok wat! :)</p>

              <p>Personally I ask people to read non-Buddhist books as well.</p>
              <p>For example, 'The Power of Now' by Eckhart Tolle is a very good book. Very inspirational, very well written, very transformative.</p>
              <p>Some other books as well...</p>
              <p>I don't see this as a problem.</p>
              <p>p.s. I'm not saying they are the same as Buddhism, but they have very important pointers as well.</p>

              <p>Gopi Krishna 's books on his kundalini experiences are also good books to read.</p>
              <p><a href="http://gopikrishna.us/">http://gopikrishna.us/</a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The remarkable thing in Gopi Krishna's case, is that he was a scientifically well informed man who wrote a detailed account of his life story and dramatic kundalini awakening which first occurred in 1937 and stabilized roughly 12 years later into a full state of perennial enlightenment in around 1949.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In this privileged state, he spent the next 35 years, until his departure from the earthly plane in 1984. During this long enlightened period, he wrote more than 15 books, and toured the world talking to and lecturing to groups of scientists, yoga devotees and the general public with his yoga based scientific explanation of the phenomena of evolution, religion and genius, based on his unique understanding and personal experience of a full kundalini awakening.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">
              </span></p><p>His first major work was "The Biological Basis of Religion and Genius" with an introduction by the esteemed German scientist Professor Carl Friedrich Von Weiszacker. In this relative short but momentous revelatory work he explains how his knowledge and experience of the biological mechanism in the body known to yoga philosophy as kundalini is the true cause of evolution, thus overturning the theories of the Darwinian Evolutionists, who have in his view by their misunderstanding of the true evolutionary process brought both religion and mysticism into disrepute, thus leading us into what he calls "the present crisis", in which we are witnessing the breakdown of morality, law and order, and a progressive disintegration into war, terrorism, and global disaster.</p>
              <p>According to Gopi Krishna, this disaster is only avertable by a scientific understanding of the evolutionary mechanism in the body known as kundalini, and a consequent return to moral standards - though not necessarily those of a prurient, puritanical nature - which are in harmony with our current stage of evolutionary development, and pre-requisite for us taking the next step of the evolutionary ladder, into what he describes as "a fairytale like kingdom of light, beauty, intelligence and bliss."</p>
              <p>The reader is warned firstly, that Gopi Krishna's works are detailed and complex, and his message cannot be absorbed fully without a serious and protracted study, and secondly that he never advised anybody to awaken kundalini without the guidance of a true master, which he felt at this time was not generally possible to find, even in India, long considered the true home of yoga.</p>
