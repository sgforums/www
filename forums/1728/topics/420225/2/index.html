              <p>To all pureland cultivators, once we have reached pureland, we go and seek Amituofo's advice on all whatever debates we want loh. I think only Buddhas can answer our questions fully and åœ†æ»¡. To see if Master CK is able to reborn in pureland or not, we go and see for ourselves loh. For those doesn't believe in Master CK's teaching but manage to see Master CK in pureland next time, can ask him why is he there loh. Most importantly is that we need to chant more and help more needy people around us.</p>

              think advocating people to go study Daoism and Confucianism, there
              are others who think it is perfectly all right.</p>
              <p>I am all supporting MJK in his encouragment to others to read
              more.  I am sure his followers will agree with him too.</p>
              <p>So what i am disagreeing with you here on this board is how you
              harp on MJK and how you are trying to FORCE others to agree with
              your narrow viewpoint.</p>

              <p>Who's forcing who?  This thread would not have existed if some of the moderator didn't go lock up threads talking about Jing Kong Dharma Master. Should have let the debate play it out, and let the people see for themselves, make their own call. Just like the debate between us here, I agree to disagree. When did I force anything to people? I state my view, u state yours. Is debate, exchange of ideas strongly discourage here in this forum especially regarding MJK?</p>

              <p> Most importantly, it is your tone of writing about MJK.  You tone is lack of respect for an elderly monk. </p>
              <p>Also when you just post one page of MJK book and you started to label MJK with names, you are not fair to MJK either.</p>

              <p>The question is not wat Theravada view towards Mahayana, and not Mahayana view towards Diamond Varjra. Since pureland sect is under Mahayana, the question is how Singapore Chinese Mahayana Buddhism view towards MJK teaching.</p>

              <p>I am just stating it as it is. MJK did advocate people to study Confucianism and Daoism, and stated that its the foundation to Buddhism. If me stating it as it is, thats consider irrespectful and rude, then I am sorry. I am oblige to do wat I have to do: stating it as it is.</p>
              <p>I had shown u another link to another dharma talk which he advocate Confucianism and Daoism, stating that they are the entry and foundation to Buddhism. I am sure there are more such dharma talk from him.</p>
