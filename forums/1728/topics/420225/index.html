              <p>Here's your answer to me:</p>
              <p>"I have not studied indepth so cannot give you a straight
                                              answer.</p>
              <p>But apparently many of the principles are quite compatible with
                                              the morality aspect of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>That said, morality is not enough for liberation."</p>
              <p>Here's what I am gonna say,</p>
              <p>Compatible but that doesn't mean that if one wanna study and practice Buddhism, one <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>got to, have to</strong></span> use Confucianism and Daoism moral education moral teachings as entry and foundation to Buddhism.</p>
              <p>To insist Confucianism and Daoism moral education/ teaching is the only entry and foundation to Buddhism thats false view, thats unorthodox Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Agree. It is not 'the only'. In fact Buddhism alone is enough and covers from foundations to advanced.</p>

              <p>But to a certain Buddhist Dharma Master (I will refrain from stating his name here), Confucianism and Daoism are the only entry and foundation to Buddhism. He didn't view Buddhism alone is enough or suitable to cover the foundation.</p>
              <p>Which is the reason, I feel oblige to bring it up. 'cause that kind of teaching from that certain Dharma Master, its unorthdox Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Base on this dharma talk, and I had came across a few MJK fan, pushing Di Zi Gui for newbie Buddhist to read, and I go think about it, I know I have to sound off the alarm. People should know about it that Jing Kong Dharma Master teaching the part where he emphaize Confucianism and Daoism as entry and foundation to Buddhism, its unorthdox Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Its a false view, and unorthdox Buddhism for Jing Kong Dharma Master to think that Confucianism and Daoism are the only entry and foundation to Buddhism. The reason, Buddhism do cover the entry and foundation to Buddhism! No need to go into Buddhism via Confucianism and Daoism. Its unorthodox Buddhism and its a false view to think otherwise.</p>

              <p>Are the principles of Daoism, Confucianism and Buddhism the same? Are they interchangable? Correct me if I am wrong, I dun think they are the same. There might be some similarities, compatibility, but one cannot subtitute Buddhism with other teachings isnt it? In this aspect, MJK teaching its unorthdox Buddhism when he put emphasis on Daoism and Confucianism as entry and foundation to Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Are the principles of Daoism, Confucianism and Buddhism the same? Are they interchangable? Correct me if I am wrong, I dun think they are the same. There might be some similarities, compatibility, but one cannot subtitute Buddhism with other teachings isnt it? In this aspect, MJK teaching its unorthdox Buddhism when he put emphasis on Daoism and Confucianism as entry and foundation to Buddhism.</p>

              <p><br>All present Buddhism is already unorthdox when you consider they have already detour from ancient Indian Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Zenist.....do you know that Buddhism comes from India ? 
              It's indian guru who brings teachings of Indian guru to China which
              become the foundation of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Now monk Jing Kong is trying to include a bit of china roots
              into his teachings.</p>
              <p>When he says Tao, he means the Way . He doesn't mean
              Taoism/Daoism.</p>
              <p>I think your mandarin is not up to the level to understand his
              teachings.</p>

              <p>So what's wrong with studying another text?  When your views are opened up , you improve your visions, your boundaries, your mental thinking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, you are just stepping on the same spot, sprouting the same words and refusing to move one step further.</p>
              <p>Others are improving while you are stagnent.  Binded by your narrow visions and narrow mind.</p>
              <p>You are definitely not a Zenist.  You should change your ID.</p>
