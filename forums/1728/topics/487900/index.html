              Religious Studies Department at the University of Colorado (CU), invited the
              highly ranked Tibetan Buddhist lama Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche to teach a course
              on Buddhism to undergraduates. Rinpoche had arrived in the United States that
              spring from Scotland, establishing Tail of the Tiger (now Karmê Chöling) in
              Barnet, Vermont, where he gave summer seminars on the teachings of Milarepa,
              the Tibetan Buddhist saint, and other subjects. In August some CU professors
              had invited Rinpoche, then about 31 years old, to come to Boulder, and I and
              another student, Marvin Casper, both in our mid-twenties, had asked him if we
              could accompany him. So in October 1970 the three of us moved to Colorado,
              initially living to gether in a stone cabin with a potbellied stove and
              outhouse at 10,000 feet in Gold Hill but later moving to a modern duplex in
              Four Mile Canyon just outside town. Rinpoche’s wife, Diana, joined us after a
              few months, and the two of them stayed together in the first floor apartment,
              while Marvin and I inhabited the upstairs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>The CU course was to run in the winter semester of 1971.
              Rinpoche appointed Marvin and me as his teaching assistants, which meant
              helping him select readings, construct the syllabus, run the class, and conduct
              discussion groups. He, of course, determined the content and delivered the
              lectures.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>At Tail of the Tiger, Rinpoche had given Marvin and me
              pointing-out instruction [the showing of the nature of mind by a teacher] and
              forged a bond with us stronger than any I had known in my relatively short
              lifetime. He had recently asked us to start teaching the students who were
              coming to him from the coasts and elsewhere, hippies mostly, without much
              money, adventurous and inspired by the dharma in general and by Rinpoche in
              particular. We knew very little doctrine, but Rinpoche had introduced us to the
              heart of the teachings. He felt it important for Westerners to connect to the
              essence of Buddhism first, so that they would not be dazzled and seduced by the
              many exotic forms that implied spectacular results, a problem he considered
              pandemic in America at the time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>The university had a population of about 25,000, including
              staff and students—this in a town whose total population was about 100,000. The
              town had a prominent population of Seventh-day Adventists (thus no alcohol was
              sold within city limits), there were no malls, and hippies were arriving from
              the coasts to live in the town and in the communes that constellated around it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>CU in those days had the reputation of being a second-tier
              school with a few standout departments, such as engineering. It was known to be
              popular with undergraduates who wanted proximity to Colorado’s ski areas as
              well as the overall opportunity to play and party. So our expectations for the
              class were not high, and we were not disappointed. My memory is that 40 or so
              students sat slumped in their chairs (the kinds with an enlarged arm for
              notepads), giving the impression of sleepiness and apathy. (In fact, a few of
              them later became devoted students of Rinpoche. You just never know.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>The room was large, stark, bare, and brightly lit by both
              the overhead fluorescents and the Colorado sunlight streaming in through
              outsize windows. Rinpoche wore a sport coat and tie; portly with tousled hair,
              he stood before the class, blackboard behind him, the Flatirons visible through
              the windows, rising 1,800 feet into the clear blue sky. Marvin and I sat in the
              front row, to the side.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>Rinpoche
              presented basic Buddhist doctrine, but with an emphasis on the teaching about
              “spiritual materialism,” which he felt was particularly relevant to his
              audiences at that time. America was in the throes of the counterculture
              revolution, protests against the Vietnam War, and the invasion of Eastern
              religions from India, Tibet, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Think Satguru, Maharishi
              and the Beatles, Yogi Bhajan, Hare Krishnas on street corners and in airports,
              Zen Beats, macrobiotic diets, and of course yoga and meditation and kundalini
              energy and so much more. We were all too ready to ape the cultures of these
              imports, hoping that, by adopting their to-us-exotic forms we would enjoy some
              benefit or release from unhappiness. Rinpoche spent a lot of his time debunking
              that notion: critical of our naiveté, he once said to an audience, almost
              apologetically, “If I told you to stand on your heads 24 hours a day, you would
              do it.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>But the lecture that most stands out in my memory—because it
              was so revelatory for me, personally, and so brilliant—was the one Rinpoche
              gave on the <em>trikaya</em>, a Sanskrit term that refers to the three (<em>tri</em>)
              bodies (<em>kaya</em>) of a buddha: the <em>dharmakaya</em>, <em>sambhogakaya</em>,
              and <em>nirmanakaya</em>, which are to be understood at various levels. This was
              no lecture on spiritual materialism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>Most basically, the term <em>nirmanakaya</em> refers to the
              actual physical and mental manifestation of Shakyamuni Buddha as well as other
              enlightened individuals. <em>Nirmana</em> is usually translated as
              “manifestation” or “apparition” or “incarnation.” It is the idea that a person
              has taken rebirth many times—has died and been reborn over and over again—and
              that this current birth is the “nirmana,” or current manifestation/incarnation.
              The Tibetan translation of <em>nirmanakaya</em> is <em>tulku</em>, a term applied
              to reincarnate lamas, so the Dalai Lama is the 14th tulku (or nirmanakaya) in
              his line, and Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche was the 11th Trungpa tulku.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>In one sense we are all nirmanakayas (tulkus), because we
              all have been reborn many times. The term, however, is usually reserved for
              enlightened teachers who take rebirth deliberately, out of compassion and
              because they have taken a vow to work for the benefit of confused, sentient
              beings until they have all attained enlightenment. The rest of us unenlightened
              individuals take rebirth not deliberately but out of the force of our karma:
              habit and desire drive us forward in life and in death to continual and
              uncontrolled rebirth in various realms of suffering. We are fortunate to be
              human beings in this life—the human realm is the only one in which a being may
              traverse the path to enlightenment and freedom—but we may not be so fortunate
              in future lives. According to the Buddhist teachings, sooner or later we will
              be reborn in all the realms: god realms, animal, hungry ghost, and hell realms.
              In fact, we experience these realms psychologically even during the course of a
              day: the anger and panic of the hell realms, the pride and pleasure of the god
              realms, the hunger and sense of deprivation of the hungry ghost realms, or the
              stupidity, sloth, and fear of the animal realms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>Dharma</span></em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '> is a
              Sanskrit word that has a number of different meanings, but here it refers first
              to the Buddhist teachings: the truth about who we are and what confusion and
              wisdom are, as well as the path to realizing enlightenment and release from
              suffering. In addition, <em>dharma</em> refers to the true action of an enlightened
              individual, a buddha. <em>Dharmakaya</em>, then, from the historically earliest
              teachings, refers to the “teachings” body of the buddha: the instructions he
              gave to his students to help them see what is real and to tread the path.
              Additionally, it refers to the buddha’s capacity to act in accord with what is
              true and real.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>Sambhogakaya</span></em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>,
              a term that appeared in a later period of Buddhist history, is usually
              translated as “enjoyment body” of a buddha. It refers to the idea that (when
              one has the eyes to see) a world of celestial beings, buddhas and bodhisattvas,
              dharma protectors, teachers, and embodiments of energy, enlightened and not, is
              present here and now. In truth we are in the midst of the Akanishtha (“above
              all”) Heaven [the realm of awakened mind], but the sambhogakaya realm is hidden
              in plain sight from the unenlightened, who may become aware of it only in
              glimpses, if at all. It is a world of beauty, power, and meaningfulness, and it
              is completely available to individuals who have left confusion behind—bodhisattvas
              on the stages of the path and enlightened beings, or buddhas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>But there is another subtler way to understand the trikaya,
              and it is this understanding that Trungpa Rinpoche taught to us that winter day
              in 1971. He did it in this way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>Stepping to the blackboard, he picked up a piece of chalk
              and drew this figure:</span></p>

              Of course no one wanted to say the obvious, and there was an extended silence
              until finally some fellow raised his hand and said, “It’s a picture of a bird.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>Rinpoche replied, “It’s a picture of the sky,” and in those
              six words he taught the entire trikaya.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>Rinpoche was introducing us to the most profound Buddhist
              description of reality as it arises in the only place and time it ever arises:
              here and now. It is not a metaphysical explanation of reality; it is simply a
              description of what arises in the moment, now, the only time we ever have.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>The past and future are mental constructs. Even the present
              can be conceptualized, but it can also be experienced. In fact, we choicelessly
              experience it all the time. It is merely a matter of whether we emerge from our
              dreams about the past, present, and future long enough to notice and see it
              clearly, truly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>In the present the six types of phenomena—sights, sounds,
              smells, tastes, tactile sensations, and mental events, which are referred to in
              Buddhism as the six knowables—arise and pass away, a constantly appearing and
              disappearing display, like a movie or like images passing through a mirror.
              These “things” do not endure even for an instant in the present moment; as we
              turn our head, as our attention shifts, as the light changes and things move,
              the display is constantly in motion, transforming so completely and
              continuously that we cannot even point to some<em>thing</em> that has changed. It
              is a continual “presencing,” as they say in the Dzogchen texts [according to
              the Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism Dzogchen is the last and most profound of
              the six vehicles of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism]—a presencing of what we call
              phenomena. And this display has three aspects. </span></p>

              from and pass back into nothing. Where did that sound go? That precise visual
              experience? That thought? That odor? They arose from nowhere, appeared in the
              midst of a matrix of conditions, and finally disappeared into nowhere. That
              fertile “nowhere” is, in this first pass at a definition, a meaning of the
              dharmakaya: absolute reality, the “womb” from which all appearances arise and
              the charnel ground into which they pass away.</span></p>

              This “thing” aspect is the nirmanakaya. There is a “presencing” of phenomena
              (the six knowables appear). That presencing is the fact of seeming appearance,
              the “thingness” of appearances, and it is all that confused sentient beings
              know, because they are not paying attention to the present moment, not noticing
              that nothing truly exists as they think it does.</span></p>

              the veil of static thought: we see a friend or hear a piece of music, and we
              are consumed with the pastness and futureness of it all; we are in relationship
              to it, an I-other proposition, fraught with past and future significance for
              “my” well-being. As long as we believe that other things and I exist, life must
              be experienced as a series of I-other problematic relationships. If the other
              is antipathetic to us, causes us pain and unhappiness, then we want to push it
              away from us: hatred. If the other promises pleasure, happiness, security, and
              so on, then we wish to pull it to us: desire. And if the other promises neither
              benefit nor harm, then we don’t care about it: indifference. In Buddhist
              doctrine, these are called “the three poisons,” and you can find them depicted
              at the center of the Wheel of Life, a heuristic depiction of confusion, as a
              snake, a rooster, and a pig, respectively.</span></p>

              moment—in reality even beyond the present moment, which can be a concept in
              itself—then the nirmanakaya is an aspect of the presencing, of the display, its
              seeming “thingness,” and it is described as the display of compassion, because
              it can communicate with us in the form of a teacher (either an actual human
              being or simply life experiences that move us along our path).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>And finally there is the sambhogakaya, the aspect whereby,
              as these “things” arise and pass away, they<em> communicate</em> to us what they
              are: the redness of red, the sweetness of sugar, the cold of ice, the sadness
              of sorrow. It is precisely because all phenomena are arising out of nowhere and
              passing away into it again, because they are utterly transitory, that they can
              and must express their qualities, so vividly and beautifully and meaningfully.
              This is the sambhogakaya, and it is the realm of magic: not magic in the sense
              of walking through walls or reading minds (although there may be that too), but
              magic in the sense of the extraordinary beauty and meaningfulness and <em>value</em> of this world seen nakedly, stripped of the false, ego-centered and
              emotion-laden thoughts/dreams through which confused sentient beings see their
              lives. Sambhogakaya is the world of deity—sacred world. In confused world
              things are of greater or lesser value in terms of what they can do for or to
              me. In sacred world things are of value for no reason at all; this life has
              intrinsic worth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>And so, seen in the present moment, a bird is utterly
              insubstantial: a constantly changing presentation, a presencing from the ground
              of nothingness, coming into being and passing away so totally every instant
              that we cannot even find any “thing” that is coming into being or passing away.
              In fact, we cannot even distinguish between the bird and the nothing
              (symbolized here by the sky), which is its womb and its grave. So when Trungpa
              Rinpoche said that he had drawn a picture of the sky, there were two ways to
              take his assertion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>First: we are so focused on the thing that we do not pay
              attention to the background (temporal as well as spatial) from which it arises.
              Look! The bird is also a picture of the sky! Lost in concept, seeing the world
              through the veil of discursive thought, we have been <em>ignoring</em> the ground
              from which phenomena arise and into which they disappear. This is one meaning
              of the Sanskrit word <em>avidya</em> (usually translated as “ignorance”), the
              fundamental error that produces “unenlightenment” or confusion. Trungpa
              Rinpoche said that <em>avidya</em> means “ignoring” or <em>not seeing</em> (the
              literal meaning of <em>a-vidya</em>) the ground, focusing only on the figure and
              its significance for or against me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>Second: the bird and sky seem different and yet we cannot
              find the dividing line between them. They create each other and are each other.
              The bird, as it moves through the sky, is merely a recoloring of the sky in an
              infinite number of locations. The difference between them is merely seeming,
              just like an image in a mirror. In the highest tantric teachings the word <em>sky</em> is often a code word for and interchangeable with “space,” which signifies the
              unity of the three kayas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>In Vajrayana (tantric Buddhist) practice one often recites
              this two-line formula, or some variation on it: “Things arise, and yet they do
              not exist; they do not exist, and yet they arise!” The first is what Buddhists
              call the absolute truth; the second is what Buddhists call the relative truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>Finally and always, the three kayas are merely different
              aspects of the same thing, which is what is meant when in the texts we find the
              assertion that the three kayas are one. The nirmanakaya and sambhogakaya, often
              lumped together and called the <em>rupakaya</em>, or “form body of the Buddha,”
              are in union with the dharmakaya, the absolute body, from which—in the present
              moment, here and now—everything seems to arise and pass away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>Things arise from and pass back into <em>nothingness</em>:
              dharmakaya. <em>Things</em> arise from and pass back into nothingness:
              nirmanakaya. And as those things arise and pass away, they <em>communicate</em> their unique, brilliant, emotionally moving individuality: sambhogakaya.</span></p>
