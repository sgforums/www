              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dharamshala
              — A new report from the International Campaign for Tibet details how
              “demolitions and expulsions at Larung Gar and Yachen Gar in the past six months
              are part of an unfolding political strategy involving more aggressive measures
              in order to curb and manage the growing influence and number of monks and
              nuns,” while simultaneously “using this very interest in Tibetan Buddhism to
              attract domestic tourists.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              report, titled ‘Shadow of Dust Across the Sun,’ released on March 13th is
              informed exclusively by first hand sources and eyewitness accounts, and while
              original reports from the Chinese authorities indicated that destruction of the
              religious institution was due to overcrowding and space concerns, the new ICT
              report suggests otherwise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Larung
              Gar and Yachen Gar have achieved widespread popularity among both Tibetans and
              Chinese as non-political hubs dedicated to monastic education, academic
              learning and Buddhist ethics since the mid-1980s when they were founded. Video
              footage of nuns weeping as they are expelled in convoys of buses while their
              wooden huts are demolished has drawn global attention to the extent of a
              crackdown at the world-famous Buddhist institute of Larung Gar in eastern
              Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According
              to the ICT report, “information from the area [suggests] the buildings under
              construction are likely to be part of a push to develop the area with new
              guest-houses or facilities for temporary visitors rather than long-staying
              monastics as part of a broader official plan to re-shape and develop the area.
              According to various Tibetan sources, tourist attractions are likely to include
              Tibetan restaurants, souvenir stores, horse-riding centers, trekking, and
              organized visits to the now world-famous Larung Gar.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Major
              construction work in the vast valley at the foot of Larung Gar to build a new
              tourist village and other developments has revealed that tourism is now being
              used as a tool by the Chinese authorities to confront revivalist trends of
              Tibetan religious and cultural expression and contain monastic growth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Heightened
              security and surveillance at both Larung Gar and Yachen Gar and local sxdtowns,
              including new mobile police stations and intensified militarization in urban
              areas nearby are consistent with more systematic and intrusive measures across
              eastern Tibet since the wave of self-immolations began in Ngaba, Sichuan in
              2009.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Official
              plans for urbanization and tourism focused on presenting an official version of
              Tibetan religious culture and a ‘happy Kardze’, involving an emphasis on
              non-religious elements of Tibetan culture, aligned with longer-term strategies
              to contain dissent, ‘manage’ religious activities and ensure Party control
              across the prefecture.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">An
              educated Tibetan man in the Serthar area said that tourism is being used in
              Tibet to assist official efforts to restrict religious freedom: “Tibet is being
              turned into a huge tourist destination. Religious activities will be
              increasingly minimized and contained in monasteries. These will be limited in
              terms of demography and housing. This is the main objective of the Chinese
              government with regards to Buddhism, and we Tibetans have no power to influence
              any of these plans.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              a rare step, six UN experts said publicly last month that they had made a joint
              submission to the PRC stating that the developments at the Buddhist institutes
              violate international human rights laws and “seem to be concerted attacks on
              tangible and intangible cultural heritage, which constitute serious violations
              of cultural rights of current and future generations."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Matteo
              Mecacci, President of the International Campaign for Tibet, said: “The new
              evidence presented in this report calls into question the entire basis of the
              demolition of homes and expulsion of nuns and monks, which have caused such
              distress. It cannot be possible for the Chinese authorities to claim there is
              overcrowding and not enough space for genuine religious practitioners given the
              extent of construction over a vast area in this remote valley. The UN statement
              reflects global alarm over the counter-productive razing of homes and expulsion
              of monks and nuns who have peacefully studied at these world famous religious
              institutes – which are so precious for Chinese as well as Tibetans.”</span></p>
