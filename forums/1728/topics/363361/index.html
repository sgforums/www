              <p>Back in the days of the Buddha, nirvana <em>(nibbana)</em> had a verb of its own: <em>nibbuti.</em> It meant to "go out," like a flame. Because fire was thought to be in a
                  state of entrapment as it burned — both clinging to and trapped by the
                  fuel on which it fed — its going out was seen as an unbinding. To go
                  out was to be unbound. Sometimes another verb was used — <em>parinibbuti</em> — with the <em>"pari-"</em> meaning total or all-around, to indicate that the person unbound, unlike fire unbound, would never again be trapped.</p>
              <p>Now that nirvana has become an English word, it should have its own
                  English verb to convey the sense of "being unbound" as well. At
                  present, we say that a person "reaches" nirvana or "enters" nirvana,
                  implying that nibbana is a place where you can go. But nirvana is most
                  emphatically not a place. It's realized only when the mind stops
                  defining itself in terms of place: of here, or there, or between the
                  two.</p>
              <p>This may seem like a word-chopper's problem — what can a verb or two
                  do to your practice? — but the idea of nirvana as a place has created
                  severe misunderstandings in the past, and it could easily create
                  misunderstandings now. There was a time when some philosophers in India
                  reasoned that if nirvana is one place and samsara another, then
                  entering into nirvana leaves you stuck: you've limited your range of
                  movement, for you can't get back to samsara. Thus to solve this problem
                  they invented what they thought was a new kind of nirvana: an
                  unestablished nirvana, in which one could be in both places — nirvana
                  and samsara — at once.</p>
              <p>However, these philosophers misunderstood two important points about
                  the Buddha's teachings. The first was that neither samsara nor nirvana
                  is a place. Samsara is a process of creating places, even whole worlds,
                  (this is called <em>becoming)</em> and then wandering through them (this is called <em>birth).</em> Nirvana is the end of this process. You may be able to be in two places
                  at once — or even develop a sense of self so infinite that you can
                  occupy all places at once — but you can't feed a process and experience
                  its end at the same time. You're either feeding samsara or you're not.
                  If you feel the need to course freely through both samsara and nirvana,
                  you're simply engaging in more samsara-ing and keeping yourself trapped.</p>
              <p>The second point is that nirvana, from the very beginning, was
                  realized through unestablished consciousness — one that doesn't come or
                  go or stay in place. There's no way that anything unestablished can get
                  stuck anywhere at all, for it's not only non-localized but also
                  undefined.</p>
              <p>The idea of a religious ideal as lying beyond space and definition
                  is not exclusive to the Buddha's teachings, but issues of locality and
                  definition, in the Buddha's eyes, had a specific psychological meaning.
                  This is why the non-locality of nirvana is important to understand.</p>
              <p>Just as all phenomena are rooted in desire, consciousness localizes
                  itself through passion. Passion is what creates the "there" on which
                  consciousness can land or get established, whether the "there" is a
                  form, feeling, perception, thought-construct, or a type of
                  consciousness itself. Once consciousness gets established on any of
                  these aggregates, it becomes attached and then proliferates, feeding on
                  everything around it and creating all sorts of havoc. Wherever there's
                  attachment, that's where you get defined as a being. You create an
                  identity there, and in so doing you're limited there. Even if the
                  "there" is an infinite sense of awareness grounding, surrounding, or
                  permeating everything else, it's still limited, for "grounding" and so
                  forth are aspects of place. Wherever there's place, no matter how
                  subtle, passion lies latent, looking for more food to feed on.</p>
              <p>If, however, the passion can be removed, there's no more "there"
                  there. One sutta illustrates this with a simile: the sun shining
                  through the eastern wall of a house and landing on the western wall. If
                  the western wall, the ground beneath it, and the waters beneath the
                  ground were all removed, the sunlight wouldn't land. In the same way,
                  if passion for form, etc., could be removed, consciousness would have
                  no "where" to land, and so would become unestablished. This doesn't
                  mean that consciousness would be annihilated, simply that — like the
                  sunlight — it would now have no locality. With no locality, it would no
                  longer be defined.</p>
              <p>This is why the consciousness of nirvana is said to be "without surface" <em>(anidassanam),</em> for it doesn't land. Because the consciousness-aggregate covers only
                  consciousness that is near or far, past, present, or future — i.e., in
                  connection with space and time — consciousness without surface is not
                  included in the aggregates. It's not eternal because eternity is a
                  function of time. And because <em>non-local</em> also means <em>undefined,</em> the Buddha insisted that an awakened person — unlike ordinary people —
                  can't be located or defined in any relation to the aggregates in this
                  life; after death, he/she can't be described as existing, not existing,
                  neither, or both, because descriptions can apply only to definable
                  things.</p>
              <p>The essential step toward this non-localized, undefined realization
                  is to cut back on the proliferations of consciousness. This first
                  involves contemplating the drawbacks of keeping consciousness trapped
                  in the process of feeding. This contemplation gives urgency to the next
                  steps: bringing the mind to oneness in concentration, gradually
                  refining that oneness, and then dropping it to zero. The drawbacks of
                  feeding are most graphically described in <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.063.than.html">SN 12.63</a>, <em>A Son's Flesh.</em> The process of gradually refining oneness is probably best described in <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.121.than.html">MN 121</a>, <em>The</em> <em>Lesser Discourse on Emptiness,</em> while the drop to zero is best described in the Buddha's famous
                  instructions to Bahiya: "'In reference to the seen, there will be only
                  the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard. In reference to
                  the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to the cognized, only the
                  cognized.' That is how you should train yourself. When for you there
                  will be only the seen in reference to the seen, only the heard in
                  reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to the sensed,
                  only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, Bahiya, there is
                  no you in connection with that. When there is no you in connection with
                  that, there is no you there. When there is no you there, you are
                  neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, just this, is the
                  end of stress."</p>
              <p>With no here or there or between the two, you obviously can't use
                  the verb "enter" or "reach" to describe this realization, even
                  metaphorically. Maybe we should make the word nirvana into a verb
                  itself: "When there is no you in connection with that, you nirvana."
                  That way we can indicate that unbinding is an action unlike any other,
                  and we can head off any mistaken notion about getting "stuck" in total
                  freedom.</p>

              <p>Nandaka: "Just as if a skilled butcher or butcher's apprentice,
                  having killed a cow, were to carve it up with a sharp carving knife so
                  that — without damaging the substance of the inner flesh, without
                  damaging the substance of the outer hide — he would cut, sever, &amp;
                  detach only the skin muscles, connective tissues, &amp; attachments in
                  between. Having cut, severed, &amp; detached the outer skin, and then
                  covering the cow again with that very skin, if he were to say that the
                  cow was joined to the skin just as it had been: would he be speaking
                  rightly?"</p>
              <p>"No, venerable sir. Why is that? Because if the skilled butcher or
                  butcher's apprentice, having killed a cow, were to... cut, sever, &amp;
                  detach only the skin muscles, connective tissues, &amp; attachments in
                  between; and... having covered the cow again with that very skin, then
                  no matter how much he might say that the cow was joined to the skin
                  just as it had been, the cow would still be disjoined from the skin."</p>
              <p>"This simile, sisters, I have given to convey a message. The message
                  is this: The substance of the inner flesh stands for the six internal
                  media; the substance of the outer hide, for the six external media. The
                  skin muscles, connective tissues, &amp; attachments in between stand
                  for passion &amp; delight. And the sharp knife stands for noble
                  discernment — the noble discernment that cuts, severs, &amp; detaches
                  the defilements, fetters, &amp; bonds in between."</p>

                  each case. At this point, Master Gotama, I am befuddled; at this point,
                  confused. The modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier
                  conversation is now obscured."</p>
              <p>"Of course you're befuddled, Vaccha. Of course you're confused.
                  Deep, Vaccha, is this phenomenon, hard to see, hard to realize,
                  tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle,
                  to-be-experienced by the wise. For those with other views, other
                  practices, other satisfactions, other aims, other teachers, it is
                  difficult to know. That being the case, I will now put some questions
                  to you. Answer as you see fit. How do you construe this, Vaccha: If a
                  fire were burning in front of you, would you know that, 'This fire is
                  burning in front of me'?"</p>
              <p>"...yes..."</p>
              <p>"And suppose someone were to ask you, Vaccha, 'This fire burning in
                  front of you, dependent on what is it burning?' Thus asked, how would
                  you reply?"</p>
              <p>"...I would reply, 'This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass &amp; timber as its sustenance.'"</p>
              <p>"If the fire burning in front of you were to go out, would you know that, 'This fire burning in front of me has gone out'?"</p>
              <p>"...yes..."</p>
              <p>"And suppose someone were to ask you, 'This fire that has gone out
                  in front of you, in which direction from here has it gone? East? West?
                  North? Or south?' Thus asked, how would you reply?"</p>
              <p>"That doesn't apply, Master Gotama. Any fire burning dependent on a
                  sustenance of grass &amp; timber, being unnourished — from having
                  consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other — is
                  classified simply as 'out' (unbound)."</p>
              <p>"Even so, Vaccha, any physical form by which one describing the
                  Tathagata would describe him: That the Tathagata has abandoned, its
                  root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions
                  of development, not destined for future arising. Freed from the
                  classification of form, Vaccha, the Tathagata is deep, boundless, hard
                  to fathom, like the sea. 'Reappears' doesn't apply. 'Does not reappear'
                  doesn't apply. 'Both does &amp; does not reappear' doesn't apply.
                  'Neither reappears nor does not reappear' doesn't apply.</p>

                  independent of nutriment,
                  their pasture — emptiness
                  &amp; freedom without sign:
                  	their trail,
                  like that of birds through space,
                  	can't be traced.
