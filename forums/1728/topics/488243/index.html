                  Chetawan</h1>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px;">by Kooi F Lim, The Buddhist Channel, May 4, 
                  2015</h3>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #808080;">Malaysia is only one of three countries (apart 
                  from Cambodia and Sri Lanka) which is observing Wesak (or Vesak) on May 3, 2015. 
                  Kooi F Lim opts to spend the morning at one of Petaling Jaya's most beautiful 
                  temple, the Thai Wat Chetawan. Here are his observations.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Petaling Jaya, Selangor (Malaysia)</strong> -- It was just after 
                  dawn, but the crowd has started to teem into the massive Wat Chetawan compound, 
                  the most beautiful Thai temple in all of Petaling Jaya, and one of the most 
                  gorgeous outside of Thailand. The day was already bright, and the low sunlight 
                  breaks through the fog produced by smoky incense like light steaming through a 
                  comb.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Apart from the articulate Thai influenced carvings on the temple walls, the 
                  smoky, slightly choking incense was an obvious presence. It's strong scents 
                  wafted through every nook and cranny of the huge compound - through its 
                  intricate entrance gate, the main shrine hall (ubosot), the meditation hall 
                  (dhammasala), the bell tower, the monks’ kuti, altar shrines (mondop) and the 
                  numerous pavilions that dot the surrounding.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Wesak people - who the more devout call 
                  them "once a year Buddhists" - waste no time in performing their duties. Like 
                  well trained army ants, they go for the jugular - buying incense, candles, 
                  flowers and coupons for lighting lamps. They then proceed to light everything 
                  up, starting with the bunch of incense and candles they hold in their hands and 
                  then the oil lamps.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Everything has a price. There is a choice of cheap flowers (but marked up for 
                  the occasion) or the more customary lotus buds, which fetches up to RM 10 (US$ 
                  3.30) a stalk or a bud. Even for the oil lamps, one needs to pay RM 20 (US$ 
                  6.60) to light them. The monies collected are mainly used to sustain the temple 
                  and its activities. With 10,000 or more visitors making a beeline to pay their 
                  homage to Buddha, this one day represents an important revenue generator for the 
                  temple.</span></p>
              <p>Once the incense are planted onto the large urns strategically located in 
                  front of the main shrine, <em>mondops</em> and other pavilions, devotees make a 
                  bee line to the <em>ubosot</em>. Here they make offerings of flowers to the 
                  "Phra Buddha Thameen", a black, stone carved Buddha image personally donated no 
                  less by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.</p>
              <p>Rows of flowers adorn the shrine. No sooner a bunch is placed on the altar, 
                  workers take it away to make space for other devotees to have their turn to make 
                  the offering. Despite the crammed space, most devotees take the effort to make 
                  three respectful bows, some making quick silent chants before standing up and 
                  moving across to the row of monks sitting by the side on the far right.</p>
              <p>This leads to the highlight of the day - chantings and blessings by monks and 
                  ending the short session (which lasts no more than 5 minutes) by a shower of 
                  "holy water".</p>
              <p>The monks softly chants a Thai variety of the <em>Ti-Ratana Vandana</em> (homage to the Triple Gem), five precepts and <em>punnanumodana</em> (sharing of 
                  merits). For most however, these chants are exotic and spiritual, and are 
                  perceived to have "supra mundane" powers. It is no wonder then that many 
                  devotees place their personal belongings - amulets, religious icons and even car 
                  keys - onto a tray held by the monk who performs the chanting.</p>
              <p>Their belief - mistaken or otherwise - is that these chants contain 
                  "spiritual powers" which are then transcended into their items, which when worn 
                  or used, protects them from harm or danger. The ceremony ends with the tying of 
                  yellow coloured strings on the wrist, a symbolic notion of the presence of the 
                  Sangha in the laity. Of course, if one wishes, they can also make a donation to 
                  the monk concerned for his service by putting money into a metal box.</p>
              <p>Once the main event is over and done with, devotees have a raft of obligatory 
                  activities to perform before they call it a day. It is these sub-events that 
                  make Wesak carnival like. Among the common and well known ones at Wat Chetawan 
                  are as follows: bathing the baby Buddha, ringing the bells at the Kuan Yin 
                  pavilion, pasting gold paper on statues of monks and Buddhas, praying to the 
                  four faced Brahmas, putting coins into the alms bowl of a row of golden Buddhas, 
                  making dana offerings (in the from of robes) and paying homage to deceased 
                  famous Thai Buddhist teachers in the many mondops.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting of course, the delicious, specially prepared Thai food offered 
                  at the cafeteria where devotees can partake at a small fees (RM 6 per box).</p>
              <p><strong>Wither Buddhism?</strong></p>
              <p>There have been calls to cull "non-Buddhist" activities at temples during 
                  Wesak. Clearly many of the so called rites and rituals commonly carried out at 
                  every Wesak day here goes against the Buddha's call to "keep it simple". Some of 
                  it are totally against the Vinaya, such as putting coins into the alms bowls and 
                  the blessings of amulets. Purists decry the state of "religious contamination", 
                  which only helps to project negative ideas of what true Buddhist teaching really 
                  is.</p>
              <p>Yet those arguing for these activities say that since Buddhism is not a state 
                  sanctioned religion, it depends mainly on the support of lay devotees. In 
                  Malaysia, it is common to see the statues of Guan Yin in many Thai temples. This 
                  is not surprising, given that a bulk of the local Buddhists are of Chinese 
                  descent with Taoist background. Temple administrators say that they are only 
                  giving back what devotees want. And to them, survival of Buddhism is paramount, 
                  even if in a corrupt form.</p>
              <p>And survivability means to have the ability to raise funds. To do this 
                  requires specific activities and rituals because it can be monetized. The 
                  monetization aspect secures the temple's survivability, and hence supports the 
                  continued existence of Buddhism in this country.</p>
              <p>Proponents also say that the teaching and learning of Buddhism are promoted 
                  throughout the year, although these "educational activities" are attended by the 
                  hundreds rather than by thousands. Perhaps when a critical mass of "learned 
                  Buddhists" are attained, then activities held on Wesak may be more reflective of 
                  what actually constitutes as "true Buddhism".</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, how this scenario plays out ultimately depends on the direction 
                  taken by the temple's administrators. It is easy to hoist ignorance on the part 
                  of devotees, but meeting the needs of their ignorance is not a viable 
                  solution.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">On a positive note, it can be said that Buddhist temples have generally 
                  transformed more Malaysians to become Buddhists, unlike their Taoist kins a 
                  generation ago. The seeds of Dharma practice can only be sown in a supportive 
                  environment. In this sense, let us "pray" then that the critical mass of learned 
                  Buddhists can materialize sooner then later.</span></p>
