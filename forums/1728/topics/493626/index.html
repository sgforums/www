              vegetarian right' wants everyone in the country to stop eating meat</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Sarah Reid The Independent
              Travel</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Choosing
              what to eat while on holiday in the Himalayan Kingdom can feel intensely
              political </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bhutan
              takes Buddhism so seriously that no animals are allowed to be slaughtered for
              consumption within the country Getty </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is purported to be the happiest country in the world, but if there is one
              subject guaranteed to flare tensions in the Buddhist Kingdom of Bhutan, it’s
              meat. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“It
              is okay because the animal was not killed in Bhutan,” explains my guide Kinley,
              when I question whether it is socially acceptable for us to be sitting down to
              a chicken curry in a country where butchering animals for consumption is
              outright banned. This reasoning might seem bizarre, but it goes a long way to
              explain the complex issues surrounding the consumption of meat in Bhutan. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              teaches that it is wrong to kill animals, which are seen to be part of the
              divine creation. But while this teaching is not taken particularly seriously in
              other Buddhist majority countries outside monastic circles, it is law in
              Bhutan, where Buddhist leaders enjoy an influential voice in public policy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Problem
              is, most Bhutanese – even many monks – enjoy eating meat. So much, in fact,
              that Bhutan is the highest consumer of meat per capita in South Asia. As it is
              not illegal to consume meat in Bhutan, it’s all imported. Yet Bhutan’s
              meat-eating community is increasingly under threat from the wrath of the
              nation’s “vegetarian right” – a growing movement led by religious figures that
              are calling for sanctions on the importation, sale and consumption of meat
              on religious grounds, despite Buddha himself well documented to have eaten
              meat.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              hardline approach jars a little in the context of a country that measures its
              success not by economics, but by a Gross National Happiness Index. And it’s
              true that during my 10-day visit, I found Bhutanese people to be among the
              world’s most welcoming. It’s easy to see why Bhutan has become such a bucket
              list destination: the famous Tiger’s Nest monastery perched on a misty
              mountaintop near Paro looks just as magical in the flesh as it does in the
              pictures, and the phallus-emblazoned houses of the Punakha district – an ode to
              a monk known as the Divine Madman for his, er, unconventional methods of
              “enlightening” women – have to be seen to be believed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              if you like your meat, eating it does feel a little more political here. I felt
              a bit put off consuming anything non-veggie – despite my guide having no issue
              with it. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              illustrate just how seriously the vegetarian right takes the issue, in 2015,
              the announcement of government plans to build a series of plants to process
              imported meat (in an effort to control quality and hygiene) outraged them
              enough that the Zhung Dratshang – Bhutan’s central monastic body – ultimately
              called for the projects to be halted. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Last
              year, Bhutan’s Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority moved to appease
              religious leaders by proposing a ban on the sale of meat during the holy first
              and fourth Bhutanese months, with heavy penalties for commercial vendors caught
              storing or selling meat during these sacred periods.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Some
              towns, including all hotels in the northern district of Bumthang, have since
              signed agreements among themselves to stop storing or selling meat during the
              auspicious months, while also agreeing to submit to surprise inspections from
              vegetarian committees.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Imagine
              my surprise, then, when I spotted a group of farmers slicing up a cow in broad
              daylight as my tour bus bumped along a pretty country road en route to a rural
              homestay. “The cow must have died of old age,” Kinley shrugged when I queried
              what was going on. “They harvest the meat before it spoils.” Now, I'm not a
              huge carnivore, but as someone who enjoys a juicy burger now and then, I
              sympathise with anyone who has to wait for a cow to die to enjoy a bit of
              steak.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Bhutan, however, it is easy – for tourists, at least – to go without meat.
              Never, except perhaps in southern India, have I found it such a delight to “go
              vego” than I did here. Tourist meals in Bhutan are typically served
              banquet-style, and while there’s usually at least one meat dish, the vegetarian
              options are the highlight. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              local red rice is as healthy as it is deliciously nutty, fresh organic
              vegetables burst with flavour, and the buckwheat momos (dumplings) served in
              Western Bhutan’s Haa district are next-level good. It is said that a
              Bhutanese meal isn’t complete without a serving of ema datshi or chilli cheese
              (literally hot green chillies cooked with local cheese), and I couldn’t resist
              sampling this eye-wateringly spicy dish at least once a day. The key flavouring
              agent in Bhutanese cuisine, chilli, poses a greater challenge for many tourists
              than the availability of meat.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              that said, it has been a somewhat bland culinary start to 2017 for locals in
              Bhutan. The government has been forced to rethink a 2016 ban on the import of
              “toxic” chillies from India that has seen the price of local chillies
              skyrocket. Poor families without the land to grow their own have thus faced
              flavourless mealtimes thanks to reduced access to their key source for taste.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              challenges of maintaining a self-sufficient chilli crop is just one of many
              hurdles Bhutan has faced while ploughing ahead to become the world’s first
              wholly organic country by 2020, an ambitious goal in an era when youth in
              developing nations like Bhutan are more reluctant to follow in the farming
              footsteps of their parents. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Despite
              its status as a poster child for sustainable development, Bhutan has not been
              left untouched by the effects of climate change either, with erratic weather
              over recent years having left some farmers struggling to reap a viable harvest
              without the use of chemicals. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              I thoroughly enjoyed being a pseudo-vegetarian during my trip to Bhutan, I’m
              grateful my choice to sink my chops into a juicy piece of meat sometimes isn’t
              under threat from a hardline vegetarian sect. If Buddha was okay with eating
              meat, surely Bhutan’s meat-lovers deserve a bit of slack? </span></p>
