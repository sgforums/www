              <p>All these channelled information - better not take their claims too seriously (such as being from Guan Yin, Buddha, 'The Source', whatever). Many spirits will use the names of great masters to transmit their own messages, but it does not mean they are truly Buddha, Jesus, and so on. (And they are not necessarily right or have any real clarity all the time) They are just spirits using their names. The spirits' true identities are unknown. It's definitely much easier to say "Hey, I'm Buddha and I got a message for you" than to say "Hey, I'm an unknown spirit from an unknown universe giving a message for you" (then people will be doubtful and go like, "what? who the heck are you" etc), so they just pick a name out of convenience.</p>
              <p>This is not very different from Taoist mediums being a medium for certain well known gods, deities, Guan Yin, etc. They are spirits (may be good intentioned for all we know) who use the names of those masters to communicate, help, do something. But this does not mean they are truly those masters themselves.</p>
              <p>So far those channelled information rarely, very rarely have much clarity about dharma. As Simpo/Longchen himself who was once deeply involved in the new age circle commented, so far the only channelled information that has even much clarity about non-dual is Aaron (deepspring.org). Aaron is a deceased master whose immediate past life was a Thai meditation teacher, and is now guiding people through Barbara. Though I still doubt there is deep clarity about anatta and D.O., haven't really studied his teachings.</p>
              <p>p.s. Simpo was able to discern this (that most channelled information has little clarity about non-dual, etc) after having gone through the stages of enlightenment himself.</p>
              <p>Also, in dharma, it is best we don't rely or trust too much about the information we receive from external source. Personal direct experience and insight from meditation is much more valuable and transformational, imo. And there won't be doubts about it because it is not merely second-hand knowledge.</p>

              <p>There is a lot of truths mixed with untruths in these kind of channelled information. This leads to confusion, not clarity...</p>
              <p>How many prophecies being made and gone by... perhaps when 2012 (or many other dates go by) without things happening as "supposed", they should reexamine their blind belief in those channelled beings.</p>
              <p>p.s. that said I still like a few channelled beings like Bashar because somehow he is able to communicate the non-local aspect which is quite similar to emptiness in Buddhism, however not as the form of experiential realization that Buddhism aims to.</p>
              <p><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/search/label/Bashar">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/search/label/Bashar</a></p>
              <p>So my point here is not that all channelled information are utterly without value, but that whatever we hear, we have to discern with wisdom, and not take it by mere belief or just because he said he is Buddha, etc.</p>
              <p>Being in line with Kalama Sutra:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>10. "Come, Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated 
                hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumour; nor upon what is in a scripture; 
                nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a 
                bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another's seeming 
                ability; nor upon the consideration, 'The monk is our teacher.' Kalamas, when 
                you yourselves know: 'These things are good; these things are not blameable; 
                these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things 
                lead to benefit and happiness,' enter on and abide in them.   </em></p>

              <p>"Just because someone is dead and claims to be X doesn't mean they're X"</p>
              <p>etc etc</p>
              <p>And I'm sure different channelled beings talk about different things, maybe even contradictory, just like men. So who's right, who's wrong? Use wisdom to discern, in the same way we use wisdom to discern a human teacher.</p>

              <p>yea, got involved (2012 Unlimited) during younger time when still seeking truth. funny got 'pull' out by X'tian. before moving into Buddhism and so on. Buddha-dharma is still Unmatched.  heard from lated Ven Shen Kai, that there are still many stuff in Buddhism truth that can be studied and are not reviewed to the doubtful people as yet, and that he would wish to come back and continue it. i first read about 'aliens' and hollow earth stuff from them, but i also heard it from late Ven Shen Kai too. maybe he knew it from spiritual knowledge. </p>

              <p>I am aware that channelled messages are not 100% accurate even if the intent is clear and good. However, I will strongly disagree if you think that nobody on Earth right now can channel messages from Lord Buddha, you just need to find the right person, that's all.</p>
              <p>Next, I want to know something...</p>
              <p>Is there anyone in this forum that can have direct telepathic communications with any of the following Ascended Masters:</p>
              <p>1. Lord Buddha</p>
              <p>2. Lord Sananda</p>
              <p>3. Lord Maitreya</p>
              <p>4. Guan Yin</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If yes, you can directly verify with any of the above to check whether Lord Buddha is the Planetory Logos;  this means that Lord Buddha is the overseer of the planetary level of the Creator’s universe.</span></p>
              <p>If no, then how/where do you get up-to-date news/information from the Great White Brotherhood? Do you have any monks from Tibet willing to pass new information around?</p>
              <p>If you seek the truth, why not put in more effort to find it?</p>

              <p>Buddha is not the 'overseer of the planetary level of the Creator's universe', firstly this seems like the job of some powerful worldly spirit, secondly Buddha taught dependent origination and negated a creator.</p>
              <p>The Buddha's sole concern and teaching is about the ending of suffering and ignorance in sentient beings, so the entire teaching of his is about suffering and how to end suffering through the noble eightfold path. His is not about mundane and worldly concerns.</p>

              <p>Best of Truths is the 4 Noble Truths (dun think its simple and easy to understand, cos it is not. dun look at the words and meanings, read beyond it and realise. its the realisation that existence is suffering, what are the causes of our continued existence, which are craving and ignorance. there is a way and path to end of your suffering)</p>

              <p>I am aware that channelled messages are not 100% accurate even
              if the intent is clear and good. However, I will strongly disagree
              if you think that nobody on Earth right now can channel messages
              from Lord Buddha, you just need to find the right person, that's
              all.</p>
              <p>Next, I want to know something...</p>
              <p>Is there anyone in this forum that can have direct telepathic
              communications with any of the following Ascended Masters:</p>
              <p>1. Lord Buddha</p>
              <p>2. Lord Sananda</p>
              <p>3. Lord Maitreya</p>
              <p>4. Guan Yin</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If yes, you can directly verify
              with any of the above to check whether Lord Buddha is the Planetory
              Logos; this means that Lord Buddha is the overseer of the planetary
              level of the Creator’s universe.</span></p>
              <p>If no, then how/where do you get up-to-date news/information
              from the Great White Brotherhood? Do you have any monks from Tibet
              willing to pass new information around?</p>
              <p>If you seek the truth, why not put in more effort to find
              it?</p>

              <p>u must try to have more commonsense and analysis.  The source say it is so-and-so, doesn't mean true rite?  if on internet, someone say he is ABC, do you 100% believe?  Just bcos this is a supernatural psychic vibe, don't think they can't play tricks on you.  Spirits also have character traits like mischievous, want to have fun, bored.  why don't you try to suspect your source of info abit? this will stop u from wasting time on the GWbrotherhood and all those things. Monks in Tibet don't trust in just any disembodied beings unless confirmed by high enlightened masters and match with Buddha's teachings.  They are very cynical about all these.  i think this is healthy cynicism.  sometimes, even high masters can get deceived by these things... so what abt us? These things can be very smart hor! They can make you spin round their little finger. </p>
