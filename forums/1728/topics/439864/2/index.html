              <p>I feel that the channelled message is accurate, that is why I posted it.</p>
              <p>As for who the channeller was or who the sender is, it does not really matter to me, its the energy that comes from the message that is important.</p>
              <p>At this point, I am unable to authenticate who is sending who telepathic messages but I can feel whether a message is useful or not. So far, I only know Guan Yin did send me messages, the rest I have no idea who at all.</p>
              <p>... Anyway I am somewhat disappointed with some of the replies in this forum. But nevermind anyway.</p>
              <p>As Iong as I can get you to read the channelled message - <a href="http://lightworkers.org/channeling/140500/lord-buddha-conscious-connection-planetary-level">LORD BUDDHA - Conscious Connection with Planetary Level</a> , I have already done my part, the rest is up you.</p>
              <p>After reading the channelled message, you may just 
              acknowledge it or ignore it, its your choice. I am not here to challenge anyone's belief system.</p>

              <p>I don't think we explicitly made claims of attainments (for the sake of making claims of attainments). What's the point of answering questions like "Are you enlightened? Is your wisdom eye open?" unless they are of practical help? If you asked me "how do I attain to insights", then I might answer you if you are sincerely seeking to gain wisdom for yourself.</p>
              <p>We
                               simply share whatever insights and experiences we had if it can benefit
                               others. So far many people have thanked me and told me how our sharings
                               were of help to them.</p>
              <p>Recently a Soto Zen priest (who himself 
                              gained realization of anatta) was telling me how my blog and e-book were
                               of help and he had taken my e-book as a guide. Likewise there had been many before who had benefitted, many now have deeper insights and enlightenment. You think my e-book is for fun and show-off? lol</p>
              <p>It is for these 
                              sincere, dedicated practitioners that I felt compelled not to keep my 
                              journey secret, but to share it openly for the sake of those who might 
                              benefit from it.</p>
