              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">LIVING UP TO ITS NAME Nestled some 5,000 meters above sea
              level, the trail leading to the Ganda La mountain pass in the Himalayas offers
              a spectacular view of rocky terrain from all sides. NIÑA CALLEJA</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">LADAKH,  India—It was high noon and I was gasping for
              breath as my trekking companions and I crossed Ganda La, a high mountain pass
              in the Himalayas. At close to 5,000 meters above sea level, the pass along a
              barren rocky terrain can easily make one dizzy.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; "></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I had set out on a seven-day trek to the Markha Valley of the
              Himalayas, a 75-kilometer route popular among visitors to this region. With me
              were four men from Israel, Australia, the Netherlands and France, and a local
              trekking guide whom I had just met at the start of our trek on Aug. 3.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I would be the slowest in the group, I warned them on our
              first day.  I had thought I was well prepared for the long trek, having
              practiced yoga for a month in Dharamshala in the Himachal Pradesh state of
              India, but true enough, my companions ended up miles ahead of me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"> “Small steps and deep
              breaths,” Uri, our Israeli trekking companion said. That early, I knew the
              Himalayas were set to test not just our physical strength but our character as
              well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I pushed on, one step at a time, until I saw the wall of
              carved stone tablets inscribed with the Tibetan mantra “Om Mani Padme Hung”
              which, according to Tibetan culture, contains all the teachings of the Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #474747;'>Prayer flags</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The Tibetan prayer walls, along with the colorful prayer
              flags fluttering in the breeze were a welcome sight, marking the top of the
              pass and buoying hopes among us that a village was nearby.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">My trekking companions had been waiting for me at the top of
              Ganda La pass. We feasted on our packed lunches– cold and hardened chapati
              smeared with honey and butter, a popular staple in South Asia; boiled egg and
              potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil; a chocolate bar, and orange juice in tetra
              pack.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">At the same time, we were treated to the glorious view of the
              immense Himalayan ranges, an out of this world desert landscape on all
              sides.  The road to Leh, a city in Ladakh, is open to motorists for only
              four and a half months, from May to mid-October, as snowfall blocks the high
              passes on other months of the year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The second day of the trek was our longest, as we had to walk
              more than 12 hours to reach our homestay for the night. “When was the last time
              you had walked this long?” Joe, our Australian group mate, asked during our
              11th hour on the trail.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I told him I had trekked to Mount Apo, the tallest mountain
              in the Philippines in 2014, and that my friends and I did it in three days,
              instead of the usual four or five days. He told me his was in Mount Mayon in
              the 1990s, with an Israeli mountaineer he had met there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #474747;'>Blisters</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I could have easily endured this day were it not for the
              blisters on my feet. Walking in my trekking boots proved too painful so I
              changed to sandals. It was slowgoing, and I had no first aid kit, an absolute
              necessity for this kind of trek.  Fortunately, Erick, our kindhearted
              Dutch companion, had thought about blisters before coming to the Himalayas. 
              “It is nice to unload some weight,” he said, handing me his pack of first aid
              supplies. Every night I would treat my blister-covered feet with betadine
              ointment and bandages.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The seven-day trek had been meditative for me, a spiritual
              journey that gave me time to observe equanimity as we continued the long and
              arduous walk. India was, for me, the best country for spiritual exploration,
              being the birthplace of the world’s major religions. Many cultural traditions
              also regard the Himalayas as a sacred place and the home of the Gods.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Ladakh, which borders Tibet to the east, has a rich Buddhist
              culture evident in every household here, with their small shrines that had a
              picture of the Dalai Lama at the center. Other Buddhist statues and offering
              bowls, like a jar of barley grains, were also on display.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #474747;'>Homestays</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">After our grueling trek, we sought refuge in homestays with
              Ladakhi families in their homes of sun-dried mudbricks and stone walls adorned
              with yak’s hair and horns. It was the best way to immerse one’s self into the
              region’s culture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">There were touching attempts to bridge the language barrier,
              as when our female host offered us a cup of local wine made from barley.
              “Chaang, chaang?” she asked her mystified guests.  After she showed us
              some grains of barley, I took a sip and felt warmth in my throat. “Good,” I
              said, giving her the thumbs up sign.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">We spent our last night in a tent in Nimaling, a beautiful
              and vast green pasture land in Markha Valley, with a view of the snowcapped
              Kang Yatze mountain.  It was freezing cold and the heavy rain in the night
              made it worse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">On our last day, we had to cross the last and highest pass
              called Gongmaru La, which has an elevation of 5,130 meters. I reached the top
              after three hours and basked in the collective feeling of triumph among some
              Germans who had arrived before me.  But not everybody was pleased. 
              Our Ladakhi guide, in fact, reprimanded me.  “I have been waiting for you
              for the last 30 minutes,” he complained.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #474747;'>No compassion</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I lost my cool. This was not the first time he scolded me. On
              our third day, he told me I didn’t have the “energy to acclimatize” and that I
              should not have chosen the Markha Valley trek. So this time I shot back that he
              could go ahead anytime as I did not need a guide. It was easy enough to
              navigate the trail replete with footprints and horse manure most of the time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Later in the afternoon, I found my group mates and our guide
              resting inside a tent, which served as a tea shop for trekkers taking a break.
              I had not sat two minutes when our guide said we should go as we had been
              delayed so much. He was about to say how long he had been waiting for me when I
              cut in:  “You claim to be Buddhist, but you lack compassion!”  For
              me, Buddhism is synonymous to love and compassion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #474747;'>“Julley”</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I burst into tears on the last stretch of the trek, probably
              because of anger and exhaustion.  Along the river, a Ladakhi woman greeted
              me. “Julley,” she said, which in Ladakh means both “hello” and “thank you.” I
              sobbed even harder because she looked like my mother when she was younger. I
              have always been mistaken for a local because the Ladakhis bear much
              resemblance to Filipinos.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">It was close to 5 in the afternoon when we reached Shang
              Sumdo village where a van that would take us to Leh waited.  “We made it,”
              I said, feeling a sense of accomplishment despite all my energy being depleted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But my journey would not be complete without finding the
              Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet. I thought that since I would be
              staying in McLeod Ganj, a suburb in Dharamsala, to practice yoga for a month,
              this possibility was not too remote.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #474747;'>Finding the Dalai Lama </span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Since his escape from the Chinese authorities in Tibet in
              1959, the 14th Dalai Lama has been residing in McLeod Ganj along with the
              Tibetan government in exile.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I had seen Martin Scorsese’s “Kundun,” the 1997 film about
              the Dalai Lama from the time he was found by the search teams looking for the
              latest reincarnation of the last Dalai Lama, up to his dramatic escape to
              India.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I was in McLeod Ganj when the Tibetans celebrated the Dalai
              Lama’s 81st birthday, but he was in the southern part of India at that time, I
              was told. So I abandoned any hope of seeing him at all and continued my journey
              to Leh in Ladakh.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">On my return from the trek, I heard from the locals that he
              was visiting and would be holding a public teaching in Thiksey Monastery on top
              of a hill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">After a shared taxi ride to Thiksey early the next day, I
              found the grounds below the monastery filled with thousands and sought a media
              spot at the aisle within striking distance of the Dalai Lama.  Having
              coverEd the historic state visit of Pope Francis to Manila in January 2015, I
              saw how different the security and people’s reaction to the two religious
              leaders were. The people around the Dalai Lama were more contemplative and there
              was no mad rush to get near or touch him. A local policeman even allowed me to
              take photos near the stage even if I didn’t have a press ID.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">So there he was—the Dalai Lama, sitting on a wide golden
              chair and speaking in Tibetan, which was being translated to Ladakhi over a
              loudspeaker. While I couldn’t understand a word, I was sure his three-hour long
              speech was sprinkled with anecdotes and jokes because he often laughed and
              smiled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #474747;'>Asking the Dalai Lama</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I was completely mesmerized. I had actually thought of
              approaching him and asking one political question—about China—but the
              journalists following him said this was not possible as I have to write his
              office a request letter first.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But just seeing the Dalai Lama was enough; it was a beautiful
              experience that capped my 10 days in the “Land of High Passes,” as Ladakh is
              known.</span></p>
