                  Sikkim’s last king and queen reads like a fairy tale gone wrong</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">1 August
                  2015 The Spectator </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Glamour, romance and a deposed
                  monarch are vividly evoked in Andrew Duff’s nostalgic history of the
                  beleaguered Himalayan former kingdom</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Sikkim was a Himalayan kingdom a
                  third of the size of Wales squeezed between China, India, Nepal and Bhutan. I
                  was there once in April, when the sky was cornflower blue. When Britain
                  withdrew from India the last ‘Chogyal’, or king, battled for his country’s
                  independence, but Mrs Ghandi won the war, and Sikkim is an Indian state now.
                  It’s a sad story, as Andrew Duff’s subtitle suggests, but one representative of
                  20th-century geopolitics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">This dense book — Duff’s first —
                  places Chogyal Thondup Namgyal at the centre of the story and focuses
                  exclusively on the period from the 1950s to the 1970s. Sikkim’s strategic
                  position is crucial, particularly as the Cold War hots up, and spies from
                  Peking, Delhi and Washington sidle on and off the pages. Everyone gets
                  particularly worked up about Tibet (Sikkim, unlike most of the other princely
                  states, was and is Buddhist, and had strong ties with the Lhasa theocracy). The
                  Chogyal’s sister Coocoola, an important figure, was passionate about the
                  Tibetan cause and rode the trade route over to Gyantse with a rifle over her
                  shoulder and a revolver in her pocket.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">There is, too, a touch of Grace Kelly
                  glamour, as in the lounge of the Windermere Hotel in Darjeeling Thondup met a
                  20-year-old American beauty called Hope Cooke. They married in 1963, ‘in the
                  shadow of the Sino-Indian conflict’. A scarlet-robed lama officiated, and the
                  Maharaja of Jaipur brought his own champagne. Cooke embraced her new country,
                  but noted astutely: ‘I can just see them using me as a wedge to help destroy
                  his [Thondup’s] rule.’ And they did. The tide turned against her almost
                  everywhere, as tides always do. <em>Newsweek</em> called her ‘a Himalayan
                  Marie-Antoinette’, and Henry Kissinger (who pops up frequently) wrote, with
                  characteristic sensitivity: ‘She has become more Buddhist than the population.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><br> Duff has undertaken diligent research in diplomatic archives across the world
                  and it is hard to imagine there is much information about this small place in
                  those decades that has escaped his attention. Just as he finished his first
                  draft, Wikileaks released 500 secret cables revealing fresh information about
                  US involvement in Sikkim. As Duff writes: ‘The patchwork of alliances and
                  enmities surrounding and within Sikkim had the characteristics of a fiendishly complex
                  multi-player game of chess.’ China did not recognise Sikkim as part of India
                  until 2005.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I would have liked more background
                  information on the topography and customs of thin-aired Sikkim, and in
                  particular on the various ethnic groups (they barely get a mention). Duff
                  mentions ‘Sikkim’s separate identity’, but one never gets a clear sense of what
                  it is. Equally, while I admire the author’s refusal to indulge in speculation,
                  he remarks often that the relationship between Cooke and Thondup was ‘never simple’,
                  yet these pages offer the reader little insight on how.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As is often the case with nationalist
                  causes, Sikkim wanted to be free of India but was heavily reliant on the aid
                  flowing from Delhi. Inevitably, Mrs Gandhi got her way and annexed the kingdom
                  in 1975. Duff is sympathetic to Thondup and instinctively on his side, but he
                  makes it clear that the man was not an adept politician. Emotion ruled the day
                  — when his minders in Calcutta refused to let him fly the Sikkim flag on his
                  car, he let the vehicle proceed without him and walked with an assistant
                  holding the flag.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In short, he was not up to his job.
                  One wonders who would have been, with almost every superpower on the case.
                  ‘Everyone agrees,’ writes Duff, ‘that Sikkim’s sensitive geopolitical position
                  dealt Thondup an almost unplayable hand.’ At least the state enjoys relative
                  peace now, living off hydroelectricity and tourism — unlike Tibet. But one has
                  ample evidence that Beijing will not rest until cultural annihilation on the
                  plateau is complete.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As a result of a referendum, the
                  monarchy was abolished in 1975, and the marriage crumbled under the strain of
                  events. Cooke left the modest palace in Sikkim’s capital, Gangtok, and returned
                  to America with her two children. Thondup died in 1982, and Cooke lives on in
                  New York, though she refused to meet Duff. He quotes judiciously from her
                  autobiography <em>Time Change</em>.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">This a wonderful story, expertly
                  told, and, given the Everest of books on India, </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">Duff was clever to spot it. What a film it would make!</span></p>
