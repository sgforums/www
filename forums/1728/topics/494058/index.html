              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How
              to Avoid the Many Pitfalls of Tea Brewing</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              am real, and the tea is real. I am in the present. I don’t think of the past. I
              don’t think of the future. There is a real encounter between me and the tea,
              and peace, happiness, and joy are possible during the time I drink. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">—Thich
              Nhat Hanh</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              could be a poem or a novel or lyrics to a blues ballad, I’m not sure, but I’ve
              been keeping a list of all the terrible, no good, very bad cups of tea I make.
              There are just so many ways it can go wrong.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Like
              the time I was trying to be considerate by preheating a special guest’s tea cup
              with hot water and then forgot and poured the tea into the full cup (the light
              was dim). Like all the times I’ve tried to be thrifty and reuse old leaves or
              old bags well past their point of releasing any worthy flavor.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Then
              there was the time the lama casually mentioned that when he was growing up in
              Sikkim they used to toast the Darjeeling tea leaves before brewing. How many
              times I burned the leaves that summer. Such bitter cups I served, with shaking
              hands and rattling spoons.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              the oolong, oh, the oolong with its testy time limits and tiny cups. The bitter
              chai with ginger stewed too long or overly biting cloves. The tasteless maté in
              that complicated calabash gourd with the metal straw. Lady Grey served in a
              chipped cup. Curdled black currant, coffee poured in tea, tea poured in coffee.
              Tea made in anger, tea made in haste, tea made with tears. Tea on the counter.
              Tea on the floor. Tea on my knees. Tea on the doorstep as I try to turn the
              knob while holding a carafe in one hand and the saucer set in the other.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Burning
              the milk is one of the gravest tea misdeeds in the eyes of some Tibetans. But
              it’s so hard to keep an eye on hot milk. So innocent as it trembles in the
              saucepan, but blink and it’s racing to the lip of the pot. The foam mushrooms
              out and over the edge onto the stovetop, where it blackens the burner. Once,
              after I produced such a mess in the presence of a lama, the monks were quickly
              summoned to do protector pujas. It turns out there are a few female deities who
              are offended by the smell of burned milk, and they are not to be messed with.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">All
              these terrible cups of tea were the result of mindlessness, not paying
              attention, losing track, multitasking. But there have been other times when
              it’s gone all pear-shaped even when I’m really, really trying. There’s that one
              pretty pot I love to use but whose spout is angled in such a way that the tea
              insists on alternately shooting out over the cup and dribbling down the side.
              No one can predict the sweet spot, and there’s always a spill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              a way, a perfect cup of tea is a miracle of causes and conditions, and when one
              meets our lips, we should give praise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you hold your cup, you may like to breathe in, to bring your mind back to your
              body, and you become fully present. And when you are truly there, something
              else is also there—life, represented by the cup of tea. In that moment you are
              real, and the cup of tea is real. You are not lost in the past, in the future,
              in your projects, in your worries. You are free from all of these afflictions.
              And in that state of being free, you enjoy your tea. That is the moment of
              happiness, and of peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">—Thich
              Nhat Hanh</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Good Old-Fashioned Sun Tea </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">My
              friend Wyatt lives in a house with solar-heated water and swears that he can
              feel the sunshine on his skin when he bathes. If you believe that, you might
              also taste the sun in sun tea, and you’ll definitely save a few shekels on fuel
              costs. Find a big empty jar like the kind restaurants buy for industrial-sized
              quantities of maraschino cherries or pickles. Make sure it doesn’t smell like
              pickles or maraschino cherries (apple vinegar cleans well). Fill it with water,
              praise Mamaki the water dakini. Put some tea into the jar, about 3 bags or a
              sachet of loose tea (strawberry, peach, rose hip, spearmint, lemon, or black
              tea all work well, but not together, obviously) and stick it in a sunny spot.
              Revisit after about six hours and you will meet your tea. You can add honey or
              juice to sweeten (a cup of cherry, apple, or grape will work well). Then you
              can get creative with garnishes and flavors. Fresh mint and strawberry go well
              together. Boil up some ginger and add to the lemon tea. Women might try 4 bags
              of Yogi Woman’s Moon Cycle Tea, then adding half a cup of unsweetened cranberry
              juice and a bit of chasteberry tincture for a soothing tonic. Don’t brew the
              black tea too long, or the tannins will become bitter. Serve in jars on a
              checkered tablecloth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Perfect Cold Brew Coffee </span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              is the best way to make iced coffee. Place one cup of ground coffee in the jug
              (my favorite brand right now is Boxcar Coffee from Boulder) with 4 cups of cold
              water. Let it soak overnight. Sleep well. Strain out the coffee grains using a
              drip coffee filter, then pour the thick black liquid back into your jug. This
              part can be messy unless you find proper implements. It will last for weeks if
              you keep it refrigerated. This jug of condensed coffee is your base for either
              cold or hot drinks. It’s less acidic, smooth, and strong. For hot coffee, pour
              an ounce of the jug coffee in an un-cracked mug and dilute with hot water to
              taste. For iced coffee, find a tall glass and fill it with ice cubes, pour the
              jug coffee over it, and imagine the cracking sound is the ice laughing.
              Dedicate the merit. If you take sweetener, simple syrup (a mixture of 1 part
              water to 1 part sugar, boiled together) dissolves better. Wish sweetness in a
              sour person’s life. Add a shot of cream, condensed milk, or full-fat milk on
              top and watch the paisley patterns curl into the blackness. Remember to enjoy it.</span></p>

              <p>Thay is a miracle. This week I went ahead and borrowed four books from Sembawang public library by him. Since I started reading his book "Teachings on Love" when I was in university, I have always stuck with the teachings of the Gautama Buddha whenever I can, will and may. The past few years ever since I gradually branched into bereavement instead of corporate life, I thought he would be gone by now. Yet, despite him entering a coma months ago, he came back fighting, and breathing.</p>
              <p>His Plum Village's brand of socially engaged Buddhism imho can only be matched by Tzu Chi's humanistic Buddhism and Sokai International's Japanese Buddhism approach in the modern sense. Meaningful and globalised Buddhism at their best, or so I reckoned.</p>
