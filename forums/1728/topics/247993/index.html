It is due to <strong>attachment</strong> that they keep holding onto something that has already changed but couldn't accept it?<br><br>Well, It is human to feel sad. I had my periods of heartache, disappointment too but eventually after there period of time, we know it is inevitable and so we move on.<br><br>When u go deeper into buddhism and u will realise that..... sad, happiness, pleasure and pain are actually all the same... arise from ... u just gotta read and understand... there is an end of suffering<br><br>I could recommend u to read what is four noble truth or any book on basic buddhism.<br><br>u can read " ruling your world" by sakyong Mipham or any books by dalai lama.<br><br></div>

You should also constantly ask yourself whether this is what I should do? Rather than acting according to our habitual momentum unconsciously... it is important to bring out everything that is happening in our minds into conscious view first, this is a way we can train our wisdom, as well as clear all our habit energy. For the beginning we should have a inquisitive mind, to question intelligently before we act... like 'san si hou xing'.<br><br>Overcoming fear is the same... most fear are really unnecessary, they are psychological.. it becomes almost an unconscious and habitual function of our consciousness... constantly worrying for what's going to happen to me in the future, to my loved ones, etc. First we have to accept that fear arises... we have to accept them and watch them as they are.. If we can train ourselves to see these thoughts as it is (i.e mindfulness), and not follow these thoughts, gradually these thoughts will lose their unconscious momentum. (see: <a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe13.html" rel="nofollow">Mindfulness</a>)<br><br>Do look into the Buddhist teachings... they can certainly help <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Ultimately dualities like 'failures' and 'success' is very relative, it is a constantly changing interplay so we should not grasp unto such notions.. like Sai Wong's horses. Go with the flow... let prajna intelligence arise spontaneously. To think... 10 years or 100 years down the roads, all our failures etc wld probably not have mattered anymore..</div>

(i.e addiction) Like mentioned previously mindful awareness is important without which we will easily go along with unconscious habitual momentum.. with mindfulness, the mind movement (for example, I need to play computer game now!) subsides as it is being seen as it is.. rather than being followed, one thought leading to the next, and then resulting in the actions (karmic effect) the thought desires.<br><br>Anyway addictive and stimulating activities which simply serves as a distraction from our ordinary stress are poor substitute for true mental equanimity and joy.. if one can develope these qualities through meditative practise, which is not only limited to sitting but also standing, walking, etc, then one will not be stressed in the first place.. or have the need to find some new excitedment... there will be contentment even if he is doing a very boring job, for example. If one is very stressed, one does not necessarily need to indulge in addictive activities... one can just relax in listening to light music, Buddhist music, or practise meditation. Meditation is very helpful in developing those positive mental qualities such as those I mentioned... and also developing insights into the nature of reality. Fundamentally speaking all these discontentment, stress, aversion as well as desire/addiction is due to the illusion of a separate dualistic self... which Buddhists call the fundamental ignorance.<br><br><blockquote>...Every addiction arises from an unconscious refusal to face and move through your own pain. Every addiction starts with pain and ends with pain. Whatever the substance you are addicted to - alcohol, food, legal or illegal drugs, or a person - you are using something or somebody to cover up your pain. That is why, after the initial euphoria has passed, there is so much unhappiness, so much pain in intimate relationships. They do not cause pain and unhappiness. They bring out the pain and unhappiness that is already in you. Every addiction does that. Every addiction reaches a point where it does not work for you anymore, and then you feel the pain more intensely than ever.<br><br>This is one reason why most people are always trying to escape from the present moment and are seeking some kind of salvation in the future. The first thing that they might encounter if they focused their attention on the Now is their own pain, and this is what they fear. If they only knew how easy it is to access in the Now the power of presence that dissolves the past and its pain, the reality that dissolves the illusion. If they only knew how close they are to their own reality, how close to God...<br><br>~ Eckhart Tolle</blockquote></div>

There is a difference between people who live their life mindful and non-mindfully. Mindful people are aware of what is not beneficial for them and thus before it arises/happens, they stopped doing those thing, thus stopping addiction. Without even being mindful of what is going on and knowing what is non-benefical and benefical, u r like a lost sheep and unaware of where u are going.<br><br></div>
