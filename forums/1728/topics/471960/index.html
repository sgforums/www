              <div class="articleBody"><span> </span>
              <p>MEDITATION is fast becoming a fashionable tool for improving your mind. 
              With mounting scientific evidence that the practice can enhance 
              creativity, memory and scores on standardized intelligence tests, 
              interest in its practical benefits is growing. A number of “mindfulness”
               training programs, like that developed by the engineer <a href="http://chademeng.com">Chade-Meng Tan</a> at Google, and conferences like Wisdom 2.0 for business and tech 
              leaders, promise attendees insight into how meditation can be used to 
              augment individual performance, leadership and productivity.</p>
              <p>This is all well and good, but if you stop to think about it, there’s a 
              bit of a disconnect between the (perfectly commendable) pursuit of these
               benefits and the purpose for which meditation was originally intended. 
              Gaining competitive advantage on exams and increasing creativity in 
              business weren’t of the utmost concern to Buddha and other early 
              meditation teachers. As Buddha himself said, “I teach one thing and one 
              only: that is, suffering and the end of suffering.” For Buddha, as for 
              many modern spiritual leaders, the goal of meditation was as simple as 
              that. The heightened control of the mind that meditation offers was 
              supposed to help its practitioners see the world in a new and more 
              compassionate way, allowing them to break free from the categorizations 
              (us/them, self/other) that commonly divide people from one another.</p>
              <p>But does meditation work as promised? Is its originally intended effect —
               the reduction of suffering — empirically demonstrable?</p>
              <p>To put the question to the test, <a href="http://www.socialemotions.org/">my lab</a>,
               led in this work by the psychologist Paul Condon, joined with the 
              neuroscientist Gaëlle Desbordes and the Buddhist lama Willa Miller to 
              conduct an experiment whose <a href="http://www.socialemotions.org/page5/files/Condon.etal.2013.pdf">publication is forthcoming</a> in the journal Psychological Science. We recruited 39 people from the 
              Boston area who were willing to take part in an eight-week course on 
              meditation (and who had never taken any such course before). We then 
              randomly assigned 20 of them to take part in weekly meditation classes, 
              which also required them to practice at home using guided recordings. 
              The remaining 19 were told that they had been placed on a waiting list 
              for a future course.</p>
              <p>After the eight-week period of instruction, we invited the participants 
              to the lab for an experiment that purported to examine their memory, 
              attention and related cognitive abilities. But as you might anticipate, 
              what actually interested us was whether those who had been meditating 
              would exhibit greater compassion in the face of suffering. To find out, 
              we staged a situation designed to test the participants’ behavior before
               they were aware that the experiment had begun.</p>
              <p>WHEN a participant entered the waiting area for our lab, he (or she) 
              found three chairs, two of which were already occupied. Naturally, he 
              sat in the remaining chair. As he waited, a fourth person, using 
              crutches and wearing a boot for a broken foot, entered the room and 
              audibly sighed in pain as she leaned uncomfortably against a wall. The 
              other two people in the room — who, like the woman on crutches, secretly
               worked for us — ignored the woman, thus confronting the participant 
              with a moral quandary. Would he act compassionately, giving up his chair
               for her, or selfishly ignore her plight?</p>
              <p>The results were striking. Although only 16 percent of the nonmeditators
               gave up their seats — an admittedly disheartening fact — the proportion
               rose to 50 percent among those who had meditated. This increase is 
              impressive not solely because it occurred after only eight weeks of 
              meditation, but also because it did so within the context of a situation
               known to inhibit considerate behavior: witnessing others ignoring a 
              person in distress — what psychologists call the bystander effect — 
              reduces the odds that any single individual will help. Nonetheless, the 
              meditation increased the compassionate response threefold.</p>
              <p>Although we don’t yet know why meditation has this effect, one of two 
              explanations seems likely. The first rests on meditation’s documented 
              ability to enhance attention, which might in turn increase the odds of 
              noticing someone in pain (as opposed to being lost in one’s own 
              thoughts). My favored explanation, though, derives from a different 
              aspect of meditation: its ability to foster a view that all beings are 
              interconnected. The psychologist Piercarlo Valdesolo and I have found 
              that any marker of affiliation between two people, even something as 
              subtle as tapping their hands together in synchrony, causes them to feel
               more compassion for each other when distressed. The increased 
              compassion of meditators, then, might stem directly from meditation’s 
              ability to dissolve the artificial social distinctions — ethnicity, 
              religion, ideology and the like — that divide us.</p>
              <p>Supporting this view, <a href="http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/publications/2013/WengCompassionPsychSci.pdf">recent findings</a> by the neuroscientists Helen Weng, Richard Davidson and colleagues 
              confirm that even relatively brief training in meditative techniques can
               alter neural functioning in brain areas associated with empathic 
              understanding of others’ distress — areas whose responsiveness is also 
              modulated by a person’s degree of felt associations with others.</p>
              <p>So take heart. The next time you meditate, know that you’re not just 
              benefiting yourself, you’re also benefiting your neighbors, community 
              members and as-yet-unknown strangers by increasing the odds that you’ll 
              feel their pain when the time comes, and act to lessen it as well.</p>
