              <p>When you see cockroaches upturned on their sides and ants swarming over it (presumably taking tiny little bites) you can see the cockroach's legs flailing in pain. So, my take is that as long they can feel pain they have the Buddha-nature,
                  meaning once karma has taken its course they will sooner or later they
                  will be reborn as a human.</p>

              <p>Animals have cognizance just like we do. Therefore it is utterly ignorant and false to slaughter animals bcos they are seen as somehow different from us... as they are completely capable of the pain and suffering we experience.</p>
              <p>But, there is no soul in either human nor animals.</p>
              <p>You heard it right... there is no soul, even in human beings.</p>
              <p>There is consciousness, cognizance, but there is no such thing as a 'self'.</p>
              <p>There are unique, individual mindstreams, which are momentary manifestation of cognizance according to conditions... consciousness arise dependent on sense organ and sense objects, there is no independent, permanent soul.</p>

              <p>excuse me for posting here ..... I am not buddhist ..... I am a catholic, but I am utterly, utterly convinced that animals do have souls ..... and that God's love extends to all of his creation, not just human beings.</p>
              <p>And there are many other christians and catholics that hold similar view too. The late Pope John Paul II for example, also affirmed that animals, too, have souls, he went on to remind us to have the same love and compassion for our animal brethrens. There are organizations like the catholic concern for animals, and in many catholic churches around the world, blessings for pets and animals are traditionally conducted by the priests at certain parishes, like st mary's of the angels at bukit batok in Singapore, during the feast day of st francis of assisi, october 4th. St Franscis of Assisi was known to have preached the gospel to the animals, and he's known today as the patron saint of animals. You'll see lots of people bringing in different pets to the church to be blessed by the priests during the occassion.</p>
              <p>I think it's pointless to go into the nuances of the doctrines of different religions, but to me, it's very very simple, what does your conscience, your humanity, tells you ? The response of the average human being to animal suffering would be the same; compassion, empathy, that's what makes us human ... even if what you believe in differs from mine, let this be a universal guide.</p>

              <p>You friend follow blindly without seeing for himself. I believe he see animals do have pain but refuse to acknowledge it because the book or the pastor says so. He should learn from Fatum who believes what he sees and not what the book or pastor says.</p>
              <p>There was an episode in Incredible Tales. It was about a businessman (he showed his face on TV so I believed he was telling the truth, he was a boss of an entertainment company). He said he was haunted by a monkey's spirit. I believed animals do have counciousness or so call spirits.</p>

              <p>In Buddhism, animals are sentiment beings just like humans. They do not just feel pain when being slaughtered, they also have feelings for their young ones and loved ones just like humans.</p>

              <p>When I was young, I used to catch birds and never have deep thoughts. Till I became a Buddhist, I have deeper thoughts for animals. Just like the poem above, it says animals lifes are as precious as humans, they aslo have bones and skins (their blood is also red like ours), advise not to kill the birds at the trees, have you thought that their youngs who are in the nest looking forward to their mother coming home.</p>

              <p>Actually the Buddha did not keep quiet on whether there was an Atman. He clearly demonstrated how there is no Atman or a Tathagata-self (see the highlighted in red passage below) - no such Self or Tathagata can be pinned down anywhere. However he does not deny an individual mindstream of the five aggregates conventionally labelled as self.</p>
              <p>What he kept quiet was the notion of a self that can be existent and non-existent. If there is no such self that can be located, or found, to begin with, all the four extreme categories (existence, non-existence, both and neither) are effectively denied.</p>
              <p>By saying, soul does not exist, a person may be prone to an nihilistic, materialistic understand that 'upon death, the self ceases, as there is no self that can persist'. By saying soul exists, a person will cling to an eternalistic understanding that 'upon death, the soul goes on'.</p>
              <p>Both these are false views that Buddha did not want Vacchagota to fall into. The understanding of Anatta is that there is no 'self' that can be pinned down inside or beyond the five skandhas, so there can be no eternal self, or a self that annihilates, for there is only ever a continuity of process and dependent origination.</p>

              <p>Then Vacchagotta the wanderer, getting up from his seat, went to Ven.

                                            Ven. Maha Moggallana and received exactly the same explanation].</p>

              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="vesali" name="vesali">Vesali</a>, in the <a id="greatwood" name="greatwood">Great Wood</a>, at the Hall of the Gabled Pavilion. At that time <a id="anuradha" name="anuradha">Ven. Anuradha</a> was staying not far from the Blessed One in a wilderness hut.</p>
              <p>Then a large number of wandering sectarians went to Ven. Anuradha and
                                         on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of
                                         friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, they sat to one side. As they were
                                         sitting there, they said to Ven. Anuradha, "Friend Anuradha, the 
                                        Tathagata — the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the 
                                        superlative attainment — being described, is described with [one of] 
                                        these four positions: The Tathagata exists after death, does not exist 
                                        after death, both does &amp; does not exist after death, neither exists 
                                        nor does not exist after death."</p>
              <p>When this was said, Ven. Anuradha said to the wandering sectarians, 
                                        "Friends, the Tathagata — the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer
                                         of the superlative attainment — being described, is described otherwise
                                         than with these four positions: The Tathagata exists after death, does 
                                        not exist after death, both does &amp; does not exist after death, 
                                        neither exists nor does not exist after death."</p>
              <p>When this was said, the wandering sectarians said to Ven. Anuradha, 
                                        "This monk is either a newcomer, not long gone forth, or else an elder 
                                        who is foolish &amp; inexperienced." So the wandering sectarians, 
                                        addressing Ven. Anuradha as they would a newcomer or a fool, got up from
                                         their seats and left.</p>
              <p>Then not long after the wandering sectarians had left, this thought 
                                        occurred to Ven. Anuradha: "If I am questioned again by those wandering 
                                        sectarians, how will I answer in such a way that will I speak in line 
                                        with what the Blessed One has said, will not misrepresent the Blessed 
                                        One with what is unfactual, will answer in line with the Dhamma, so that
                                         no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for 
                                        criticizing me?"</p>
              <p>Then Ven. Anuradha went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having 
                                        bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there 
                                        he said to the Blessed One: "Just now I was staying not far from the

                                         or a fool, they got up from their seats and left.</p>

              <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, do you too know 
              of this Teaching, the wrong view of the bhikkhu Sati, the son of a 
              fisherman, on account of which he misrepresents us and also destroys 
              himself and accumulates much suffering?"</p>
              <p>"No, venerable sir. In various ways we have been taught that 
              consciousness arises dependently. Without a cause there is no arising of
               consciousness."</p>
              <p>"Good, bhikkhus! Good that you know the Dhamma taught by me. In various 
              ways I have taught that consciousness arises dependently. Without a 
              cause, there is no arising of consciousness. Yet, this bhikkhu Sati, son
               of a fisherman, by holding to this wrong view, misrepresents us and 
              destroys himself and accumulates much demerit, and it will be for his 
              suffering for a long time.</p>
              <p>"Bhikkhus, consciousness is reckoned by the condition dependent upon 
              which it arises. If consciousness arises on account of eye and forms, it
               is reckoned as eye consciousness. If on account of ear and sounds it 
              arises, it is reckoned as ear consciousness. If on account of nose and 
              smells it arises, it is reckoned as nose consciousness. If on account of
               tongue and tastes it arises, it is reckoned as tongue consciousness. If
               on account of body and touch it arises, it is reckoned as body 
              consciousness. If on account of mind and mind-objects it arises, it is 
              reckoned as mind consciousness. Bhikkhus, just as a fire is reckoned 
              based on whatever that fire burns - fire ablaze on sticks is a stick 
              fire, fire ablaze on twigs is a twig fire, fire ablaze on grass is a 
              grass fire, fire ablaze on cowdung is a cowdung fire, fire ablaze on 
              grain thrash is a grain thrash fire, fire ablaze on rubbish is a rubbish
               fire - so too is consciousness reckoned by the condition dependent upon
               which it arises. In the same manner consciousness arisen on account is 
              eye and forms is eye consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of 
              ear and sounds is ear consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of 
              nose and smells is nose consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account 
              of tongue and tastes is taste consciousness. Consciousness arisen on 
              account of body and touch is body consciousness. Consciousness arisen on
               account of mind and mind-objects is mind consciousness.</p>
              <p>"Bhikkhus, do you see, This has arisen?" "Yes, venerable sir". "Do you 
              see it arises supported by That?" "Yes, venerable sir." "Bhikkhus, Do 
              you see if the support ceases, the arising too ceases?" "Yes, venerable 
              sir."</p>
              <p>"Bhikkhus, when you are not sure whether something has arisen do doubts 
              arise?" "Yes, venerable sir." "When you are not sure why something has 
              arisen, do doubts arise?" "Yes, venerable sir." "Bhikkhus, when you are 
              not sure that with ceasing of a certain support, that the arisen too 
              would cease, do doubts arise?" "Yes, venerable sir."</p>
              <p>"Bhikkhus, do your doubts fade when you see with right wisdom, that 
              something has arisen?" "Yes, venerable sir." "Bhikkhus, do your doubts 
              fade when you see with right wisdom, that something arises with a 
              support?" "Yes, venerable sir." "Bhikkhus, do your doubts fade when you 
              sees with right wisdom that with the cessation of its supports, the 
              arisen also ceases?" "Yes, venerable sir."</p>
              <p>"Bhikkhus, This has arisen - are your doubts dispelled about that?" 
              "Yes, venerable sir." "Bhikkhus, This has arisen with That as support - 
              are your doubts dispelled about that?" "Yes, venerable sir." "Bhikkhus, 
              when that support ceases, the arising too ceases - are your doubts 
              dispelled about that?" "Yes, venerable sir."</p>
              <p>"Bhikkhus, do you clearly see, as it really is, with right wisdom, this 
              is arising?." "Yes,venerable sir." "Bhikkhus, do you clearly see, with 
              right wisdom, that this arises supported?" "Yes, venerable sir." 
              "Bhikkhus, do you clearly see, with right wisdom, that when the support 
              ceases the arising too ceases?" "Yes, venerable sir."</p>
              <p>"Bhikkkhus, as purified and bright as this view is, if you covet, 
              cherish, treasure and take pride in it, do you understand this Dhamma as
               comparable to a raft, taught for the purpose of giving up [i.e. 
              crossing over] and not for the purpose of grasping?" "No, venerable 
              sir." "Bhikkhus, as purified and bright as this view is, if you do not 
              covet, cherish, treasure and take pride in it, would you then know this 
              Dhamma as comparable to a raft, taught for the purpose of giving up 
              [i.e. crossing over] and not for the purpose of grasping?" "Yes, 
              venerable sir."</p>

              <p><br>yes, tis why it's best to be clear that Buddha rejected both <strong>extreme</strong>. as one can be mistaken as nihilistic or eternalism, is what i'm getting at. i think why buddha stress more on not-self is because of our world, ppl are more attached to eternalism. if He go to another world where ppl are more attached to no self, He would have stress more on true self to break their attachment.</p>
              <p>our pureland school is more incline to the brilliant existence side than the true emptiness side, so people can take birth there. but nevertheless, they are one.</p>
