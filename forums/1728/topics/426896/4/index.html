              <p><br>no, it is not necessary.  It's just one of the 8400 door to enlightenment.</p>
              <p>One can realize one's nature by Zen meditation.  By chanting , by repenting, by walking meditation, by visualising Buddha etc etc...8400 doorways.</p>
              <p>I read on the website an old tibetan sculptor chanted only Om mani padme hum whole life while he worked .  He knew when his passing away date, he told his children to surround him on his death day. His body shrunk and he left behind only nails and hair and there was a rainbow formed on the day he died.</p>
              <p>( he achieved the rainbow body nature ...highest level in tantric)  and he was just an illiterate man who focus on one mantra whole life. He was very poor but he would let any passerby to drink water and rest in his humble home. This old sculptor achieved what many high Rinpoches could not. He was so unknown till he died.</p>

              <p>Last time before Master passed away, he instructed local teacher lzls to change Shakyamuni Buddha image and statue to this:</p>
              <p><img src="http://azenvoice.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/zen-circle-zen-buddhist.jpg" alt="" width="1092" height="1100"></p>
              <p>Might as well pay respect to our own self-nature Buddha who is in fact the True Buddha.</p>
              <p>(<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">1. “He who sees 
                          me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in sounds is on a heterodox path and 
                          cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">2. “All forms 
                          are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are illusory, one sees the 
                          Tathagata.) </span></p>
              <p>Other things he wanted local teacher lzls to implement was the four refuge system similar to vajrayana. Take refuge in guru... including the lay teacher.</p>
              <p>Local teacher lzls was the ONLY teacher who received this instruction... even Taiwanese teacher chen who is Master's dharma successor, did not receive this instruction.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately she was too scared to implement this... she said the next gen teachers should implement it.</p>

              <p>Might as well pay respect to our own self-nature Buddha who is in fact the True Buddha.</p>
              <p>Other things he wanted my dharma teacher to implement was the four refuge system similar to vajrayana. Take refuge in guru... including the lay teacher.</p>
              <p>My local teacher was the ONLY teacher who received this instruction... even my Taiwanese teacher who is my Master's dharma successor, did not receive this instruction.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately she was too scared to implement this... she said the next gen teachers should implement it.</p>

His body shrunk and he left behind only nails and hair and there was a rainbow formed on the day he died.</p>
              <p>( he achieved the rainbow body nature ...highest level in tantric)  and he was just an illiterate man who focus on one mantra whole life. He was very poor but he would let any passerby to drink water and rest in his humble home. This old sculptor achieved what many high Rinpoches could not. He was so unknown till he died.  </p>
