                                          twenty you had deteriorated from when you were ten. Day by day,

                                          now when I am sixty-two it is still no different."<br> <br> The Buddha said, "Now you are mournful that your hair is white and
                                          your face wrinkled. In the same way that your face is definitely
                                          more wrinkled then it was in your youth, has the

                                          changes will perish, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what does not change is fundamentally

                                          to your birth and death? Furthermore, why bring up what Maskari G

                                          there is total annihilation?"<br> <br> The king heard these words, believed them, and realized that when
                                          the life of this body is finished, there will be rebirth. He and

              <p>You are still seeing an 'essence'... therefore you can't understand beyond substantial non-dual.</p>
              <p>What Namdrol said stands true here... whatever the 
                                          Buddha teaches... even the Tathagatagarbha etc, are simply ways to point
                                           out emptiness.</p>
              <p>Any time the Buddha says something permanent... 
                                          that must be referring to emptiness. There is no ultimate reality in 
                                          Buddhism. However, the truth of emptiness is ultimate in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>So actually what Shurangama Sutra said here is simply talking about emptiness. It is not talking about a permanent substance like Brahman... a unchanging awareness of sorts.</p>
              <p>I used to have this view last year... when I was still at the I AM and substantial non-dual stage of experience. I thought that Shurangama Sutra is talking about a permanent awareness that transcends the coming and goings of impermanent bodies... but this is a false understanding of what Shurangama Sutra meant, and is no different from the deviant views of the externalists. After realizing Anatta... the view of a substantial metaphysical essence (like the I AM or substantial non-dual) is overthrown.</p>
              <p>This view (of an essence) is criticized by many masters before (but unfortunately most teachers today only reach substantial non-dual level of understanding and experience)... including but not limited to Zen Master Dogen, who criticized the Hindu view called 'Senika heresy'. (since he too, has gone through that phase before going to China) <em>...While  Dogen’s most articulate critiques are those refutations of the  
                          non-Buddhist Indian teaching of Senika, his disparagement of all dualism
                            permeate his works....</em> ...<em>In his later years Dogen often severely criticized the Senika heresy (sennigedo), which is the erroneous view that the mind abides while the form perishes.</em> <em>According to this view, there is a bright spiritual intelligence contained in our body that is the source of self-understanding. When the body dies, the spiritual intelligence alone does not perish but abides immutably. This view, Dogen argues, when "hearing of the doctrine of this very mind [itself is buddha], take it to mean that the discriminating knowledge of sentient beings is itself the buddha." In hearing of the doctrine of the Buddha-nature, it "regards the movement or stillness of wind and fire as the enlightenment of the Buddha-nature."...</em></p>
              <p>In other words, Impermanence is Buddha-Nature.</p>
              <p>The verse you quoted is saying that visual consciousness does not come into being on its own (independent of conditions), nor does it come from causes and conditions. Why? Because no independent visual consciousness, nor an independent cause and conditions can be establish. Nothing whatsoever can be established. æ— ä¸€æ³•å�¯ç«‹.</p>
              <p>For example, the 'nature of seeing', which actually is more accurately translated as 'the nature of visual awareness' (and is translated as such in the newer translation of Shurangama Sutra), is emptiness. Emptiness is the nature of all six forms of awareness... visual, auditory, etc... awareness.</p>
              <p>Being as such, the nature of the various awareness (visual, auditory, etc...) is that it is empty and unestablished, unconditioned, without birth and dying. The relative truth of things (body, house, etc) is that things are born and die (when taken to be entities), yet what is born and die when realized to be empty is beyond birth and death - that includes visual awareness, auditory awareness, etc... and so it is stated:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">T</span><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">hat which, taken as causal or
                                                                  dependent, is the process of being born and passing on, is, taken
                                                                  noncausally and beyond all dependence, declared to be
                                                                  nirvÄ�á¹‡a.</span></em></p>
              <p>~ Nagarjuna</p>
              <p>Also, Shurangama Sutra has many chapters demonstrating how due to the empty nature of the various types of consciousness... auditory, visual, etc, they are beyond causation nor independent spontaneous arising. Why? Nothing can be established as independently existing, not consciousness, not even the causes and conditions.</p>
              <p>As I quoted under a part called 'Total Causality is Unconditionality' in my Certainty of Being thread...</p>

              <p>This is similar to what Thusness said few days ago at the Seeing thread:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>The "world of our senses" is neither existent nor nonexistent;
                                      hence neither created nor self-existing. </em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>The 'world' is an activity itself.  The senses, the mental
                                      factors, the forms do not alienate each other from before
                                      beginning. Therefore there is no 'the world' besides these
                                      ongoing activities.</em></p>
              <p>Therefore we must understand that when we talk about 'not coming into being from causes and conditions, nor do they come into being on its own', we are talking about the various consciousness 'not having independent existence', 'unestablished' -  it is not because there is a permanent substance.</p>

              <p>I think many practitioners held on to the substantial non-dual because it is not as scary as the ultimate emptiness. To accept emptiness as it truly is demands a lot of courage.</p>
              <p>I come from long time zen practice, discovering your blog and thusness writings encourage me to pick up the slack. Your e-book is especially inspiring since everything is in one place. I will re-read my copies of shurangama sutra with ven hsua hua commentaries which I bought around long time ago</p>

              <p>:) to write 'essence' is so i can type out in word. yes, it's still mundane saying.  </p>
              <p>i thinking the sutra texts are pretty straight forward and simple. and actually i think the various types of consciousness faculty given in this part of the Shurangama sutra(u qouted) is different, still mundane and false from what the Buddha is refering of the "essence of nature". i think the " <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">essential nature of seeing</span></strong>" is what our old master mentioned as <strong>è§�æ€§è§�è‰²æ€§ or nature of seeing, seeing the nature of form</strong> instead of the ordinary seeing that people think. it's not çœ¼è§�è‰².</p>
              <p>at certain part, Buddha aka it as "the six entrances are basically the wonderful nature of True Suchness, the Treasury of the Tathagata" . i think it is  <strong>æ³•ä½�æ³•ä½�,æ³•å°”å¦‚æ˜¯</strong>, "All are always and already so" as in ur website. it's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>fundamentally free of production and extinction</strong></span> as Buddha Simply stated. the later part of the sutra is teaching Ananda not to have attachment, dualism and wandering thoughts So as to reach this "state". and the process of getting rid of wandering thoughts, dualism and attachment is "<strong>Empting"</strong> the mind as u are refering. i think it's refering to ur website's Stage 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected, yet it's still link to Emptiness.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"Thus you should know that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">essential, enlightened wonderful brightness</span> is due to neither causes nor conditions nor does it arise spontaneously. Nor is it the negation of spontaneity. It is neither a negation nor the denial of a negation.</p>
              <p>Ananda said to the Buddha, "If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the nature of the wonderful enlightenment</span> has neither causes nor conditions then why does Bhagavan always tell the bhikshus that the nature of seeing derives from the four conditions of emptiness, brightness, the mind, and the eyes? What does that mean?" <br><br><strong>The Buddha said, "Ananda, what I have spoken about causes and conditions in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mundane sense</span> does not describe the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> primary meaning</span>. " <br><br></strong>Ananda, I ask you again: people in the world say, 'I can see.' <br><br>What is that <strong>'seeing'</strong>? And what is <strong>'not seeing'</strong>?" <br><br>Ananda said, "The light of the sun, the moon, and lamps is the cause that allows people in the world to see all kinds of appearances: that is called seeing. Without these three kinds of light, they would not be able to see." <br><br>"Ananda, if you say there is no seeing in the absence of light, then you should not see darkness. If in fact you do see darkness, which is just lack of light, how can you say there is no seeing?" <br><br>"Ananda, if, when it is dark, you call that 'not seeing' because you do not see light, then since it is now light and you do not see the characteristic of darkness, that should also be called 'not seeing.' Thus, both aspects would be called 'not seeing.' Although these two aspects counteract each other, your seeing-nature does not lapse for an instant. Thus you should know that seeing continues in both cases. How, then, can you say there is no seeing? <br><br>"Therefore, Ananda, you should know that when you see light, the seeing is not the light. When you see darkness, the seeing is not the darkness. When you see emptiness, the seeing is not the emptiness. When you see solid objects, the seeing is not the solid objects. And by extention of these four facts, you should also know that when you see your seeing, the seeing is not that seeing . Since the former seeing is beyond the latter, the latter cannot reach it. Such being the case, how can you describe it as being due to causes and conditions or spontaneity or that it has something to do with mixing and uniting? You narrow-minded Hearers are so inferior and ignorant that you are unable to penetrate through to the purity of ultimate reality. Now I will continue to instruct you. Consider well what is said. Do not become weary or negligent on the wonderful road to Bodhi." <br><br><a href="http://www.e-sangha.com/alphone/shurangama.html">http://www.e-sangha.com/alphone/shurangama.html</a></p>

Ananda, although the eyes' staring causes fatigue, both the eye and the fatigue originate in Bodhi. The attributes of the fatigue come from the staring. Because of the two false defiling attributes of light and dark, a sense of seeing is stimulated which in turn draws in those two defiling attributes. That is called the ability to see. Apart from these two defiling attributes of light and dark, this seeing is ultimately without substance. In fact, Ananda, you should know that seeing does not originate from light or dark, nor from the sense organ, nor from emptiness. Why not? If it originated from light, then it would be extinguished when there was darkness, and you would not see darkness. If it came from darkness, then it would be extinguished when there was light, and you would not see light. If the essence of seeing came from the sense organ, which is obviously devoid of light and dark, then in that case, basically no seeing could take place. If it came from emptiness, then looking ahead it would see the shapes of mundane phenomena; looking back, it should see the eye itself. Moreover, if emptiness itself did the seeing, what would that have to do with your eye? From this you should understand that the eye-entrance is empty and false. Fundamentally its nature cannot be attributed to either causes and conditions or spontaneity.</p>

              <p>our old master taught that from the experiment of Dr Masaru Emoto of the water crystal teach us that water can see, hear, feel and know. it has è§�é—»è§‰çŸ¥. not just water, everything have è§�é—»è§‰çŸ¥ or "six entrances". even a rock have è§�é—»è§‰çŸ¥  and can see, hear, feel and know, which is basically the wonderful nature of True Suchness, the Treasury of the Tathagata. hence MCK told Dr Emoto to continue research on other things, like cook rice, rock etc.  </p>
              <p>this is neither seeing Nor not seeing. it just is seeing.</p>
              <p>when i say all this, it does not mean i'm negating Emptiness.  nor very attached to this existence of non emptiness. as opposte to becoming into a form of <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothingness</span></em> thinking. nor is it same as the eternalist of permanent substance like Brahman.</p>
              <p>one have to have Emptiness before reaching this True Suchness, the Treasury of the Tathagata per se. as Namdrol is refering. i think to say Tathagata is emptiness is still missing the mark as to saying it's existence is also missing the mark(?).</p>

              <p>i thinking the sutra texts are pretty straight forward and
                          simple. and actually i think the various types of consciousness
                          faculty given in this part of the Shurangama sutra(u
                          qouted) is different, still mundane and false from what
                          the Buddha is refering of the "essence of nature". i think the
                          " <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">essential
                          nature of seeing</span></strong>" is what our old master mentioned
                          as <strong>è§�æ€§è§�è‰²æ€§ or nature of seeing, seeing the nature of
                          form</strong> instead of the ordinary seeing that people
                          think. it's not çœ¼è§�è‰².</p>
              <p>at certain part, Buddha aka it as "the six entrances are
                          basically the wonderful nature of True Suchness, the Treasury of
                          the Tathagata" . i think it is 
                          <strong>æ³•ä½�æ³•ä½�,æ³•å°”å¦‚æ˜¯</strong>, "All are always and already so" as in
                          ur website. it's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>fundamentally free of
                          production and extinction</strong></span> as Buddha Simply stated.
                          the later part of the sutra is teaching Ananda not to have
                          attachment, dualism and wandering thoughts So as to reach this
                          "state". and the process of getting rid of wandering thoughts,
                          dualism and attachment is "<strong>Empting"</strong> the
                          mind as u are refering. i think it's refering to ur website's
                          Stage 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected, yet it's still link
                          to Emptiness.</p>
              <p>our old master taught that from the experiment of Dr Masaru
                          Emoto of the water crystal teach us that water can see, hear, feel
                          and know. it has è§�é—»è§‰çŸ¥. not just water, everything have è§�é—»è§‰çŸ¥ or "six
                          entrances". even a rock have è§�é—»è§‰çŸ¥  and can see, hear, feel and
                          know, which is basically the wonderful nature of True Suchness, the
                          Treasury of the Tathagata. hence MCK told Dr Emoto to continue
                          research on other things, like cook rice, rock etc.  </p>
              <p>this is neither seeing Nor not seeing. it just is seeing.</p>
              <p>when i say all this, it does not mean i'm negating
                          Emptiness.  nor very attached to this existence of non
                          emptiness. as opposte to becoming into a form of
                          <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothingness</span></em> thinking. nor
                          is it same as the eternalist of permanent substance like
                          Brahman.</p>
              <p>one have to have Emptiness before reaching this True Suchness,
                          the Treasury of the Tathagata per se. as Namdrol is refering. i
                          think to say Tathagata is emptiness is still missing the mark as to
                          saying it's existence is also missing the mark(?).</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: SimSun;">all and all, i'm
                          <strong>neither</strong> attached to this existence nor emptiness,
                          which is the true emptiness.</span></p>

              <p>i recall a saying that it's easier to know Form is
                          Emptiness, while to realise Emptiness is Form take a life time or
                          more difficult. HHDL also said something quite similar i think.</p>
              <p>one of Shurangama sutra line i like most is that the
                          Light(En-light-enment) is already switched On. don't think it's not

              <p>The translation should be 'nature of visual awareness'. You should check the new translation by DRBA (the association that also provided the first translation you quoted from), which is finished 2 years ago. The one you just quoted is under 'True Visual Awareness', and I quote from the newer translation: "Light and darkness are mutually exclusive; still, regardless of which one is present, your visual awareness does not lapse for an instant."</p>
              <p>There is actually no other consciousness beyond the six types of consciousness. To posit something else is to fall into error of positing another substance beyond the six like Brahman... an ultimate reality of sorts. No such ultimate reality is being found in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Whatever you quoted is actually similar to what I said earlier... visual awareness, being empty and unestablished, could not have been created by something external, nor could it have arisen spontaneously independent of conditions. All consciousnesses and all causes and all conditions do not have independent existence... they are fundamentally empty.</p>
              <p>If you have true realization of the twofold emptiness, you will not fall into the extreme of emptiness but will see the inseparability of emptiness and appearance, or emptiness and luminosity.</p>
              <p>All existence must be understood to be relative, not ultimate, and though luminous, is unestablished.</p>
              <p>What I'm trying to say is this, "free from production and extinction" should be understood from the viewpoint of twofold emptiness, of everything being unestablished... and not from the view of there being a substance which is by nature unborn and imperishable (e.g. brahman).</p>
              <p>Understood in this way, as Nagarjuna have said,</p>

                          in dependence is empty. The view of Dzogchen,

                          the view of dependent origination, since the                         
                          Madhyamaka view is dependent origination. He also cites Sakya

                                         from beginning to end, and top to bottom, free from all

                       word that has confounded many Hindu Svamis is ‘unborn’ (Skt. ajat), 
                      ‘unproduced’ (Skt. anutpada). In the context of the Hindu Vedanta, it 
                      means that there is this Ultimate Reality called the Brahma which is 
                      unborn i.e. never produced by anything or at any time, which means it 
                      always was. A thing or ‘super thing’ even a ‘non-thing’ that always 
                      existed and was never ever produced at any period in time which is 
                      separate from this born, illusory Samsara. In the Buddhist context, it 
                      is the true nature of Samsara itself which although relatively appears 
                      to be ‘born’, ultimately is never born. Advayavajra in his 
                      Tatvaratnavali says, “The world is unborn says the Buddha”. As Buddha 
                      Ekaputra Tantra (Tib. sangye tse tsig tantra) says, the base of DzogChen
                       is the Samsara itself stirred from its depth. Since the Samsara stirred
                       from its depth is interdependently originated, i.e. not really 
                      originated i.e. unborn and since Samsara is only relatively an 
                      interdependently originated thing but ultimately neither a thing nor a 
                      non-thing (bhava or abhava) that truly exists, the use of the word 
                      ‘unborn’ for Brahma (which is definitely not Samsara) and for Samsara 
                      itself in Buddhism are diametrically opposed. The true meaning of unborn
                       (anutpada) is dependently originated (pratityasamutpanna), which is as 
                      already mentioned, the meaning of a nisvabhava (non-real existence) or 
                      Shunyata (emptiness). None of these can be a synonym for Brahma or 
                      anything that has kind of ultimate real existence, even if it is called 
                      Tathagatagarbha. There is no acceptance of an Ultimate Existence in any 
                      Buddhist Sutra. It is interesting that an exact word for Ultimate 
                      Existence (Skt. paramartha satta) in Tibetan Buddhism is very rarely 
                      used. It shows how non-Buddhist the whole concept is. One has to 
                      differentiate between existence (Skt. satta) and truth (Skt. satya) 
                      although they are so close and come from the same root in Sanskrit. Even
                       in the Ratnagotra there is one single sentence (Skt. Yad yatra tat tena
                       shunyam iti samanupasyati yat punartravasistam bhavati tad sad 
                      ihasthiti yathabhutam prajanati): “whatever is not found, know that to 
                      be empty by that itself, if something remains, know that to exist as it 
                      is).” This statement is straight out of the Vaibhasika Sutras of the 
                      Theravada (Sunnatavagga) and Sautrantika Abhidharma Samuccaya. It seems 
                      to imply an affirming negative. First of all, this statement contradicts
                       the rest of the Ratnagotravibhaga if it is taken as the ultimate 
                      meaning in the Sutra (as the Shentongpas have done). Secondly, since it 
                      is a statement of the Vaibhasika school (stating that an ultimate unit 
                      of the consciousness and matter remains), it cannot be superior to the 
                      Rangtong Madhyamika. Thirdly, its interpretation as what remains is the 
                      ultimately existing Tathagatagarbha contradicts not only the 
                      interpretation that is found in other Buddhist sutras as “itar etar 
                      shunyata” (emptiness of what is different from it) but also the Shentong
                       interpretation of Tathagatagarbha contradicts all the other definitions
                       of the Tathagatagarbha found in the Ratnagotravibhaga itself.</span></em></strong></p>

              <p>reading from HHDL Q&amp;A,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Q: You have said that according to Buddhist philosophy there is no Creator, no God of creation, and this may initially put off many people who believe in a divine principle. Can you explain the difference between the Vajrayana Primordial Buddha and a Creator God?</h4>
              <p><strong>A: </strong>I understand the Primordial Buddha, also known as Buddha Samantabhadra, to be the ultimate reality, the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras. However, in the context of your question, the tantric tradition is the only one which explains the Dharmakaya in terms of Inherent clear light, the essential nature of the mind; this would seem imply that all phenomena, samsara and nirvana, arise from this clear and luminous source. Even the New School of Translation came to the conclusion that the "state of rest" of a practitioner of the Great Yoga--Great Yoga implies here the state of the practitioner who has reached a stage in meditation where the most subtle experience of clear light has been realized--that for as long as the practitioner remains in this ultimate sphere he or she remains totally free of any sort of veil obscuring the mind, and is immersed in a state of great bliss.</p>
              <p>We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein.<strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But we must be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual level. </span></p>
              <p>Likewise, when we speak of karma as the cause of the universe we eliminate the notion of a unique entity called karma existing totally independently. Rather, collective karmic impressions, accumulated individually, are at the origin of the creation of a world. When, in the tantric context, we say that all worlds appear out of clear light, we do not visualize this source as a unique entity, but as the ultimate clear light of each being. We can also, on the basis of its pure essence, understand this clear light to be the Primordial Buddha. All the stages which make up the life of each living being--death, the intermediate state, and rebirth--represent nothing more than the various manifestations of the potential of clear light. It is both the most subtle consciousness and energy. The more clear light loses its subtlety, the more your experiences take shape.</p>
              <p>In this way, death and the intermediate state are moments where the gross manifestations emanating from clear light are reabsorbed. At death we return to that original source, and from there a slightly more gross state emerges to form the intermediate state preceding rebirth. At the stage of rebirth, clear light is apparent in a physical incarnation. At death we return to this source. And so on. The ability to recognize subtle clear light, also called the Primordial Buddha, is equivalent to realizing nirvana, whereas ignorance of the nature of clear light leaves us to wander in the different realms of samsaric existence.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is how I understand the concept of the Primordial Buddha. It would be a grave error to conceive of it as an independent and autonomous existence from beginningless time.</span> If we had to accept the idea of an independent creator, the explanations given in the <em>Pramanavartika, </em>the "Compendium of Valid Knowledge" written by Dharmakirti, and in the ninth chapter of the text by Shantideva, which completely refutes the existence per se of all phenomena, would be negated. This, in turn, would refute the notion of the Primordial Buddha. The Buddhist point of view does not accept the validity of affirmations which do not stand up to logical examination. If a sutra describes the Primordial Buddha as an autonomous entity, we must be able to interpret this assertion without taking it literally. We call this type of sutra an "interpretable" sutra.</p>

              <p>By the way I do agree that trees and other things must have some form of awareness... (strangely Simpo used to say tuned into the consciousness of the stone he bought which 'communicated' with him and 'informed' him that it would be better put on a running stream, so he placed it there) however they do not have the faculty of volition and perception. So while they are able to react to sunlight, and grow towards sunlight, they are incapable of performing karma and falling into the six realms...</p>

              <p><br>yea we did sort of talk about where spirits can reside in them. i presume rock too. those plant or rock that people seldom disturb, are more choosen by "them" as "home". if like vegetables or trees that people farm, i think not many spirits like to reside, as they will need to move house often when harvesting. it's also true for small animals.</p>
              <p>but for the water crystal experiment, i'm thinking something deeper.  not so much related to spirits. as it can see a word love or hate place near it; listen to music; precieve our thoughts etc. more related to dependent origination. they react(perceive) due to the surrounding Collective "energy" (or karma). they cannot change by <strong>itself</strong>. they also don't have volition/action on it's <strong>own</strong> to create karma. that will be independant. it is truly NO Self. here i can use NO instead of NOT.  :) </p>

              <p>Good point EN, appreciate your always perceptive detailed post,
              I just discovered this forum and your blog thru
              dharmaoverground.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I think many practitioners held on to the substantial non-dual
              because it is not as scary as the ultimate emptiness. To accept
              emptiness as it truly is demands a lot of courage.</span></p>
              <p>I come from long time zen practice, discovering your blog and
              thusness writings encourage me to pick up the slack. Your e-book is
              especially inspiring since everything is in one place. I will
              re-read my copies of shurangama sutra with ven hsua hua
              commentaries which I bought around long time ago</p>

              <p>Strangely this thought has been revolving around my mind for a few days. been wanting to write something about it but can't pen anything.</p>
              <p>The 'scary' fear of emptiness is present from a clinging to this view of self, and coupled with the bliss of substantial non-dual as pure awareness. This creates a tendency to 'enjoy' this stage. to shake off this notion of awareness, one needs to closely examine each of the six senses and come to a realization that they are all there is. The bliss is also only conditional.</p>
