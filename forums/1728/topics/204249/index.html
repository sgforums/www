            <div class='col-md body'>What do you think about it?<br>Hatha Yoga, that famous in many parts of the world for its 'body exercise' yoga, was founded by Matsyendranath and Gorakshanatha. They were also two of the 84 Mahasiddhas(Holder of Mantra/Great Sorcerer) from Tantric Buddhism. They have both Buddhist and Hindu connections. I read that Matsyendranath in Nepal is known as a form of Avalokitesvara.<br><br>Om Mani Padme Hum</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh finally somebody posted this.<br><br>Yoga is certaintly beneficial, in terms of both physical and to a certain extent spiritual healing. I have had a few good yoga sessions and intending to continue. Yoga certainly can help in improving our physique and kinetics. And it touches on aspects of meditation and how the body responses to it.<br><br>It is not suprising that some form of religious beliefs got integrated into yoga -- much like the FaLunGong which is a "Packaged spiritual exercise". I'm not unfamiliar with chinese martial arts, spirituality and meditation. Even on the physical aspects of the FLG exercise, it is largely limited and does not bring out the full beneficial aspects of chinese martial arts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yoga is definitely a very beneficial exercise. However the purpose of yoga has disappeared in modern times. Indian yoga which has a highly spiritual nature has degenerated into a form of 'mental and physical exercise'.<br><br>Pls see the hindu website: <a href="http://www.swamij.com/ancientyoga.htm" rel="nofollow">Modern  Yoga versus  Ancient Yoga</a><br><br><blockquote><strong>The goal of Yoga is Yoga</strong>: The goal or destination of Yoga is Yoga itself, union itself, of the little self and the True Self, a process of awakening to the preexisting union that is called Yoga. While it is not the intent of this article to give a final or conclusive definition of the term  Yoga--which can be described in different ways--it has to do with the realization through direct experience of the preexisting union between Atman and Brahman, Jivatman and Paramatman, and Shiva and Shakti, or the realization of Purusha standing alone as separate from Prakriti. The mere fact that one might do a few stretches with the physical body does not in itself mean that one is headed towards that high union, referred to as Yoga.<br><br>-------------<br><br><strong>Perception has recently shifted:</strong> The typical perception of Yoga has shifted a great deal in the past century, particularly the past couple decades. Most of this is due to changes made in the West, particularly in the United States, though it is not solely an American phenomenon. (Similar shifts have happened with Tantra as well.)<br><br><strong>Gist of the two perspectives:</strong> The gist of the shift can be summarized in two perspectives, one of which is modern and false, and the other of which is ancient and true.<br><br>*<br><br>False: Yoga is a physical system with a spiritual component.<br>*<br><br>True: Yoga is a spiritual system with a physical component.<br><br>The false view spreads: Unfortunately, the view that Yoga is a physical exercise program is the dominant viewpoint. The false view then spreads through many institutions, classes, teachers, books, magazines, and millions of students of modern Yoga, who have little or no knowledge or interest in the spiritual goals of ancient, authentic Yoga and Yoga Meditation.<br><br>pls read entire article in that website</blockquote>Tibetan Buddhism yoga however, is fully for spiritual purposes.</div>
