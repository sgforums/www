              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'>A few days ago I read BR Ambedkar’s essay,
                  ‘Buddha or Karl Marx. Ambedkar writes that the basic tenets of Marxism involve
                  violence, as the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be established without.
                  The second objection was on the duration of dictatorship. He writes that it is
                  unclear even amongst Marxists how long shall the dictatorship last. Later in
                  his life Ambedkar advocated the path of Buddha to bring about transformation in
                  society. He writes that most Marxists may have a natural aversion to anything
                  closely resembling religion, but it is important to keep one’s prejudices aside
                  (for a while) and critically examine the social tenets of Buddha’s teachings.
                  Buddhist social tenets are not meant to create a utopian socialism but are
                  directed towards increasing happiness and welfare of citizens.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'>Buddha and Marx are two personalities with
                  a time interval of more than two thousand years. Both in their own ways, wanted
                  to bring about change in society. One had a firm faith in non-violence; the
                  other could not foresee the path to future without violence. Joseph Conrad in
                  the Heart of Darkness writes that man lives like he dreams, he dreams alone and
                  hence lives alone. I wonder to what degree this precondition of human living
                  goes into Buddha and Marx’s ways of understanding the world. Buddha said that
                  suffering is a part of existence; whether that suffering is individual or
                  social is not fully clear. Does the social suffering comprise the sum-total of
                  individual sufferings or is it something extraneous to the sum-total of
                  individuals and therefore more, perhaps different? Buddha said every man
                  suffers; there is no escape from suffering. On inquiry by one of his disciples
                  on what is suffering, Buddha replied suffering encompasses all the
                  disappointments, confusion, anxieties that afflict a human being. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'>In comparison Marx divides the world into
                  two classes, one is the ruler and therefore must exploit to maintain its
                  hegemony, the other ruled and thus by its nature subservient and exploited.
                  Marx has not written much on the individual. Individuality, according to Marx,
                  is shaped and made up by historical forces beyond an individual’s comprehension
                  and therefore unseen and absent. And thus Marx writes, that on founding of
                  Communism exploitation would cease, ushering in some form of unexploitative
                  society. Marx was writing in mid-nineteenth century, living in exile, in
                  London, using the resources available at what is now called the British Museum
                  library.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'>Buddha lived four hundred years before the
                  beginning of the Common Era. Living at that time he was disenchanted by
                  distortion of thought and spread of ritualistic practices. A time that is so
                  distant that it seems unimaginable to comprehend its social conditions and
                  ordinary men and women. Buddha codified his thoughts into an eight-fold path.
                  He did not write a book as detailed as Das Kapital, based on analysis of social
                  and economic conditions and the two classes, indeed the idea that has come to
                  be called Marxism. There is a sharp difference between Marxian and Marxist.
                  Marxian can be called an analytic concept that uses Marx’s writings, whereas
                  Marxist refers to an adherent of a political ideology. Thus one can be a
                  Marxian and simultaneously not necessarily be a Marxist.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'>Buddha’s concept of impermanence is
                  enlightening. Buddha said, all that we have in the world is marked by change and
                  therefore impermanent. Human nature seeks a certainty amidst that change, but
                  these attempts are futile and permanency elusive. Acceptance of the natural
                  order brings about a conscious transformation in our minds and thereby we begin
                  to understand ourselves and others. According to Buddha, seeking permanence in
                  human life is not accepting life. Buddha’s impermanence does not mean an
                  unsteady mind; steadiness of mind is a pre-requisite to understand the
                  suffering that afflicts life. Many even in the time of Buddha were confounded
                  by his idea of impermanence. After a little thinking it can be realized that
                  impermanence of natural phenomena and paraphernalia associated with
                  conventional life is not a vision of negation but of knowledge and
                  understanding. Marx described all tools of living as intrinsically exploitative
                  as their foundation was built on unfair economic relations.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'>To mark a distinction between Buddha and
                  Marx’s thoughts; Buddha’s thoughts eventually formed a religion and Marx’s an
                  ideology. Religion is not only concerned with explaining the world but also
                  with personal conduct. Ideology is seeing the way the world functions and in
                  defining its parts. Ideology is not concerned with birth and death as religions
                  are. Although Buddha was different, he did not seek an irrational explanation
                  to understand the world. Buddha has been called the greatest spiritual teacher
                  of India. His ideas were not limited to the realm of spirit and had and perhaps
                  still have social and material consequences. Marx was a scholar and a
                  revolutionary. Some argue that Marx ignored human nature and the role natural
                  resources play in creating and sustaining relations. His ideas eventually
                  penetrated the psyche of many culminating in twentieth century revolutions.
                  During Marx’s lifetime a commune was founded in Paris but did not last long and
                  crumbled as soon as it had begun. Buddha stresses the importance of
                  understanding, empathy and decency in our conduct, Marx warns us on the
                  fractures that are inevitable in a market economy and its consequences on the
                  general population.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'>Marx’s theory of alienation describes the
                  way in which a man becomes alienated from the society he functions in. In the
                  capitalist mode of production, alienation refers to workers becoming alienated
                  from the output and losing control over their product and life. This eventually
                  produces a sense of estrangement from the self and is not limited to the
                  individual but spreads across social classes. Umberto Eco in his essay on
                  literature writes that most writings can be classified as either
                  autobiographical or autocritical. Marx’s writings were not always literary, as
                  they intended to reflect his revolutionary fervour, but when he wrote without
                  he exemplified being autocritical. Self was not left alone but was constantly
                  under different forms of criticism, at times social, political, economic or
                  psychological.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #616060;'>Text has a special significance in Marx’s
                  writings. He wrote not with the aim of adding onto the world of literary
                  output, which in itself is a worthy desire and a legitimate aim, but to create
                  conditions for revolution. Buddha was much closer to poetic sensibility. He
                  wanted to understand human passions, and poetry is often described as an essay
                  to congeal human passions. Buddha didn’t leave any texts behind but left an
                  unfathomable insight into the human mind. His insights were so complete that
                  they almost touched physical reality. Buddha’s poetic way of seeing the world
                  led him to discover human passions, their origin and end. Besides the immediate
                  and direct, do Buddha and Marx have anything to say to thinking and inquisitive
                  minds? Marx depicts the world and ways it can be made; Buddha tells us to
                  understand the causes of our disenchantment.</span></p>
