And so through this forum they want more people to start paying attention to Buddhism - and this will be a benefit for all of China," he said. - AFP/de</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is what is written in the book Returning from Death by Vietnamese monk Bikkhu Buddha Dhatu in his meeting with the Dalai Lama in India, 1997<br><br><blockquote><br>"One of the Dalai Lama's ministers asked me for my opinion of the annexation of Tibet by China and if I would consider helping them to recover their country but my reply shocked them. I told them that they should be grateful for whatever had hapened. If the Chinese had not overrun their country, the Dalai Lama might not have had the chance to go to the West and spread the Dhamma. A country is just so much earth, and as monks, our duty is not to secure the borders of our country but to free ourselves of ignorance and desire. That is the only way to win peace"<br><br>The Dalai Lama stared at me and said "But Bikkhu Buddha Dhatu, don't you know that the communist say that religion is a drug addiction?"<br><br>I replied cooly, "But no, not that. Worst than that! Religions today make ppl believe blindly and they harm others w/o thinking twice. Why? Because they believe their religions require them to do so! That is pure ignorance. We must lead ppl to the right path and not mix religion with politics or business!<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But anyway, Dalai Lama is not really a political figure, and he does not seek independance at all. He seeks true autonomy for the Tibetan people - something that the Chinese government claims that Tibet is, but hasn't done much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>These skull cups are not obtained from murdered human beings but from those natural dead corpses. These skullcups are basically obtained thru the sky burial funeral rituals.<br><br>In Tibetan culture, they practise sky burial where they wrap up dead corpses into a white cotten cloth in the shape of a new born baby in the concieved womb. Latter they transport the wrapped corpses to a mountain peak where a priest hacked and smashed the corpses into many pieces for vulture feeding.  These corpses bones are obtained after the vulture feeding. However, not everybody's skulls are qualified to be used as ritual artifacts. Only those practitioners skulls are qualified to be used. Normally they will seek the dying buddhists or the abbot's permission or consent to take their skulls for such ritual usage. Tibetans see it as a form of selfless offerings of their body for higher tantric practises.<br><br>Singapore also practise and promote organs donations isn't it ?<br><br>Skullcups are Tantric symbolism. A very special object within Tibetan tantric practice is the Kapala or skullcup. The skullcup is related to detachment and transformation of the world we experience. There are much profound meanings n realisations in skullcups where I am not a qualified tantric teacher to share with u more about it. :-)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>SKY BURIAL GROUND FULL OF CORPSE REMAINS:<br><br><img src="http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/anthro2003/religion/070399tibetan-sky-burial.1.jpg"><br><br><span class="large"><strong>The exquisite and brilliant skull-cup exhibited in the Tibet Museum is made of human skull. </strong></span><br><br><img src="http://www.travelchinaguide.com/images/photogallery/0018000/tibet%20museum%2010017506t.jpg"></div>
