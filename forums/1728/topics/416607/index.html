              <p>I sit down to meditate, but feel that I cant concentrate and my thoughts are elsewhere. Why is it so? Because the mind is restless, need to calm down the thoughts first?</p>
              <p>I heard from Ajahn Brahm that if you are unable to meditate well, that is because you are fighting your thoughts, like I am unable to concentrate, I need to concentrate and focus, arrghhhh.........similarly when you meditate, you are in a sleepy position and unable to concentrate? This, Ajahn Brahmn advises, is not to fight it if you are sleepy. Just go with the flow. He said what is important is your reaction to the sleepiness or concentration when meditating.</p>

              <p>Hi Rooney, </p>
              <p>I think it is normal for us to feel that way. I do have 'bad' and 'good' days when meditating. During the 'bad' day, my mind will flicker and start to wonder.</p>
              <p>I THINK... the reason why you feel restlessness could be due to the fact that you think you are restless before the meditation. Don't be so particular about it. Just sit down, relax, breathe!</p>
              <p>Meditation is about watch your mind, watching your breath. </p>
              <p>The common things you will think about is:</p>
              <p>1) Events which had past (either happy, or sad e.g. boss scolding you)</p>
              <p>2) Events which has not come </p>
              <p>If you are sitting for 5 mins, just tell yourself, nothing in this world can disturb you. This is your 5 mins. Unhappy or happy events which has passed, has passed, you cannot do anything about it. Happy or unhappy events which has not arrive, you also cannot do anything about it. Leave the worrying till next time. </p>
              <p>Then notice what are you feeling? what are you thinking? where does your restlessness come from? where does it goes? what happens next?</p>
              <p>Try to lock your attention to the breath. feel the sensation of the air at the tip of the nose or whatever object you are meditating on. When you realized you ha drifted, come back to the breathing gently. It is not your fault, this is how the mind reacts. </p>
              <p>Most importantly, enjoy the blissfulness which stays when you are calm and peaceful, if possible, feel the joy =)</p>
              <p>It is sad when most people do not know how to appreciate this but you can! continue to practice hard. This wholesome feeling will be the motivation to bring you back to practice in the future.</p>
              <p>Hope it does help.</p>

              <p>Hi Rooney,</p>
              <p>Just my guess and hope it help.</p>
              <p>It may be that in your daily life, you did not keep your behavior and mental state well, ie, keep your precepts well, and thus your gross çƒ¦æ�¼ is still very strong... it carries on into your meditation.  If you are not used to letting go of your afflictive mental states eg. anger, impatience, finding faults with others, greed, pride, jealousy etc., then it is hard to suddenly let go during meditation period.  Therefore , the ancient masters always emphasize that one use precepts and compassion practices to tame one's mind on the grosser level during daily life and then concentration can much more easily arise during practice session.</p>
              <p>Also, please don't hope for results very fast.  Hope or expectation is a big obstacle.  Actually this hope will also be naturally lessened if one is careful with one's mind in daily and keep the precepts well. It is all inter-linked.  Practice on compassion, morality and the other paramitas in daily life is very important and it supports our meditation practice in a very vital way.</p>

                  not to fight it if you are sleepy. Just go with the flow. He said
                  what is important is your reaction to the sleepiness or

              <p>It's very normal. You need to meditate regularly for a period of time. Try 20-30 minutes a day. It will take time and practice.</p>
              <p>Thusness's advice on lethargy and restlessness works for me: when tired, practice strong mindfulness of bodily sensations. You will have a crystal clear luminous sensation and feel awake. When restless, practice endless dropping/letting go. Mind will gradually subside.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: arial; line-height: normal; font-size: small;">Hi Rooney,in order to meditate, you must achieve perfect ease/perfect tension. </span></p>
              <div>The balance from  extremes of agitation and torpor. The mind is often compared to a monkey and an elephant, first, always running around, and very hard to catch hold of, the other, hard to get moving.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>We  are often caught in the two states, making focus and concentration hard.  Also, we tend to occupied to"doing" things, keeping our mind and body busy, as if to reifying our existence.  We do not allow ourselves to be doing nothing.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>To keep my suggestion  simple,  in agitative state , a body at ease is a mind at ease.  Allocate meditation time as time for yourself to be doing nothing, not achieving, not wanting, not doing. If body is tense, relax the body and tend to any body aches, if any. Use a back rest(back to wall) to relax the body.  As time goes by, when the mind is at ease, watching your thoughts and emotions. In an agitative state, everything is a "lump",  slowly learn to identify thoughts, and emotions aroused by  thoughts and emotions attached to thoughts. Learn your habitual tendencies, strong, mild, no, emotions arising, inconsequential thoughts,the flow of it . </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In a torporific state, especially after day of stress at work, the mind winds down or switches off.  Have a shower, eat lightly and maybe short nap.  Concentrate on proper posture first, erect spine,shoulder. tongue touching palate, etc. Once sufficient attention is achieve, concentrate on breathing or focusing on an object.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>To try understand the mindset, imagine the experience you have when you go an watch a movie, eating popcorn, passing time not really doing anything. Sounds corny and mundane, but it works! </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In daily life, when dealing with people, lightly observe your  attention, arising thoughts and emotions when interacting with everbody.</div>
              <div>Do a rectification of faults in front the image of Buddha of your intolerance to other people in your daily interaction.    </div>
              <div><br></div>
