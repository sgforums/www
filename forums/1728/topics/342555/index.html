              <p>I havent have the chance to attend Mani retreat or meet The Late Drubwang Konchok Norbu Rinpoche in the past. From the video showing  him giving dharma teachings , could see that he was a lively &amp; interesting person or Rinpoche. In his 2003 teachings in Kong Meng San monastary , upon the completion of his teachings , music was played. Guess what ? He started to dance around , encouraging the audience to join in. What a "funny" &amp; interesting Rinpoche ! :p</p>
              <p> He left a deep impression in me . He was a person who always advocates people to be a vegetarian. Though it is not meat , i just ate a hard-boiled egg last night after the retreat. :(  Thought it should be okay until i knew it today.</p>
              <p>During my 3 days Mani retreat , throat was constantly feeling uncomfortable. Heard that the Mani retreat in the past was more than 3 days in the past. At first , the chanting was okay. Having picked up the momentum , the leading lama started to chant rapidly. It took me some time to adjust to it. Proper pronounciation seems to be hard at first , but i managed to "survive" it. ;p Victory for me !!!!</p>
              <p>I do "contaminated" my recitation by dozing off for more than a few occassions in the first day , a few in the second day. Each not lasting more than a few minutes. No dozing off in the last day. Another Victory for me !!!!!</p>
              <p>I didnt went to the toliet during the recitation session , only 1 time ( second day ) , i felt so restless , imagine sitting on a chair for most of the day. :(</p>
              <p>To my suprise , reciting the 6 syllabus would enable one to go to the Western Pureland. There are actually very deep meaning of each of the syllabus , not just a simple explanation that OM means closure of the door to the suffering of being reborn in the gods' realm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having read the book by the late His Eminence Drubwang Konchok Norbu Rinpoche ( the person who iniatiated the 100 million Mani Retreat ) , he mentioned that of all the non-virtuous deeds in general , particularly the consumption of meat , has the heaviest negative karma. This is beacause all the living beings that we eat are actually our own parents who have been very kind to us in many lifetimes. Eating meat is a non-virtuous act with such heavy misgivings that the Buddha Himself also mentioned that consuming the meat of other sentient beings who have been our parents one lifetime or another is the most gravest &amp; most heinous deed to commit.</p>
              <p>Thought the heaviest karma are killing one's parents , hurting enlightened beings &amp; etc ?</p>
              <p>I attended the 100 million mani retreat , read some of the articles on the wall , one article says that it takes 9 lifetimes to repay for the killing &amp; taking live of another sentient being.</p>
              <p>Does this applies in the comsumption of meat as well ?</p>
              <p>IIt seems that the more i find out about dharma , the more "problems" i encounter . So ladies &amp; gentleman , time to be a vegetarian ? Anyone planning to join next year's Mani Retreat ?</p>

              <p>I am not a full vegetarian and  have tried not to eat meat for continual 6 days. I plan to to do so in specific days now. I eat meat , the meat of the mother sentient beings , my previous mothers in many previous lives. Quite disturbing to know this , on one side you are learning dharma , on the other side , you are commiting bad karma by eating meat. Both do not tally with each other. And then , there will be reasoning that meat-eaters also can go to western purelands.</p>
              <p>You force yourself to be a vegetarian , vegetarian cookings are bad in the stalls that i encounter and it is rather hard to find one sometimes. In the end , give up the idea of being a full vegetarian and reason that karma is heavy &amp; wisdom is limited, in the current state , it is best not to force on yourself , and let it affect your daily life and learning dharma.</p>
              <p>What an irony but i manage to live with it. Anyone face such problem or at such crossroad before ?</p>

              <blockquote>You need lots of determination and effort to cut meat entirely and also have faith in the reasons to do so.</blockquote><blockquote>There are many reasons for turning vegetarian.</blockquote><blockquote>1) We became vegetarians to develop compassion for all mother sentient beings, since Chen Re Zig is the embodiment of Great Compassion. If on one side, we recite Mani and on the other side, we eat the flesh of mother sentient beings, then it is like going against our practice. </blockquote><blockquote>2) Furthermore, we have infinite rebirths since beginningless time, so it is likely that all sentient beings have been our parents in our previous lives. After receiving their kindness in the past, we shouldn't eat them because that is ingratitude.</blockquote><blockquote>3) Also, all sentient beings have Buddha Nature, so it is not right to take their lives to satisfy our appetite and taste. </blockquote><blockquote>4) Buddha taught that we need to tame our mind from cravings due to ignorance, attachment and aversion, and practice equanimity, compassion and loving-kindness to all, without excluding any being.</blockquote><blockquote>5) Not giving up a meat diet is a form of attachment to self because we think that eating vegetables means poorer health to us so we prefer to sacrifice others' lives to protect our body, but in actual fact, the usefulness of this body is only in practicing the dharma for cessation of suffering and vegetarian diet doesn't kill us. </blockquote><blockquote>6) Also, we felt embarassed and inconvenient about being vegetarian. That is attachment to self-ego and self-cherishing which we need to abandon. </blockquote><blockquote>I started being a full-time vegetarian quite easily because I was seriously ill with an incurable rare disease and was in trouble spiritually, the very compassionate Drubwang K. N. Rinpoche advised me sternly to turn vegetarian full-time and recite lots of Mani during a private audience with him. I did and the illness just miraculously disappeared and my health improves gradually. Saying so, during the initial years of being a vegetarian, there were many obstacles. </blockquote><blockquote>However, I think to myself, if others can do it, it shouldn't be that difficult to adjust to it and the main obstacle must be my pre-conception and unfirm resolve. With a renewed resolve, I found the following remedies: </blockquote><blockquote>1) Wherever I go, I'll check and ask around for vegetarian food outlets. Nowadays, it is easier because many foodcourts in shopping malls have a vegetarian stall. Also, you can do a search on the Internet for them or ask about them in Buddhist forum. Some useful links:</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.sbestfood.com/Food%20Choice/vegetarian.htm"><span style="color: #810081;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.sbestfood.com/Food%20Choice/vegetarian.htm</span></span></a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://makantime.com/indexnote.html"><span style="color: #810081;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://makantime.com/indexnote.html</span></span></a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.singaporefood.com.sg/general/search-result.asp"><span style="color: #810081;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.singaporefood.com.sg/general/search-result.asp</span></span></a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.veggieplaces.co.uk/vegetarian_restaurant_singapore_island_sg.html"><span style="color: #810081;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.veggieplaces.co.uk/vegetarian_restaurant_singapore_island_sg.html</span></span></a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://goodfood.sg/vegetarian"><span style="color: #810081;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://goodfood.sg/vegetarian</span></span></a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.vegetarian.sg/vegetarian_restaurants.html"><span style="color: #810081;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.vegetarian.sg/vegetarian_restaurants.html</span></span></a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.hungrygowhere.com/search_results.php?searchby=Category&amp;country=147&amp;f_bank=na&amp;f_foodplace=na&amp;f_cuisine=na&amp;f_price=na&amp;f_recommend=8&amp;f_zone=0&amp;sortlocationby=abc&amp;f_zip=--&amp;button2=Search"><span style="color: #810081;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.hungrygowhere.com/search_results.php?searchby=Category&amp;country=147&amp;f_bank=na&amp;f_foodplace=na&amp;f_cuisine=na&amp;f_price=na&amp;f_recommend=8&amp;f_zone=0&amp;sortlocationby=abc&amp;f_zip=--&amp;button2=Search</span></span></a></blockquote><blockquote>Please double check before going down to eat because some vegetarian outlets may be closed.</blockquote><blockquote>2) If there are no vegetable outlets where I'll be going, I'll turn to dessert stall or fruits stall for my rescue. If I'm really very hungry, I'll just buy white rice from a non-vegetarian foodstall and eat it with fruits. Eating like that is quite yummy and healthy. Initially, I felt odd doing that, but my non-vegetarian colleagues encouraged me because they thought it was cool for losing weight. Also, one advantage about being vegetarian is that my superiors and colleagues perceived that I was less competitive, more approachable, understanding and trustworthy, so when bad things happened, I was never targeted. It is funny, but it happens and in turn, it was easy to develop compassion and loving-kindness to all. Eventually, they also started joining me for vegetarian diet on certain days and took the initiative to make special arrangements for vegetarian food for me on special occasions.</blockquote><blockquote>3) The worst scenario was a supermarket where I can get canned vegetarian baked beans or tibits suitable for vegetarian consumption. </blockquote><blockquote>4) As for the part of not liking mock meat, I got use to them eventually because some vegetarian stalls and restaurants really know how to make them tasty. However, initially, I chose to eat vegetables, mushrooms and soya bean products. Nowadays, there are mock meat made from shitake mushrooms and soya protein. They taste better than gluten type.</blockquote><blockquote>5) Whenever my crave for real meat arises, I'll look at the chicken rice and duck rice store and imagine myself as the chicken or duck being chopped into pieces for others' consumption. It didn't felt good being dead for that purpose so I'll avoid doing that on other beings because I may end up being them in my future lives.</blockquote><blockquote>6) I try to eat a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, nuts, mushrooms and soya products to have a balance intake of vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants and protein. Eg. Seaweed for zinc, iron, calcium and selenium intake, shitake for a wide variety of amino acids (simple form of protein), potatoes for potassium, spinach for iron, red capsicum, broccoli, tomatoes, etc. The main thing is to eat different variety of food, especially of different colors. I also take a vitamin supplement whenever I felt like it. I think the most important is vitamin B complex supplement which is very cheap at 100 tablets for less than $11 at Unity Pharmacy. I can't remember the exact name, but you can just ask the pharmacist for the alternative to Neurobian. I take this once a week because I felt it was enough for me.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.japanese-food-for-health.com/seaweed.html"><span style="color: #810081;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.japanese-food-for-health.com/seaweed.html</span></span></a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://home.howstuffworks.com/potatoes3.htm"><span style="color: #810081;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://home.howstuffworks.com/potatoes3.htm</span></span></a></blockquote><blockquote>Being a full-time vegetarian is really not that difficult. You just need some time to adjust to it. For example, when my Dad became a vegetarian, he felt sluggish at first because he was a big meat-eater for a long time, but the sluggishness went away after 6 months. I think most of the obstacles lie in the mind due to our bias perception.</blockquote><blockquote>Hope this help you in some ways.</blockquote><blockquote>By the way, Teacher (Drubwang Rinpoche) is really very cute. Sometimes he is real stern, but most of the time, he is very kiddie. ^^ He is one of the most compassionate, understanding and highly realised dharma practitioners that I have met. He is like Milarepa in many many ways.</blockquote><blockquote>Jia you for your daily Mani recitation. I hope there will be a Mani retreat this year-end, so that I go and recite Mani with everyone. It is almost impossible to accumulate 100 Million Mani recitations by oneself. The most recent one, I wasn't able to attend. I used to attend it every year since 2002 I think.</blockquote><blockquote>May you experience swift spiritual progress and be always happy and well.</blockquote><blockquote>With Mani, </blockquote><blockquote>Kim</blockquote>
