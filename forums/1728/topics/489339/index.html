              lot of his history is shrouded in obscurity. For instance, did he become a monk
              or did he simply remain an illustrious disciple of the Buddha? It is believed
              that he entered the Buddhist order shortly before his death. How he reconciled
              the duties of a monarch and a monk is a matter of conjecture, but there is no
              scope for doubt that he was at once a missionary and a monarch.</span></p>

The conquest of
              Kalinga was definitely not his first military exploit, but it did turn into his
              last. After the bloodbath at Kalinga, he did not make any attempt to extend his
              kingdom further, but his empire was so vast, it was enough to tax all his
              energies.</span></p>

              closely allied to Prakrit. It was the vernacular of Asoka’s day, and despite
              differences in script and dialect in certain localities, it was more or less
              uniformly spoken. This speaks volumes about his administration. On the eastern
              side of India are found revised editions of edicts dealing with the
              administration of Kalinga; one is located near the village of Dhauli, about
              seven miles south of Bhubaneswar, and another one in Ganjam district of Odisha.</span></p>

              “all men are my children” and “the world is my parish” in them. With regard to
              these two special Edicts known as Borderers’ Edict and Provincials Edict, it
              was Asoka’s command to the officials to recite their contents aloud, the former
              in the three seasons of hot, wet and cold, whereas the latter at least once a
              month. “Borderers” were the jungle tribes, who still inhabit the tributaries of
              Odisha, and it was Asoka’s greatest concern that his officers should win their
              confidence by spreading the message of love. He didn’t want them to feel afraid
              of their new ruler, but to trust him.</span></p>

He wanted
              to show them that he was like their father; he loved them as he loved himself.
              He knew a message in writing reaches only a small segment of the people, who
              could read them, whereas it’s recitation at the beginning of each of the three
              seasons, before the gatherings in villages, would spread the King’s message far
              and wide. By reading aloud the Provincials’ Edict, officials were warned to see
              that no one is unjustly imprisoned. By following the message incorporated in
              these edicts, any present government in the world can learn how to win the
              heart of its people and to tame any hostile elements in the country. Though
              Asoka’s empire was more than double the size of present day India, peace prevailed
              everywhere without modern day means of communication.</span></p>

              about him and his strategies of administration and his Law of Piety. From his
              first minor rock edict, we learn that for more than two-and-a-half-years, Asoka
              was simply a lay disciple of Buddha’s, even though he had joined the faith more
              than a year before he wrote the edict. He went through the country no fewer
              than 256 times as an itinerating missionary in a layman’s clothes — his way to
              win people’s hearts. He never engaged in the pompous display of his
              magnificence and splendour. Asoka was not only the temporal and spiritual head
              of the Church, but he also had a clear conception of his responsibility as head
              of state. His office acted as the defender of the
              Faith.      </span></p>

              rank. Immediately after his conversion, he settled down to spread the faith not
              only throughout his own dominions and amongst his subjects, but the regions
              beyond it, too. The Rock Edicts II, V, and XIII furnish details about his
              missionary operations. His missionary activities extended to Western Asia,
              including Syria, North Africa, including Egypt and Cyrene, Eastern Europe,
              including Macedonia and the Epirus, South India, and Sri Lanka as well as the
              extreme northwestern slopes of the Himalayas. </span></p>

              Jaugada inscription was the earliest one in the South, not far from his most
              northern boundary, the Mysore inscriptions are much further south than Jaugada.
              In August 1915, another inscription was discovered in the previous Nizam’s
              dominions. It is actually at Maski, a village in the Raichur district in
              Karnataka, and is a copy of Minor Rock Edict I. It has a peculiarity, because
              it is the only inscription, which incorporates the name Asoka, while in others
              Asoka is either addressed as “Devanapiya” or “Piyadasi”. His missionaries
              preached in the kingdoms of Cholas of the Coromandal Coast, Pandyas of
              Madurai’s Tinnevelley in Malabar and other regions on the West Coast and
              inspired them to make “curative arrangements for men and beasts” by digging
              wells and planting trees.</span></p>

              of Asoka was establishment of Buddhist faith in Sri Lanka. Though prima facie
              this task appeared to be easy, it wasn’t so. It was done by exertion of Asoka’s
              son Mahendra, who, accompanied by a band of monks and Pitakas or scriptures,
              had crossed over to Ceylon or Sri Lanka from South and converted the Ceylonese
              King and his 40,000 subjects to Buddhism. Though we do not find reference of
              this remarkable achievement mentioned in any of the edicts, yet local
              traditions support this fact. However, Mahendra or Mahinda is sometimes
              confused as the brother instead of son. History records Mahendra did not go
              alone; his sister Sanghamitra, and a band of nuns accompanied him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>The great “stupa” of Sanchi further adds that a branch of the sacred
              Bo-tree of Gaya was also carried over to Ceylon.   After his death,
              Mahendra was buried  at Ceylon. Ceylon’s King Tissa followed the example
              of Asoka and built many beautiful buildings in support of his new religion.
              Thomas William Rhys Davids , a British scholar of the Pali language and founder
              of the Pali Text Society wrote, “I shall not easily forget the day, when I
              first entered that lonely, cool, and quiet chamber, so simple and so beautiful,
              where more than 2,000 years ago the great teacher of Ceylon had sat, and thought,
              and worked through the long years of his peaceful and useful life.”</span></p>

              249 BC. The commemorative records on pillars at Rummindei and Nigliva, in the
              Nepalese Terai testify Asoka’s visit to Lumbini Garden, where Buddha was born,
              and also to the stupa of Konakamana. To instruct his subjects in the Law of
              Piety or the Law of Duty, Asoka maintained a system of official circuits
              occurring every five years. Dhamma, the colloquial form of dharma, used in his
              edicts does not stand for Buddhism, but for simple piety, which Asoka urged all
              his subjects, irrespective of faith to follow. Though Asoka does not deny the
              existence of a supreme deity, he insists that man should free himself by his
              own exertion from all vices and move towards the path of happiness. The
              Dhammapada sums up this teaching: “By ourselves is evil done; by ourselves we
              pain endure; by ourselves we cease from wrong; by ourselves we become pure. No
              one saves us but ourselves; no one can do and no one may; we ourselves must
              tread the Path; Buddhas only show the way.”</span></p>

              Every officer was expected to combine the work of piety with his ordinary
              duties. In 256 BC, Asoka appointed special officers of high rank, called the
              Dharma-mahamatras, to enforce the edicts related to the Law of Piety. The
              subordinates were called Dharmayuktas. The emperor attached utmost importance
              on two virtues: one on sanctity of animal life and the other on reverence
              towards parents, instructors, and other superiors. Asoka disliked blood
              shedding of any kind. He completely stopped slaughtering of any kind of animal
              for the royal kitchen. Any merry-making, which involved the use of meat, was prohibited.  </span></p>

              young bulls, rams, etc, and branding of horses and cows. In fact, he ordered
              building of asylums for animals. Trees were planted, wells were dug and rest
              houses were built along the sides of the roads. Though death penalty was not
              fully abolished, yet it was used very sparingly and even then condemned
              criminals were allowed time to regret and reform, so that death penalty could
              be postponed indefinitely. He built hospitals and infirmaries for the care of
              the sick in villages, inspired by Chanakya’s Arthasatra. He displayed his
              sagacity in his efforts to plant medicinal herbs, both in his own and other
              countries. Now the Western medicine has gradually become more disposed than ever
              to recognise the importance of indigenous drugs of India, because of the
              toxicity associated with the use of antibiotics.</span></p>

His roads were neither metalled nor
              bridged, yet as a builder in stone he challenges comparison with his rivals of
              all ages in any land, because his works display extreme finesse and
              sophistication.  His stupas or cupolas built in stones were found by Huien
              Tsang in Kapisa in Kafiristan and Nangrahar, near Jalalabad, on the bank of the
              river, Kabul. Very few are aware that he found a new city in Nepal called
              Lalita Patan. The principal stupa at Sanchi built by Asoka in about 250 BC is
              still famous for its historical significance. Asoka’s pillars bear testimony of
              his artistic and architectural genius. They all consist of fine sandstone and
              were queried at Chunar in the district of Mirjapur, and transported either as
              rough blocks or finished pillars for hundreds of miles to the places of
              erection. The buildings built at Sarnath, where Buddha delivered his first
              sermon, still stand intact.</span></p>

              the whole reflect the intentions, ambitions and ideals of their author. He gave
              utmost importance on protecting the interests of the people. Asoka exhibited
              inimitable tolerance to other religions, and made no discrimination among his
              subjects. Asoka’s effort to spread Buddhism did not go in vain; after his
              death, it travelled across Eastern Turkestan via the northwest Himalayas to
              China, where it became the state religion in the fourth century AD, and then it
              spread to Korea, Japan and Mongolia. Despite his contributions to the world,
              nothing is known either about the circumstances of the death or about the last
              days of this great emperor.   The world should take a leaf from the
              ideas on tolerance propagated by one of India’s greatest prophets.</span></p>
