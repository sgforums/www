              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Singapore is mixed culture religion country, many have cross Toasim deities and Buddhism Buddha and bodhisavatta. The two Bodhisavatta that usually overlap both religion are è§‚ä¸–éŸ³è�©è�¨ and åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è�¨,actually both bodhisavatta are buddhism bodhisavatta, this is due their appearance in china and folk culture by the people they also pray respect to them in the toasit temples.</p>
              <p>We pray respect to Buddha or bodhisavatta statue, is not term as "pray", I would like to use the word respect, we respect the Dharma(ä½›æ³•) teaching.</p>
              <p>I personally I do not treat buddhism as a religion, I treat it more like a higher state philiosophy(å“²å­¦) or pyscology, as å‡€ç©ºæ³•å¸ˆ you mention in a DVD which I watch, he mentioned, in order to treat a religion as a religion, there is a center of the ultimate god, ie christianity, you will have Lord(ä¸Šå¸�).</p>
              <p>In Buddhism you would normally see buddha statue/bodhisavatta statue, arhart statue and protectors of the dharma statue(æŠ¤æ³•).As you mentioned Guan Yin Ma, maybe you are referring to the statue at Guan Yin Tang, Middle Raod. I heard a friend said that statue is å‡†æ��ä½›æ¯� instead of Guan Yin, and actually è§‚ä¸–éŸ³è�©è�¨ has alot manifestition so you would see different names. As for Guan Yu, you can find his statue at Shuang Lim Temple (toa payoh) he is the dharma protector.</p>

              <p>Great you're taking up interest again!</p>
              <p>BTW you said decided to switch religion.. are you a Christian?</p>
              <p>To answer your questions, Buddhists do not pray to different gods. There is a Chinese folk tradition (like, Ming Jian Xin Yang) out there that worships many Chinese gods, and they included Guan Yin (a Buddhist Bodhisattva) into their 'pantheon'. However the Chinese folk tradition practitioners are not necessarily Buddhists. A Buddhist is someone who has taken refuge in the triple gems (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha).</p>
              <p>Guan Yin is a Bodhisattva who symbolizes great compassion, and not only do Buddhist pay reverence to her, we see her as a model... we want to become like Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva ourselves. A Bodhisattva is someone on the path to Buddhahood, who not only sought his own liberation but has great compassion for all sentient beings and vows to deliver them from the samsaric ocean of suffering.</p>
              <p>As for Guan Yu, as Bodhi hut explained he's a Buddhism dharma protector. There's a story behind it.</p>
              <p>We don't really worship anyone, not even Buddha, Guan Yin, Guan Yu and so on. We pay our deepest respect and reverence to them. We pay respect to Buddha as being the greatest teacher to mankand, and we want to practice his teachings, and attain enlightenment ourselves.</p>

              <p>p.s. Guan Yin is not a god, a god (though might be powerful) is still within the cycle of the 6 realms of samsara... experiencing birth, death, rebirth. In Buddhism we don't 'worship' gods.</p>
              <p>Guan Yin Bodhisattva is enlightened, is out of the cycle. But he appears in Samsara out of great compassion for all of us.</p>

              <p><br>I think it's a common perception that Buddhism = Taoism = Confusius, in fact, they see no difference between the 3.  In fact, to many so call followers of buddhist organisations, the buddhism they know is to pray for Buddha/Boddhisattvas, get the blessed water, do whatever they can, only to ask for Buddha/Boddhisattvas to improve their lives.  When difficult time decends, they start to ask the same question :" Why Buddha dun want to protect them?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've helped out at one dharma event.  On the stage, is the Holiness of Bhutan.  At the first row of audiences were the VIPs.  They were dressed elaborately, with branded ornaments, handbags, even wore a buddha pendent decorated with loads of diamonds.  Before the start of the event, the Tai Tais were admiring the wonderful expensive pendents they have, the dress they wore, the latest 1st class holiday they've recently took etc.  They were there for one purpose, the blessing of Rinpoche, so that their live could be improved further, so that they can book a place in the Buddha Land.  To them, Buddhism is about using the money to buy expensive buddha pendants for themselves, donating money to monastery of their choice (preferbly those with Holiness), and most importantly, everybody must know how much money they have donated.  Oh.. not to forget, Rinpoche must also bless their pendants, cars, yachts etc, so that they can not only be the richest being in Samsara, they can also build their Villas in the Buddha Land.  Guess what's the topic the Holiness preached on the stage?  Renunciation.</p>
              <p>Just sharing of my thoughts here.... :P  To summarise, Buddhism is not about pray pray, get blessing, donate money for the better of oneselves.       </p>

              <p>Eridanus ,the concept of God is a fabrication by human since time immemorial to comfort his survival in a harsh african savannah forest. Christianity also stemmed from the human explanation of apocalyptic view of the God's Will</p>
              <p>Jesus Christ is like a Great Bodhisattva in Buddhism ,seeking to relieve the Oppressed Jews from the Control of the Roman Empire</p>
              <p>The religion of Gods is seeking outer inspirational ,while Buddhism goes through an inner reflection of ones self to attain liberation</p>

              <p>Glad you continued to look into Buddhism.. my Master himself was once a Christian pastor who wrote Christian books, and later he turned to Buddhism after being challenged to write a book for his [false] criticisms against Buddhism... after reading Buddhism, his whole perspective of Buddhism changed, he found what he wanted and converted. It was an interesting story, but maybe next time..</p>
              <p>To answer your questions... yes we have heaven and hell like Christianity. However, as you know, we do not believe in eternal heaven and hell. The beings in hell and heaven also have a temporal lifespan, even though it is very long... they will eventually pass away from the plane and take rebirth according to their karma.</p>
              <p>A person is reborn according to his karma, wholesome karma leads to higher realms, unwholesome karma leads to lower realms. What are higher realms? Human, asura, heaven/deva. What are lower realms? Hell, ghost, animal. Altogether they make up six realms.</p>
              <p>Another thing is, in Christianity there is only 1 level of heaven and probably 1 hell. In Buddhism, there are many heavens and many hells. There are 28 heavens, for example,</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">According to Buddhism, 
                        the various celestial levels of existence, in ascending order, are divided 
                        into three worlds, namely:<br> <strong>(i) Field of Desires <br> (ii) Field of Forms<br> (iii) Field of Formless<br> <br> <br> </strong></span></p>

              <p>Erm.. I might be asking a very dumb question but.. I'm 16 this
                  year. I was borned a Buddhist and I didn't really care about that
                  when I was young.. Last few years, I've even decided to switch my
                  religion because of this so called "trend" during my primary school
                  times and lower sec-sch times.</p>
              <p>Just recently, I've finally understand what Buddhism is. A
                  slight understanding. I might be only a tender young age of 16, but
                  I admire Buddha's teachings. I love helping people, I'm a guy who
                  helps out a lot, and I'm a guy who won't bear to kill a beetle, but
                  still did, cause it irritates me. I know it's wrong, but I don't
                  kill insects now.</p>

              <p>Hmm, i also didnt know that most buddhist pray to bodhisattvas and buddhas, but i guess you're right to say that. But it depends on traditions. Theravada only pay revenance to Buddha Sakyamuni, the great one. Then we have Mahayana which have both buddha and bodhisattvas and arhats. In the Vajrayana we have buddhas, bodhisattvas, arhats, dharma-protectors, deities which we can meditate on.</p>
              <p>Regarding this statement,"It is said that the founder of Tian Tai school (æ™ºè€…å¤§å¸ˆ) is one of many manifestations of buddha sakyamuni"  , i somehow dont agree with it. Buddha Sakyamuni has already parninirvana and left the world, and how did he come back as manifiestation again? This statement leaves me wondering</p>

              <p>There are many buddhist who pray to bodhisatva. All dharma doors can be categorized to 3 types (essence, appearance, function) those practice the appearance and function need strong devotion to buddha and/or bodhisatva in order to succeed.<br>For example, pureland school, they can pray to amitabha buddha or Guan Yin bodhisatva to be born in the pureland.<br>For people who practice vajrayana, when doing sadhana, they also pray to the yidam, yogini and so on.

              <p>Well, i think regarding the manifestation of Buddha, it all depends on tradition again. We see tibetan buddhism having many deities and so on who are manifestation of many Buddhas, similarly in mahayana, but we dont see them in Theravada tradition.</p>
              <p>Someone who is a theravada told me that their stand of nibbana is that Gautama buddha after parninibbanna will not appear in this world again. But i know of course, that in mahayana standpoint is like what you have said.</p>
              <p>But anyway i dont think thats very important on the issue of whether buddha can manifiest. Im sure Buddha wants us to advocate on his teachings and practice them and not ponder over his existence currently.</p>

              <p>Halo TS, like you, i also realised buddhism very much on my own. i was born into a taoism family. my grandma and parents will always buy chicken and roast meat to pray, and ate after the praying. even though i was very young and would follow what my parents did, i had wondered why praying involves killing living things for praying. because i thought the animals are like us, if i fear pain and death, surely the animals felt that too right.</p>
              <p>Sorry side track a bit.. My mother converted to buddhism after her divorce and she realised a lot of things too. i was very much left alone to explore on my own. She left me to make my own choices in life. I am very glad that i was not being led into astray.

              <p>Halo TS, like you, i also realised buddhism very much on my own.
                  i was born into a taoism family. my grandma and parents will always
                  buy chicken and roast meat to pray, and ate after the praying. even
                  though i was very young and would follow what my parents did, i had
                  wondered why praying involves killing living things for praying.
                  because i thought the animals are like us, if i fear pain and
                  death, surely the animals felt that too right.</p>
              <p>Sorry side track a bit.. My mother converted to buddhism after
                  her divorce and she realised a lot of things too. i was very much
                  left alone to explore on my own. She left me to make my own choices
                  in life. I am very glad that i was not being led into astray. I
                  have always felt lucky that i have good friends and colleagues
                  surrounding me, some of them were not sincere, but still my life
                  was not affected very much by them. Few times i nearly went off the

              <p>Haha, all of us have a story behind on how we came into buddhism. But all in all, something must have sparked us into finding out more about buddhism.</p>
              <p>I was attracted to it by music. I find those mantras very nice and thus decided to explore the musics and further into buddhism.</p>

              <p>Got to work and just happen to be at Ma Zu temple last Sunday, there is a story inscribed in english and chinese versions beside the statues about GuanYu on how he became a Dhama protector</p>
              <p>I was also at Buddha Tooth Relics Temple later to see exhibits about Buddha life.</p>
              <p>And of course dumplings exhibit at Chinatown market. Very interesting weekend!</p>
