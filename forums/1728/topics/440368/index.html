              <p><br> The Buddha teaches:<br> <br> These four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world. Which four?<br> There is the case of the individual who has attained internal 
                      tranquility of awareness, but not insight into phenomena through 
                      heightened discernment. There is... the individual who has attained 
                      insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, but not internal 
                      tranquility of awareness. There is... the individual who has attained 
                      neither internal tranquility of awareness nor insight into phenomena 
                      through heightened discernment. And there is... the individual who has 
                      attained both internal tranquility of awareness &amp; insight into 
                      phenomena through heightened discernment.<br> <br> The individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness, 
                      but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, should 
                      approach an individual who has attained insight into phenomena through 
                      heightened discernment... and ask him: 'How should fabrications be 
                      regarded? How should they be investigated? How should they be seen with 
                      insight?' The other will answer in line with what he has seen &amp; 
                      experienced: 'Fabrications should be regarded in this way... 
                      investigated in this way... seen in this way with insight.' Then 
                      eventually he [the first] will become one who has attained both internal
                       tranquility of awareness &amp; insight into phenomena through 
                      heightened discernment.<br> <br> As for the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through
                       heightened discernment, but not internal tranquility of awareness, he 
                      should approach an individual who has attained internal tranquility of 
                      awareness... and ask him, 'How should the mind be steadied? How should 
                      it be made to settle down? How should it be unified? How should it be 
                      concentrated?' The other will answer in line with what he has seen &amp;
                       experienced: 'The mind should be steadied in this way... made to settle
                       down in this way... unified in this way... concentrated in this way.' 
                      Then eventually he [the first] will become one who has attained both 
                      internal tranquility of awareness &amp; insight into phenomena through 
                      heightened discernment.<br> <br> As for the individual who has attained neither internal tranquility 
                      of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, 
                      he should approach an individual who has attained both internal 
                      tranquility of awareness &amp; insight into phenomena through heightened
                       discernment... and ask him, 'How should the mind be steadied? How 
                      should it be made to settle down? How should it be unified? How should 
                      it be concentrated? How should fabrications be regarded? How should they
                       be investigated? How should they be seen with insight?' The other will 
                      answer in line with what he has seen &amp; experienced: 'The mind should
                       be steadied in this way... made to settle down in this way... unified 
                      in this way... concentrated in this way. Fabrications should be regarded
                       in this way... investigated in this way... seen in this way with 
                      insight.' Then eventually he [the first] will become one who has 
                      attained both internal tranquility of awareness &amp; insight into 
                      phenomena through heightened discernment.<br> <br> As for the individual who has attained both internal tranquility of 
                      awareness &amp; insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, 
                      his duty is to make an effort in establishing ('tuning') those very same
                       skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the effluents*.</p>

              <div class="cite"><br></div>
              <p><br> Here's a related conversation between Thusness and I about five years ago:</p>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">Session Start: Saturday, August 26, 2006</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:52 PM) Thusness: about the mahamudra, some say its the
              4th turning. </div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:53 PM) Thusness: But it is the experience of total
              Presence.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:53 PM) AEN: meaning?</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:53 PM) AEN: u mean 4th turning = total presence</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:53 PM) AEN: wats the diff between 3rd and 4th</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:54 PM) Thusness: the teaching is to directly experience
              the buddha nature.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:54 PM) Thusness: like zen to me. </div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:54 PM) AEN: oic.. but isnt it same as 3rd which also
              about buddha nature</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:55 PM) Thusness: yeah</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:55 PM) Thusness: so i don't see a diff. </div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:55 PM) AEN: hahaha</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:55 PM) AEN: oic</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:55 PM) Thusness: wonder why some call it 4th
              turning. </div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:55 PM) Thusness: to me, there is no real mark of distinction.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:56 PM) Thusness: but because it is a tibetan practices, i
              do not really know is there any hidden teaching.  From the books I have read, it is just the
              direct experience of our Pristine Awareness.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:57 PM) Thusness: I do not advice ppl to go into
              experiencing of Buddha's nature directly.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:57 PM) Thusness: one should always start from developing
              the qualities of the mind...</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:58 PM) AEN: icic... paramitas?</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:58 PM) Thusness: to experience the deep calmness
              resulting from settling our thoughts</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:58 PM) Thusness: still our mind</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:58 PM) Thusness: then wisdom</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:58 PM) AEN: oic</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:58 PM) AEN: is stilling our mind considered shamatha?</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:59 PM) Thusness: not exactly but it can be by any
              practices as long as it lead us to the experience of this calmness</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:59 PM) Thusness: mindfulness of breath</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:59 PM) Thusness: or mindfulness itself or chanting</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:59 PM) Thusness: one must experience this calmness first.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(6:59 PM) Thusness: because it is the 'ground' that
              strengthen other experience</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:00 PM) Thusness: however some ppl are vested with the
              conditions to experience the end-result first, then they have to return to
              these practices to stabilize the experience.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:00 PM) Thusness: like experiencing our buddha nature
              directly.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:01 PM) Thusness: then the entire life becomes the
              unfolding and understand of this experience.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:01 PM) Thusness: like those experiencing "I
              AMness".</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:01 PM) Thusness: it is a mistaken identity</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:02 PM) Thusness: due to our karmic propensities, they do
              cannot discern the nature of that experience.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:02 PM) Thusness: however after many years of
              contemplation, they are able to have deeper glimpse of it.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:03 PM) Thusness: and the next stage is the experience of
              no-self to further refine their understanding.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:04 PM) Thusness: the mind then is experienced as a
              crystal clear mirror, there is no-I. 
              Then emptiness must step in to know that there is no mirror in the
              first place reflecting anything.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:04 PM) Thusness: the manifestation is the arising is the
              buddha's nature.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:05 PM) Thusness: there is no mirror bright at all, the
              arising is the buddha nature itself. 
              Samsara is Nirvana.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:05 PM) Thusness: even with this illumination, one is not
              able to overcome the defilement, our karmic propensities.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:05 PM) Thusness: because they do not start from the
              perfection of the calmness, there is no strength</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:06 PM) Thusness: they are unable to 'control' their
              thoughts (meaning settle their thoughts)</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:07 PM) Thusness: when we reached a state of deep calmness
              and we turn into it into mindfulness, then there is the experience of
              blissfulness, clarity and vitality and wisdom</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:07 PM) Thusness: stilling the body and mind only result
              in a deep and stable calmness that gather strength.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:08 PM) Thusness: for the other quality to arise, it needs
              the direct experience and intuitive wisdom</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:09 PM) Thusness: that is why i told longchen to eliminate
              the presence and start experience the deep calmness by letting go.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:09 PM) Thusness: the letting go is to settle the mind
              till he is about to have mastery over the thought patterns</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:10 PM) Thusness: this is very important for progress.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:10 PM) Thusness: direct perception is crucial, because
              buddha nature cannot be understood conceptually</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:11 PM) Thusness: but without the ground of deep calmness,
              there is no strength.  And one might
              suffer because we do not know how to deal with these experience.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:38 PM) Thusness: "Generally, as in the Theravadin
              Buddhist tradition and the Samkhya yogic schools, whenever you enter this state
              of unmanifest absorption, it burns away certain linger afflictions and sources
              of ignoance. Each time you fully enter this state, more of these afflictions
              are burned away. and after a certain number and type of these entranes - often
              four-  you have burned away everything
              there is to ob</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:38 PM) Thusness: who said this?</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:42 PM) AEN: ken wilber</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:42 PM) AEN: a brief history of everyting</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:42 PM) Thusness: not bad. </div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(7:43 PM) Thusness: about the emptiness he is toking about,
              is the no-self.  That is manifestation
              itself.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(9:49 PM) Thusness: u got the book "a history of
              everything' ?</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(10:03 PM) AEN: borrowed from library</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(11:01 PM) Thusness: yeah...i think it is okie to keep a
              book of ken wilber.  I like his
              description of the no-self. </div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(11:01 PM) Thusness: just do not know the strength.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(11:07 PM) Thusness: when there is the experience of
              everything as pristine awareness, there cannot be a 'self' or any sense of
              'I'.  To have strength of this
              experience, the deep sense of calmness from complete stillness of the body as
              well as the mind are the conditions.  The
              problems is if we did not go through the proper stage, we will based on or
              unknowingly exercise our intellect to capture that experience.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(11:07 PM) Thusness: it is the quality of the mind that is
              important, not the content of it.  The
              quality must come from just the sensing, nothing about intellect.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(11:11 PM) Thusness: after longchen has more experience of
              the no-self nature of the pristine awareness, the next step is to gather
              strength through experiencing that sense of calmness and tranquillity and
              then  fuse his anatta experience into this
              tranquil calm.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(11:11 PM) Thusness: then experience the total dissolving of
              the consciousness of Presence into deep sleep.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(11:11 PM) Thusness: Dare to face the great death and be
              nothing.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(11:11 PM) AEN: wat great death</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">(11:13 PM) Thusness: merge completely into the place as if
              we were never there b4....love and fuse completely into nothingness....don't
              worry about anything...total wakefulness when waking and complete death in deep
              sleep.  This is true presence according
              to conditions.</div>

              Regarding the chanting mentioned above.
              
              -  Is it verbal chanting, or can it be silent chanting?  (I usually chant silently.)
              
              -  I can't help but feel I have to place my attention somewhere even when chanting.  So where can I place my attention; the forehead, the nose, the lips, the ears... where?

              <p>1) Either. I seldom chant nowadays, but I prefer to chant aloud when alone, but with others just chant silently.</p>
              <p>2) Pay attention to the chanting voice.</p>

              <p>Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having 
              bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to 
              the Blessed One, "'One who dwells in the Dhamma, one who dwells in the 
              Dhamma': thus it is said, lord. To what extent is a bhikkhu one who 
              dwells in the Dhamma?"</p>
              <p>"Monk, there is the case where a monk studies the Dhamma: dialogues, 
              narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous 
              exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question &amp; 
              answer sessions.<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.073.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> He spends the day in Dhamma-study. He neglects seclusion. He doesn't 
              commit himself to internal tranquillity of awareness. This is called a 
              monk who is keen on study, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.</p>
              <p>"Then there is the case where a monk takes the Dhamma as he has heard
               &amp; studied it and teaches it in full detail to others. He spends the
               day in Dhamma-description. He neglects seclusion. He doesn't commit 
              himself to internal tranquillity of awareness. This is called a monk who
               is keen on description, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.</p>
              <p>"Then there is the case where a monk takes the Dhamma as he has heard
               &amp; studied it and recites it in full detail. He spends the day in

              internal tranquillity of awareness. This is called a monk who is keen on
               recitation, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.</p>
              <p>"Then there is the case where a monk takes the Dhamma as he has heard
               &amp; studied it and thinks about it, evaluates it, and examines it 
              with his intellect. He spends the day in Dhamma-thinking. He neglects 
              seclusion. He doesn't commit himself to internal tranquillity of 
              awareness. This is called a monk who is keen on thinking, not one who 
              dwells in the Dhamma.</p>
              <p>"Then there is the case where a monk studies the Dhamma: dialogues, 
              narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous 
              exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question &amp; 
              answer sessions. He doesn't spend the day in Dhamma-study. He doesn't 
              neglect seclusion. He commits himself to internal tranquillity of 
              awareness. This is called a monk who dwells in the Dhamma.</p>
              <p>"Now, monk, I have taught you the person who is keen on study, the 
              one who is keen on description, the one who is keen on recitation, the 
              one who is keen on thinking, and the one who dwells in the Dhamma. 
              Whatever a teacher should do — seeking the welfare of his disciples, out
               of sympathy for them — that have I done for you. Over there are the 
              roots of trees; over there, empty dwellings. Practice jhana, monk. Don't
               be heedless. Don't later fall into regret. This is our message to you."</p>

              <p>"Even if a monk is not skilled in the ways of the minds of others,<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.054.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> he should train himself: 'I will be skilled in reading my own mind.'</p>
              <p><a id="mirror" name="mirror"></a>"And how is a monk skilled in 
              reading his own mind? Imagine a young woman — or man — fond of 
              adornment, examining the image of her own face in a bright, clean mirror
               or bowl of clear water: If she saw any dirt or blemish there, she would
               try to remove it. If she saw no dirt or blemish there, she would be 
              pleased, her resolves fulfilled: 'How fortunate I am! How clean I am!' 
              In the same way, a monk's self-examination is very productive in terms 
              of skillful qualities:<a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag" name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.054.than.html#fn-2">[2]</a> 'Am I one who achieves internal tranquility of awareness, or am I one 
              who does not achieve internal tranquility of awareness? Am I one who 
              achieves insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, or am I 
              one who does not achieve insight into phenomena through heightened 
              discernment?"</p>
              <p>"If, on examination, he knows, 'I am one who achieves internal 
              tranquility of awareness but not insight into phenomena through 
              heightened discernment,' then his duty is to make an effort for the 
              maintenance of internal tranquility of awareness and for insight into 
              phenomena through heightened discernment. At a later time he will then 
              be one who achieves both internal tranquility of awareness and insight 
              into phenomena through heightened discernment.</p>
              <p>"But if, on examination, the monk knows, 'I am one who achieves 
              insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal 
              tranquility of awareness,' then his duty is to make an effort for the 
              maintenance of insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and
               for internal tranquility of awareness. At a later time he will then be 
              one who achieves both insight into phenomena through heightened 
              discernment and internal tranquility of awareness.</p>
              <p>"But if, on examination, the monk knows, 'I am one who achieves 
              neither internal tranquility of awareness nor insight into phenomena 
              through heightened discernment,' then he should put forth extra desire, 
              effort, diligence, endeavor, relentlessness, mindfulness, &amp; 
              alertness for gaining those very same skillful qualities. <a id="turban" name="turban"></a>Just
               as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra
               desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, relentlessness, mindfulness, &amp;
               alertness to put out the fire on his turban or head; in the same way, 
              the monk should put forth extra desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, 
              relentlessness, mindfulness, &amp; alertness for gaining those very same
               skillful qualities.</p>
              <p>"But if, on examination, the monk knows, 'I am one who achieves both 
              internal tranquility of awareness and insight into phenomena through 
              heightened discernment,' then his duty is to make an effort in 
              maintaining those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for 
              the ending of the effluents.</p>
