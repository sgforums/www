              <p>Yes, we want to see qualified and certified people to help us do our things - bankers, doctors etc in daily life.</p>
              <p>But guess what? It doesn't solve the problem, we get people with fake degrees, fake certifications going around, people still get duped.</p>
              <p>And what happens also is, ppl start to say "Oh this teacher is better! This lawyer is better! He's got a degree from oxford! He's a director of whatever! He really cures people!" and everyone flocks to that guy. So ppl realised "hey if i want to be like this guy, and earn big money and name, i better go get a degree from oxford!" and end up when they realise they can't have that degree, they just settle for any degree that is good, and u get lots of not-really-that-brillant people around with a "whatever" degree / certification.<br><br>In the worldly things, degree and certifcations helps, but why do people want to get a degree or be certified in the 1st place? It's because society demands these people around to help them do their stuff, and if they don't go get a degree, they can't earn their living.</p>
              <p>In the Buddhadharma, even though everyone wants to follow the best teacher, no one is suppose to announce their attainments. To understand why, we have to consider the consequences of these actions. <br><br>1) If someone announces he is the real deal, everyone flocks to him to learn. This can induce jealousy and cause division in the community - this is especially serious if it happens in the community of monks and nuns - a schism may follow. Therefore to protect sentient beings, attainments should not be revealed.<br><br>2) During the Buddha's time, although the Buddha certified Bhikhus, the people are not like the people in our Dharma ending age. There are less people at that time who anyhow claim they have attain xxxxx attainment. <br>Now the Buddha is no longer around to give certifications, and as we move into the dharma ending age, demons spread like wildfire, if the ppl who have reach xxxx attainments start to disclose their attainments, so too can these demons claim such and attract followers and mislead people causing them to fall. Therefore to protect sentient beings, attainments should not be revealed.<br><br>3) It is easier to discern who's a quack in terms of worldly stuff, that's why we hear people saying "this uni is not so good", "this doctor is good" etc. But in terms of spiritual attainments - who can discern? Unless a person is of a higher spiritual level than that person who claims he is xxxxxx. Therefore, it is easy to make claims with no one knowing whether you have really achieve that state because living beings are confused and deluded. Therefore to protect sentient beings, attainments should not be revealed.<br><br>The buddha never indicated a successor to his teachings, and ask the monks to rely on the dharma as their refuge. As such, we can only rely on the what the Buddha taught - the sutras, to see if people are "certified" in a sense - at the very least, we should be able to tell for sure that are certified to be on the wrong path, certified to a wrong attainment with the sutra's explanation.</p>

              <p>i think AEN has a point in that such revelation of attainments can actually encourage those who think that meditation and liberation is completely beyond them. maybe AEN himself has been inspired in this way and i'm sure many others too.</p>
              <p>Attainments couched in terms like 'arhatship' , 'buddhahood' is quite strange to me cos one can always share where one is in terms of one's direct experience. To proclaim with such labels is quite pointless IMO, and we know what the Diamond sutra has to say with regards to dwelling on such things.</p>
              <p>Having said that, one of the great obstacle in practice nowadays is the hankering after attainment.  The expectation and hope/fear is always making one fixate. Fixation is one of the factors that leads to deviant paths / states as stated in the Shurangama sutra.</p>
              <p>we always say that meditation or any spiritual pursuit has to be done in the right spirit, with the altruistic motivation.  And so due to disclosure of one's own experience, if competitiveness arises to the point of jealousy and other kleshas, then it is also pointless.</p>
              <p>there are many sides to the picture.  And we see that many past masters have presented their experiences in many different ways, some in more overt manner, some in a more hinting fashion. So I think we should allow the variety of styles to exist but yet, i myself should think that since this is the degenerated age then it is very fair to warn all those out there to be extremely cautious with the counsel they seek.  In part, because there are so many demons and what are demons actually, but really people taken over by the inner poisons of attachment, aversion and ignorance... and their own selfish aims and agendas... so it is good to have a pinch of salt with everything.</p>
              <p>If you find someone who you want to learn from, he should have the qualities of being accomplished and having the genuine and utmost wish to help you be liberated.  Mainly compassion and wisdom.    That is very impt.  The internet is full of articles about how to identify authentic teachers.  It is pointless to harp on about whether someone is authentic or not. Everyone has to decide for themselves and face the consequences.</p>

              <p>Claims are a dozen to the dime! However. it may good for the good ole US of A, home of crass commercialism. You have probably forgot to remember all the false prophets in the internet, or that there are also people who shop around for the BEST religion and the BEST teacher, with all the credentials. But that does'nt guarantee anything. Shopping for the best only means you want or possess the best, does they really want enlightenment?!! Good teachings and transmission do occur, but it only works if there is a effective teacher/student relationship.  </p>
              <p>There are different vehicle for different sentient beings, it is not a one side fits all. So in context of all these, what do you make of your teacher, your guide who do not make such claims?!     </p>

              <p>yeah man.. time flies since we last met!</p>
              <p>i feel its more of our collective social conditioning and expectation of what's perceived to be politically-correct when it comes to spiritual matters from the practical and scholarly aspects. what can be brought into an open forum for discussion and what should be done behind closed doors.</p>
              <p>example, notice how there are tons of basic meditation courses offered out there?  i've attended a couple and it is always useful for beginners, especially the Q&amp;As and discussions where everyone can benefit from each other's experience.  </p>
              <p>but notice there isn't any intermediate or advanced meditation courses?  not in public that i know of anyway.  pls let me know if anyone is aware of one coz i'm definitely interested :-)</p>
              <p>is it because majority of the folks are generally not interested to practice beyond the basic relax-and-feel-good level?  or perhaps is it a taboo to not share openly about practical meditative experiences and how to help fellow intermediate/advanced practitioners to progress further along the path? or the fear that any open discussions about direct meditative experience (or gasp... attainments!) will be deemed too weird or unacceptable by our social norms?</p>
              <p>so the above situation applies to the practical aspect.  interesting thing is, from the scholarly aspect, notice there are tons of basic buddhist course, and intermediate course, and advanced course, all the way to Ph.D, that you can easily find in public? there is no shame, discomfort or awkwardness when someone proclaims that he has achieved the highest Ph.D attainment. from a scholarly standpoint at least :-P</p>
              <p>and you can find tons of intellectual debates and discussions about the "truth" of your views vs my views.  but again, pretty silent and rare when it comes to debates and discussions about real direct practical meditative experiences.  why is that so?</p>
              <p>i guess i'm still struggling to rationalize why the disparate social expectations and norms when it comes to practice and study when both aspects should be balanced and equally focused upon for meaningful individual progress along the path.</p>

              <p>Yes, I am grateful that the Buddha did turn the Wheel of Dharma, even though he initially felt what he realised was so profound that people may be unable accept it. Thankfully, we have 2553 years(?) of the Dharma.</p>
              <p>Anyway, when Rahula went and asked the Buddha for his inheritance, he gave him the tonsure and ordained him. So if you really want to be the son of the conqueror, you do likewise.</p>
              <p>You let go and ordain yourself and enter the full time occupation of seeking enlightenment. You do not bother yourselves with mundane matters anymore. Cutting all fetters and seek arahantship.</p>
              <p>In the Varjayana tradition, there is the mandala offering of mudra, which is the offering of everything, represented by Mt. Meru at the center.  That means giving up everything!  So I asked  myself genuinely. do I really mean to seek enlightenment, or is it just a case of having your cake and eating it too? I know the answer about myself, what about you?</p>
              <p>Anyway, thank you for your insightful views, it will take me some time to ruminate over it! </p>

              <h1>Issues Surrounding Talking about Enlightenment</h1>
              <p>There is a website called <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/">access to insight</a> that I generally think is excellent. It provides one of the largest 
              on-line English translation selection of the original texts as well as a
               huge amount of other useful information, including a section of 
              questions and answers on Buddhism.
              <br><br> There is a section of it (<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/bfaq.html#arahants">click here</a>)
               in which they answer a question about whether or not there are 
              enlightened beings around today and how to know. I like most of the 
              advice they give, but take some issue with the following advice found at
               the end of their (John Bullitt's) answer:</p>
              <blockquote><em>Finally, one rule of thumb that I've found helpful: 
              someone who goes around claiming to be enlightened (or dropping hints to
               that effect) probably isn't—at least not in the sense the Buddha had in
               mind.</em></blockquote>
              <p><strong>As one crusader for bringing things back down to earth, 
              empowering everyone to aim high in their spiritual practice, and 
              standing up against harmful taboos, I submit the following reply to that
               assertion:</strong> <br><br> I have a great deal of experience with people who have had to wrestle 
              with this question from both sides of it, meaning that I know lots of 
              people looking for enlightened beings, and I know lots of living 
              enlightened beings wondering about how in the world to talk about it in 
              ways that are skillful. I have also been lucky enough to hear both 
              groups' candid opinions on these issues. I also have some knowledge of 
              the examples from the old texts of the various strains of Buddhism that 
              give examples of enlightened beings handling it in various ways. I will 
              address the later two:
              <br><br> Examples of people actively claiming enlightenment include:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>The Buddha, who was forever talking about how enlightened he was. 
              Sutta after sutta, story after story, he makes explicit claims about his
               efforts, deeds, abilities and understanding that are of the grandest 
              and most explicit nature. So do large numbers of other Buddhas, 
              Boddhisattvas, Dakinis and hangers-on. The very word "Buddha" means 
              "Awakened One."</li>
              <li>Many of the early Sangha: Sariputta and many of the others were 
              explicitly known as being enlightened to various degrees, having powers,
               etc.</li>
              <li>Loads of Buddhist practitioners since then, including basically 
              every lineage master explicitly or implicitly (the very concept depends 
              explicitly on there being transmission of real ultimate wisdom from 
              teacher to student), and numerous authors (e.g. <em>The Vimuttimagga</em> by The Arahat Upatissa). Many of the titles people receive in the past 
              and today have explicit stages of awakening inherently implied in them, 
              and basically all lineages have some requirement for minimum levels of 
              attainment to be allowed by those lineages to teach (e.g. second path in
               the Mahasi Sayadaw tradition, at least Third Path (First Bodhisattva 
              Bhumi and beyond) in the Tibetan Five Path System for teaching tantric 
              empowerments, etc.).</li>
              <li>Large numbers of modern dharma teachers, including a good number who
               teach at IMS and related centers, as well as plenty of the living 
              Theravada, Zen, and Tibetan masters, routinely give hints, and 
              occasionally outright claims to enlightenment above and beyond the 
              unambiguous implications of their titles, fancy hats, robes, seats on 
              the front cushion, and lineage status. If you are curious, I will be 
              happy to provide scads of examples that I have witnessed myself.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><br> Examples of people not claiming it who are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Hard to be sure, obviously, but the Buddhist texts are not always 
              kind to these, such as the "silent Buddhas" who are criticized in the 
              Mahayana literature for failing to share their much-needed wisdom (see 
              the standard lists of ways bodhisattvas fail). Or take the Buddha's 
              admonition that the arahats not go two together so that there would not 
              be one silent while the other spoke the dharma.
              <br><br> If one has known for one's self wondrous understandings, abilities or 
              attainments, their direct personal and societal benefits, the 
              reproducible means to attain them, the pitfalls, perils, and side-tracks
               of those practices and how to avoid them because one has done this for 
              one's self, it is extremely natural for compassion and the wish to share
               these things to arise, and this is well-documented and attested to. 
              That compassionate wish to share these things having arisen, it is 
              natural to face the question of how to frame those understandings, 
              options including:</li>
              <li>Not claiming any understanding and thus teaching on the blatently 
              deceptive pretense that one is merely teaching those things attained in 
              the past or by others (perhaps one's teachers or guru(s)), thus playing 
              one's actual understandings as merely points of dogma or heresay, 
              thereby undermining one's authority to teach in trade for some sort of 
              polite attempt at "modesty", or putting students in the complex position
               of trying to figure out if one is lying for their benefit, if it could 
              be called benefit. Possible benefits involve hopefully avoiding the 
              massive amount of projection, role confusion, temptation to abuse 
              confused students, cults of personality, disbelief, inevitable 
              disappointment, and other craziness, doubt, and possibly professional 
              issues that arises whenever people falsely or correctly claim levels of 
              realization, concentration practice ability or powers. Downsides to this
               approach include reinforcing the common belief that these things are 
              not attained today (as is implicit in the question above), or are only 
              attained by very rare beings or those with huge amounts of retreat time 
              (say 20 years in a cave). Further, students may think they are sitting 
              with someone who is merely reciting the dogma, when even cursory 
              examination of the dogma says that one should seek out a qualified 
              teacher (i.e. an enlightened teacher) if at all possible. All of those 
              are clearly absurd and disempowering to students who are then likely to 
              underestimate their own potential to tap into their inherent wisdom.</li>
              <li>Claiming enlightenment by hints or explicitly (perhaps stating level of attainment as well). Downsides include:
              <ol type="a">
              <li>Possibly being wrong about enlightenment or level of attainment: a 
              common mistake, particularly for those who have crossed the Arising and 
              Passing Away or entered into the formless realms. Also, those in the 
              in-between paths, particularly anagmis, can be easily fooled into 
              thinking they are arahats. Those using other models (Tibetan Five Path, 
              Bodhisattva Bhumis, Trees of Life, Rungs of the Ladders of Love, etc.) 
              face similar issues. People are then stuck in either apologizing and 
              facing all the badness that comes from that or getting stuck in the role
               when they are not up to it.</li>
              <li>Having to face all the projection, etc. noted above. This can be 
              particularly bad if they have some other job, particularly one that 
              involves non-dharma people, such as a professional job (e.g. the lawyer,
               doctor, psychologist, accountant, architect, etc. who works in a normal
               worldly capacity also claims enlightenment is blatantly asking for 
              badness, ridicule, etc.).</li>
              <li>Having to either:
              <ol type="i">
              <li>expose people to the inevitable conflict between the realities of 
              human enlightenment and both the standard craziness of the old texts on 
              what emotions enlightenment eliminates as well as modern people's 
              projections and absurd ideals about what enlightened beings must 
              be/feel/say/do/perceive, or</li>
              <li>put on some fantastic saintly front
               to play to these bizarre ideals and face the burden, danger and trap of
               the massive shadow-side that inevitably follows.</li>
              </ol> </li>
              </ol> </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Benefits include (assuming one didn't blow it and claim enlightenment when not actually enlightened):</p>
              <ol type="a">
              <li>Conveying the accurate and very empowering sense that these things 
              are done today, by regular imperfect people, with available techniques 
              and not absurd amounts of retreat/practice time, and thus that they 
              could do this also.</li>
              <li>Granting the (hopefully) appropriate level authority to one's guidance and thus increasing the confidence of one's students.</li>
              <li>Not having to break the precept against lying by playing the 
              exceedingly neurotic "I didn't actually maybe do this sort of, hint, 
              hint, wink, wink" game.</li>
              <li>Following the example of countless enlightened beings before.</li>
              <li>Creating the continued sense of lineage and direct transmission of living dharma that is relevant to today.</li>
              <li>Normalizing and shining the clear light of reality on something that
               desperately needs normalizing and bringing back down to Earth.</li>
              <li>The feeling of accomplishment that comes when one begins to bravely 
              face the projections, stand up against the absurd emotion-denying dogma,
               and says that enlightenment is actually about understanding honestly 
              the full real-world implications of this human birth.</li>
              <li>Getting the understandably rewarding recognition for an 
              accomplishment that is truly worthy of praise, recognition, and, 
              perhaps, dare I say it, celebration.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><br> It needs to be the acknowledgment that throughout the ages psychopaths 
              and cons have routinely claimed enlightenment when they weren't for all 
              sorts of basically evil and deluded reasons, and massive badness, theft,
               exploitation, and death has resulted from this, but that does not 
              contradict the points I mention above at all. It does, however, require 
              careful vigilance, as well as holding those who claim enlightenment to 
              the exact same basic and perennial moral codes that everyone should be 
              held to. I refer you to the excellent book by William (Bill) Hamilton 
              called <em>Saints and Psychopaths</em> for more useful discussion of 
              this and the above topics. I agree wholeheartedly with the advice given 
              in the answer to the question about watching people for long periods of 
              time before making up one's mind and the cautions about watching one's 
              own delusions and defilements.
              <br><br> A few more thoughts:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>If the teacher who claims enlightenment is basically into their own 
              enlightenment, this usually is pretty obvious. This will tend to attract
               the most religious and least empowered practitioners who are looking 
              for the guru/daddy/mommy/divine presence and usually repulses everyone 
              else as they realize that these people are being treated like foolish 
              children.</li>
              <li>If the teacher makes hints of enlightenment (by being an abbot of 
              some monastery, teaching but not answering the question), this will tend
               to attract people who are not quite so devotionally religious, but 
              still rather into the hierarchy, religion, worship, scene, and sort of 
              into the practice, though starting to grow up, but usually don't really 
              expect to get far and probably still have some unrealistic expectations 
              and disempowering projections about the whole enlightenment thing. It 
              will also tend to disappoint realists and serious practitioners who, 
              instead, like things being clear, open, down-to-earth and balanced, as 
              they don't like being treated as if the dharma is PG-13 and can only be 
              discussed as it actually is between adults (monks/gurus/senior teacher 
              list/etc.).</li>
              <li>If the teacher says, "Hey, I'm just some ordinary person who with 
              good technique and good effort realized exactly the same thing you 
              yourself can realize by the same or similar methods, and this is how it 
              is done so that you can do it," that tends to have a very different 
              feel, is certainly not inappropriate. It will tend to attract pragmatic 
              and real-world practitioners who are just into going for it without any 
              concern for the rest of the trappings, mystery, aura, i.e. practitioners
               who like being treated like the capable adults they are. It will also 
              disturb the those like adolescents who prefer the cushion of the second 
              way that allows them to dip their toes in the water without having to 
              learn to swim and scare off those like children who really just want a 
              guru to tell them how to live and magically save them. The texts have 
              plenty of examples of even complete morons who through enough good 
              practice got all kinds of enlightened, and I still prefer this view and 
              model to the others as it seems the most healthy and sane, but to each 
              his own.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In short, the basic sentiment, which I have heard oft repeated and 
              appears on that fine site, that those who claim enlightenment can't be, 
              is patently absurd and clearly not in keeping with any of the Buddhist 
              traditions I know of, not substantiated by the texts, not part of the 
              practices of the lineages we all respect, not part of the legends, and 
              not what happens today, as well as being one more thing that gets in the
               way of those who are brave enough to face all the difficulties that 
              come from saying one is enlightened and teaching from that place.
              <br><br> Again, I hope that people develop into the spiritual adults they are 
              capable of being and that conversations around awakening become freed 
              from foolish taboos. These are my thoughts as they come to me this 
              afternoon. I hope you have found them useful.
