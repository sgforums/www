              <h2>The Hardcore Dharma Movement</h2>
              <p class="post-info">July 16, 2010 by <a title="Posts by wanderingdhamma" href="http://wanderingdhamma.wordpress.com/author/wanderingdhamma/">wanderingdhamma</a></p>
              </div>
              <p>One of the most interesting new trends
               in Western Buddhism is a reaction against more ‘soft’ and ‘self-help’ 
              type dharma books. Some contemporary Buddhist authors are now calling 
              themselves hardcore as an opposition to this earlier work. The most 
              outspoken and prolific of the hardcore teachers is Daniel Ingram who 
              wrote <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Core-Teachings-Buddha%20Unusually/dp/1904658407/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1250665249&amp;sr=1-1">Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha: An 
              Unusually Hardcore Dharma Book</a></em>. Kenneth Folk is another teacher
               of a similar generation as Daniel Ingram who, through his website and 
              podcasts on Buddhist Geeks, carries the hardcore meditation practice 
              message. And now this movement has a <a href="http://www.vincenthorn.com/2010/05/01/new-site-new-look-new-focus-2/">second generation</a> as Vince Horn, founder of the 
              Buddhist Geeks, calls himself the first lineage holder of both of these 
              teachers. The changes these dharma teachers are making are very 
              interesting and revealing about the state of Buddhist practice in 
              Western countries.</p>
              <p>So what is it that is hardcore about these teachers’ ideas and 
              teachings? What are they opposing themselves to? A description of this 
              movement is found in <a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/05/bg-119-the-dharma-overground/">Daniel Ingram’s biography</a> on the Buddhist Geeks 
              Website where he states that he is part of:<strong></strong></p>
              <p>“the global movement of meditation reform, a movement that seeks to 
              preserve core meditation technology and supports, integrate helpful 
              aspects from across traditions, refine the techniques and maps through 
              exploration and verification, and spread the message that it can be 
              done. It is also a movement to strip away the aspects of dogma, ritual, 
              rigid hierarchy, myth and falsehood that hinder high-level practice and 
              keep the culture of meditation mired in unhelpful taboos and misplaced 
              effort.”<strong></strong></p>
              <p>Kenneth Folk and Daniel Ingram are<strong> </strong>interested in 
              teaching about the higher-level meditation practices and are defying the
               taboo against declaring one’s attainments. They have both stated that 
              they are arahants and talk about their experiences attaining the four 
              paths of Enlightenment openly, hoping that others will come to see that 
              attaining this state is possible. In one of his Buddhist Geek Podcast 
              interviews Folk narrates in detail the moments when he attained first 
              through fourth path of Enlightenment. Kenneth Folk  in his interview on 
              Buddhist Geeks Podcast called ‘<a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2010/01/bg-156-ordinary-people-can-get-enlightened/">Ordinary People Can Get Enlightened’</a> stated this 
              outright:</p>
              <p>“What I really want to say here is that it’s possible to get 
              enlightened. And I know that, because it happened to me… So I’m hoping 
              that by telling the story, other people understand that regular, average
               people who aren’t wearing robes, and aren’t even Asian. Or whether 
              they’re Asian or not. It is possible for ordinary people to get 
              enlightened.”</p>
              <p>One of the chapters of Ingram’s <em>Mastering the Core Teachings</em>,
               is called ‘It Is Possible!’ in order to point out that even though many
               think the end of the path is mythical and unattainable, people do 
              attain these states today. He contrasts the openness in talking about 
              the paths of Enlightenment in Burma with the paradigm you would most 
              likely find in a Western Buddhist. “First, most Western Buddhists don’t 
              really believe that after a few months of good practice you could get 
              enlightened or more enlightened. They do not believe it is simply a 
              matter of following simple instructions, moving through the clearly 
              defined insights” (<em>Mastering the Core Teachings, </em>337).</p>
              <p>Hardcore teachers, along with revealing their own meditation 
              experiences, critique what they consider typical Western Buddhism. They 
              are reacting against teachings that have more in common with therapy 
              than vipassana, are concerned with self-help and calmness rather than 
              the sometimes destabilizing cycles of insight. They hope that through 
              their writings and teachings, some Western Buddhists can adopt “a more 
              empowering view of what is possible on the spiritual path” (viii).</p>
              <p>Ingram in his book considers himself and others from the same lineage
               “to be dharma cowboys, mavericks, rogues, and outsiders” (ix). Although
               he considers himself a traditionalist who tries to get to the depths of
               the Buddha’s teachings, he finds that this kind of practice contrasts 
              with much of Western Buddhist meditation cultures. The mainstream 
              cultures, from the Hardcore dharma perspective, have been designed by 
              certain teachers “who want everyone to be able to feel good that they 
              are doing something ‘spiritual’” (95). But Ingram argues that this kind 
              of teaching is not very helpful. As a solution to this, his book 
              provides an invitation “to step far beyond the increasingly ritualized, 
              bastardized, and gutless mock-up of Buddhism that is rearing its fluffy 
              head in the modern West and has a stranglehold on many a practice group 
              and even some of the big meditation centers” (95).</p>
              <p>Ingram also says Western Buddhism is watered-down. He writes that 
              there is a movement to make Buddhism into something for everyone (94). 
              Ingram labels Buddhism in the West the “least goal-oriented, least 
              practical and least effective take on Buddhism I have found anywhere” 
              (117). In contrast to this way of teaching, Ingram characterizes one of 
              his teachers, Bill Hamilton, as a guy who was “too smart, too 
              uncompromising, too scholarly and too dedicated to non-watered-down 
              dharma and to absolute mastery to be a popular mainstream teacher. He 
              didn’t teach to make people feel good about themselves . . .” (219). 
              Because of this watered-down approach Ingram finds that in Western 
              Buddhist meditation circles people are not discussing their attempts to 
              understand and master the teachings or meditation techniques, but rather
               their own psychological problems. He writes:</p>
              <p>“I just wish the whole Western Buddhist World would just get over 
              this notion that these practices are all about getting to our Happy 
              Place where nothing can ever hurt us or make us neurotic and move on to 
              actually mastering real Buddhist practice rather than chasing some ideal
               that will never appear” (297).</p>
              <p>Ingram and Folk call the cultural factors that led to the state of 
              Buddhism in the West “the Mushroom Factor” because as mushrooms are fed 
              and kept in the dark, meditation teachers are using the mushroom method 
              of teaching and raising a crop of mushroom meditators. Ingram finds that
               “there is this cultural factor in Western Buddhism that real insight, 
              insight into the fundamental nature of reality or the Three 
              Characteristics, is almost never talked about directly, unlike in Burma 
              or some other settings” (102).</p>
              <p>Some may wonder whom in particular Ingram is admonishing here. In 
              fact he has great respect for many of the popular American meditation 
              teachers, such as Jack Kornfield, but believes that their presentation 
              of the teaching is written in a way that perpetuates the Mushroom 
              Factor. He praises Kornfield’s <em>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Path-Heart-Through-Promises-Spiritual/dp/0553372114/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279237713&amp;sr=8-1">Path With Heart</a></em> saying it contains many 
              brilliant statements that should confound the reader and hit at their 
              core sense of identity but “as they have been written in a style that is
               so completely accessible, these statements have nearly the opposite 
              effect, creating a mushy comfort in the reader with statements that 
              should have stopped them in their proverbial tracks and provoked deep 
              inquiry” (89). Because of this, Ingram felt the need for a hardcore book
               about practice, such as his own. </p>
              <p>Daniel Ingram also discusses the taboo of discussing attainments in 
              Western Buddhist culture in a Buddhist Geeks podcast called “<a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/05/bg-119-the-dharma-overground/">The Dharma Overground</a>:” “You know, there’s this 
              sort of a huge taboo, you can’t say you’ve attained to a jhana, and you 
              can’t say you’ve attained to a nana, and you sure as heck can’t say 
              you’ve attained to a path. And telling people you’re an anagami or an 
              arhant would really be crazy.” Because of this situation, he started the
               Dharma Overground website where high-level practitioners could start to
               get comfortable with talking about attainments. The <a href="http://www.dharmaoverground.org/web/guest/dharma-wiki/-/wiki/Main/Daniel+Ingram?p_r_p_185834411_title=Daniel+Ingram">purpose of this website </a>is to “form a safe haven 
              for people who were into hardcore practice, real attainments, helping 
              people out in the spirit of mutual friends, open conversations about 
              topics related to actual practice, and the like.”</p>
              <p>This website reveals in detail the maps on the path to Enlightenment 
              in order to balance out the mushroom culture. Ingram offers information 
              on how to know where one is on the path along with his own experiences 
              to help others understand what they are or will be going through. The 
              website’s <a href="http://www.dharmaoverground.org/web/guest;jsessionid=103049DDDB7516EF6A013AB9C9AA2A72">basic principles</a> are: “a lack of taboos surrounding
               talking about attainments, the assumption that the various aspects of 
              meditative development can be mastered in this life.” And these are also
               the basic principles of the hardcore dharma movement, a very 
              interesting new development in the history of Buddhism in the West.</p>
              <p>What does this mean for the future of Buddhism in the West? The 
              hardcore teachers are picking up on the emerging characteristics of 
              Western Buddhist meditation practices, and are opposing themselves to 
              it. It thus shows a growing diversity of practice and options for 
              Buddhists in the West. But how impactful will this new movement be? As 
              Ingram’s website grows and the hardcore supporters increase, will other 
              teachers follow the same path? Will there be a paradigm shift in how 
              Westerners think about meditation and interact with the core teachings 
              of the Buddha?</p>

              <p>Hmm... if they claim they are arahats/buddhas/bodhisattvas, there must be something not right. <br><br>And considering Ingram says this on his website:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, tahoma, sans-serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 13px; color: #233b50;">Here are a number of bogus myths and falsehoods about arahats, each of which violates one of more of the First Principles in addition to simply being untrue:</span></p><ol>
              <li style="margin-top: 9px;">Arahats cannot lie.</li>
              <li style="margin-top: 9px;">Arahats cannot have erections or have sex.</li>
              <li style="margin-top: 9px;">Arahats would never do drugs or drink.</li>
              <li style="margin-top: 9px;">Arahats cannot kill anything ever.</li>
              <li style="margin-top: 9px;">Arahats cannot state they are arahats.</li>
              <li style="margin-top: 9px;">Arahats must ordain within 7 days of becomming an arahat in the Buddhist order of monks or they will die.</li>
              <li style="margin-top: 9px;">Arahats cannot think the thought "I am an arahat."</li>
              <li style="margin-top: 9px;">Arahats cannot feel the following emotions: lust, hatred, irritation, restlessness, worry, fear, pride, conceit, desire for the formless realms, desire for the formed realms, or any other "bad" emotion.</li>
              </ol>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; font-size: 16px;">Then anyone here can claim they are arahats as well and nobody would have to observe precepts.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><br></span></span></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; font-size: 16px;">The reason why enlightened people don't claim themselves enlightened (or after claiming, still continue to stay on earth) is because, if they start to allow this, tons of people hankering after wealth, fame and desires, as well as dharma-wrecking demons will be out, shamelessly proclaiming they have reach fruition or is a certain Buddha or Bodhisattva, and mislead lots of people. Nobody will be able to differentiate between the true and false anymore, and in no time, the Dharma would be destroyed.</span></div>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>You do have a point there. In fact, I do have my own views about Daniel's claim of arhatship, but I shall reserve them for myself.</p>
              <p>As Thusness said before (not in exact words), Daniel has some very precious and deep insights that are truly profound - not very common around. He is a true and sincere practitioner that will serve as a good guide for others. So Thusness basically told people to disregard the claims and just go for the wisdom.</p>
              <p>Besides, Daniel M. Ingram seems to be entering new territories these days and very engaged at the moment in a practice called 'Actualism'. Gasp, an 'arhat' who is still progressing on the path! He seems to be discovering a new type of experience (called PCE, Pure Consciousness Experience), which is utterly without any sense of self, in which emotions do not arise. Does this contradict his earlier claims? Will he somehow intergrate this experience into his map of enlightenment? Who knows.</p>
              <p>I already wrote a (currently updated to 20 pages long) article about this experience (and how it relates to Buddhism) to him at

              <p>Precepts are important and I don't think Daniel M. Ingram are opposed to precepts. He does dedicate a chapter of his book to morality, even though his book is about meditation. Anyway, he is a qualified lineage teacher from the Mahasi Sayadaw Vipassana lineage, a lineage where Sakadagami (2nd out of 4 stages) stage of enlightenment is a minimum criteria for teaching.</p>
              <p>However I also want to make it clear that I do not think at this point that Daniel M. Ingram has achieved arhatship.</p>
              <p>As I said, he is beginning (only in recent weeks/months) to enter into a new territory where emotions (and thereby the faults in keeping precepts) do not arise. My understanding is that his view of what Arhatship entails will change in the future to become more in lined with the classical texts and stance.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, he is highly qualified to teach Vipassana and already has achieved some substantial insights into the nature of reality. Hardly do you find teachers who are so open about high level practice and I like his style.</p>

              <div class="Normal" style="padding: 4px;">
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="padding-top: 0pt; color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    The original 
              Pali word for this training is sila, which I am translating as 
              “morality.” People translate it in various ways, with some other 
              possibilities being “virtue” and “decency.” Regardless of the word we 
              choose, it is likely to have both positive and negative implications. If
               the word “morality” bothers you due to the associations that it brings 
              to mind, take a look at the assumptions, agendas, and practices of this 
              training and come up with your own word for it. I don’t think that it is
               so important what we call it. I do, however, think that we should give 
              some attention to trying to live it.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    From my point of view, training 
              in morality has as its domain all of the ordinary ways that we live in 
              the world. When we are trying to live the good life in a conventional 
              sense, we are working on training in morality. When we are trying to 
              work on our emotional, psychological and physical health, we are working
               at the level of training in morality. When we philosophize, we are 
              working on training in morality. When we exercise, we are working on 
              training in morality. When we try to take care of ourselves or others, 
              we are working on training in morality. When we try to defend the 
              environment, reform the government, or make this world a better place, 
              we are working on training in morality. When we try to find a good and 
              helpful job, try to build a healthy marriage or raise healthy children, 
              or shave our heads and move to a remote desert, we are working on 
              training in morality. Whatever we do in the ordinary world that we think
               will be of some benefit to others or ourselves is an aspect of working 
              on this first training.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    The second two trainings, those 
              having to do with attaining unusual states of mind and those having to 
              do with ultimate realizations, have limits, in that we can master them 
              absolutely. However, this cannot be said of the first training. There is
               no limit to the degree of skill that can be brought to how we live in 
              the world. Thus, morality is also the last training, the training that 
              we will have to work on for all of our life. We may be able to attain to
               astounding states of consciousness and understand the true nature of 
              reality, but what people see and what is causal are the ways that these 
              abilities and understandings translate into how we live in the world.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    There are basic assumptions that
               are extremely helpful when undertaking training in morality. It is very
               helpful to assume that some sort of basic moral code is helpful for 
              getting along in this world, and thus that there is some practical 
              benefit to be derived from training in morality.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    It is also helpful to assume in 
              some loose and non-dogmatic way that the more good we do in the world, 
              the more good there will be in that world, and thus the more good things
               will happen to us and all other beings. It is also worth assuming the 
              corollary of this, that the more we do bad things in the world, the more
               bad things will be in that world for us and for all beings. These 
              assumptions are not unique to Buddhism nor are they in any way 
              extraordinary. Societies and traditions throughout the ages have 
              advocated that we find a place in our life for these assumptions. 
              Realize that defining bad and good is often very much a question of 
              perspective, but don’t fall into the paralyzing trap of imagining that 
              it is useless to try anyway. It is better to try to do your best and 
              fail than not try at all.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    Thus, we are assuming that what 
              we think, say and do have consequences. When undertaking training in 
              morality, we are assuming that we can control what we think, say and do,
               thus creating consequences that are beneficial. Rather than accepting 
              our current level of intellectual, emotional and psychological 
              development as being beyond our power to change, we consciously and 
              explicitly take the empowering view that we can work with these aspects 
              of our lives and change them for the better. We assume that we can 
              change our world and our attitudes towards our world. We take 
              responsibility for our actions and their consequences.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    Further, as a part of our 
              empowerment, we assume that the more of our resources and abilities we 
              bring to this training, the likelier we will be to succeed. We have a 
              body, we have reason, we have our intuition, we have our heart, and we 
              have ability to learn and remember. We have a community of others with 
              wisdom to share, we have books and other media that contain advice for 
              living the good life, and we have our friends and family. We can draw on
               all of this and more to try to live a good life, a life where our 
              thoughts, words and deeds reflect as closely as possible the standards 
              we have consciously adopted and defined for ourselves. The more 
              consciously engaged we are with our task, the more we are likely to be 
              successful.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    Crucial to the control of what 
              happens in our lives is our intent. Thus, training in morality places a 
              lot of emphasis on intent, with the basic assumption being that the more
               our intentions are kind and compassionate, the more we are likely to be
               able to manifest kind and compassionate thoughts, words and deeds.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    Further, it is helpful to assume
               that training in morality requires us to pay attention to what is 
              happening in our lives. When we are not paying attention to what we are 
              thinking, saying and doing, we will not easily be able to craft these in
               a way that fits with the assumptions of this training. If we are not 
              paying attention to what the consequences of our thoughts, words and 
              deeds are, both in the short term and the long term, we are unlikely to 
              be able to gain enough experience to be able to guide our training in 
              morality successfully.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    It is also helpful to assume 
              that training in morality will help us when we get to formal meditation 
              practices (the next two trainings in concentration and wisdom), 
              providing a foundation of good mental and physical habits that can 
              support those practices. Thus, even if we have little interest in being 
              moral because of the benefits it can bring, if we are interested in 
              obtaining the results of the other two trainings, we should also engage 
              in training in morality.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    These assumptions naturally lead
               to the specific agendas we have for what happens when undertaking 
              training in morality. We consciously aspire to have the actions of our 
              body, speech and mind live in a way that fits with the assumptions of 
              this training. In short, we have standards for our mental, emotional and
               physical lives and we try our best to live up to those standards. When 
              we are working on training in morality, we consciously cultivate 
              actions, words and thoughts that we deem to be kind and compassionate. 
              By “kind,” I mean that we work to promote the happiness and welfare of 
              ourselves and others. By “compassionate,” I mean that we work to relieve
               the suffering of ourselves and others. Thus, our agenda is for our 
              intentions to be kind and compassionate, for our minds to be aware of 
              what we are thinking, saying, and doing, and for our experience to tell 
              us as best it can how to craft our life to reflect our intentions.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    Training in morality tends to be
               discussed in terms of what one shouldn’t do and also what one should 
              do. The standard Buddhist short-list of the five things that one should 
              try to avoid, called “The Five Precepts” are: killing, stealing, lying, 
              taking mind altering substances that lead to heedlessness, and using 
              sexual energy in ways that are harmful. These are obviously not unique 
              to Buddhism, and seem to be part of the basic set of standards for 
              behavior that societies and cultures throughout the ages have found to 
              be helpful and practical. The standard list of things that one should 
              try to do includes being kind, compassionate and appreciative of the 
              successes of others.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    Wrestling with the question of 
              how we can meet this fairly reasonable standard and yet honor where we 
              are and what is going on around us is the practice of this first 
              training. We will make all kinds of mistakes that can be very 
              educational when trying to work on this first training; if you mess up, 
              remember to be kind to yourself!</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    There are many great techniques 
              for cultivating a more decent way of being in the world, but there are 
              no magic formulations. You must figure out how to be kind to yourself 
              and all beings in each moment. As training in morality takes into 
              account all of the ordinary ways in which we try to live a good and 
              useful life, it is so vast a subject that I couldn’t possibly give 
              anything resembling a comprehensive treatment of it here. However, if 
              you wish for further elaboration on some of the basics of training in 
              morality, I suggest that you check out some of the following works:</div>

              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    Training in morality at its best
               is grounded in a theoretical or direct appreciation of one more 
              assumption, that of interconnectedness. Interconnectedness at this level
               means an appreciation of the fact that we are all in this together and 
              that we all share the wish to be happy. When we take into consideration 
              our own needs and the needs of those around us, we are more likely to be
               naturally kind and considerate of ourselves and others. Thus, we try to
               make it a habit to try to take into account the feelings, opinions and 
              welfare of those around us. The obvious trap here is to simultaneously 
              fail to take into account our own needs. Work on balancing both in a way
               that is sustainable and healthy.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    There are countless other 
              pitfalls we can run into when training in morality, as it is such a vast
               area of work. I will spend a lot of time in Part II detailing some of 
              the more common side effects and shadow sides of training in morality, 
              but realize that it is an endless subject.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    However, one pitfall that must 
              be addressed here, as it is so common, is that of guilt. We have grown 
              up in a culture in which we can be extremely hard on ourselves, causing 
              ourselves astounding amounts of pain to little good effect. If we can 
              learn to substitute wise remorse, a remorse that simply says, “Well, 
              that didn’t work, and this is unfortunate. I should try my best to 
              figure out why and hopefully do something better next time,” we will be 
              much more able to train successfully in living a good and useful life.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    Some people unfortunately seem 
              to think that the primary message of training in morality is that they 
              should continuously cultivate the feeling that they have taken up a 
              heavy yoke of responsibility and self-oppression. In fact, some people 
              seem to revel in that unfortunate feeling. Those more fortunate will 
              think, “It is so much fun to try to live a good, healthy and useful 
              life! What a joy it is to find creative ways to do this!” There are few 
              things more helpful on the spiritual path and life in general than a 
              positive attitude.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    Thus, the related and all too 
              common pitfall is that people stop having fun and trying to be 
              successful in worldly terms. There is absolutely no reason for this. If 
              you can have fun in healthy ways, have fun! It’s not just for breakfast 
              anymore. Also, success is highly recommended for obvious reasons. Pick a
               flexible vision of success in the ordinary sense for yourself and go 
              for it! Play to win. This is your life, so make it a great one. There is
               no reason not to try, so long as you can do so in a kind and 
              compassionate way.</div>
              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;">    One more great thing about the 
              first training is that it really helps with the next training: 
              concentration. So, here's a tip: if you are finding it hard to 
              concentrate because your mind is filled with guilt, judgment, envy or 
              some other hard and difficult thought pattern, also work on the first 
              training, kindness. It will be time well spent.</div>

              <p>I think the notion that Arhant do not need to eat is bullshit, unless he is in a meditative retreat and is cultivating samadhi all day then that is possible. It must be understood in context.</p>
              <p>All the Arhants received alms... even the Buddha needed to eat and still get sick etc (due to his karma of having participated in killing fishes in a past life, and so on) and needed medicine, much less an Arhant.</p>
              <p>Lastly, there are many cases in the suttas where people wrongly stated their attainments, but was later corrected by the Buddha, and the Buddha did not say anything like they will go to hell.</p>
              <p><strong>According to scriptures, you only land in hell if you ARE aware that you are not an arhant, and then pose as one. This does not apply to someone who is genuinely UNaware that he is not an arhant, and claims to be, due to his own misunderstandings. Daniel Ingram has his own model and idea of what Arhantship is and he certainly and truthfully fits into it (particularly the Non Dual model of awakening) - but whether his map and model is the same as the Buddha's is another highly debatable matter, and I highly suspect his views will change over time. <br></strong></p>
              <p>In the case of Daniel M. Ingram, he has clearly attained to the paths (even if he is not Arhant, he has definitely already attained to Sotapanna, Sakadagami, etc...) His attainment is confirmed both by lineage, teachers, and the classical texts and commentaries. A sotapanna is known not to ever fall into the 3 lower realms again.</p>
              <p>Perhaps if you are not even sotapanna yet and claim you are arhant (and intentionally did so even though you knew you werent), then you may fall into lower realms. But for a sotapanna (and above), no chances there.</p>
              <p>As for 'visiting other realms', that is just one of the side effects of practice and I don't think any true teacher will focus so much on supernatural powers. But it is true that Daniel M. Ingram has experiences with psychic abilities, remember past lives, moving objects, etc etc (he used to mention that, but he does not focus on this - his focus is on Vipassana or insight meditation).</p>
              <p>Btw, it's not true that an Arhant must have mastery of powers. Only Arhants that mastered samatha jhanas have powers. You do not have to master samatha jhanas to attain arhatship: there is a category of arhat called 'dry vipassana/insight' arhats, and these arhats don't develope samatha jhanas and powers. However, Daniel M. Ingram is experienced with samatha jhanas and has some experience with the psychic realms, but he didn't have to.</p>

There is no need for publicity.<br><br>No matter how lofty the teachings seem to be, personally I can never listen to someone who claim they are arahats or bodhisattvas or buddhas - unless they pass away right after they hinted so.

              <p>I have never in my life heard of a lying sotapana, skadagami,
                  anagami, or arahat who claims a fruition that they have not
                  reached. And even if anyone really has attained the above
                  fruitions, why would they need to declare it? What good does it
                  does to tell everyone "I am an Arahat or whatever"? Isn't it enough
                  that they know it for themselves? There is no need for
                  publicity.<br> <br> No matter how lofty the teachings seem to be, personally I can
                  never listen to someone who claim they are arahats or bodhisattvas
                  or buddhas - unless they pass away right after they hinted so.
                  Shakyamuni Buddha said very clearly in the Shurangama Sutra - the
                  chapter on the four clear instructions on purity, and the chapter
                  on the 50 Demonic states about these kind of people in the

              <p>Like I said, Daniel M. Ingram has *never* lied about his meditative experience and fruitions. It is very very evident if you are practicing to see the truth in what he said.</p>
              <p>It is only that his subjective interpretations of his experiences (which he never lied at all) as being 'arhantship' is another separate issue that he should personally deal with.</p>

              <p>BTW, here is his own suscribed model of awakening so that you have an idea where he is coming from. His model is similar (not exactly similar in terms of the explanation of stages, but in terms of 'theme') to Thusness's <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's
                   Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a> in that they both focus on the Insights and Realization of the true nature of reality. (much like Zen's 5 ranks of Tozan, 10 oxherding pictures, Tibetan 4 yogas, etc.) Except of course Thusness does not use traditional terms like 'arhant' etc, he simply stated his experience as-it-is without interpreting it with traditional terms like 'arhantship' (which is often subject to controversy and debate).</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Here is my revised version of the Four Path Model, and this 
                  is the primary model I use when describing awakening, talking about my 
                  practice, and helping others practice. I think that using the original 
                  terminology and revising its definitions allows a lot of good material 
                  in the Pali Canon to be used, thus provides a link to previously done 
                  work. However, I realize that using terminology that already has such 
                  deep cultural and dogmatic resonance may be a problem. For those who 
                  want something new, I will shortly present a rephrasing of this model 
                  that I call the Simple Model.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> In the Revised Four Path Model, Stream 
                  Enterers have discovered the complete discontinuity that is called 
                  Fruition and sometimes called Nirvana or Nibbana (Sanskrit vs. Pali). 
                  This is the first of two meanings of Nirvana, with the other being 
                  Fourth Path. Stream enterers cycle through the ñanas, know that 
                  awakening or some different understanding from the norm is possible, and
                   yet they do not have all that different an experience of most 
                  sensations from those who are not yet stream enterers. They may 
                  correctly extrapolate a lot of good dharma insights from momentary 
                  experiences, particularly high up in High Equanimity and the three 
                  moments before a Fruition, but this is not the same as living there all 
                  the time. In fact, most stream enterers have a very hard time describing
                   how things have changed in terms of their daily life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Those of Second Path have now 
                  completed a new insight cycle. They understand the process by which 
                  enlightened beings make further progress and equate progress with 
                  further cycles of insight, which is partially true. More model-obsessed 
                  or intellectual practitioners at second path may get very into fractal 
                  models, consciousness models, enlightenment models, various integrative 
                  theories, and that sort of thing at this stage of practice. 
                  Psychological issues tend to be a bit more of a big deal during this 
                  phase, and psychological development become interesting to them in some 
                  way. By this point most people, though certainly not everyone, also have
                   a pretty good understanding of the basics of the samatha jhanas, and 
                  these can be very fascinating. What they may be most bothered by is that
                   cycle after cycle of practice, duality remains the predominant 
                  experience most of the time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Those of Third Path have shifted their understanding of what 
                  progress is from those of Second Path, and have been to see that it is 
                  about seeing the emptiness, selflessness, impermanence, etc. of 
                  sensations in daily life and begin to see that they have the ability to 
                  do this. This can be a long, developmental process from the first time 
                  they notice this to it becoming a nearly complete experience. Thus, 
                  Third Path tends to be a long path, though it doesn’t have to be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> At the beginning of Third Path, 
                  most practitioners think: “I’ll just complete more cycles of insight, 
                  like I did before, and this will do the trick.” They don’t tend to 
                  understand what it is they have attained all that well yet, nor its 
                  deeper implications. By the mature stage of Third Path, which can take 
                  months to years to show up, the practitioner is more and more able to 
                  see the emptiness, selfless, centerlessness, luminosity, etc. of 
                  phenomena in real-time, so much so that it can be very difficult to 
                  notice what artificial dualities remain. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> As they cycle, they will enter new 
                  territory, possibly causing some uncertainty or instability, and with 
                  each Review phase they tend to really feel that they have done it until 
                  they begin to notice the limits of their practice. There can be this 
                  nagging something in the background that things aren’t done, and yet 
                  figuring out exactly what the problem is can be very slippery. It is a 
                  bit like being in the stages before stream entry, trying to figure out 
                  what exactly needs to be done. They need to notice something that has 
                  nothing to do with the cycles, to finally untangle the knot of 
                  perception at its core, but doing this can be a real trick. It is a very
                   strange place, as one seems to know the dharma all the way to the end 
                  and yet somehow it just isn’t quite enough. In that vein, it is 
                  interesting to note that I wrote the vast majority of this book while I 
                  was some sort of anagami, and on reflection I got just about everything 
                  right. My emphases are slightly different now, but the basics are all 
                  the same.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> As things progress, anagamis begin to tire of the cycles to a
                   small or large degree and begin to look to something outside of them or
                   not related to them for the answer to the final question. Finally, the 
                  cycles of insight, the states of concentration, the powers, and all the 
                  other perks and prerogatives of their stage of awakening or 
                  concentration abilities (if they developed them) hold no appeal and only
                   lead to more unsatisfying cycles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> I completed around 27 full, complete 
                  insight cycles with mind-blowing A&amp;P Events, Ass-kicking Dark 
                  Nights, Equanimity phases, and what seemed to be brand new, fresh 
                  Fruitions and Review phases between third and fourth path. There is 
                  nothing special about that number, as I mentioned previously in my 
                  descriptions of the problem that I call Twelfth Path. The later cycles 
                  got faster and faster, so that by the end it seemed I was whipping one 
                  out every few weeks or even every few days, but they still seemed to be 
                  leading nowhere. It was only when I had gotten so sick of the cycles and
                   realized that they were leading nowhere that I was able to see what has
                   nothing to do with the cycles, which also wasn’t anything except a 
                  strange untangling of the knot of perception of them. The cycles, for 
                  better or worse, have continued just the same. Thus, there is not much 
                  point in counting cycles or paths, as they don’t necessarily correlate 
                  well with anything past the first two or three, and issues of 
                  backsliding can really make things complex, as I explained earlier.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Finishing up my Revised Four Path 
                  Model, arahats have finally untangled the knot of perception, dissolved 
                  the sense of the center point actually being the center point, no longer
                   fundamentally make a separate Self out of the patterns of sensations 
                  that they used to, even though those same patterns of sensations 
                  continue. This is a different understanding from those of Third Path in 
                  some subtle way, and makes this path about something that is beyond the 
                  paths. This is also poetically called the opening of the Wisdom Eye. 
                  What is interesting is that I could write about this stage quite well 
                  when I was an anagami, but that is a whole different world from knowing 
                  it like arahats know it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> The Wisdom Eye may seem to blink initially. It may go through
                   cycles of flashing open just after a Fruition and then slowly fading 
                  over a few hours (at least on retreat) as each round of physical 
                  sensations, then mental sensations, then complex emotional formations, 
                  then lastly fundamental formations such as inquiry itself move through 
                  and become integrated into this new, correct and direct perception of 
                  reality as it is. Review cycles may occur many times during each flash, 
                  but when the eye is open they seem rather irrelevant in comparison to 
                  keeping the level of clarity and acceptance high enough to keep the eye 
                  open. When the eye fades, the familiar insight cycles may seem like pure
                   drudgery, with the focus being of practice initially lost in getting 
                  through the cycles and then gradually shifting again to getting clear 
                  enough to get the eye to open again. The themes that occupy center stage
                   go through a cycle that is very much like a progress cycle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Finally, the Wisdom Eye cycles and
                   insight cycles all converge, and the thing stays open from then on, 
                  which is to say that at that point it all seems the same whether or not 
                  the eye is open, which it actually was. That being seen, nothing can 
                  erode or disturb the centerlessness of perspective. Done is what is to 
                  be done, and life goes on. That there are arahats who have opened the 
                  Wisdom Eye but had it fade and those who have opened it and had it stay 
                  open is rarely mentioned but worth knowing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> For the arahat who has kept the thing 
                  open, there is nothing more to be gained on the ultimate front from 
                  insight practices, as “done is what is to be done”. That said, insight 
                  practices can still be of great benefit to them for a whole host of 
                  reasons, there is a ton they can learn just like everyone else about 
                  everything else there is to learn. They can grow, develop, change, work 
                  and participate in this strange human drama just like everyone else.</span></p>

                  Sutra Model. The Simple Model is the less mysterious, stripped down 
                  version of that earlier model, though in its essence it is basically the
                   same. While in one sense it is also rephrasing of the Revised Four Path
                   Model, as it has no numbers, and is free of the traditional names, it 
                  has some advantages over that terminology.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> I present this somewhat novel model here 
                  because it focuses on real insight directly and treats any emotional 
                  benefits of this as side effects. Further, there are often too many 
                  cycles of insight before arahatship, making the Four Path model 
                  troublesome. This phenomena of too many cycles (which I will sometimes 
                  call “paths” with a lowercase “p”) between each of the Four Paths gets 
                  worse as one works towards final awakening. As Bill Hamilton put it, and
                   I have learned the hard way, “The arahat fractal is vast.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> The Simple Model does not 
                  reinforce fascination with content, nor with life denying ideals or 
                  limited emotional range models in the way that the traditional Four Path
                   Model often does. It does not tempt one to count paths. It keeps the 
                  focus on precise inquiry into the truth and one’s experience of it or 
                  lack thereof.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> This model basically says that enlightenment is about direct 
                  insight that progressively reveals something different in the 
                  relationship to the field of experience and gradually allows things in 
                  it to be held in their proper proportion. Thus, it is a Non-Duality 
                  Model.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> The 
                  first understanding is that sensations are sensations, thoughts are 
                  thoughts, and this forms the basis of further inquiry. When the 
                  universal characteristics of these sensations begin to be seen, this 
                  represents growth in understanding. When the whole sense field is known 
                  directly and completely as it is, this can cause an entrance into 
                  Fruition through one of the Three Doors, and represents the first stage 
                  of awakening.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> When one appreciates the cycles of the process of awakening 
                  and has completed at least one more cycle, this is the next stage. When 
                  one begins to appreciate the emptiness, luminosity, centerlessness, 
                  agentlessness, etc. of phenomena in real-time and this becomes the focus
                   of practice rather than Fruition, this is the next stage. When the 
                  sense of the watcher, observer, subject, controller, doer, etc. is seen 
                  completely as it is and the knot of perception untangles, that simple, 
                  fundamental way of perceiving things is the next stage of awakening. 
                  When that untangling stays untangled, that is the next stage. When that 
                  understanding is integrated into our lives, that is the next phase, 
                  though I am not sure it can be defined as a stage rather than as a 
                  process.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> The problem is that the traditions seem to want to make this 
                  understanding into so much more than it is, such as add ideals of 
                  emotional perfection onto this. There is some truth in the models 
                  dealing with emotions, but it has to do with things moving through 
                  faster and being seen more clearly. It does not have anything to do with
                   bad emotions not arising. I hate to even go here, as my goal is to give
                   the emotional models the bashing they richly deserve, but I also want 
                  to not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Thus, here it goes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> As the deep-seated perceptual 
                  sense of a separate, continuous, permanent, observing Agent stops being 
                  extrapolated from the same old patterns of sensations that seemed to be 
                  those, there is this wider inclusive something that can come into the 
                  consciousness of the enlightened individual, depending on their level of
                   awakening. There is also a slowly growing directness of perception that
                   comes as reality is not filtered so exclusively through thought. These 
                  two can combine to give the emotions of enlightened beings less sticking
                   power, so that they may move through more quickly than for those that 
                  are not enlightened, and also may be seen more quickly and clearly as 
                  they arise and vanish. There may also be less blind contraction into 
                  thoughts and emotions and a wider perspective, thus giving the other 
                  parts of the brain more of a chance of creating moderated responses to 
                  the emotions. That said, even when seen through, there seems to be a 
                  biological component to how emotions move through that can only be 
                  expedited so much.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Anyone who thinks these highly qualified statements are 
                  anything like a vision of emotional perfection or the elimination of all
                   negative emotions is not paying attention! That is the last thing I 
                  wish to imply. I merely wish to say that there is some increased clarity
                   about our basic human experience and it can help, but that is all. That
                   said, you would be amazed how angry, lustful or ignorant enlightened 
                  beings can be, and they can still do all sorts of stupid things based on
                   these emotions, just like everyone else. The ability to moderate 
                  responses to emotions can sometimes give the impression that those 
                  emotions have been attenuated, but that is not the same thing, and there
                   is my nice transition to the Action Models.</span></p>

              <p>Yeah I saw the sutra already yesterday.</p>
              <p>There is no contradictions with Daniel's work, since he also teaches the importance of morality and precepts. He is not a monk, but he is a morally upright man with a full-time job as a physician and has a wife and there isn't any scandals or any reports of him abusing students (he doesn't have any students and only discusses online) or doing any things morally wrong unlike some other famous Buddhist teachers who are more well known and supposedly enlightened. His level of morality is on par or even higher than many great Buddhist teachers.</p>
              <p>By the way, I wonder if you are familiar with the traditional 4 paths and 10 fetters model of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>For example: a Sotapanna gained some insight and has a taste of Nirvana, but he has *not* cut off lust, anger, and so on.</p>
              <p>A once-returner also has *not* cut off lust, anger, and so on, but reduced them.</p>
              <p>A non-returner has cut off sensual lust and also anger/aversion, but not subtle attachment to jhanic states, pride, and the others of the 5 fetters.</p>
              <p>An arhant has cut off all 10 fetters.</p>
              <p>So you should understand that someone who is enlightened to varying degrees might not cut off all defilements.</p>
              <p>As my Taiwanese teacher (dharma successor of Master Shen Kai) says, even a 1st Bhumi bodhisattva still can have sex. Only 2nd Bhumi onwards are they freed from those gross defilements (that level is known as ç¦»åž¢åœ°)</p>

              <p>Hi Aen,</p>
              <p>By claiming himself to have achieved arahatship whether he has or not is not allowed.  If he hasn't reach arahatship and claims such he is lying. If he really is an arahat he won't declare he is - unless like what have been mentioned earlier, he passes on after. <br><br>If the arahat  he is refering to  is not the arahat in Buddhism, then he shouldn't use the same term as it will confuse others. In the website he recommends - dharmaoverground, you can see they even have a whole section by itself for people to claim their attainments? Why in the world would that be needed besides to satisfy ppl's self-ego and get more adherents to their teachings?<br><br>And to quote one of DI's replys in dharmaoverground forum:<br><em>"Yeah, MCTB does directly contradict much standard Buddhist dogma, but then so does reality, so whatcha gonna believe? <br><br>Here's what I recommend, which sounds so preposterous from one point of view but is actually really doable: become an arahat, or at least an anagami, and then see what holds up to reality testing and what is just junk.<br><br>Follow standard methods, get your practice trip together, go on retreats, engage with the profundity of the teachings of insight practice and their fundamental assumptions and pointings, make progress, get stream entry by following the usual advice, progress from there as directed. Then you will see and we will have much to talk about, not that we don't now, but it will be at an entirely different level and much of it wouldn't even need to happen, given that you would see for yourself, which is really the whole point of Buddhism, however sliced.<br><br>Until then, withhold judgement, and certainly don't necessarily believe me. Do your own research, confirm for yourself. This is the way. All else is just blind faith, dogma, hearsay, etc. and of little to no value, and might even be harmful if you substituted that for your own direct comprehension.<br><br>Also, sex and practice: I don't see any particular correlation between sex and progress in insight or a lack thereof. I know plenty of celibate monks and nuns without any significant insight, and a good number of relative horn-dogs who are meditative stars."<br></em><br>In the 1st sentence, he said it himself that his own book contradicts much of the Buddha's standard teachings. Well, I rather believe in the Buddha's old age doctrines than some person trying to come up with new age Buddhism with new age terms for meditative experiences. Who wouldn't get confused by all those terms? <br><br>And in the last paragraph, what he is saying same as, "you can still indulge in desires and still achieve high level insight in meditation" How are people gonna even reach skadagami level when they indulge in all these? Take heed.</p>
              <p>Meditation is about getting out of the cycle of Birth and Death, not high-level experiences. The reason why DI ganers so much attention is that he promises people a Fast way to be enlightened and no need to meditate life after life to finally reach that goal, that you don't have to care about all those rules and precepts to get that kind of meditative experiences. This is something important to take note.</p>
              <p>I think I have said enough about DI, I really don't want to discuss about this guy anymore... </p>

              <p>I will repudiate this statement first because I think it is very wrong. What Daniel teach is *NOT* a 'fast way' - it is the 'normal way' as taught by Buddha. You CAN reach liberation in this life-time, and Many have done it. In Burma monasteries, it is well known that half of those who go for 3 months long retreat actually attain to Stream entry. The success rates elsewhere might be slightly lower (it depends on technique, teacher, the practitioner etc) but it is still highly possible. Those who say that enlightenment is not possible this life is really bullshitting and teaching something that has no basis in the scriptures.</p>
              <p>Enlightened people exists more than you think there are. They exist in sanghas, they exist on the streets, they exist in online communities, including some other moderators in my forum except that they don't openly make claims of attainments like Daniel - though they are open to sharing their experiences. See for example, <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's

              <p>No, what he taught is very standard Mahasi Sayadaw teaching, backed by the classical Theravadin commentary Visudhimagga by Ven Buddhaghosa, and the scriptures and texts, etc. It has so much depth that it is nothing resembling new age, which are often lacking in depth of true experience.</p>

              <p>Of course he is not doing it for his ego.

              <p> </p>
              <p>Meditation *is* about high level realization/insights (not just experience, but Realization), and whatever Daniel wrote about his experiences and insights, is in fact in agreement with his tradition and the commentaries of Ven Buddhaghosa and all the other vipassana teachers who had gone before him. He simply discusses them in details openly. All vipassana practitioners will go through the 16 nanas, the 4 fruitions, and so on.</p>
              <p>Lastly again as I said so many times, he teaches the importance of precepts and morality.</p>
              <p>As Ven Dhammanando pointed out:</p>
              <p><em><br>To be fair, what Ingram repudiates is the Sutta teaching that 
                                                                                                          arahants are incapable of transgressing certain precepts. As far as I

                                                                                                          teachers. Which is to say, it's a bit woolly and lacking in clearcut 
                                                                                                          descriptions of what each precept entails, but nonetheless not actually

              <p> </p>
              <p>And like I said, I believe Daniel's view on this will likely change in future, in view that he is entering a new territory empty of emotions (he has not had permanent access to this yet but is aiming for it).</p>

              <p>From what you have written, Daniel Ingram is still exploring, therefore, he have not reached to the stage of Asekha, non learner yet. </p>
              <p>The attitude towards enlightentment in one  lifetime is not a matter only of perception, but also of conditions being in right.  When one fails to sense the ebb and flow of attachment, however subtle, or one's reification of one's experience,  one is probably not there yet.</p>
              <p>However, it helps for the practictioner to know that enlightenment to know attainable this very as long as it does not lead to grasping!</p>
              <p>And expectations ,just like if you go to university, you are expected to get a degree.Are you are expected to achieve Realisation upon this fact?!</p>
              <p>Or faking,in relation to that,I read in a book, that a shaman, as part of his training as supposed to receive visions. Although he did receive visions later on in his life, he faked receiving visions as it was expected of him.     </p>
              <p>Personally( for myself anyway), cessation of suffering is more important, everything else is only means to an end. Is it ok if "I", or my experiences means nothing, and is ok to no longer exist when my life is extinguished eventually. Can I let go of all?</p>

              <p>In our latest podcast with Theravada teacher Daniel Ingram he 
              breaches the taboo of enlightenment by discussing the enlightenment of 
              other teachers. Not only that but he argues for a more transparent 
              approach to enlightenment within certain teaching circles, in hopes that
               enlightenment can become more attainable. Listen and see why he thinks 
              this will help.</p>
