              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pema Chödrön WINTER 2009 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Three steps to genuine compassion</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I’ve often heard the Dalai Lama say that having compassion
              for oneself is the basis for developing compassion for others. Chögyam Trungpa
              also taught this when he spoke about how to genuinely help others—how to work
              for the benefit of others without the interference of our own agendas. He
              presented this as a three-step process. Step one is maitri, a Sanskrit word
              meaning lovingkindness toward all beings. Here, however, as Chögyam Trungpa
              used the term, it means unlimited friendliness toward ourselves, with the clear
              implication that this leads naturally to unlimited friendliness toward others.
              Maitri also has the meaning of trusting oneself—trusting that we have what it
              takes to know ourselves thoroughly and completely without feeling hopeless,
              without turning against ourselves because of what we see.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Step two in the journey toward genuinely helping others is
              communication from the heart. To the degree that we trust ourselves, we have no
              need to close down on others. They can evoke strong emotions in us, but still
              we don’t withdraw. Based on this ability to stay open, we arrive at step three,
              the difficult-to-come-by fruition: the ability to put others before ourselves
              and help them without expecting anything in return.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When we build a house, we start by creating a stable
              foundation. Just so, when we wish to benefit others, we start by developing
              warmth or friendship for ourselves. It’s common, however, for people to have a
              distorted view of this friendliness and warmth. We’ll say, for instance, that
              we need to take care of ourselves, but how many of us really know how to do
              this? When clinging to security and comfort, and warding off pain, become the
              focus of our lives, we don’t end up feeling cared for and we certainly don’t
              feel motivated to extend ourselves to others. We end up feeling more threatened
              or irritable, more unable to relax.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I’ve known many people who have spent years exercising daily,
              getting massages, doing yoga, faithfully following one food or vitamin regimen
              after another, pursuing spiritual teachers and different styles of meditation,
              all in the name of taking care of themselves. Then something bad happens to
              them, and all those years don’t seem to have added up to the inner strength and
              kindness for themselves that they need in order to relate with what’s
              happening. And they don’t add up to being able to help other people or the
              environment. When taking care of ourselves is all about me, it never gets at
              the unshakable tenderness and confidence that we’ll need when everything falls
              apart. When we start to develop maitri for ourselves— unconditional acceptance
              of ourselves—then we’re really taking care of ourselves in a way that pays off.
              We feel more at home with our own bodies and minds and more at home in the
              world. As our kindness for ourselves grows, so does our kindness for other
              people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The peace that we are looking for is not peace that crumbles
              as soon as there is difficulty or chaos. Whether we’re seeking inner peace or
              global peace or a combination of the two, the way to experience it is to build
              on the foundation of unconditional openness to all that arises. Peace isn’t an
              experience free of challenges, free of rough and smooth—it’s an experience
              that’s expansive enough to include all that arises without feeling threatened.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I sometimes wonder how I would respond in an emergency. I
              hear stories about people’s bravery emerging in crises, but I’ve also heard
              some painful stories from people who weren’t able to reach out to others in
              need because they were so afraid for themselves. We never really know which way
              it will go. So I ponder what would happen, for instance, if I were in a
              situation where there was no food but I had a bit of bread. Would I share it
              with the others who were starving? Would I keep it for myself? If I contemplate
              this question when I’m feeling the discomfort of even mild hunger, it makes the
              process more honest. The reality gets through to me that if I give away all my
              food, then the hunger I’m feeling won’t be going away. Maybe another person
              will feel better, but for sure physically I will feel worse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Sometimes the Dalai Lama suggests not eating one day a week,
              or skipping a meal, to briefly put ourselves in the shoes of those who are
              starving all over the world. In practicing this kind of solidarity myself, I
              have found that it can bring up panic and self-protectiveness. So the question
              is, what do we do with our distress? Does it open our heart or close it? When
              we’re hungry, does our discomfort increase our empathy for hungry people and
              animals, or does it increase our fear of hunger and intensify our selfishness?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With contemplations like this, we can be completely truthful
              about where we are but also aware of where we’d like to be next year or in five
              years, or where we’d like to be by the time we die. Maybe today I panic and
              can’t give away even a crumb of my bread, but I don’t have to sink into
              despair. We have the opportunity to lead our lives in such a way that year by
              year we’ll be less afraid, less threatened, and more able to spontaneously help
              others without asking ourselves, “What’s in this for me?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A fifty-year-old woman told me her story. She had been in an
              airplane crash at the age of twenty-five. She was in such a panic rushing to
              get out of the plane before it exploded that she didn’t stop to help anyone
              else, including, most painfully, a little boy who was tangled in his seat belt
              and couldn’t move. She had been a practicing Buddhist for about five years when
              the accident happened; it was shattering to her to see how she had reacted. She
              was deeply ashamed of herself, and after the crash she sank into three hard
              years of depression. But ultimately, instead of her remorse and regret causing
              her to self-destruct, these very feelings opened her heart to other people. Not
              only did she become committed to her spiritual path in order to grow in her
              ability to help others, but she also became engaged in working with people in
              crisis. Her seeming failure is making her a far more courageous and
              compassionate woman.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Right before the Buddha attained enlightenment under the
              Bodhi tree, he was tempted in every conceivable way. He was assaulted by
              objects of lust, objects of craving, objects of aggression, of fear, of all the
              variety of things that usually hook us and cause us to lose our balance. Part
              of his extraordinary accomplishment was that he stayed present, on the dot,
              without being seduced by anything that appeared. In traditional versions of the
              story, it’s said that no matter what appeared, whether it was demons or
              soldiers with weapons or alluring women, he had no reaction to it at all. I’ve
              always thought, however, that perhaps the Buddha did experience emotions during
              that long night, but recognized them as simply dynamic energy moving through.
              The feelings and sensations came up and passed away, came up and passed away.
              They didn’t set off a chain reaction. This process is often depicted in
              paintings as weapons transforming into flowers—warriors shooting thousands of
              flaming arrows at the Buddha as he sits under the Bodhi tree but the arrows
              becoming blossoms. That which can cause our destruction becomes a blessing in
              disguise when we let the energies arise and pass through us over and over
              again, without acting out.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A question that has intrigued me for years is this: How can
              we start exactly where we are, with all our entanglements, and still develop
              unconditional acceptance of ourselves instead of guilt and depression? One of
              the most helpful methods I’ve found is the practice of compassionate abiding.
              This is a way of bringing warmth to unwanted feelings. It is a direct method
              for embracing our experience rather than rejecting it. So the next time you
              realize that you’re hooked—that you’re stuck, finding yourself tightening,
              spiraling into blaming, acting out, obsessing—you could experiment with this
              approach.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Contacting the experience of being hooked, you breathe in,
              allowing the feeling completely and opening to it. The in-breath can be deep
              and relaxed—anything that helps you to let the feeling be there, anything that
              helps you not push it away. Then, still abiding with the urge and edginess of
              feelings such as craving or aggression, as you breathe out you relax and give
              the feeling space. The outbreath is not a way of sending the discomfort away
              but a way of ventilating it, of loosening the tension around it, of becoming
              aware of the space in which the discomfort is occurring.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This practice helps us to develop maitri because we willingly
              touch parts of ourselves that we’re not proud of. We touch feelings that we
              think we shouldn’t be having—feelings of failure, of shame, of murderous rage;
              all those politically incorrect feelings like racial prejudice, disdain for
              people we consider ugly or inferior, sexual addiction, and phobias. We contact
              whatever we’re experiencing and go beyond liking or disliking by breathing in
              and opening. Then we breathe out and relax. We continue that for a few moments
              or for as long as we wish, synchronizing it with the breath. This process has a
              leaning-in quality. Breathing in and leaning in are very much the same. We
              touch the experience, feeling it in the body if that helps, and we breathe it
              in.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the process of doing this, we are transmuting hard,
              reactive, rejecting energy into basic warmth and openness. It sounds dramatic,
              but really it’s very simple and direct. All we are doing is breathing in and
              experiencing what’s happening, then breathing out as we continue to experience
              what’s happening. It’s a way of working with our negativity that appreciates
              that the negative energy per se is not the problem. Confusion only begins when
              we can’t abide with the intensity of the energy and therefore spin off. Staying
              present with our own energy allows it to keep flowing and move on. Abiding with
              our own energy is the ultimate nonaggression, the ultimate maitri.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Compassionate abiding is a stand-alone practice, but it can
              also serve as a preliminary for doing the practice of tonglen, the practice of
              taking in and sending out. Tonglen is an ancient practice designed to
              short-circuit “all about me.” Just as with compassionate abiding, the logic of
              the practice is that we start by breathing in and opening to feelings that
              threaten the survival of our self-importance. We breathe in feelings that
              generally we want to get rid of. On the out-breath of tonglen, we send out all
              that we find pleasurable and comfortable, meaningful and desirable. We send out
              all the feelings we usually grasp after and cling to for dear life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tonglen can begin very much like compassionate abiding. We
              breathe in anything we find painful and we send out relief, synchronizing this
              with the breath. Yet the emphasis with tonglen is always on relieving the
              suffering of others. As we breathe in discomfort, we might think, “May I feel
              this completely so that I and all other beings may be free of pain.” As we
              breathe out relief, we might think, “May I send out this contentment completely
              so that all beings may feel relaxed and at home with themselves and with the
              world.” In other words, tonglen goes beyond compassionate abiding because it is
              a practice that includes the suffering of other beings and the longing that
              this suffering could be removed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tonglen develops further as your courage to experience your
              own unwanted feelings grows. For instance, when you realize you’re hooked, you
              breathe in with the understanding, even if it’s only conceptual at first, that
              this experience is shared by every being and that you aspire to alleviate their
              suffering. As you breathe out, you send relief to everyone. Still, your direct
              experience—the experience you’re tasting right now—is the basis for having any
              idea at all about what other beings go through. In this way tonglen is a heart
              practice, a gut-level practice, not a head practice or intellectual exercise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It’s common for parents of young children to spontaneously
              put their children first. When little ones are ill, mothers and fathers often
              have no problem at all wishing they could take away the child’s suffering; they
              would gladly breathe it in and take it away if they could, and they would
              gladly breathe out relief.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It’s suggested to start tonglen with situations like that,
              where it’s fairly easy. The practice becomes more challenging when you start to
              do it for people you don’t know, and almost impossible when you try to do it
              for people you don’t like. You breathe in the suffering of a panhandler on the
              street and aren’t sure you want to. And how willing are you to do more advanced
              tonglen, where you breathe in the pain of someone you despise and send them
              relief? From our current vantage point, this can seem too much to ask, too
              overwhelming or too absurd.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The reason why tonglen practice can be so difficult is that
              we can’t bear to feel the feelings that the street person or our nemesis bring
              up in us. This, of course, brings us back to compassionate abiding and making
              friends with ourselves. It has been precisely this process of doing tonglen,
              trying to stretch further and open my mind to a wider and wider range of
              people, that has helped me to see that without maitri I will always close down
              on other people when certain feelings are provoked.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The next time you have a chance, go outside and try to do
              tonglen for the first person you meet, breathing in their discomfort and
              sending out well-being and caring. If you’re in a city, just stand still for a
              while and pay attention to anyone who catches your eye and do tonglen for them.
              You can begin by contacting any aversion or attraction or even a neutral,
              uninterested feeling that they bring up in you, and breathe in, contacting that
              feeling much as you do with compassionate abiding but with the thought, “May
              both of us be able to feel feelings like this without it causing us to shut
              down to others.” As you breathe out, send happiness and contentment to them. If
              you encounter an animal or person who is clearly in distress, pause and breathe
              in with the wish that they be free of their distress and send out relief to
              them. With the most advanced tonglen, you breathe in with the wish that you
              could actually take on their distress so they could be free of it, and you
              breathe out with the wish that you could give them all your comfort and ease.
              In other words, you would literally be willing to stand in their shoes and have
              them stand in yours if it would help.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By trying this, we learn exactly where we are open and where
              we are closed. We learn quickly where we would do well to just practice abiding
              compassionately with our own confused feelings, before we try to work with
              other people, because right now our efforts would probably make a bigger mess.
              I know many people who want to be teachers, or feed the homeless, or start
              clinics, or try in some way to truly help others. Despite their generous
              intentions, they don’t always realize that if they plan to work closely with
              people they may be in for a lot of difficulty—a lot of feeling hooked. The
              people they hope to help will not always see them as saviors. In fact, they
              will probably criticize them and give them a hard time. Teachers and helpers of
              all kinds will be of limited use if they are doing their work to build up their
              own egos. Setting out to help others is a very quick way to pop the bubble of
              ego.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">So we start by making friends with our experience and
              developing warmth for our good old selves. Slowly, very slowly, gently, very
              gently, we let the stakes get higher as we touch in on more troubling feelings.
              This leads to trusting that we have the strength and good-heartedness to live
              in this precious world, despite its land mines, with dignity and kindness. With
              this kind of confidence, connecting with others comes more easily, because what
              is there to fear when we have stayed with ourselves through thick and thin?
              Other people can provoke anything in us, and we don’t need to defend ourselves
              by striking out or shutting down. Selfless help—helping others without an
              agenda— is the result of having helped ourselves. We feel loving toward
              ourselves and therefore we feel loving toward others. Over time, all those we
              used to feel separate from become more and more melted into our heart.</span></p>
