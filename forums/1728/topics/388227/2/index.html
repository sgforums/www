              <p>Neither is emptiness refering to non-conceptuality. It cannot be grasped by conceptuality (well for intellectual understanding that's ok, but is different from the realisation), but neither can it be grasped by non-conceptuality. If you stop all concepts you won't realise it either. For one thing, emptiness is not talking about a state of experience void of thought and experience, but the nature of 'selves' and 'things' as 'ungraspable', 'unlocatable', 'interconnected'. Hence it is not a state to enter in meditation, but rather must be realised as what all phenomena always already is by nature - empty.</p>
              <p>Emptiness can only be seen or realised through a quantum shift in perception where one penetrates and realise the dependent origination of all phenomena.</p>
              <p>As an analogy given by Thusness:<em><br><br>If we were to observe a red flower that is so vivid, clear and 
                          right in front us, the “redness” only appears to “belong” to the flower,
                           it is in actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal 
                          species (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an inherent 
                          attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum eyesight” to look into the 
                          atomic structure, there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere 
                          found, only almost complete space/void with no perceivable shapes and 
                          forms. Whatever appearances are dependently arisen, and hence is empty 
                          of any inherent existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or 
                          “redness” -- merely luminous yet empty, mere appearances without 
                          inherent/objective existence.</em></p>

              <p>Just to continue on my previous post where Thusness was correcting me on certain things.</p>
              <p>He had another conversation with me yesterday which made me understand better.</p>
              <p>It is a pretty long conversation I will just try to summarize.</p>
              <p>Basically, someone who experience non-dual does not necessarily mean he understands the causes of the subject-object split in the first place, and the way to dissolve the split. One must also then face the question, "if there is no split, how am I going to dissolve the split?"</p>
              <p>Next thing, when Joan Tollifson talked about there being <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/11/body-no-body.html">"no body, only sensations"</a> - she does not mean 'body' does not exist conventionally, but that the entire construct of a solid 'body' is phantasm, all there is is points of sensations.</p>
              <p>When a practitioner speaks of non-dual, he penetrates and sees through the illusion of subject-object division. This is different from mere non-dual experience, however the insight/experience of "no division" and "no body" are different.</p>
              <p>The same applies to the construct of "coming and going". It does not mean that once one experiences non-dual, one will penetrate the meaning of "no coming or going".</p>
              <p>Seeing 'duality', 'body', 'coming and going', these are the result of imposing an inherent and dualistic framework on experience and thus seeing things inherently. A practitioner goes through these constructs one by one, and then later from the insight of emptiness realizes it is all about seeing things inherently, and then the practitioner progresses further.</p>
              <p>One must know what is meant by "inherent" experientially. It is refering to the 'blinding factor' as in the case of 'body', 'dual'. Then a practitioner resolves all these into the One Mind, One Awareness, One Consciousness, but this too must be dissolved.</p>
              <p>Now regarding Awareness, although Awareness is ever-present and unfabricated, the understanding of 'uncaused' must come from causes and conditions, must come from manifestation. All manifestations that dependently originate are self-luminous.</p>
              <p>That is, we should not separate Awareness and manifestation into two. We cannot separate awareness from manifestation. As Manifestation, 'it' dependently originates and that alone is unconditioned, uncaused. And what that dependently originates does not arise, does not cease, does not 
                      come, does not go.</p>
              <p>As David Loy stated:</p>
              <p><em>"...the hierarchy that causality constructs must collapse into an interpenetration 
                      in which each event is equally conditioned by the whole and manifests that whole 
                      as the only thing in the universe.<br>"...we find ourselves in a universe of 
                      sunya-events, none of which can be said to occur for the sake of any other. Each 
                      nondual event -- every leaf-flutter, wandering thought, and piece of litter -- 
                      is whole and complete in itself, because although conditioned by everything else 
                      in the universe and thus a manifestation of it, for precisely that reason it is 
                      not subordinated to anything else but becomes an unconditioned end-in-itself..."</em></p>
              <p><em>"...the hierarchy that causality constructs must collapse into an 
                      interpenetration in which each event is equally conditioned by the whole and 
                      manifests that whole as the only thing in the universe..."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And Archaya Mahayogi Shridar Rinpoche states:</p>
              <p><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/02/madhyamika-buddhism-vis-vis-hindu.html"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-size: 100%;">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/02/madhyamika-buddhism-vis-vis-hindu.html</span></em></a></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-size: 100%;"><br>Another
                       word that has confounded many Hindu Svamis is ‘unborn’ (Skt. ajat), 
                      ‘unproduced’ (Skt. anutpada). In the context of the Hindu Vedanta, it 
                      means that there is this Ultimate Reality called the Brahma which is 
                      unborn i.e. never produced by anything or at any time, which means it 
                      always was. A thing or ‘super thing’ even a ‘non-thing’ that always 
                      existed and was never ever produced at any period in time which is 
                      separate from this born, illusory Samsara. In the Buddhist context, it 
                      is the true nature of Samsara itself which although relatively appears 
                      to be ‘born’, ultimately is never born. Advayavajra in his 
                      Tatvaratnavali says, “The world is unborn says the Buddha”. As Buddha 
                      Ekaputra Tantra (Tib. sangye tse tsig tantra) says, the base of DzogChen
                       is the Samsara itself stirred from its depth. Since the Samsara stirred
                       from its depth is interdependently originated, i.e. not really 
                      originated i.e. unborn and since Samsara is only relatively an 
                      interdependently originated thing but ultimately neither a thing nor a 
                      non-thing (bhava or abhava) that truly exists, the use of the word 
                      ‘unborn’ for Brahma (which is definitely not Samsara) and for Samsara 
                      itself in Buddhism are diametrically opposed. The true meaning of unborn
                       (anutpada) is dependently originated (pratityasamutpanna), which is as 
                      already mentioned, the meaning of a nisvabhava (non-real existence) or 
                      Shunyata (emptiness). None of these can be a synonym for Brahma or 
                      anything that has kind of ultimate real existence, even if it is called 
                      Tathagatagarbha. There is no acceptance of an Ultimate Existence in any 
                      Buddhist Sutra. It is interesting that an exact word for Ultimate 
                      Existence (Skt. paramartha satta) in Tibetan Buddhism is very rarely 
                      used. It shows how non-Buddhist the whole concept is. One has to 
                      differentiate between existence (Skt. satta) and truth (Skt. satya) 
                      although they are so close and come from the same root in Sanskrit. Even
                       in the Ratnagotra there is one single sentence (Skt. Yad yatra tat tena
                       shunyam iti samanupasyati yat punartravasistam bhavati tad sad 
                      ihasthiti yathabhutam prajanati): “whatever is not found, know that to 
                      be empty by that itself, if something remains, know that to exist as it 
                      is).” This statement is straight out of the Vaibhasika Sutras of the 
                      Theravada (Sunnatavagga) and Sautrantika Abhidharma Samuccaya. It seems 
                      to imply an affirming negative. First of all, this statement contradicts
                       the rest of the Ratnagotravibhaga if it is taken as the ultimate 
                      meaning in the Sutra (as the Shentongpas have done). Secondly, since it 
                      is a statement of the Vaibhasika school (stating that an ultimate unit 
                      of the consciousness and matter remains), it cannot be superior to the 
                      Rangtong Madhyamika. Thirdly, its interpretation as what remains is the 
                      ultimately existing Tathagatagarbha contradicts not only the 
                      interpretation that is found in other Buddhist sutras as “itar etar 
                      shunyata” (emptiness of what is different from it) but also the Shentong
                       interpretation of Tathagatagarbha contradicts all the other definitions
                       of the Tathagatagarbha found in the Ratnagotravibhaga itself.</span></em></p>

              <p>Dear AEN,</p>
              <p>It seems to me the text doesn't seem to mention how it would be
                  difference. But rather, it seems to imply that all these are just
                  different names of the same thing. To call it a thing though would
                  be a mistake because I am making it into a thing when it is really
                  not anything. More will be said about making things later.</p>
              <p>Also as I was reading the text, I realised some points which I
                  am unsure of.</p>
              <p>First, "Thoughts in the past are clear and empty and leave no
                  traces behind." Isn't karma the trace which was left behind?</p>
              <p>Second, "Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by
                  anything." Isn't future thoughts also conditioned in many ways by
                  karma?</p>
              <p>What do you think?</p>
              <p>The next line after that, I find to be very well said though,
                  "And in the present moment, when (your mind) remains in its own
                  condition without constructing anything, awareness, at that moment,
                  in itself is quite ordinary." As they say from where I came from,
                  it is just like this. Don't make anything special! In chinese, they
                  say ä¸�è¦�é€ ä½œ,å�³è§�å¦‚æ�¥ã€‚</p>

              <p>Hi, actually, Guru Padmasambhava did answer the difference. Do read through the book I lent you, I think there was quite some detailed explanation and commentary on that.</p>
              <p>The part that clarifies the difference is here:</p>
              <p><em><br>25.<br><br>Moreover, as for this diversity of appearances, which 
                  represents relative truth,<br>not even one of these appearances is 
                  actually created in reality, and so accordingly they disappear again.<br>All
                   things, all phenomenal existence, everything within Samsara and 
                  Nirvana,<br>Are merely appearances (or phenomena) which are perceived by
                   the individual's single nature of the mind.<br>On any particular 
                  occasion, when your own (internal) mind-stream undergoes changes,<br>then
                   there will arise appearances, which you will perceive as external 
                  changes.<br>Therefore, everything that you see is a manifestation of 
                  mind.<br>And, moreover, all of the beings inhabiting the six realms of 
                  rebirth perceive everything with their own distinct karmic vision.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The
                   Tirthikas who are outsiders see all this in terms of the dualism of 
                  Eternalism as against nihilism.</strong></span></span><br>Each of the nine successive vehicles 
                  sees things in terms of its own view.<br>Thus, things are perceived in 
                  various different ways and may be elucidated in various different ways.<br>Because
                   you grasped at these various (appearances that arise), becoming 
                  attached to them, errors have come into existence.<br>Yet with respect 
                  to all of these appearances of which you are aware in your mind,<br>Even
                   though these appearances that you perceive do arise, if you do not 
                  grasp at them, then that is Buddhahood.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He puts it very clearly: Hindus posit a permanent essence of Being that underlies all existence, and is thus the truly existent substance of reality. This substance then appears as everything, which are simply modulations of the same One Essence of Pure Consciousness, which is 'one without a second'. Everything is just appearances of that One Essence or substratum, like waves are made of water, golden necklace is made of gold. Unawakened beings according to them, are like grasping the names and forms that the One Essence takes shape in, but forget the Essence itself, in which these forms arise from and are ultimately made of. The appearances may change in form but the Essence will not.</p>
              <p>From some Hindu book and site:</p>
              <p><em>"Brahman is the eternal, unchanging, unborn, and un-created reality underlying the world of change. Brahman is formless and nameless and hence cannot be perceived by the senses and intellect (mind). Brahman is the power whose varieties of manifestation are the myriad worlds of phenomena. All change is change in form and name only. To take an example: consider a gold necklace. It can be melted and made into, say, a ring. The gold in the ring is the same gold as in the necklace, only hitherto it was in the form of a necklace but now of a ring. Just so, all things arise and pass away (acquire forms and undergo change in forms) but the power that is all things is one and the same: it never arises or passes away. Being nameless and formless, Brahman cannot be captured in any system of knowledge.</em><em>"</em></p>
              <p><em>"Creation is just the names and forms without any substantive other than 
              Brahman. Just as ring, bangle, necklace, etc are the name and form 
              without any substantive other than gold. Therefore all that you see is 
              nothing but Brahman in varieties of names and forms (sarvaM khalvidam 
              brahma – all this is Brahman) and there is nothing other than Brahman 
              (neha nAnAsti ki~nchana)."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Archaya Shridar Rana Rinpoche says:</p>
              <p><em><a href="http://www.byomakusuma.org/Ved%C3%A0ntavis%C3%A0visShentong/tabid/87/Default.aspx">http://www.byomakusuma.org/Ved%C3%A0ntavis%C3%A0visShentong/tabid/87/Default.aspx</a><br></em></p>
              <p><em>Sankaràcàrya even mentions the exact opposite view of what Sàntarakùita mentioned above and refutes him. Sàntarakùita says, “The error in the view of these philosophers is a slight one – due only to the assertion of eternality of cognition.” About the Chittamatra, Sankara says the error in the view of these philosophy is only slight - they believe the non-dual mind as changing moment to moment, we believe it as unchanging eternal.</em></p>
              <p><em><br>If the meaning of the Uttara Tantra is what the Shentongpas make it out to be, it would have existed in the Indian sources too. Sankara would certainly have written that the view of these Buddhist philosophers as what the Vedas had always taught and that Buddhism is just a branch of Hinduism. Even today, if any Indian Hindu philosopher comes across the Shentong view, they would be most happy to embrace it as the correct view and take it as a solid proof that Buddhism is just a branch of Hinduism and the Buddha did not teach anything new. This of course blatantly contradicts what the Buddha himself said in Mahayana, Theravada, and Sarvàstivàda Sutras and Sàstra-s. The Buddha said that he taught something that had been lost for a long time. But the Vedas and the Vedic Bràhmaõa-s of the Buddha’s time, whom the Buddha met, had been and are still teaching the existence of true âtmà, and ‘eternal non-dual cognition’ as the Ultimate Reality.</em></p>
              <p><em><br>If we glance through the Jain literature, we again find that no Jain scholar mentions that the Buddhists believed in an eternal / permanent non-dual cognition as the ultimate reality. At least, those Jain scholars after Asanga should have done so, if that was how the Uttara Tantra had been interpreted in India.</em></p>
              <p><em><br>If we analyze both the Hindu Sankaràcàrya’s and the Buddhist Sàntarakùita’s refutation, we find that both agree with the view of the Hindu Advaita Vedànta, which is that the ultimate reality (âtmà) is an unchanging, eternal non-dual cognition and that the Buddhists as a whole do not agree that the ultimate reality is an eternal, unchanging non-dual cognition, but rather an changing eternal non-dual cognition. These statements found in the 6th century Hindu and the 9th century Buddhist (both were after the Uttara Tantra and Asanga), show that the ultimate reality as an unchanging, eternal non-dual cognition is a Hindu view and is non-existent amongst the Buddhists of India. Not only was such a view non-existent amongst Buddhists of India, but also it was refuted as a wrong view by scholars like Sàntarakùita. He even writes that if and when Buddhists use the word ‘eternal’ (nitya), it means ‘pariõàmi nitya’, i.e., changing eternal, and not the Hindu kind of eternal, which always remains unchanged.</em></p>
              <p><em><br>The Hindu âtmà is not only non-dual cognition but is also unchanging, eternal, and truly existing. Sankaràcàrya defines existence (sat) in hisTattvaboda as that which remains the same in all the 3 times (past, present, future). In the commentary by Gauóapàda (who was Sankaràcàrya’s Guru’s Guru), of the Mànóukya Upaniùada, in verse number 96, he calls the eternally really existing non-dual cognition is non-relational, i.e., free from reference points. In the 37th verse of the same work, this non-dual, eternal, really existing cognition is free from all sense organs, i.e., free from the dualistic mind (namshe). So the Upaniùadic view is that the really existing, eternal / permanent, non-dual, non-referential cognition is the âtmà, and this is not dualistic mind. This Upanishadic view existed even before the Buddha, and this was what Sankaràcàrya expounded very clearly and most powerfully around the 6th century. This view, similar to this Sankara view, was refuted by Sàntarakùita as a wrong view.<br></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The subtle difference between Hindu non-duality and Buddhist anatta is well explained in Thusness Stage 4 and 5 description.</p>
              <p>Basically: though non-duality may be experienced as an All-Self and hence subject 
                  and object are not divided, one can still extrapolate all phenomena as 
                  being extensions of a universal substratum (i.e. reifying Brahman as an 
                  Absolute/Universal Consciousness) -- and hence seeing reality as an 
                  inherent ontological essence, which is not in accord with the principles
                   of Shunyata. Non-duality here is seen as the union/inseparability of 
                  objects with Subject, but the insight of No-Subject has not arisen.<br><br>In
                   Stage 5, there is only vivid reflection and manifestation without 
                  mirror/Subject, there is no mirror (Ultimate Subject) reflecting or 
                  being in union with the manifestations. 'Everything' is a process, 
                  event, manifestation and phenomenon, nothing ontological or having an 
                  essence. Stage 5 is quite thorough in being no one and Thusness calls 
                  this anatta in all 3 aspects -- no subject/object division, no doer-ship
                   and absence of agent. There is no agent, not just no subject/object 
                  division. This is Buddhism's No-Self.<br><br>So the difference between 
                  Advaita's non-dualism of brahman and world and Buddhism's No-Self is the
                   difference between Thusness's Stage 4 and 5 which he explained in his 
                  comments on <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's

              <p>Another related post I made in another forum recently:</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>We can talk about this in two ways:<br><br> All there is is awareness, in other words, everything you experience is 
              awareness.</em> <em><br><br> Or -</em> <em><br><br> There is just sensations and thoughts and no other thing called 
              awareness, in other words, since there is just sensations and thoughts, 
              those sensations and thoughts are the only 'awareness' there is, there 
              is no separate perceiver or awareness.</em> <em><br><br><br> Both are the same thing. There is a danger however, in reifying Case 1) 
              into a Brahman, something ultimate, unchanging and independent. Though 
              if it is not reified, that is fine.</em> <em><br><br> Case 2 is what is more commonly explained in classical Nikaya, original 
              Buddhist texts. Even though it never talks about Awareness as the 
              essence of all experiences, it is implied already that awareness is 
              non-dual because there cannot be a subject/object split in anatta, there
               cannot be a split when all there is is sensations and aggregates.</em> <em><br><br><br> Reification would be imputing a particular set of sensation as 'Subject'
               or 'Awareness' while the other set as 'Objects', but in reality, all 
              there is is self-aware sensations and thoughts, if all there is is 
              self-aware manifestation, in other words only sensations and aggregates,
               and that sensations and aggregates auto-imply awareness, why talk about
               awareness at all? There is absolutely no reification here, only 
              impermanent dependently originated sensations and thoughts whether they 
              are gross (gross waking dream sensory experience) or subtle (such as 
              dream, astral realms, or the subtler formless I AMness experience).</em> <em><br><br> As Greg Goode said, "once experience doesn't seem divided and once it 
              doesn't seem like there is anything other than consciousness, then the 
              notion of consciousness itself will gently and peacefully dissolve."</em> <em><br><br><br> P.S. As to Lucky noticing similarities between Advaita and Buddhism in 
              terms of non-dual, I have to say that the non-dual experience in Advaita
               and Buddhism is exactly the same. The only difference lies in the view,
               whereby Advaita makes nondual awareness into Pure Subjectivity 
              transcending and encompassing phenomena, but Buddhism sees only vivid 
              and empty (dependently originated) manifestations and thus which leads 
              to subtler realisation of the Anatta and Empty nature of luminosity in 
              Buddhism. The difference thus lies not in non-dual but in Anatta and 
              Emptiness.</em> <em><br><br> There is no hearer, only sounds, hearing is just sounds. No seer, only 
              scenery, the seeing is the scenery. What you call 'awareness' is only 
              just dependently originated phenomena, sounds, sights, thoughts, etc. 
              Absolutely no reification here. Reification would be stating - there is 
              an independent awareness perceiving things, or an unchanging substance, 
              like a mirror, behind all changes. Buddhism's 'awareness has always been
               so' does not mean a Brahman or an ultimate subject or an ultimate 
              perceiver, rather it means all along there never has been a perceiver, 
              only sensations, thoughts, sounds, sights, just that.</em></p>

              <p>Some thoughts on awareness:-</p>
              <p>Awareness "IS" as opposed to ''was'' and "going to be".</p>
              <p>It occurs in the present; the phenomena, a process.</p>
              <p>It depends on conditions being present, and occurs spontaneously on conditions being present.</p>
              <p>Awareness is present,recollection is awareness now interpreting the past.</p>
              <p>Awareness is now, future is present projecting the future.</p>
              <p>Thought elements or conditions pertaining to current thought must be present for it to occur.</p>
              <p> Awareness can either be "associative" or "disassociative" ,  or simply the focus of attention.</p>
              <p>Shamantha is "dissociative", while Vispashyana is "associative".</p>
              <p>Thus, when we disassociate, awareness does not arise, as conditions is not sufficient,</p>
              <p>Only if we associate does awareness arise, as conditions are met.</p>
              <p>Example, if you not associate with sight, "seeing" do not arise, phenomena is a dancer in front of me, but I do not see.</p>
              <p>If association of sound does not arise, "'hearing" do not arise. I am so engrossed with the dancer that I did'nt hear what you are saying.</p>
              <p>Clinging to:-</p>
              <p>"I" or "Self" is a referencing tool, "in relation to" or "in reference" to "I", representing or in representation of  "I", the individual.</p>
              <p>When awareness associates with "I", thoughts and emotions in relation to "I" arise.</p>
              <p>When awareness disassociates with "I", thoughts and emotions in relation to "I" does not arise.</p>
              <p>Physical pain can also be disassociated by refocusing association. </p>
              <p>By acknowledging thoughts and emotions, they are not suppressed or reacted to, allowing it to come and go.</p>

              <p>Hi Weychin,</p>
              <p>Awareness is not the same as attention. I wrote a few years back:</p>
              <p><em class="bbc"><a class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/search/label/View%20and%20Path">http://awakeningtore...ew%20and%20Path</a><br> <br> Awareness or Buddha-Nature is not the same as focused attention or
              concentration. Awareness is effortlessly happening right now, whether
              you like it or not, and whether you are paying attention or not. When
              causes and conditions is, manifestation is, when manifestation is,
              Awareness is. Naturally, sounds are effortlessly being heard, smells
              are effortlessly being smelled, even if the smell or sound is
              unpleasant and you try to avoid it, it's being awared. While paying
              attention to the breath, something still hears sounds. That is
              Buddha-Nature. It is the sum of all our parts, that which sees, hears,
              feels and tastes all at once as One Reality. Before you think that this
              awareness is a 'thing' -- a Mirror or a Witness, it's not separate --
              it's just sound hearing, scenery seeing, it's not a something tangible
              (a Mirror or a Witness) yet is vividly manifesting.<br> <br> So as Toni Packer said, "There is no need for awareness to turn
              anywhere. It's here! Everything is here in awareness! When there is a
              waking up from fantasy, there is no one who does it. Awareness and the
              sound of a plane are here with no one in the middle trying to "do" them
              or bring them together. They are here together! The only thing that
              keeps things (and people) apart is the "me"-circuit with its separative
              thinking. When that is quiet, divisions do not exist."<br> <br> Joan Tollifson ("student" of Toni), "This open being is not something
              to be practiced methodically. Toni points out that it takes no effort
              to hear the sounds in the room; it's all here. There's no "me" (and no
              problem) until thought comes in and says: "Am I doing it right? Is this
              'Awareness'? Am I enlightened?" Suddenly the spaciousness is gone—the
              mind is occupied with a story and the emotions it generates."<br> <br> As John Welwood says: "This larger awareness is self-existing: it
              cannot be fabricated or manufactured because it is always present,
              whether we notice it or not."<br> <br> To reiterate my previous statement that Awareness is not the result of
              an effort put in concentration or focused attention, is not
              constructed, is unborn, self-existing and ever-present, and becomes
              'apparent' through letting go of fixation, Judith Blackstone nicely
              puts it:<br> <br> "Nondual consciousness is not a state of attention. It is
              experienced without effort of any kind. It is the mind completely at
              rest. In fact, there is not even a sense that the mind is resting, for
              that is still an activity of sorts. Rather, one experiences a simple
              lucid openness in which the phenomena of the world appear, and through
              which experiences such as thoughts, emotions, and sensations move
              without obstruction.<br> <br> There is also a sense that one's consciousness is pervading all of
              the content of one's experience. Rather than an encounter between one's
              own head and the objects outside of one's head, as experienced in
              intentional, dualistic consciousness states, nondual consciousness is
              experienced globally. It pervades and subsumes one's whole body and
              everything in one's environment at the same time. "Consciousness is
              encountered as something more like a field than a localized point, a
              field that transcends the body and yet somehow interacts with it"
              (Forman, in Gallagher &amp; Shear, 1999, p. 373).<br> <br> One of the main characteristics of nondual realization is that it
              is discovered, rather than created, as rigid subjective organizations
              are released. Constructivists may insist that nondual consicousness is
              itself a conceptual construct. Speaking both from my own experience as
              well as from traditional accounts, I can attest that nondual
              realization is a process of gradually letting go of one's grip on
              oneself and one's environment -- as if opening a clenched fist. It does
              require concentrated effort and time to achieve a certain degree of
              letting go. But the expanse of nondual consciousness, pervading oneself
              and one's environment as a unified whole, appears of its own accord as
              a result of this letting go, and continues to appear, without any
              effort on one's own part."<br> <br> ~ "The Empathic Ground" by Judith Blackstone (a book that Thusness
              thinks is very good and recommended me, contains many practical
              techniques and pointers to nondual awareness)</em></p>

              <p>Dear AEN,</p>
              <p>It seems to me the text doesn't seem to mention how it would be
                                      difference. But rather, it seems to imply that all these are just
                                      different names of the same thing. To call it a thing though would
                                      be a mistake because I am making it into a thing when it is really
                                      not anything. More will be said about making things later.</p>
              <p>Also as I was reading the text, I realised some points which I
                                      am unsure of.</p>
              <p>First, "Thoughts in the past are clear and empty and leave no
                                      traces behind." Isn't karma the trace which was left behind?</p>
              <p>Second, "Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by
                                      anything." Isn't future thoughts also conditioned in many ways by
                                      karma?</p>
              <p>What do you think?</p>
              <p>The next line after that, I find to be very well said though,
                                      "And in the present moment, when (your mind) remains in its own
                                      condition without constructing anything, awareness, at that moment,
                                      in itself is quite ordinary." As they say from where I came from,
                                      it is just like this. Don't make anything special! In chinese, they

                                                  into an interpenetration in which each event is equally conditioned
                                                  by the whole and manifests that whole as the only thing in the

                                                  -- every leaf-flutter, wandering thought, and piece of litter -- is

              <p><em>"...the hierarchy that causality constructs must collapse

              <p>And Mahasi Sayadaw said:</p>
              <p><em>"Before a drum is beaten, its sound does not exist in the
                                          drum itself, the drumstick, or anywhere in between. Even though a
                                          sound occurs when the drum is beat, the sound does not originate
                                          from the drum or the drumstick. The physical phenomena of drum and
                                          drumstick are not transformed into a sound nor does the sound
                                          originate from anywhere in between drum and drumstick. In
                                          dependence on the drum, the drumstick, and the hitting of the drum,
                                          the sound is a completely new phenomenon each time the drum is hit.
                                          The drum and the stick are different from the sound.<br> <br> In the same way, before you see something or someone, seeing does
                                          not exist in the eye, in the visible form, or anywhere in between.
                                          The seeing that takes place neither originates in the eye nor in
                                          the visible form. The seeing consciousness neither originates in
                                          the eye nor in the visible forms, which are physical phenomena. It
                                          also does not originate from anywhere in between. Seeing is
                                          actually a new phenomenon that arises due to the combination of the
                                          eye, the visible form, light, and your attention. Thus, the eye and
                                          the visible form are different from the seeing. The same is true
                                          for the other senses."</em></p>

              <p>Hi Weychin,</p>
              <p>Awareness is not the same as attention. I wrote a few years
                      back:</p>
              <p><em><a title="External link" rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/search/label/View%20and%20Path">http://awakeningtore...ew%20and%20Path</a><br> <br> Awareness or Buddha-Nature is not the same as focused attention or
                      concentration. Awareness is effortlessly happening right now,
                      whether you like it or not, and whether you are paying attention or
                      not. When causes and conditions is, manifestation is, when
                      manifestation is, Awareness is. Naturally, sounds are effortlessly
                      being heard, smells are effortlessly being smelled, even if the
                      smell or sound is unpleasant and you try to avoid it, it's being
                      awared. While paying attention to the breath, something still hears
                      sounds. That is Buddha-Nature. It is the sum of all our parts, that
                      which sees, hears, feels and tastes all at once as One Reality.
                      Before you think that this awareness is a 'thing' -- a Mirror or a
                      Witness, it's not separate -- it's just sound hearing, scenery
                      seeing, it's not a something tangible (a Mirror or a Witness) yet
                      is vividly manifesting.<br> <br> So as Toni Packer said, "There is no need for awareness to turn
                      anywhere. It's here! Everything is here in awareness! When there is
                      a waking up from fantasy, there is no one who does it. Awareness
                      and the sound of a plane are here with no one in the middle trying
                      to "do" them or bring them together. They are here together! The
                      only thing that keeps things (and people) apart is the "me"-circuit
                      with its separative thinking. When that is quiet, divisions do not
                      exist."<br> <br> Joan Tollifson ("student" of Toni), "This open being is not
                      something to be practiced methodically. Toni points out that it
                      takes no effort to hear the sounds in the room; it's all here.
                      There's no "me" (and no problem) until thought comes in and says:
                      "Am I doing it right? Is this 'Awareness'? Am I enlightened?"
                      Suddenly the spaciousness is gone—the mind is occupied with a story
                      and the emotions it generates."<br> <br> As John Welwood says: "This larger awareness is self-existing: it
                      cannot be fabricated or manufactured because it is always present,
                      whether we notice it or not."<br> <br> To reiterate my previous statement that Awareness is not the result
                      of an effort put in concentration or focused attention, is not
                      constructed, is unborn, self-existing and ever-present, and becomes
                      'apparent' through letting go of fixation, Judith Blackstone nicely
                      puts it:<br> <br> "Nondual consciousness is not a state of attention. It is
                      experienced without effort of any kind. It is the mind completely
                      at rest. In fact, there is not even a sense that the mind is
                      resting, for that is still an activity of sorts. Rather, one
                      experiences a simple lucid openness in which the phenomena of the
                      world appear, and through which experiences such as thoughts,
                      emotions, and sensations move without obstruction.<br> <br> There is also a sense that one's consciousness is pervading all of
                      the content of one's experience. Rather than an encounter between
                      one's own head and the objects outside of one's head, as
                      experienced in intentional, dualistic consciousness states, nondual
                      consciousness is experienced globally. It pervades and subsumes
                      one's whole body and everything in one's environment at the same
                      time. "Consciousness is encountered as something more like a field
                      than a localized point, a field that transcends the body and yet
                      somehow interacts with it" (Forman, in Gallagher &amp; Shear, 1999,
                      p. 373).<br> <br> One of the main characteristics of nondual realization is that it
                      is discovered, rather than created, as rigid subjective
                      organizations are released. Constructivists may insist that nondual
                      consicousness is itself a conceptual construct. Speaking both from
                      my own experience as well as from traditional accounts, I can
                      attest that nondual realization is a process of gradually letting
                      go of one's grip on oneself and one's environment -- as if opening
                      a clenched fist. It does require concentrated effort and time to
                      achieve a certain degree of letting go. But the expanse of nondual
                      consciousness, pervading oneself and one's environment as a unified
                      whole, appears of its own accord as a result of this letting go,
                      and continues to appear, without any effort on one's own
                      part."<br> <br> ~ "The Empathic Ground" by Judith Blackstone (a book that Thusness
                      thinks is very good and recommended me, contains many practical
                      techniques and pointers to nondual awareness)</em></p>

              <p>Also, From ZenGuide:<br> <br> <br> <em><strong>Clangor:</strong><br> <br> Quote: "we hear sounds regardless if we pay attention to them or

              <p>            Thanks for your answers, I beg to differ, not because you are wrong, but that attention is also part of awareness, or rather, the conscious part of it.</p>
              <p>Yes, sounds is "heard", sights,"seen"or sensations,sensed. However, if the sensation to be a source or origin of investigation, it has to be quantifiable, it has to have attention. That my present attention has "Nowness"..For awareness without non attention, to be quantifiable, it has to be in store consciousness and it has to arise to be perceived.</p>
              <p>I am not enlightened, therefore I rely on self investigation or witness. Non dual witness, just spontaneous , just like clap, without conceptualisation! As I awaken, the the "Is-ness" or "Nowness" with the present increases  with more awareness. Just as you say, a dog is colorblind, the flowers have color. However, without the faculty of color discrimination, everything is in shades of grey. So do we still say awareness of dog is in colour? Moreover, for a deaf and mute, can probably sense, with other faculties,but they will never hear and  see! If I were in the dark, do I still see the flowers, or am I seeing dark? We are talking awareness and conditions leading to perception must be present!</p>
              <p>With attentive awareness, we have a working model, we can observe conditions leading. However,that awareness that does not have immediate attention, that which lies in dormant state in our store consciousness and does not arise spontaneously in order,to be investigated,because now that it is recollective, is subject to conceptional speculation, as it lack the "Nowness". Also whether I hold you position to  be true or false, is also due to hearsay and speculation, for it is not experiential, and not conclusive because there is no "Nowness", without witnessing spontaneous arising.</p>
              <p>From you stand point you see, because of  your increased awareness, but from my stand point,with my diminished capacity, I don't!</p>

              <p>When we investigate all sensations that imply "Nowness", and all sensations and thoughts that imply "Then-ness" or "Futureness", in other words whether a sensation, or a thought or memory of the past, or the sense of bodily contraction due to worrying about the future, whatever it is, once investigated we only experience all sensations as simply present and aware where it is. There is in fact, nothing inherently 'now', 'then', 'before', etc. These are simply impressions but when investigated all sensations that imply 'now', 'before', etc, are simply sensations vividly present where they are and are empty of anything inherent.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, all our experience, be it thoughts, sensations, perceptions and so on, they are simply present, aware, non-dual as it is. This means all along, whatever manifests, be it sensations, thoughts, and so on, are simply manifest without an observer-observed duality. It is simply present and aware where they are. In seeing, always already only scenery, no seer. In thinking always already just thoughts, no thinker. In hearing always already just sounds, no hearer.</p>
              <p>Similarly when we say 'awareness of grey', you may think that awareness
                              is an observer of grey. Actually, the observer is the observed, or the
                              observing IS what is observed, means there is simply the sight and
                              sensation of grey. There is actually no separate observer or awareness
                              apart from the arising sensation or sight which dependently originates. Means these sensations and thoughts simply arise and vanish moment to moment on its own accord due to causes and conditions. You did not create them (there is no you), nothing created them, they just appear according to the laws of causality. What we call awareness is simply the presently arising sound, thought, sight, sensation, etc. Hence you cannot say awareness is in the grey, as that would imply there is an entity called 'awareness' that can be 'inside' something else called 'grey', whereas in reality there is no separate or inherently existing entity 'awareness' other than these arising sensate reality itself.</p>
              <p>Now with regards to attention, whether or not there is attention, sounds are still heard. If sound of airplane passes by, the sound will be spontaneously perceived whether or not you want to do so, and even if you are paying attention to something else like your breathe. Awareness simply awares of the entire reality all at once, as one seamless integrated totality. It requires no observer to observe, and there never has been a separate observer to observe. As for attention, attention is simply a mental factor that sorts of amplifies a particular sensations or thought. However attention is actually not what is 'aware' of sensate reality. All sensate reality are simply manifest in itself, aware and self-luminous in itself. The mind however focuses on a particular sensation. It is a mental factor, and as Shayne said,</p>
              <p><em>when not thinking the attention dont exist.<br> <br> when not focusing on a particular sense object the attention dont
                                                      exist.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, while Shayne seems to put down attention, in Buddhism it is not necessary that attention is 'bad'. In fact it is important for certain practices depending on what you are practicing. Especially for classical vipassana practice, focused attention on sensations to observe their three characteristics is often important in the beginning stages. Attention is also necessary for normal functioning in our lives to certain extent. However, it is important to understand that attention is not an 'observer' of sounds, sights, etc. All sounds and sights and phenomena and thoughts are simply present where they are, self-luminous, without an observer and observed division.</p>

              <p>We can only perceive the suchness of things 
              through an awareness
                                      that opens to them nonconceptualy and 
              unconditionally, allowing
                                      them to reveal themselves in their 
              as-it-is-ness. As the poet Basho
                                      suggests:</p>
              <p><em>From the pine tree</em></p>
              <p><em>Learn of the pine tree</em></p>
              <p><em>And from the bamboo</em></p>
              <p><em>of the bamboo.</em></p>
              <p>Commenting on these lines, the Japanese 
              philosopher Nishitani
                                      (1982) explains that Basho does not mean</p>
              <p><em>That we should ‘observe the pine tree 
              carefully.’ Still less
                                      does he mean for us to ‘study the pine tree 
              scientifically.’ He
                                      means for us to enter the mode of being where 
              the pine tree is the
                                      pine tree itself, and the bamboo is the bamboo 
              itself, and from
                                      there to look at the pine tree and the bamboo. 
              He calls on us to
                                      betake ourselves to the dimension where things 
              become manifest in
                                      their suchness. (p. 128)</em></p>
              <p>In the same vein, Zen Master Dogen advises: 
              “You should not
                                      restrict yourselves to learning to see water

                                      human beings alone. Know that you must see water

                                      sees water” (Izutsu, 1972, p. 140). “Seeing 
              water in the way water
                                      sees water” means recognizing water in its 
              suchness, free of all
                                      concepts that spring from an observing mind 
              standing back from
                                      experience.</p>
