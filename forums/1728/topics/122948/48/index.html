              <p>Dhammapada Verse 291</p>
              <p>Kukkutandakhadika Vatthu<br><br>Paradukkhupadhanena<br>athno sukhamicchati<br>verasamsaggasamsattho<br>vera so na parimuccati.</p>
              <p>Verse 291. When Anger Does Not Abate<br><br>Who so for self wants happiness<br>by causing others pain,<br>entangled in anger’s tangles<br>one’s from anger never free.<br><br>Explanation: The individual who achieves happiness by inflicting pain on others is not freed from anger because he is entangled in the web of anger due to the contact of the anger of other people.</p>
              <p><br>The Story of the Woman Who Ate up the Eggs of a Hen<br><br>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (291) of this book, with reference to a feud between a woman and a hen.<br><br>Once, there lived a woman in a village near Savatthi. She had a hen in her house; every time the hen laid an egg she would eat it up. The hen was very much hurt and angry and made a vow to have vengeance on the woman and made a wish that it should be reborn as some being that would be in a position to kill the offspring of that woman. The hen's wish was fulfilled as it was reborn as a cat and the woman was reborn as a hen in the same house. The cat ate up the eggs of the hen. In their next existence the hen became a leopard and the cat became a deer. The leopard ate up the deer as well as its offspring. Thus, the feud continued for five hundred existences of the two beings. At the time of the Buddha one of them was born as a woman and the other an ogress.<br><br>On one occasion, the woman was returning from the house of her parents to her own house near Savatthi. Her husband and her young son were also with her. While they were resting near a pond at the roadside, her husband went to have a bath in the pond. At that moment the woman saw the ogress and recognized her as her old enemy. Taking her child she fled from the ogress straight to the Jetavana monastery where the Buddha was expounding the Dhamma and put her child at the feet of the Buddha. The ogress who was in hot pursuit of the woman also came to the door of the monastery, but the guardian spirit of the gate did not permit her to enter. The Buddha, seeing her, sent the Venerable Ananda to bring the ogress to his presence. When the ogress arrived, the Buddha reprimanded both the woman and the ogress for the long chain of feud between them. He also added, "If you two had not come to me today, your feud would have continued endlessly. Enmity cannot be appeased by enmity; it can only be appeased by loving-kindness."<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:<br><br>Verse 291: He who seeks his own happiness by inflicting pain on others, being entangled by bonds of enmity, cannot be free from enmity. <br><br>At the end of the discourse the ogress took refuge in the three Gems, viz., the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha, and the woman attained Sotapatti Fruition.</p>

As an elephant stuck in mire pulls itself out, so also pull yourself out of the mire of moral defilements.<br><br>The Story of the Elephant Called Paveyyaka<br><br>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (327) of this book, with reference to the elephant, called Paveyyaka.<br><br>Paveyyaka when young was very strong; in due course, he became old and decrepit. One day, as old Paveyyaka went into a pond he was stuck in the mire and could not get on to the shore. When King Pasenadi of Kosala was told about it, he sent an elephant trainer to help the elephant get out of the mire. The elephant trainer went to the site where the elephant was. There, he made the musicians strike up a martial tune. Hearing the military airs, the elephant felt as if he were in a battlefield; his spirits rose, he pulled himself with all his might, and was soon out of the mire.<br><br>When the bhikkhus told the Buddha about this he said, "Bhikkhus! Just as that elephant pulled itself out of the mire, so also, must you all pull yourselves out of the mire of moral defilements."<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:<br><br>Verse 327: Take delight in mindfulness, guard your mind well. As an elephant stuck in mire pulls itself out, so also, pull yourself out of the mire of moral defilements. <br><br>At the end of the discourse the bhikkhus attained arahatship.</span></span></p>

              <p>Thera Ujjhanasanni was always finding fault with and speaking ill of others. Other bhikkhus reported about him to the Buddha. The Buddha replied to them, "Bhikkhus, if someone finds fault with another so as to teach him in good way; it is not an act of evil and is therefore not to be blamed. But, if someone is always finding fault with others and speaking ill of them just out of spite and malice, he will not attain concentration and mental absorption (jhana). He will not be able to understand the Dhamma, and moral (intoxicants asavas) will increase in him."<br><br>Verse 253: In one who constantly sees the faults of others and is always disparaging them, moral intoxicants (asavas) increase; he is far from extinction of moral intoxicants (i.e., he is far from attainment of arahatship).</p>

Four Forms Of Victories<br><br>Anger conquer by amity,<br>evil conquer with good,<br>by giving conquer miserly,<br>with truth the speaker of falsity.<br><br>Explanation: Let anger be conquered by love. Let bad be conquered by good. Let miserliness be overcome be generosity. Let the liar by conquered by the truth.<br><br>The Story of Uttara the Lay-Disciple<br><br>While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (223) of this book, with reference to Uttara, a female lay-disciple.<br><br>Uttara was the daughter of a farm labourer named Punna and his wife. Punna worked for a rich man named Sumana, in Rajagaha. One day, Punna and his wife offered alms-food to Thera Sariputta soon after his arising from sustained deep mental absorption (nirodha samapatti), and as a result of that good deed they suddenly became very rich. Punna came upon gold in the field he was ploughing, and the king officially declared him a royal banker. On one occasion, the family of Punna offered alms-food to the Buddha and the bhikkhus for seven days. and on the seventh day, after hearing the Buddha's discourse, all the three members of the family attained Sotapatti Fruition.<br><br>Later, Uttara the daughter of Punna married the son of the rich man Sumana. That family being non-Buddhist, Uttara did not feel happy in her husband's home. So, she told her father, "My father, why have you put me in this cage? Here, I do not see any bhikkhu and I have no chance to offer anything to any bhikkhu." Her father felt sorry for her and sent her fifteen thousand in cash. With this money, after getting permission from her husband, Uttara engaged a courtesan to look to the needs of her husband. So it was arranged that Sirima, a well-known and very beautiful courtesan, was to take her place as a wife for fifteen days.<br><br>During that time, Uttara offered alms-food to the Buddha and the bhikkhus. On the fifteenth day, as she was busy preparing food in the kitchen, her husband saw her from the bedroom window and smiled, and then muttered to himself, "How foolish she is! She does not know how to enjoy herself. She is tiring herself out with this alms-giving ceremony!" Sirima saw him smile, and forgetting that she was only a paid substitute wife felt very jealous of Uttara. Being unable to control herself, Sirima went into the kitchen and got a ladleful of boiling butter with the intention of pouring it over the head of Uttara. Uttara saw her coming, but she bore no ill will towards Sirima. She reflected that because Sirima had stood in for her, she had been able to listen to the dhamma, make offerings of alms-food for fifteen days, and perform other acts of charity. Thus she was quite thankful to Sirima. Suddenly, she realized that Sirima had come very close to her and was going to pour boiling-hot butter over her; so she made this asseveration: "If I bear any ill will towards Sirima may this boiling-hot butter burn me; if I have no ill will towards her may it not burn me."<br><br>As Uttara had no ill will towards Sirima, the boiling butter poured over her head by Sirima was just like cold water. Then Sirima thought the butter must have gone cold; and as she went for another ladleful of boiling butter, the attendants of Uttara fell upon her and beat her hard. Uttara stopped her attendants and instructed them to rub Sirima with medicinal ointment.<br><br>Then, Sirima remembered her true position and she regretted that she had done wrong to Uttara and asked Uttara to forgive her. To her Uttara replied, "I have my father; I shall ask him whether I should accept your apology." Sirima then said that she would readily go and apologize to the rich man, the father of Uttara. Uttara then explained to Sirima, "Sirima,. when I said 'My father', I did not mean my real father, who had brought me into this round of rebirths. I was referring to my father, the Buddha, who had helped me break the chain of rebirths, who had taught me the Dhamma, the Noble Truths." Sirima then expressed her wish to see the Buddha. So it was arranged that Sirima should offer alms-food to the Buddha and the bhikkhus on the following day at the house of Uttara.<br><br>After the meal, the Buddha was told everything that had happened between Sirima and Uttara. Sirima then owned up that she had done wrong to Uttara and entreated the Buddha that she should be forgiven, for otherwise Uttara would not forgive her. The Buddha then asked Uttara how she felt in her mind when Sirima poured boiling butter on her head, and Uttara answered, "Venerable Sir, because I owed so much to Sirima I had resolved not to lose my temper, not to bear any ill will towards her. I sent forth my love towards her". The Buddha then said, "Well done, well done, Uttara! By not bearing any ill will you have been able to conquer one who has done you wrong through hate. By not abusing, you should conquer one who abuses you; by being generous you should conquer one who is stingy; by speaking the truth you should conquer one who tells lies."<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:<br><br>Verse 223: Conquer the angry one by not getting angry (i.e., by loving-kindness); conquer the wicked by goodness; conquer the stingy by generosity, and the liar by speaking the truth. <br><br>At the end of the discourse Sirima and five hundred ladies attained Sotapatti Fruition.</p></div>

In Buddhism, generosity is seen as a strategy to weaken greed, a way of helping others and a means of lessening the economic disparities in society. Since it is one of the cardinal Buddhist virtues, the Buddha has a great deal to say about<span class="text_exposed_hide">...</span><span class="text_exposed_show"> giving and sharing. He said we can give to guests, to those setting out on a journey, to the sick, the hungry, the poor and the first fruits to monks, nuns or spiritual teachers (A.III,41). The JÄ�taka says: ‘From little give a little, from middling give middling and from much give much. There is no excuse for giving nothing.’(Ja.V,387).<br><br>When we give or share we should, the Buddha advised, give with respect, thoughtfully, with our own hand if possible, give things that will benefit the recipient and after having considered how our gift might benefit them (A.III,172). With typical skill and insight, he asked us to see beyond the actual article we give to what it can actually do for others. So, for example, he pointed out that: ‘In giving food one also gives life, beauty, happiness, strength and intelligence and in giving these five things one also partakes in them, both now and later.’ (A.III,42). While seeing the value of providing others with their material needs, the Buddha reminded us that the highest, the most helpful and precious thing we can give to others is the Dhamma (Dhp.354).<br><br>However, one has to get things in perspective. Giving a sick person a book on Buddhism when they are in desperate need of medicine or a doctor is not only inappropriate, it is also void of wisdom and compassion. This point is highlighted by the incident in the traditional life of the Buddha. Once a man was so determined to hear the Dhamma that he came to where the Buddha was speaking straight after a long day’s work. He had not even given himself time to rest, bathe or eat. <br><br>Having come to know of this, the Buddha asked the monks to give the man something to eat before the Dhamma talk began (Dhp-A. 262).<br><br>DÄ�na - The Development of its Concept and Practice, T.

But one day, as he went for alms-food to his uncle's house, he saw a woman and felt a great desire to have her. Then he left the Order of the bhikkhus. As a layman, he was a failure as he did not work hard. So, his uncle drove him out of the house, and subsequently he became mixed up with some thieves. All of them were caught by the authorities and were taken to the cemetery to be executed. The Venerable Mahakassapa saw his pupil as he was being led out and said to him, "My pupil, keep your mind steadfastly on a subject of meditation." As instructed, he concentrated and let himself be established in deep mental absorption. At the cemetery, while the executioners were making preparations to kill him, the ex-bhikkhu was very much composed and showed no signs of fear or anxiety. The executioners and the onlookers were awe-struck and very much impressed by the man's courage and composure and they reported about him to the king and also to the Buddha. The king gave orders to release the man. The Buddha on hearing about the matter sent his radiance and appeared to the thief as if in person.<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke to him in verse as follows:<br><br>Verse 344: Having left the forest of desire (i.e., the life of a householder), he takes to the forest of the practice (i.e., the life of a bhikkhu); but when he is free from the forest of desire he rushes back to that very forest. Come, look at that man who having become free rushes back into that very bondage. <br><br>At the end of the discourse, the thief who was steadfastly keeping his mind on the arising and perishing of the aggregates discerned the impermanent, unsatisfactory and non-self nature of all conditioned things and soon attained Sotapatti Fruition. Later, he went to the Buddha at the Jetavana monastery where he was again admitted to the Order by the Buddha and he instantly attained arahatship.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Dhamma Talk<br><br>Responsibility to the Dead: <br>" REMEMBERING AND LETTING GO "<br>By Ven Kumara <br><span class="text_exposed_hide">...</span><span class="text_exposed_show"> <br>We just chanted the Metta Sutta and the Mangala Sutta. The Metta Sutta is chanted for the well being, happiness and peace of all beings, far and near. The Mangala Sutta tells us what blessings are, such as associating with the wise, having respect for those worthy of respect, and showing gratitude. <br><br>We hope that Ah Loong who passed away 7 weeks ago, heard the suttas and is also well, happy and peaceful. We hope that he heard the blessings of the Mangala Sutta. One who has died and is not yet reborn can hear the suttas because the consciousness is still around. He can understand the suttas in any language because those in the spirit world have no language but communicate with the mind. <br><br>Letting Go <br><br>Attachment to someone as a result of long association is natural and understandable. However, attachments, such as on the part of the living for the dead and vice versa, do not benefit anyone. Instead, it causes and prolongs suffering. The coming and going of something is what impermanence is all about. It is the way of the world and we have to accept it. I hope Ah Loong and his family members understand this and are able to let go of this attachment. Both parties have to let go. If not, his consciousness will continue to wander and prevent his rebirth. <br><br>Difference between attachment and love <br><br>Real love has no attachments and asks for nothing in return. It is unconditional and accepts whatever one does — good deeds, bad deeds, coming and going. Love is good; attachment is not. Attachment brings suffering whereas loving-kindness brings happiness. We must differentiate between the two. <br><br>Remembering the Dead <br><br>The purpose of today’s dana is to transfer merits to the deceased. You’ve performed a number of meritorious deeds today. You’ve taken refuge in the Triple Gem, taken the 5 Precepts and offered food to the Sangha. We have given and listened to a Dhamma talk and chanted. If Ah Loong rejoices in these deeds, he will receive all the merits transferred to him. I hope he receives these merits and goes to a better place. Today’s dana is one way of fulfilling one of the responsibilities of the living towards the dead. <br><br>Transference of merits to the dead <br><br>This responsibility is expounded in the Tirokutta Sutta which tells of dead relatives coming back to the house when the living relatives are giving dana. <br><br>These departed relatives stand at the door, but because of previous bad kamma, no one remembers them. Those with compassion will offer good food to their dead relatives who will come and in return wish for a long and happy life for the living. The dead depends on the living for sustenance. This sutta likens these offerings for the dead to water flowing down a river. In the same way, the offerings will flow down to the dead. Considering the good deeds done for the living by the deceased while he was alive, the living should make offerings for his benefit. Lamentation, on the other hand, is no help to the dead. Offerings may include offerings to the Sangha, which give strength to the Sangha and bring the highest and lasting merits to the giver, according to the Buddha. <br><br>So, with this talk, I hope both the living and the departed would know what is of use and what is not, and would know what to do for the benefit of all.<br><br>Sadhu..

The Buddha was going there to expound the Dhamma cakkappavattana Sutta to the Panca Vaggis, his old associates, viz., Kondanna, Bhaddiya, Vappa, Assaji, and Mahanama. When Upaka saw Gotama Buddha, he was very much impressed by the radiant countenance of the Buddha and so said to him, "Friend, you look so serene and pure; may I know who your teacher is?" To him, the Buddha replied that he had no teacher.<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:<br><br>Verse 353: I have overcome all, I know all, I am detached from all, I have given up all; I am liberated from moral defilements having eradicated craving, (i.e., I have attained arahatship).

Each of them practised restraint of just one out of the five senses and each of them claimed that what he was practising was the most difficult. There were some heated arguments over this and they could not come to an agreement. Finally, they went to the Buddha to ask for his decision. The Buddha said to them, "Each of the senses is just as difficult to control as the other; but all bhikkhus must control all the five senses and not just one. Only those who control all the senses would escape from the round of rebirths."<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:<br><br>Verse 360: Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear; restraint in the nose is good, good is restraint in the tongue.<br><br><br>Verse 361: Restraint in body is good, good is restraint in speech; restraint in mind is good, good is restraint in all the senses. A bhikkhu restrained in all the senses is freed from all ills (Samsara dukkha).</p></div>

One day, while sitting with another bhikkhu after having their bath in the Aciravati River, he saw two swans flying at some distance. He told his friend that he would get one of the swans by throwing a stone at it. At that instant, the swan, hearing voices, turned its neck and the bhikkhu threw a pebble at the bird. The pebble went through one eye and came out of the other eye of the bird. The bird cried out in pain and agony and dropped dead at the feet of the young bhikkhu.<br><br>Other bhikkhus seeing the incident took the young bhikkhu to the Buddha. The Buddha reprimanded him and said, "My son, why have you killed this bird? Why especially you, a member of my Order, who should be practising loving-kindness to all beings and who should be striving ardently for liberation from the round of rebirths? Even during the period outside the Teaching, the wise practised morality and observed the precepts. A bhikkhu must have control over his hands, his feet and his tongue."<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:<br><br>Verse 362: He who controls his hand, controls his foot, controls his speech, and has complete control of himself; who finds delight in Insight Development Practice and is calm; who stays alone and is contented; — him they call a bhikkhu.</p></div>

              <p>"No, Most Honored One, the Buddha cannot be recognized by means of his bodily form. Why? Because when the Buddha speaks of bodily form, it is not a real form, but only an illusion."</p>
              <p>The Buddha then spoke to Subhuti: "All that has a form is illusive and unreal. When you see that all forms are illusive and unreal, then you will begin to perceive your true Buddha nature."</p>
