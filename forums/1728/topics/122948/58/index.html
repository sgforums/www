              <p>Without having basic faith that a particular teacher has understood the ultimate truth regarding life, one could not even begin to learn from him.  Faith here does not refer to placing faith in the Buddha as some almighty deity that can reward or punish.  Instead, what it points to here is having faith in the integrity and effectiveness of the Buddha's teachings to lead us out of suffering.</p>

                                      that stems limitless compassion from others.<br> <br> What I am saying is that intellectually cultivated bodhicitta is

              <p><br> Although I do not hold on tightly to an altruistic view but yes I
                                      believe when a practitioner fully actualized the view of 2 fold
                                      Emptiness, there is this free flowing compassion for all living
                                      beings. For lay practitioner, this aspect is not thoroughly
                                      manifested but for some great vajrayana or Mahayana masters, we
                                      witness such compassions. I do not see ‘Bodhicitta’ as a goal but
                                      rather as a natural quality of a sincere practitioner that has
                                      actualized the view of Emptiness.</p>

              <p>Thusness, early 2007:</p>
              <p><br> Since appearance is all there is and appearance is really the
                                                  source, what gives rise to the diversities of appearances?
                                                  Â“SweetnessÂ” of sugar isnÂ’t the Â“bluenessÂ” color of the sky. Same
                                                  applies to Â“AMnessÂ”Â…<img title="Mr. Green" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green"> all
                                                  are equally pure, no one state is purer than the other, only
                                                  condition differs. Conditions are factors that give appearances
                                                  their Â‘formsÂ’. In Buddhism, pristine awareness and conditions are
                                                  inseparable.<br> <br> Although there is non-dual in Adviata and no-self in Buddhism,
                                                  Adviata rest in an Â“Ultimate BackgroundÂ” (making it dualistic

                                                  whereas Buddhism eliminates the background completely and rest in
                                                  the emptiness nature of phenomena; arising and ceasing is where
                                                  pristine awareness is. In Buddhism, there is no eternality, only
                                                  timeless continuity (timeless as in vividness in present moment but
                                                  change and continue like a wave pattern). There is no changing
                                                  thing, only change.</p>

              <p>..........</p>
              <p>The Â‘NowÂ’ has no identity, no image and no sameness. Not a
                                                  background and is not a container for things to manifest. When free
                                                  of concepts, free of the bondage and the need for a background, the
                                                  Â‘thatÂ’, the Â‘itÂ’, the arising and subsiding phenomena is the
                                                  presence.<br> <br> There is no changing thing, there is only change. Things are
                                                  cognized.<br> The ever becoming has no end and does not begin. No one particular
                                                  moment is all of it and yet, no moment isnÂ’t it. Neither is there
                                                  an Â‘AllÂ’ to this stream as Â‘AllÂ’ has no meaning in an endless
                                                  stream of becoming.<br> <br> Look, see and point to the mountain, listen to the drumbeats of
                                                  footsteps, hear the chirping birds; without overlaying symbols,
                                                  free of concepts, delimited not by a body, not affect by the
                                                  imprints of senses, undefined by languages, all is and are the
                                                  Pristine Awareness.<br> <br> Yet the entire beauty, richness, fabric and texture of this so
                                                  lucidly clear and real, does not remain even for a moment,
                                                  instantaneously it is gone. Embrace "this instantaneously gone" and
                                                  embrace Â“let ariseÂ”, this is its nature, simply so.</p>

              <p>...........</p>
              <p>The sensation of Isness 'as it is' is a feeling of clarity. It
                                              is an expression that the mind is not adding or subtracting
                                              anything from that clarity. But in most cases, Isness is to some
                                              extend very much mixed up with thoughts (dualistic). There are
                                              varying degree of clarity to this experience of Isness.<br> <br> There will come a time where the mind/body just dropped completely.
                                              There is absolutely no sensation of a background and a body. Then
                                              the vividness and clarity is only just the 'things' as the layering
                                              that divides disappear.<br> <br> If the mind/body drop-experience is stabilized, all experiences
                                              become shifted to the experience of awareness as 'Forms'. Seeing it
                                              as the 'Things', as everything. Experiencing Awareness is the same
                                              as experiencing the crystal clarity of 'things'. As long as there
                                              is 'things', existence, awareness IS. Awareness, IS and 'Things'
                                              are One. If this experience is stabilized, there is really no need
                                              to find 'where' it emanates from since everywhere merely IS. If the
                                              center is truly gone, emanation is right at the 'sound' heard,
                                              there and then. So we felt a Â‘centerÂ’, a Â‘placeÂ’, what we are
                                              feeling is an impression that is Â‘thought-boundÂ’. It is really the
                                              feeling of the Â‘ideaÂ’ in a more subtle form rather than awareness
                                              in its nakedness.<br> <br> Next when the mind is free of definitions and symbols, it loses all
                                              its 'quantitative' characteristics. Eternality for example, is not
                                              an endless duration from past to future; instead it is right in/at
                                              this instant; how deep, beautiful, real and clear it is in this
                                              instantaneous moment. All attributes (Realness, Luminosity, Unborn,
                                              Uncreated...etc) of Awareness are manifested instantly. How much we
                                              know about our pristine Awareness is determined by the quality of
                                              this moment of experience. In Buddhism it is what can be
                                              experienced in a speck of dust and all these have to do with the
                                              thoroughness of dropping the 'Self', every aspect of the 'Self' (as
                                              a container, as body, as habitual momentum). Do not place any limit
                                              on the experience of 'Isness', there is no depth to it...

              <p>...........</p>
              <p>IMO and from a spiritual practice point of view, any form of
                                          holdings is pain.<br> <br> Many times attachments are not obvious and we never realized how
                                          strong our attachments are until we are hit by crisis. This is what
                                          I experienced during financial crisis in 1997. Before that I
                                          thought I was not that attached to $$$ but when threaten by
                                          bankruptcy all sort of thoughts arised, including very evil ones.
                                          <img title="Embarassed" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed"><br> <br> To live in present moment from a practice perspective is to be in
                                          naked awareness, where awareness is completely clear, non-dual and
                                          unmolested. It is not seeking anything and awareness rest in its
                                          orginality. Puting this mind state into daily activities is known
                                          as non-action and does not carry karma and this is the difficult
                                          part. This is different from those '1 second manager' sort of
                                          concepts that train one to be effective and efficient in achieving
                                          goals.<br> <br> With regards to ur exams and utube example, it is a matter of being
                                          focus that requires u to 'jing and ding' in order to concentrate.
                                          In this case both are still attachment. If u study with ur best
                                          effort yet not affected by the the outcome, you are non-attached.

              <p>'Now' is an impression. 'Here' is an impression. The 'place
                                      where it emanates' is also an impression. If we attempt to find a
                                      'where', we are reacting to our dualistic momentum. This will
                                      create a 'split' and the sense of self will arise.<br> <br> Isness is the vivid and crystal clarity of a moment of phenomenal
                                      manifestation. It is awareness as 'things' and awareness as
                                      'forms'. All of what awareness is, is the phenomenal manifestation
                                      right there and then and it subsides instantaneously. If the 'sense
                                      of self' as a background, as body and as momentum hasn't dissolved
                                      thoroughly, there will be vagueness in the experience of Isness and
                                      the timelessness of an instant will not be appreciated.</p>

              <h4>“Beyond meditation practice, there is attitude. A beginner must 
              learn to cultivate what is called, “the poise of a dying man”. What is 
              this poise? It is the poise of knowing what is important and what is 
              not, and of being accepting and forgiving. Anyone who has ever been at 
              the bedside of a dying man will understand this poise. What would the 
              dying man do if someone were to insult him? Nothing. What would the 
              dying man do if someone were to strike him? Nothing. As he lay there, 
              would he scheme to become famous or wealthy? No. If someone who had once
               offended him were to ask him for his forgiveness would he not give it? 
              Of course he would. A dying man knows the pointlessness of enmity. 
              Hatred is always such a wretched feeling. Who wishes to die feeling 
              hatred in his heart? No one. The dying seek love and peace.”</h4>

              <div class="chapter">
              <p>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the 
              Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' sanctuary. Now at that time a certain monk 
              by the name of Elder<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn21/sn21.010.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> was one who lived alone and extolled the virtues of living alone. Alone
               he entered the village for alms, alone he returned, alone he sat 
              withdrawn [in meditation], alone he did walking meditation.</p>
              <p>Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival,
               having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, 
              they informed him: "Lord, there is a certain monk by the name of Elder 
              who lives alone and extols the virtues of living alone."</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One told a certain monk, "Come, monk. In my name, 
              call the monk named Elder, saying, 'The Teacher calls you, my friend.'"</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," the monk answered and, having gone to Ven. Elder, on arrival he said, "The Teacher calls you, my friend."</p>
              <p>"As you say, my friend," Ven. Elder replied. Then he went to the 
              Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. 
              As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "Is it true, 
              Elder, that you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord."</p>
              <p>"But how do you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone?"</p>
              <p>"Lord, alone I enter the village for alms, alone I return, alone I 
              sit withdrawn [in meditation], alone I do walking meditation. That is 
              how I live alone and extol the virtues of living alone."</p>
              <p>"There is that way of living alone, Elder. I don't say that there 
              isn't. Still, listen well to how your living alone is perfected in its 
              details, and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," Ven. Elder responded.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said: "And how is living alone perfected in its 
              details? There is the case where whatever is past is abandoned, whatever
               is future is relinquished, and any passion &amp; desire with regard to 
              states of being attained in the present is well subdued.<a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag" name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn21/sn21.010.than.html#fn-2">[2]</a> That is how living alone is perfected in its details."</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said it, the One Well-gone further said this:</p>
              <div class="freeverse">"All-conquering,
              all-knowing, intelligent;
              with regard to all things,
              	unadhering;
              all-abandoning,
              released in the ending of craving:
              <em>him</em> I call

              offerings, &amp; fame are a cruel thing, a harsh, bitter obstacle to the
               attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondage.</p>
              <p>"Have you heard the jackal howling in the last hours of the night?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord."</p>
              <p>"That jackal is suffering from mange. He finds no pleasure whether he
               goes to a bluff, to the foot of a tree, or to the open air. Wherever he
               goes, wherever he stands, wherever he sits, wherever he lies down, he 
              is sunk in misery.</p>
              <p>"In the same way there is the case where a certain monk is conquered 
              by gains, offerings, &amp; fame, his mind consumed. He finds no pleasure
               whether he goes to an empty dwelling, to the foot of a tree, or to the 
              open air. Wherever he goes, wherever he stands, wherever he sits,

              <p>"Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will put aside any gains, 
              offerings, &amp; fame that have arisen; and we will not let any gains,

              <p>Buddha:</p>
              <p><br>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near 
              Savatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Now on that 
              occasion the Blessed One was sitting out in the open in the pitch black 
              of the night, while oil lamps were burning. Many flying insects were 
              meeting their downfall and misfortune in those oil lamps. The Blessed 
              One saw those flying insects meeting their downfall and misfortune in 
              those oil lamps.<br><br>Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:<br></p>
              <ul>
              Rushing headlong, missing what's essential,<br>bringing on one new bond<br> after another,<br>like insects falling into the flame,<br>some are intent only on what's seen &amp; heard.

              Loppon Namdrol:
              
              Causes and effects are not the same, nor are they different. 
              
              The mind that takes rebirth is not as same as the previous mind nor is it different. 
              
              This is the reason why it is possible for sentients beings to experience serial rebirth through the appropriation of an infinite series of new physical bodies over time, relatively speaking. 
              
              By saying that there is no actual rebirth, one is committing oneself to a metaphysical position called ucchedavada i.e. annihilationism. Commiting oneself to the position that there is an actual self, person, or entity that is reborn is called Å›Ä�Å›vatavÄ�da, eternalism. 
              
              But when one understands that one instant of mind is neither the same nor different than the next instant of mind; since they are not the same, one avoids Å›Ä�Å›vatavÄ�da; and since they are not different, one avoids ucchedavada â€” thus one can understand the truth of rebirth, karma and its result, and dependent origination in the manner in which the Buddha intended and leave off the metaphysical speculations that plague non-Buddhists about such issues. One can then also understand that since the mind has no beginning, it never arose; and since it never arose, it never ceases.

              If one hopes that something will manifest from outside oneself, instead of continuing in the presence of one's own State, this is like the saying that tells about an evil spirit coming to the Eastern gate, and the ransom to buy him off being sent to the Western gate. In such a case, even if one believes one is meditating perfectly, in reality, it's just a way of tiring oneself out for nothing. So continuing in the State which one finds within oneself is really the most important thing. If one neglects that which one has within oneself and instead seeks something else, one becomes like the beggar who had a precious stone for a pillow, but not knowing it for what it was, had to go to such great pains to beg for alms for a living.
              
              Therefore, maintaining the presence of one's own State and observing the wave of thought, without judging whether this presence is more or less clear, and without thinking of the calm state and the wave of thought in terms of the acceptance of the one and the rejection of the other, absolutely not conditioned by wanting to change anything whatsoever, one continues without becoming distracted, and without forgetting to keep oneâ€™s awareness present; governing oneself in this way one gathers the essence of the practice.
              
              Some people are disturbed when they hear noises made by other people walking, talking and so on, and they become irritated by this, or else becoming distracted by things external to themselves, they give birth to many illusions. This is the mistaken path known as 'the dangerous passageway in which external vision appears to one as an enemy'. What this means is that, even though one knows how to continue in the knowledge of the condition of both the state of calm and the wave of thought, one has not yet succeeded in integrating this state with one's external vision. If this should be the case, while still always maintaining present awareness, if one sees something, one should not be distracted, but, without judging what one sees as pleasant, one should relax and continue in the presence. If a thought arises judging experience as pleasant and unpleasant, one should just acknowledge it with bare attention and continue in present awareness without forgetting it. If one finds oneself in an annoying circumstance, such as surrounded by a terrible row, one should just acknowledge this disagreeable circumstance and continue in present awareness, without forgetting it.
              
              If one does not know how to integrate the presence of awareness with all one's daily actions, such as eating, walking, sleeping, sitting, and so on, then it is not possible to make the state of contemplation last beyond the limited duration of a session of sitting meditation.

              Correct. The bliss of karmaudra practice is just a tool. In the lamdre system, it is called the practice of small bliss and emptiness and is connected with the third consecration. It does not produce a final result since it works by purifying the the white and red bodhicitta. For that, you need the practices of the jÃ±Ä�navÄ�yu, the wisdom winds (albiet still practiced with either sort of mudra), termed in Lamdre, great bliss and emptiness -- the practice that transforms the karmavÄ�yus into jÃ±Ä�navÌ„ayus -- thus resulting in rainbow body, as in Dzogchen. 
              
              The main advantage of Dzogchen togal over these practices is that a) it does not require a consort b) it does not require the step by step purification of the four mandalas through the two stages (i.e. the outer body channel mandala, the inner channel syllable mandala, the bodhicitta mandala, and the vÄ�yu mandala). This is why togal is sometimes equated with the completion stage practices of the gsar ma system. 
              
              The practice of tregchÃ¶, the inseperabilty of samsara and nirvana of Sakya, mahÄ�mudra of Kagyu, and clear light nature of the mind of the Gelugpas have essentially the same point i.e. cultivating a momentary unfabricated awareness. 
              
              Dzogchenpas maintain however that this cultivation of a momentary unfabricated awareness by itself will not result in rainbow body, but rather, will result only in the the body dissolving at death into subtle particles. In Nyingma, Sakya and Gelug, it seems this cultivation of a momentary unfabricated awareness forms the basis for the pratice the two stages, whereas Kagyu dissents, and asserts that this meditation alone can be sufficient for a person of supreme caliber. 
              
              In any event, the main point of the view in all four (or five if we included Jonang) schools is the experiential cultivation of a momentary unfabricated awareness. Other than that, the main differences are terminolgies related to the specifics of each schools presentation of their respective paths and methodologies.
