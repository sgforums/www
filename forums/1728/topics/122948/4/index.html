            <div class='col-md body'>"If one can really come to that state of saying, "I do not know," it indicates an extraordinary sense of humility; there is no arrogance of knowledge; there is no self-assertive answer to make an impression. When you can actually say, "I do not know," which very few are capable of saying, then in that state all fear ceases because all sense of recognition, the search into memory, has come to an end; there is no longer inquiry into the field of the known. Then comes the extraordinary thing. If you have so far followed what I am talking about, not just verbally, but if you are actually experiencing it, you will find that when you can say, "I do not know," all conditioning has stopped. And what then is the state of the mind? ...<br><br>We are seeking something permanent Â– permanent in the sense of time, something enduring, everlasting. We see that everything about us is transient, in flux, being born, withering, and dying, and our search is. But that which is truly sacred is beyond the measure of time; it is not to be found within the field of the known". - J.Krishnamurti</div>

Watching is tremendously alive, every moment a vacancy. Watching without a single thought, watching every reaction, watching without identity, only endlessly watching, you are not really awake, you are absent minded, not all there; you are not you but watching. There is no thinker watching the thought, the thinker is the thought. Somebody passes by you and wonders what you are watching. You are watching nothing, and in that nothingness everything is."   - J Krishnamurti</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day a stranger walked by. "Spare some change?" mumbled the beggar, "I have nothing to give you," said the stranger. Then he asked: "What's that you're sitting on?" "Nothing, " replied the beggar. "Just an old box. I've been sitting on it for as long as I can remember. "Ever look inside?," asked the stranger. "No," said the beggar. "What's the point, there's nothing in there." "Have a look inside," insisted the stranger. The beggar, reluctantly, managed to pry open the lid. With astonishment, disbelief, and elation, he saw that the box was filled with gold.<br><br>I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look inside. Not inside any box, as in the parable, but somewhere even closer: inside yourself.<br><br>Eckhart Tolle, from The Power of NOW</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>....Any disturbing noise can be as helpful as silence. How? By dropping your inner resistance to the noise, by allowing it to be as it is, this acceptance also takes you into that realm of inner peace that is stillness.<br><br>Whenever you deeply accept this moment as it is no matter what form it takes you are still, you are at peace.<br><br>Pay attention to the gap the gap between two thoughts, the brief, silent space between words in a conversation, between the notes of a piano or flute, or the gap between the in-breath and out-breath.<br><br>When you pay attention to those gaps, awareness of "something" becomes just awareness. The formless dimension of pure consciousness arises from within you and replaces identication with form.....<br><br>- Eckhart Tolle, Excerpt from 'Stillness Speaks'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Liberation</strong><br><br>Liberation or freedom is not really concerned with any particular essential aspect, quality, or state. It does not matter what essential state exists in the experience of liberation. If you are free from personality, you are free no matter what the state is. In the state of liberation the content of experience becomes unimportant. It is very ordinary. Nothing specific happens, no huge realization or mind shattering experience. It is the most natural state. It is so ordinary and so natural that when we have it, we don't know we have it. It is so uneventful that almost everyone goes in and out of it frequently. (Diamond Heart Book 2, pg 2)<br><br>----<br><br>Being liberated means there is no clinging to anything; there is no worry, no concern, no heaviness. The mind is not fixated, focused or bound to any particular content; you are aware of whatever arises in the mind, without effort, without even trying to be aware. You don't care whether you are sensing your Essence, or even whether your Essence is there. Whether you are happy or sad, whether a person is there with you or not, none of these things seem important. For the moment you are completely free from all the concerns in your life. This state can never be achieved by striving for it. It will just happen one day, and if you notice it you won't think it's a big deal. You'll go on eating your dinner or whatever you are doing. The moment it becomes a big deal, it's gone. (Diamond Heart Book 2, pg 3)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We are unable to experience the full power of Presence because we objectify reality.  Just like thoughts are objectified in art, a process is objectified into something concrete by ideas.  There must be an 'I' experiencing from moment to moment is an assumption, it is not reality.  When we do away with all labeling and become bare in attention, it is always this process, arising and ceasing from moment to moment and the reality of existence is<br><br>The entire field of Pure Awareness is truly an inter-dependent process, not an objectified entity.  'I' no matter how skillfully put, is always a form of holding (attachment) in disguised that results in separation.  Without it, experiencing becomes simple, lucid, complete and direct, there is no vagueness.  Presence is a free flow of pure awareness that is vibrantly clear and liberating.<br><br>When the 'I-Thought' that has been trapping us subsides, 'shadows' disappear, not only the images in terms of thoughts disappear, the entire body seems to disappear because everything is felt directly like a transparent mirror reflecting.  'Now' is this free flowing reflection.  This is the beauty and full power of the Presence.  GongggggÂ….how clear!<br><br>- Thusness</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"If you look deeply into the palm of your hand, you will see your parents and all generations of your ancestors. All of them are alive in this moment. Each is present in your body. You are the continuation of each of these people. To be born means that something which did not exist comes into existence. But the day we are "born" is not our beginning. It is a day of continuation. But that hould not make us less happy when we celebrate our "Happy Continuation Day."<br><br>Since we are never born, how can we cease to be? This is what the Heart Sutra reveals to us. When we have a tangible experience of non-birth and non-death, we know ourselves beyond duality. The meditation on "no separate self" is one way to pass through the gate of birth and death.<br><br>Your hand proves that you have never been born and you will never die. The thread of life has never been interrupted from time without beginning until now. Previous generations, all the way back to single-celled beings, are present in your hand at this moment. You can observe and experience this. Your hand is always available as a subject for meditation. "<br><br>Present Moment, Wonderful Moment by Thich Nhat Hanh</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The near enemies are qualities that arise in the mind and masquerade as genuine spiritual realization, when in fact they are only an imitation, servin to separate us from true feeling rather than connecting us to it...<br><br>The near enemy of lovingkindness is attachment...At first, attachment may feel like love, but as it grows it becomes more clearly the opposite, characterized by clinging, controlling, and fear.<br><br>The near enemy of compassion is pity, and this also separates us. Pity feels sorry for "that poor person over there," as if he were somehow different from us...<br><br>The near enemy of sympathetic joy (the joy in the happiness of others) is comparison, which looks to see if we have more of, the same as, or less than another...<br><br>The near enemy of equanimity is indifference. True equanimity is balance in the midst of experience, whereas indifference is a withdrawal and not caring, based on fear...<br><br>If we do not recognize and understand the near enemies, they will deaden our spiritual practice. The compartments they make cannot shield us for long from the pain and unpredictability of life, but they will surely stifle the joy and open connectedness of true relationships.<br><br>Jack Kornfield, A Path with Heart</div>
