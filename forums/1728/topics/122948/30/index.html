              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Whenever your mind is too high, it is necessary to crush your pride by remembering the instructions of the Buddha. Whenever your mind is too low, it needs to have inspiration. Whenever you face the objects of desire or hatred, see them as illusions and apparitions. Whenever you see unattractive things, see them as echoes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Whenever hurt comes to your body, accept it as the result of your karma. Mind leads phenomena. Mind is the main factor and forerunner of all actions. If one speaks or acts with a cruel mind, misery follows, as the cart follows the horse. Phenomena are led by the mind. Mind is the main factor and forerunner of all actions. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness follows, as a shadow follows its source. If we do not feel anxious about problems, our strength of mind can help us to bear even great sufferings easily. We will be able to feel them as being light and insubstantial like cotton. But if we harbor anxiety, it will make even small suffering intolerable. For example, while we are thinking of the beauty of a girl, even if we try to get rid of desire, we will only be burned. Similarly, if we concentrate on the painful characteristics of suffering, we will not be able to develop tolerance for it. Whenever problems come to us from beings or inanimate objects, if our minds gets used to perceiving only the suffering or the negative aspects of them, then even from a small negative incident great mental pain will ensue. For it is the nature of indulgence in any concept, whether suffering or happiness, that the experience of this happiness or suffering will thereby be intensified. As this negative experience gradually becomes stronger, a time will come when most of what appears before us will become the cause of bringing us unhappiness and happiness will never have a chance to arise. If we do not realize that the fault lies with our own mind’s way of gaining experience, and if we blame all our problems on the external conditions alone, then the ceaseless flame of habitual negative deeds such as hatred and suffering will increase in us. That is called: “All appearances arising in the form of enemies.”</span></p>

              <p>The Buddha attained the perfect peace of enlightenment long ago, but our minds are still confused and disturbed, and we are helplessly trapped in the cycle of birth ,death and suffering. The main reason for this is that the Buddha gave up his self-cherishing attitude long ago, whereas we are still very much attached to ours.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">     
                Once, while Lord Buddha was residing at Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, the
                monks were assembled to listen to the dhamma discourse. Lord Buddha went to
                the place and picking up some dust from the earth and putting it on his thumb
                nail asked the monks.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">     
                "O monks if the dust on my thumb nail is compared to the whole earth,
                which is more," the Lord Buddha asked (though knowing the answer). </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">     
                (Monks are generally of two categories: Those who just wear the robes and
                eat, after going round for alms-food, and those who fear the sufferings of
                samsara. Here it concerns both the categories.)</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">     
                The monks replied "O, Lord, the dust which is on your thumb nail, if
                compared to the whole earth is so little that it cannot be accounted for. The
                dust on the earth is much too abundant." </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">     
                When the monks thus replied, the Enlightened One continued to say
                "Monks, according to the example given, when people die and leave this
                existence those who are reborn as human beings are so few that they may be
                compared to the dust on my nail.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">     
                After leaving this human abode, people who are reborn in hell or become
                animals, ghosts, demons in the lower planes are as numerous as the dust on
                earth. Thus, the Lord gave a discourse that to become a human being is very
                difficult. (Sam 1/454)</span></p>

                After the discourse Lord Buddha continued to remind the monks, since it is so
                difficult to be a human being, as little as the dust on my finger nail, do
                not forget to practise dhamma while there is sasana.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">     
                When there was no time to give a discourse Lord Buddha would remind "Do
                not forget, practise dhamma." This was the usual reminder. In some
                places "Appamadena Sampadetha" "Be vigilant, practise and perfect
                yourselves" This is the usual utterance by Lord Buddha.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">     
                In saying "Do not forget, perfect yourselves in practising dhamma"
                does not mean to do ordinary merit so as to get the happiness of human
                beings, celestial beings and brahmas". What the Lord Buddha meant was to
                practise Satipatthana Vipassana so as to reach nibbana.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">     
                Why did the Lord Buddha remind us to practise Satipatthana Vipassana? To
                become Enlightened, Lord Buddha had practised dhamma for four incalculables
                (asankheyya) and a hundred thousand world cycles (kappas) without caring for
                His physical body and life. The purpose is not for all beings to get the
                happiness of human life, celestial life and brahma. This is not the aim in
                perfecting Himself without caring for His life and physical body.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">     
                It is for Himself and all beings to be free from apaya and all kinds of
                suffering and reach nibbana, that He accumulated merit. That is why He said
                do not forget to practise satipatthana vipassana to reach nibbana. </span></p>

Your stay is but short and the moment of your departure unknown. None can live without toil and a craft that provides your needs is a blessing indeed. But if you toil without rest, fatigue and weariness will overtake you, and you will deny the joy that comes from labour’s end. Speak quietly and kindly and be not forward with either opinions or advice. If you talk much, this will make you deaf to what others say, and you should know that there are few so wise that they cannot learn from others. Be near when help is needed, but far when praise and thanks are being offered. Take small account of might, wealth and fame, for they soon pass and are forgotten. Instead, nurture love within you and strive to be a friend to all. Truly, compassion is a balm for many wounds. Treasure silence when you find it, and while being mindful of your duties, set time aside, to be alone with yourself. Cast off pretense and self-deception and see yourself as you really are. Despite all appearances, no one is really evil. They are led astray by ignorance. If you ponder this truth always you will offer more light, rather than blame and condemnation. You, no less than all beings have Buddha Nature within. Your essential Mind is pure. Therefore, when defilements cause you to stumble and fall, let not remorse nor dark foreboding cast you down. Be a good cheer and with this understanding, summon strength and walk on. Faith is like a lamp and wisdom make the flame burn bright. Carry this lamp always and in good time the darkness will yield and you will abide in the Light. </span><span>Dhammavadaka.</span></p>

              <p>I was sharing with a teenager weeks ago that nothing in this world is 
              certain, except death and many a times we forgot that we are dying and we will 
              all eventually die. If only we remember this truth, we probably would have less 
              hang ups. Then I left it as it is as we got distracted to other topics.</p>
              <p>To my surprise, this unintentional talk actually stayed in this teenager's 
              mind. Last night she told me that recently she has been thinking about in years 
              to come she'll be old and in no time she'll die and admits that its still a very 
              scary thought and finds it difficult to accept that death is part of life. Then 
              she asked me isn't this way of thinking a very pessimistic approach and it 
              actually makes her feels life has no joy if she has to keep worrying about 
              death.</p>
              <p>We then discussed about if we know that we are dying tomorrow, would today's 
              disagreement with friends still matters? Would we still bother to think of past 
              grudges, future's unknown hopes and fear? Wouldn't we be cherishing more of this 
              present moment, thus our mind is more free and light. Wouldn't we be kinder 
              since its pointless to still be nasty since we know that we are dying and our 
              ideals would no longer matters as much?</p>
              <p>We concluded that contemplating death is not a pessimistic approach but 
              actually reminds us to cherish this present moment. And she told me that should 
              her friends have any future disagreement, she'll tell them any of them may just 
              die tomorrow, therefore its pointless to quarrel and should rather cherish their 
              friendship.</p>
              <p>I find it very encouraging, esp teenagers who appreciate the Dharma, Truths 
              and actually take a step more to contemplate about it. At this fun loving age, 
              death is not a topic they are even interested to hear, what's more discuss and 
              contemplate on. This also breaks my concept that teenagers are only limited to 
              hearing certain topics, can only discuss with them till certain depth.</p>
              <p>If you all have more points to add on to what I've discuss with the teenager, 
              pls feel free to add your input!</p>
              <p>Bye and Good Morning!</p>

              <p>When the Buddha was alive, he said to the Kalamas:</p>
              <p>Now look,you Kalamas.Be not misled by report or tradition or heresay.Be not misled by proficiency in the collections, nor by reason or logic nor after reflection on and approval of some theory; nor because it conforms with one's inclination nor out of respect for the presitge of a teacher.</p>
              <p>But Kalamas,when you know for yourselves, these things are unwholeshome, these things are blameworthy,these things are censured by the intelligent; these things when practiced and observed are conducive to welfare and happiness; then Kalamas should you, having practiced them, abide therein.</p>
