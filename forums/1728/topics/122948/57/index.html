              If we can be patient with others' insult and ridicule, and not to calculate how much others have taken advantage of us and not to worry, then karmic conditions from previous lives will just go away.

              if we see things that are not right, turn around and exam ourselves first. --Confucians
              
              If you are a true cultivator,
               You see not the faults of the world;
               If you see the wrongs of others,
               You have fallen into the wrong path.
               Others find fault but I do not,
               If I find fault then I am at fault;
               Only remove this fault finding mind,
               And all Kleshas would be broken. --Master Hui Neng
              
              What is appearing is merely a manifestation of imprints in my mind. This is my karma.
               The only "definitive truth" for Buddhism is the absolute negation of any one truth as the Definitive Truth. -- HH Dalai Lama
              
              The object is never the source of your problems. We blame and criticize others because we don't like suffering. But if we don't like suffering, we should not harm others and create disharmony; this is what interferes with our happiness. What we want and what we are doing are opposite.
               The time is now~ Practice is not for another time or another place or another person~It is not differences that divide us; it's our judgments that do~Lama Zopa~

Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.Â” - Matthew 7:1-5

                           You'll have to start anew."-Ven. Tipitaka master Hsuan Hua.
                          
                          
                          tis a beautiful piece by Dharma Master Heng Sure, i hope we can post more of such teachings!
                          
                          Don't discuss the faults of others. "Others" are just thoughts in your own head. What you see as a fault in someone else comes from your discriminating mind.
                          
                           Others' faults are just my own. You should return the light all the time. Shine the light on the projections of the mind and get to work crossing them over.
                          
                           Being of the same substance is called Great Compassion. All thoughts come from the self-nature. When they filter up into the mind they get discriminated into good and bad, right and wrong. When the Bodhisattva practices Prajna wisdom and wipes away all thoughts as they arise, he is returning to his self-nature, to the original, fundamentally pure substance that he shares with all living beings. This is truly taking all living beings across.
                          
                           "At all times he nurtures them." He must do it constantly for Great Compassion to manifest.
                          
                           "At all times" in the Buddhist sense means from thought to thought, minute to minute, hour to hour, day to day, week to week, through months, years, life to life, kalpa to kalpa. Time loses its meaning. For the Bodhisattva who has vowed to save all living beings, one thought of purity, one act of Great Compassion extends throughout all time and space to the ends of the Dharma realm. What could be more liberated, more independent than the scope of Great Compassion?
                          
                           Practices are the measure of the Bodhisattva. In order to stay on the Middle Way he must maintain his Dharma-methods no matter what circumstances arise. If a good state appears he cannot turn from his practice. If an unpleasant scene develops, the Bodhisattva nurtures his practice all the same, taking tender care of his most valuable possession, the jewelled Dharma-raft that can ferry all beings from suffering to the other shore of bliss.
                           -Ven. Dharma Master Monk- Heng Sure</p>
              <p>Those of you who are in this Study, do not agitate your mind; let it
                           be like a mountain. Let your mind be like a wide and empty space and
                           continue to reflect on enlightening Dharma like the moon reflects the
                           sun. Whether others think that I am right or wrong is not your concern.
                           Do not judge or criticize others. Just be at ease and go on mindlessly
                           like a simpleton or fool. Or, be like one who is struck deaf and dumb.
                           Spend your life like you cannot hear a thing or like an infant. Then,
                           sooner or later, all the delusion will disappear.-VENERABLE MASTER KYUNG-HO'S

              <p>A tree makes no distinction in the shade it gives. Even so, the

              murderers, enemies and towards himself, thinking: "How may these beings

              <p><br>Kevin Solway, you should understand that there are two models of DO.
               The twelve links are the specific theory of DO applied to the process 
              of samsara. It is derived from the general theory of DO, "Where this 
              exists, that exists..." and so on. <br><br>The specific theory of DO also has four variations, serial, static, momentary and simultaneous. <br><br>Now,
               since the Buddha admonished Ananda for thinking DO was an easy read -- 
              what are we to make of your claim to have "understood" it before 
              encountering Buddhism?<br><br>In reality, DO is profound and subtle. DO 
              is also one of those things that when we first read it, we all say, 
              "wow, I already get that." But that does not mean we really understand 
              DO. It merely means we recognize the concept to be true. <br><br>N</p>

              In the world — many and varied —
              None are equal to the Dhamma.
              Drink of this, monks!

              The Prajnaparamita-samchayagatha states:
              
              Strive to achieve tranquil absorption
              Through uninterrupted contemplation
              On inner purity.
              Just as the striking of two flints
              With long pauses in between
              Will not cause sparks,
              So occasional meditation
              Will not lead to tranquility.
              Do not give up until perfection is achieved!

              Thus, past thought has ceased, the future is yet to emerge, and the present is difficult to penetrate. Being nonsubstantive and spacelike, the mind is colorless and shapeless. It is neither one nor many entities. Its nature is the unborn [void] and luminous awareness. By examining the mind with the weapon of logic, one will comprehend its nonreality.
              
              -----
              
              Settle the mind without discrimination in the nonconceptual expanse of reality.
              
              -----
              
              The infinity of reality is without center or horizon. Observe it with a deep nonconceptual mind, unobscured by any shadow of dullness or sensual incitement.

              <p>The nature of appearances is empty, that is correct. But then you 
              have to ask the question: do appearances arise? They seem to , but do 
              they? Do appearances remain, they seem to, but do they? Appearances seem
               to vanish. They seem to, but do they? When you understand that 
              appearances do not arise, remain, or vanish, then you understand the 
              emptiness of appearances. If appearances do not in reality arise, remain
               or vanish, how could their emptiness arise, remain or vanish? <br><br>N</p>
