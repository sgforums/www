              <p>A person responsive to requests, <br> sympathetic to all beings, <br> delighting in distributing alms: <br> "Give to them! <br> Give!" <br> he says. <br> As a cloud — resounding, thundering — rains, <br> filling with water, drenching <br> the plateaus &amp; gullies: <br> a person like this <br> is like that. <br> Having rightly amassed <br> wealth attained through initiative, <br> he satisfies fully with food &amp; drink <br> those fallen into <br> the homeless state.”</p>

              <p>The Brahmin Vassakara, an important man in Magadha, came to the Lord and said:  <br> “Good Gotama, for my part I say this, this is my opinion.  If anyone 
              speaks of what he has seen, heard or sensed, there is no harm in him 
              saying:  ‘This is what I saw.  This is what I heard.  This is what I 
              sensed.’  No harm can come from that.”  <br> The Lord then replied:  <br> “For my part, brahmin, I do not say that everything one has seen, heard
               or sensed should be spoken of, and nor I do not say it should not be 
              spoken of.  <br> If one speaks and unprofitable states grow, then one should not speak.  <br> If one speaks and profitable states grow, then one should speak of what one has seen, heard, sensed and understood.”</p>

              <p>In addition, a so called pandita is described as A scholar in the 
              foundation of outer and inner objects of knowledge. A so called kusali 
              is described as One who has the most dedication inwardly after severing 
              all outer distractions.
              In terms of actual perfect Buddhahood: the first, having become 
              knowledgeable about all objects of knowledge, has severed doubt through 
              hearing, reflection and meditation. Then, because of severing doubt 
              through meditating which makes samadhi essential, the pandita gradually 
              attains Buddhahood after actualizing the Dharma of realization. A kusali
               necessarily has the same basis, but when considered alone, a pandita is
               closer to Buddhahood.

              your disturbing emotions as well as an aid for allowing the pure Dharma 
              to take birth in your being, then that is called a Mahayana teaching and
               is unmistaken.<br>No matter how much you may be acclaimed as learned in
               study, exposition, and meditation, if your intention is only the eight 
              worldly concerns, your activity is called a black Dharma practice.</span><br>In
