            <div class='col-md body'><p>Mahamudra Free from Fixation<br>If you want to meditate on mahamudra you need to have an understanding of the lack of the true<br>existence of a self-entity of the individual, otherwise your perception of a personal self won’t<br>diminish. If you don’t have certainty about the lack of a self-entity of the individual, then you’ll<br>fixate in your mahamudra meditation. You’ll fixate on the meditator and you’ll fixate on the<br>object of meditation and on the means of meditation. This kind of conceptual fixation will<br>obscure your practice. You’ll be obscured by your own thoughts, of there being a truly existent<br>meditator, a truly existent object of meditation, and a meditation technique.<br>— From Talks on Mahamudra Shamatha: A commentary on the Shamatha section of<br>Mahamudra – The Ocean of Definitive Meaning by the Ninth Gyalwang Karmarpa,<br>Wangchuk Dorje, translated by Elizabeth Callahan, Dechen Chöling, 2002.</p></div>

              <p>I ask you, O Blessed One.
              Please tell me.
              I regard you as knowledgeable,
              with your self developed.
              From what have the many
              forms of stress &amp; suffering
              arisen in the world?</p>
              <p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
              <p>If you ask me
              the coming-into-being
              of stress &amp; suffering,
              I will tell it to you
              	as one who discerns.
              From acquisition <a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.5.04.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> as cause
              the many forms of stress &amp; suffering
              come into being in the world.
              Whoever, unknowing, makes acquisitions
              	— the fool —
              comes to stress &amp; suffering
              	again
              	&amp; again.
              So one who's discerning,
              	focused on the birth
              	of stress &amp; suffering,
              	their coming-into-being,
              should make no acquisitions.</p>
              <p class="spkr">[Mettagu:]</p>
              <p>What we asked, you've expounded.
              Now we ask something else.
              	Please tell us.
              How do the prudent
              cross over the flood of
              	birth &amp; aging,
              	lamentation &amp; sorrow?
              Please, sage, declare this to me
              	as this Dhamma has
              	been known by you.</p>
              <p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
              <p>I will teach you the Dhamma
              	— in the here &amp; now,
              	not quoted words —
              knowing which, living mindfully,
              you'll cross over beyond
              entanglement in the world.</p>
              <p class="spkr">[Mettagu:]</p>
              <p>And I relish, Great Seer,
              that Dhamma 	supreme,
              knowing which, living mindfully,
              I'll cross over beyond
              entanglement in the world.</p>
              <p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
              <p>Whatever you're alert to,
              	above, below,

              		to those things,
              consciousness should not take a stance
              		in becoming.
              The monk who dwells thus
              	— mindful, heedful —
              letting go of his sense of <em>mine,</em> knowing right here would abandon
              		birth &amp; aging,
              	lamentation &amp; sorrow,
              		stress &amp; suffering.</p>
              <p class="spkr">[Mettagu:]</p>
              <p>I relish, Gotama, the Great Seer's words
              well-expounded, without acquisition,
              for yes, O Blessed One,
              you've abandoned stress &amp; suffering
              as this Dhamma has
              been known by you.
              And they, too, would abandon stress &amp; suffering
              	those whom you, sage,
              	would admonish unceasingly.
              Having met you, I bow down to you,
              		Great One.
              Perhaps you will admonish me
              		unceasingly.</p>
              <p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
              <p>Whoever you recognize
              as a knowledgeable brahman,
              	possessing nothing,
              	unentangled
              	in sensuality &amp; becoming
              yes, he has crossed over the flood.
              Having crossed to the far shore,
              	he is without
              	harshness or doubt.
              And any one who has realized,

            <div class='col-md body'>The easiest thing in the world to do is walk naked, and the hardest. We have to take off the clothes we put on in which to admire ourselves. If we don't, then we never see the truth of ourselves. We are naked to others even if we think we are clothed. ~ Malcolm, aka Loppon Namdrol</div>

              <p>§ 48. “For a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma,<br>this is what accords with the Dhamma: that he keep cultivating disenchantment<br>with regard to form, that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to<br>feeling, that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to perception, that<br>he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to fabrications, that he keep<br>cultivating disenchantment with regard to consciousness. As he keeps cultivating<br>disenchantment with regard to form… feeling… perception… fabrications…<br>consciousness, he comprehends form… feeling… perception… fabrications…<br>consciousness. As he comprehends form… feeling… perception… fabrications…<br>consciousness, he is totally released from form… feeling… perception…<br>fabrications… consciousness. He is totally released from sorrows, lamentations,<br>pains, distresses, &amp; despairs. He is totally released, I tell you, from suffering &amp;<br>stress.” — SN 22:39</p>
              <p><br>§ 49. “Suppose that an archer or archer’s apprentice were to practice on a<br>straw man or mound of clay, so that after a while he would become able to<br>shoot long distances, to fire accurate shots in rapid succession, and to pierce great<br>masses. In the same way, there is the case where a monk… enters &amp; remains in<br>the first jh›na: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed<br>thought &amp; evaluation. He regards whatever phenomena there that are<br>connected with form, feeling, perception, fabrications, &amp; consciousness, as<br>inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a<br>disintegration, an emptiness, not-self. He turns his mind away from those<br>phenomena, and having done so, inclines his mind to the property of<br>deathlessness: ‘This is peace, this is exquisite—the resolution of all fabrications;<br>the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion;<br>cessation; Unbinding.’</p>
              <p><br>52<br>“Staying right there, he reaches the ending of the effluents. Or, if not, then—<br>through this very Dhamma-passion, this Dhamma-delight, and from the total<br>wasting away of the first five Fetters [self-identity views, grasping at precepts &amp;<br>practices, uncertainty, sensual passion, and irritation]—he is due to be reborn (in<br>the Pure Abodes), there to be totally unbound, never again to return from that<br>world….<br>[Similarly with the second, third, and fourth jh›na.]<br>“…. Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw<br>man or mound of clay, so that after a while he would become able to shoot long<br>distances, to fire accurate shots in rapid succession, and to pierce great masses. In<br>the same way, there is the case where a monk… enters &amp; remains in the<br>dimension of the infinitude of space. He regards whatever phenomena there that<br>are connected with feeling, perception, fabrications, &amp; consciousness, as<br>inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a<br>disintegration, an emptiness, not-self. He turns his mind away from those<br>phenomena, and having done so, inclines his mind to the property of<br>deathlessness: ‘This is peace, this is exquisite — the resolution of all fabrications;<br>the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion;<br>cessation; Unbinding.’</p>
              <p><br>“Staying right there, he reaches the ending of the effluents. Or, if not, then—<br>through this very Dhamma-passion, this very Dhamma-delight, and from the<br>total wasting away of the first five of the fetters—he is due to be reborn (in the<br>Pure Abodes), there to be totally unbound, never again to return from that<br>world…. ”</p>
              <p><br>[Similarly with the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness and the<br>dimension of nothingness.] — AN 9:36</p>

              <p>While reading the sutras, disciple ask Buddha, what Buddha said about the other shore(Nirvana), i cannot see it. How can i believe it's true? So Buddha bring the disciple into a dark room and told the disciple that on the wall, there hang a hammer. Disciple replied, it's too dark, i cannot see it. Buddha then light a candle, and indeed there hang a hammer on the wall. Buddha told the disciple, what you cannot see, does not mean it does not exist.</p>

              "Letting the mind to become peaceful and staying in meditation state of stillness free from many thoughts is called shamata or sustained calm. Recognizing the empty nature of the mind within that state of calm is called vipashyana or profound insight. Uniting shamata and vipashyana is the essence of meditation practice. It is said:
                  
              Look at the mind,
              There is nothing to see.
              Seeing nothing, we see the Dharma,
              The source of all buddhas."
