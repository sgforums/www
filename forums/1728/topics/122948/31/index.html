              LAZY. We do not bother to bring ourselves back to the present because we're too

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">What is the ultimate method of cultivation?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">What is deemed 
                            to be the ultimate cultivation? This is not an easy matter. I have yet 
                            to reach the ultimate, so if you want me to speak of the ultimate method, 
                            I am lost for words. However, I know of one way which can be described 
                            by two words: "let go". From this moment on, you learn to let go, begin 
                            let go, and continue to let go until you become Buddha. After you have 
                            become Buddha, you still continue to let go of even the Buddha. Then, 
                            surely that is the ultimate!.<img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>
              <p>.</p>

              <p>.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> <br> A student once asked me about the ultimate method of cultivation in Buddhism. 
                        The answer is the method of letting go. Not only do we need to practise 
                        letting go now, the present, but also the past and future. We have to let 
                        go of all the distresses in our mind. Moreover, we have to let go of all 
                        notions of possession or attachments that we have. Even when we become Bodhisattvas 
                        or attain Buddhahood, the Buddha must be given up too. This is the only 
                        way of the true Buddha-Dharma.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Love Is Like a Mirror</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><br> The Mirror, as Zen masters say, is without ego and without mind. If a face
                          comes in front of it, it reflects a face. If a table comes by, it reflects a
                          table. It shows a crooked object to be crooked and a straight object to be
                          straight. Everything is revealed as it really is. There is no discriminating
                          mind or self-consciousness on the part of the mirror.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><br> If something comes, the mirror reflects it; if it moves on, the mirror lets it
                          move on. The mirror is always empty of itself and therefore able to receive the
                          other. The mirror has no preconditions for entry, no preconditions for
                          acceptance. It receives and reflects back what is there—nothing more or nothing
                          less. The mirror is the perfect lover and the perfect contemplative. It does
                          not evaluate, judge or act. It takes the advice of the philosopher
                          Wittgenstein: "Don't think, just look."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><br> If we are to see as God sees, we must first become mirrors. We must become
                          no-thing so that we can receive some-thing. That is probably the only way that
                          love is ever going to happen. To love demands a complete transformation of
                          consciousness, a transformation that has been the goal of all religious
                          founders, saints, mystics and gurus ever since we began to talk about love. And
                          the transformation of consciousness is this: we must be liberated from
                          ourselves.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><br> We really need to be saved from the tyranny of our own judgments, opinions and
                          feelings about everything, the "undisciplined squads of emotions"
                          that T.S. Eliot criticizes in his poetry. We must stop believing our false
                          subjectivity, which chooses to objectify everybody and everything in the
                          world—including God and our own soul.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">(The likely reason why most Western
                          individualists hate themselves: we treat our own souls as objects to be
                          dissected, judged and perfected.)</p>

              <p>Our normal way of relating people is to see ourself as separate from the others.</p>
              <p>To objectify beings as separate you and make them an object of attachment is to bring endless seeking, endless longing, and endless suffering. And hence, passion, emotion, attachment, and so on. All sentient beings are like that.</p>
              <p>But to recognise yourself (true self), in all beings, is true love. When we meet someone without seeing them as individual entities separate from us, with no labeling and no objectification, there is simply the act of love, or compassion, without separation resulting in lust. There is a 'recognition in oneness'.</p>
              <p>The problem is we will always hold onto an idea of separation and individuality, and become totally bonded, and this strong imprint will lead to suffering, if lets say we 'lose' someone (and in actuality there is no 'one' who can lose 'some other one'). We will then be lost in our stream of endless projection of someone separate from us, leading to separation, seeking, and suffering.</p>
              <p>But if suffering happens we cannot suppress or push it away, if suffering arise, we have to be completely honest and face the suffering fearlessly. To deny suffering is to deny <em>What Is</em>, and this denial will result in further suffering because there is no 'you' (a fiction) who can run away from <em>What Is</em>. There is only <em>What Is</em> at every moment... so if suffering arise at that moment, it has to be accepted.</p>
              <p>As you can see, the problem is not in love itself, but in the illusion of separation, grasping on individuality, lust, resulting in suffering.</p>
              <p>I am myself far from being free from such illusions, but I know of people who have reached that level. They are awakened. As longchen said, <em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>Yes, a fully enlightened being will not view what that is being
                                                                  see as external.</em></p>
              <p><em>There is no inner and outer. Likewise there is no separate
                                                                  persons and things out there.</em></p>
              <p><em>There is no out there. There is no inside. All is one
                                                                  reality.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That being said, as a lay person, it's important not to be too attached to someone or anything, and contemplate on the impermanence and death. But the ultimate 'solution' is not throwing away your wife or belongings (I know of many enlightened people who still have family and children), it is to realise deeply the non-dual reality, without separation, without self and others, without birth and dying, coming or going... the non-dual reality that encompasses everything. It transform our 'dualistic love' to the great love of Bodhisattvas, which is non-dualistic, and unconditional for all beings.</p>

              <p>You will still live happily with your wife/husband, you still love him/her and can show care and affection, but you will not be lost in the illusion of separation and individuality, seeking and suffering. One gradually lets go of strong grasping, but it doesn't mean 'indifference' and 'no concern'. You are still as concerned as before.</p>
              <p>Because of having lived with your family for a long time, of course the way you relate to your family is still different from how you relate to others. It's all 'conditions'/yuan, which sometimes become related with 'affinity'. A family shows an affection and concern for each other unlike outside a family.</p>
              <p>But certainly realisation can 'widen one's scope' and lead to an all encompassing and unconditional love, if you're a bodhisattva. Certainly I don't expect a true bodhisattva showing love for his children while being an asshole to other motherly sentient beings.</p>

                                suffering fearlessly. To deny suffering is to deny <em>What
                                Is</em>, and this denial will result in further suffering because
                                there is no 'you' (a fiction) who can run away from <em>What
                                Is</em>. There is only <em>What Is</em> at every moment... so if

              <p>And if suffering arise, the only way is to be so complete present with our pain without denying anything, just stay at bare naked awareness of our present experience without labelling and judging as good or bad. To be so totally present that the bonds and projections can gradually subside.</p>
              <p>We have to train ourselves in the first place, to be completely present in our everyday living, not to live in our projections and dreams. Otherwise when suffering comes, we'll not be any better, i.e. our 'painful stories' will repeat itself over and over again in our heads.</p>
              <p>We have to know a different mode of knowing, an effortless, silence, blissful, complete clarity pervading our field of awareness, that every cells of our body and everything we see and feel, feels alive, is aliveness itself. The perfect, silent, brilliant wholeness experienced void of a self feels so complete and blissful that the dead story of an 'I' will not 'appeal' that much any longer.</p>
