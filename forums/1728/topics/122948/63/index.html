              Do not fight against pain; do not fight against irritation or jealousy. Embrace them with great tenderness, as though you were embracing a little baby. Your anger is yourself, and you should not be violent toward it. The same thing goes for all your emotions.

              ALTRUISM AND INNER PEACE We humans are social beings. We come into the world as the result of othersâ€™ actions. We survive here in dependence on others. Whether we like it or not, there is hardly a moment of our lives in which we do not benefit from othersâ€™ activities. For this reason it is hardly surprising that most of our happiness arises in the context of our relationships with others. Nor is it so remarkable that our greatest joy should come when we are motivated by concern for others. But that is not all. We find that not only do altruistic actions bring about happiness, but they also lessen our experience of suffering. Here I am not suggesting that the individual whose actions are motivated by the wish to bring others happiness necessarily meets with less misfortune than the one who does not. Sickness, old age, mishaps of one sort or another are the same for us all. But the sufferings which undermine our internal peaceâ€”anxiety, doubt, disappointmentâ€”these are definitely less.Â

              â€œâ€¦we should see that every event, every thing in this entire world is a time.â€�
              Shobogenzo, Uji, Hee-Jin Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, p.224-225
              
              
              
              The self arrays itself and sees itself in array. This is the principle of the self being time.
              
              We should learn that, because of this principle, myriad phenomena and countless things exist throughout the entire earth, and that each and every particularity, be it of a thing or of phenomenon, exists as the entire earth. Such a consideration is the beginning of trainingâ€¦
              
              Because there is no other time than this very moment, â€œexistence-timeâ€� is always entire time.

              By understanding everything you perceive from the perspective of the view, you are freed from the constraints of philosophical beliefs.
              By understanding that any and all mental activity is meditation, you are freed from arbitrary divisions between formal sessions and postmeditation activity.

              <p>Ted Biringer:</p>
              <p>Dogen’s emphasis on the phenomenal nature of dharmas serves to
                                      underscore their real, spatial-temporal, manifest existence.
                                      According to Dogen the true nature (essential reality, emptiness)
                                      of each and all particular dharmas is “as it is” (thusness). The
                                      significance of this becomes clearer as our study and practice
                                      increasingly expands our realization of the Buddhist principles of
                                      nonduality.</p>
              <p>Let us try to bring all this together by considering Dogen’s
                                      treatment of a saying by Daie Soko (Dogen’s archetypal symbol for
                                      unreliable Zen masters):</p>
              <p>A certain monk called Meditation Master Daie SÅ�kÅ�, once
                                      said:</p>
              <p>Folks today are fond of talking about mind and talking about
                                      nature, and because they are fond of talking about profundities and
                                      talking about wonders, they are slow to realize the Way. Since mind
                                      and nature form a duality, once these folks have discarded this
                                      duality, and have forgotten all about the profound and the wondrous
                                      as well, then dualities will no longer arise, and they will
                                      experience the Truth that the Buddha promised them.</p>
