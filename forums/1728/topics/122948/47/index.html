              <p>From the day the Lord said: "Four months from now, I will attain final Nirvana", thousands of men came to wait upon him. Those who had not yet attained the fruits of Stream-Winning could not restrain their tears; those who had not attained enlightenment experienced deep emotion, and walked around in small groups, saying: "What will we do?" But one monk named Dhammarama kept separate from the other monks, and when asked: "What is the matter with you?" -he gave no reply. He had thought to himself: "The Lord has said that four months from now he will attain final Nirvana and I still have not freed myself from desire. Thus, while the Lord lives I will struggle to attain enlightenment." <br>   </p>
              <p> Accordingly, Dhammarama kept to himself recollecting, pondering and calling to mind the Lord's Dhamma. The monks went to the Tathagata and said: "Reverend Sir, Dhammarama has no affection for you. Since you announced your final Nirvana four months from now, he has nothing to do with us." The Lord had Dhammarama called to him and asked: "Is it true what they say, that you have nothing to do with the other monks?" <br>    "Yes, reverend sir, it is true." <br>    "Why do you do this?" <br>    "I do it thinking thus: the Lord has said that four months from now he will attain final Nirvana, and I have not freed myself from desire. Thus, while the Lord lives I will struggle to attain enlightenment. Accordingly, I keep to myself, recollecting, pondering and calling to mind the Lord's Dhamma. <br>    "Excellent, monk, excellent," said the Lord. <br>    </p>
              <p>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Every monk should show his affection for me in the way Dhammarama has done. They who honour me with garlands, perfume and so on honour me not; but they that practise the Dhamma in all its parts- they honour me in the best way." <br><br>Dhammapada Atthakata 94</p>

              <p>Akkosaka of the Bharadvaja Brahmin clan heard that the leader of the clan had gone forth into the Sangha of the recluse Gotama. Angry and displeased, he went to where the Lord was and reviled and abused the Lord with rude, harsh words. <br>    When he had finished, the Lord said: "What do you think, Brahmin? Do you receive visits from friends and acquaintances, kith and kin and other guests?" <br>    "Yes, Gotama, sometimes I do." <br>    "And what do you think? Do you prepare for them hard and soft food and give them rest?" <br>    "Yes, Gotama, sometimes I do." <br>    "And if they do not accept these things from you, whose do these things become?" <br>    "They become mine." <br>    "It is the same here, Brahmin. That with which you revile, scold and abuse me, who does not revile, scold or abuse, that I do not accept from you. It is yours, Brahmin. It belongs to you. <br>    One who reviles when reviled, who scolds when scolded, who abuses when abused - it is as if a host and a visitor dined together and made good. We, Brahmin, have not dined together nor have we made good. It is yours, Brahmin. It belongs to you. <br><br>Samyutta Nikaya I.161 <br></p>

Let my body not be like this.' But since the body is not the self, it is liable to affliction, and one cannot say: 'Let my body be like this. Let my body not be like this.' And it is the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. What do you think? Is body permanent or impermanent?" <br>    "Impermanent, sir." <br>    "Now, is what is impermanent painful or pleasant?" <br>    "Painful, sir." <br>    "Now, is it fit to regard what is impermanent and painful like this: 'This is mine, this is I, this is my self?" <br>    "No, sir." <br>    "And it is the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. So, any kind of body, feeling, perception, mental constructs or consciousness - whether past, present or future, whether gross or subtle, whether internal or external, whether inferior or superior, whether far or near - must with right understanding be regarded thus: 'This is not mine, this is not I, this is not myself.' When a noble disciple has heard this and sees this, he is detached from body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. Being detached, passions fade, with the fading of passions he is free, and when he is free he knows he is free. He knows: 'Birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what has had to be done is done, there is no more of this.' " <br><br>Samyutta Nikaya III.67</p></div>

He might hear someone speaking of the pleasure of a lovely, unstained, pure white cloth, and start searching to get one. But someone might deceive him by giving him a greasy, grimy, coarse robe and by saying: 'My good man, this is lovely, unstained, pure white cloth.' He might take it and put it on. Then his friends and relations might get a physician and surgeon to make medicine for him, potions, purgatives, ointments and treatment for his eyes. Because of this he might regain his sight and clarify his vision. <br>    Then the desire and attachment he had for that greasy robe would go, he would no longer consider the man who gave it to him a friend. He might even consider him an enemy, thinking: 'For a long time I have been defrauded, deceived and cheated by this man." Even so, if I were to teach you Dhamma, saying: 'This is that health, this is that Nirvana,' you might come to know health, you might see Nirvana. With the arising of that vision, the desire and attachment you had for the five clinging aggregates might go. <br>    You might even think: 'For a long time I have been defrauded, deceived and cheated by the mind, by clinging to body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciouness. Conditioned by this clinging there was becoming; conditioned by becoming there was birth; conditioned by birth, old age, dying, grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair came into being. This is the origin of this whole mass of suffering." <br>    And Magandiya said to the Lord: "I have confidence that if the good Gotama were to teach me Dhamma, I could rise from my seat no longer blind." <br><br>Majjhima Nikaya I.511 <br></p></div>

Don't say that. Being a friend with admirable people, a companion with admirable people, a colleague with admirable people is actually the <strong>whole</strong> of the holy life. When a monk is a friend with admirable people, a companion with admirable people, a colleague with admirable people, it is to be expected of him that he will develop the noble eightfold path, and make much of it. . . . And through this line of reasoning one may know how being a friend with such people is actually the whole of the holy life: It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth, that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging, that beings subject to death have gained release from death, that beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress &amp; despair have gained release from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress &amp; despair."               <em> SN XLV.2 </em></span></p>
