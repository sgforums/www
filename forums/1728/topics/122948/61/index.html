In the Buddha's biography, this point is illustrated by his refusal to rest content with the formless absorptions he mastered under his first two teachers. See MN 36.<br></p></div>

You die this side of a century, but even if you live past, you die of old age. People grieve for what they see as mine, for nothing possessed is constant, nothing is constantly possessed.[1] Seeing this separation simply as it is, one shouldn't follow the household life. At death a person abandons what he construes as mine. Realizing this, the wise shouldn't incline to be devoted to mine. Just as a man doesn't see, on awakening, what he met in a dream, even so he doesn't see, when they are dead — their time done — those he held dear. When they are seen &amp; heard, people are called by this name or that, but only the name remains to be pointed to when they are dead. Grief, lamentation, &amp; selfishness are not let go by those greedy for mine, so sages letting go of possessions, seeing the Secure, go wandering forth. A monk, living withdrawn, enjoying a dwelling secluded: they say it's congenial for him he who wouldn't, in any realm, display self. Everywhere the sage independent holds nothing dear or undear. In him lamentation &amp; selfishness, like water on a white lotus, do not adhere. As a water bead on a lotus leaf, as water on a red lily, does not adhere, so the sage does not adhere to the seen, the heard, or the sensed; for, cleansed, he doesn't construe in connection with the seen, the heard, or the sensed. In no other way does he wish for purity, for he neither takes on passion nor puts it away.[2]<br>Notes<br><br>1.<br>    "Nothing possessed is constant, nothing is constantly possessed" — two readings of the phrase, na hi santi nicca pariggaha.<br>2.<br>    Nd.I: An arahant has put passion totally away once and for all, and so has no need to do it ever again. An alternative explanation is that, as Sn 5.6 points out, the arahant has gone beyond all dhammas, dispassion included.<br></p></div>

              Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others. I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.

              Devadatta bribed the royal elephant keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nalagiri, intoxicated with toddy, on the road along which the Buddha would go, begging for alms. The Buddha was warned of this but disregarded the warning, and when the elephant appeared, Ananda, against the strict orders of the Buddha, threw himself in its path, and only by an exercise of iddhi-power (psychic power), including the folding up of the earth, could the Buddha come ahead of him. As the elephant approached, the Buddha addressed it, pervading it with his boundless love, until it became quite gentle. (This incident, with great wealth of detail, is related in several places - e.g., in J.v.333ff).

                                  think that we have understood the profound meaning of it. The very
                                  fact that it is non dual, it is not within fabrication. Not between
                                  two moments of thought; not between two moments of arising before
                                  thought.<br> <br> Meditate earnestlyÂ…Try to fuse into everything that comes into
                                  contact, every authentication. Experience the ultimate block as we
                                  move along, as we delve deeper, the witnessing consciousness, the
                                  center of all, becomes more obvious. When practices gain ground, it
                                  dissolves but in no time, it re-appears. Are we able to come so
                                  close to it and see it?<br> <br> There is absolutely no observer; the experience of the Witnessing
                                  Consciousness must face its ultimate challenge. Only when a
                                  practitionerÂ’s mind is tremendously attentive, vivid, sharp, alive
                                  and clear can he then be ready. Ready to see each and every single
                                  moment of arising that makes up the stream and how each moment
                                  succeeds to the next moment; how the Witnessing Observer that we
                                  have treasured so deeply is in essence an illusion. This is not an
                                  intellectual quest; a gross mind cannot touch the true nature. The
                                  entire purpose of the doctrine of Anatta and Emptiness is to
                                  prepare us, ready us for this moment to come. To bear witness of
                                  the precious teachings of the Blessed One the truth of the
                                  instantaneous moment of arising and ceasing that makes up the
                                  stream. With this awakening, one sees the truth that the ultimate
                                  purpose of all practices is to lead us to the insight that
                                  enlightenment has no attainment.</p>

              </div>
              <p>I wrote a pm to longchen, think it is good for u too.
                                  <img title="Smile" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"><br> <br> Just to share some of my opinions. What you said is one aspect of
                                  Emptiness -- the emptiness of self (doctrine of Anatta). There is
                                  another aspect of Emptiness you might want to explore further
                                  (meditative experience), but before going into it, I would like
                                  just to highlight the importance of the experience of Anatta as a
                                  'nature' rather than as a stage having an entry and exit point.<br> <br> The sense of 'Self' must dissolve in all entry and exit points. In
                                  the first stage of dissolving, the dissolving of 'Self' relates
                                  only to the thought realm. The entry is at the mind level. The
                                  experience is the 'AMness'. Having such experience, a practitioner
                                  might be overwhelmed by the transcendental experience, attached to
                                  it and mistaken it as the purest stage of consciousness, not
                                  realizing that it is only a state of 'no-self' relating to the
                                  thought realm.<br> <br> The experience of the dissolving of the 'Self' must ultimately be
                                  extended to the other 5 entry and exit points (eyes, ears, nose,
                                  tongue and body) so that in no moment Anatta is not experienced, it
                                  must be thorough. Pure sound is radically different from pure
                                  seeing. All experiences are equally pure; non is purer than the
                                  other. The condition differs. (This, I believe we have already
                                  discussed. <img title="Smile" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile">)<br> <br> To me, a thorough experience has 3 distinguishing
                                  characteristics:<br> 1. Signlessness, a realm without thought, labels and symbols.<br> 2. An ever changing process<br> 3. Consciousness as everything, not as thought, but as
                                  everything.<br> (I believed by now u should have experienced why everchanging can
                                  lead us to a non-dual experience)<br> <br> The ultimate challenge is the witnessing consciousness that stands
                                  in the midst of experiencing. The point of elimination comes when
                                  attention reaches the minutest moment of experience and 'see' that
                                  a moment of experience is nothing but an instance of 'luminous
                                  light of emptiness nature', instantaneously it is gone and the next
                                  moment of 'luminous light of emptiness nature' arises with
                                  differing conditions and again in lightning flash moment it is all
                                  together different...ad infinitum. Consciousness is a momentary
                                  stream. Because it is momentary, knowing that it as a stream itself
                                  is not sufficient but 'how' it arises from moment to moment is most
                                  crucial. This brings us into the other aspect -- arising without
                                  origination, without a point of centricity. Without certain
                                  stability in the experience of Anatta in all entry and exit points,
                                  this aspect of Emptiness can only be appreciated conceptually; it
                                  will not be understood intuitively. <img title="Smile" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>

              <p><em>Althought it has a past and a future, the past and the future are cut off.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here Dogen makes the point from the relative perspective (the particular, the individual, etc.). When you look at today's firewood from this perspective, today's firewood is unique. That is, today's firewood is distinctively today's firewood. It is, always has been, and always will be today's firewood.</p>
              <p>This aspect is demonstrated philosophically by the Huayen doctrine of "principal and satellites." When any particular thing, time, or event is posited as the "principal," all other things, times, or events are seen as "satellites." For instance, look at an apple that has fallen from a tree. As the "principal" everything else in the univese can be seen as its "satellites," including the apple that was on the tree, the apple falling through the air, and the rotten apple of next month. Now if you shift your focus and take the rotten apple as the "principal" the fallen apple is now a "satellite" of the rotten apple. In this way, each thing, time, and event can be seen to include every other thing, time, and event. This applies to apples, firewood, ash, or any other particular thing, time, or event, including you at this very moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next, the Genjokoan says:</p>
              <div><em>Ash exists in the dharma position of ash. It has a past and it has a future.</em></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here, Dogen makes the same point with ash that he just made with firewood. Since both ash and firewood "abide" or "exist" in their own particular "place in the dharma," their own unique "place" in all of space and time, one cannot <em>become </em>the other.</p>

              <p>Ven Master Xing Yun's commentary on the Diamond Sutra's beginning related to the six Paramitas...</p>
              <blockquote class="uncited">
              <div><a class="postlink" href="http://www.blpusa.com/download/bies20.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">http://www.blpusa.com/download/bies20.pdf</span></span></a><br>Now, I will talk about the prajna in the Buddha's daily living.<br>This is the prajna spoken of in the Diamond Sutra. The Diamond Sutra opens with the following statement:<br>"Then the Blessed One at mealtime, put on His robes, took the alms bowl, and entered the city of Sravasti. <br>Having begged for alms there in due order, He returned to His place. Having taken His meal, He put away His robe and alms bowl, washed His feet, and sat in a cross-legged posture. . ."<br>This is the beginning of the Diamond Sutra, which I think all of you have read. Such a famous and precious Buddhist Sutra starts with a description of the Buddha washing His feet, putting on His robes, and eating His meal. <br><br>What do such simple daily activities have to do with prajna and emptiness as explained in the Diamond Sutra? <br>In fact, if you understand the Diamond Sutra, just these few lines can enable you to become enlightened. These few lines completely capture the spirit of prajna in the Diamond Sutra.<br><br>For example, putting on the robe and taking up the alms bowl signifies the paramita of precepts. <br>Entering the city of Sravasti to beg for alms is an illustration of the paramita of generosity. <br>To beg for alms in due order exemplifies the paramita of patience.<br>Taking his meal, putting away His robe and alms bowl, and washing His feet explains the paramita of diligence. <br>Sitting in a cross-legged position refers to the paramita of meditative concentration. <br>In this way, the Buddha integrated the Six Paramitas in His daily life. Because He had lived a life of the Six Paramitas, He was able to realize nirvana and be in harmony with prajna. Therefore, we should practice the Six Paramitas in our daily lives.</div>
