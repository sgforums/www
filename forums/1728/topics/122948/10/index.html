Thus there is no continuance of birth and death and no body or mind that is subject to birth and death. This nonexistence of [birth and death and body and mind] is so not as a consequence of contrived effort. It is so by its intrinsic nature.<br><br>Â“The awareness [of their nonexistence] is like empty space. That which is aware of the empty space is like the appearance of the illusory flower. However, one cannot say that the nature of this awareness is nonexistent. Eliminating both existence and nonexistence is in accordance with pure enlightenment.<br><br>Â“Why is it so? Because the nature of empty space is ever unmoving. Likewise, there is neither arising nor perishing within the Tathagatagarbha. [8] It is free from conceptual knowledge and views.

Dark, cloudy, cool, moist and windy. Amazing, this whole affair of the weather!<br><br>We call it weather, but what is it really? Wind. Rain. Clouds slowly parting. Not the words spoken about it, but just this darkening, blowing, pounding and wetting, and then lightening up, blue sky appearing amid darkness, and sunshine sparkling on wet grasses and leaves. In a little while there'll be frost, snow and ice covers. And then warming again, melting, oozing water everywhere. On an early spring day the dirt road sparkles with streams of wet silver. SoÂ—what is weather other than this incessant change of earthly conditions and all the human thoughts, feelings and undertakings influenced by it? Like and dislike. Depression and elation. Creation and destruction. An ongoing, ever-changing stream of happenings abiding nowhere. No real entity weather exists anywhere except in thinking and talking about it.<br><br>Now, is there such an entity as me or I? Or is it just like the weatherÂ—an ongoing, ever-changing stream of ideas, images, memories, projections, likes and dislikes, creation and destruction, that thought keeps calling I, me, Toni, and thereby solidifying what is evanescent? What am I really, truly, and what do I merely think and believe I am?<br><br>Are we interested in exploring this amazing affair of myself from moment to moment? Is this, maybe, the essence of this work? Exploring ourselves attentively, beyond the peace and quiet that we are seeking and maybe finding occasionally? Coming upon an amazing insight into this deep sense of separation that we call me and other people, me and the world, without any need to condemn or overcome?<br><br>Most human beings take it for granted that I am me, and that me is this body, this mind, this knowledge and sense of myself that feels so obviously distinct and separate from other people and from the nature around us. The language in which we talk to ourselves and to each other inevitably implies separate me's and you's all the time. All of us talk I-and-you talk. We think it, write it, read it, and dream it with rarely any pause. There is incessant reinforcement of the sense of me, separate from others. Isolated, insulated me. Not understood by others. How are we to come upon the truth if separateness is taken so much for granted, feels so commonsense?<br><br>The difficulty is not insurmountable. Wholeness, our true being, is here all the time, like the sun behind the clouds. Light is here in spite of cloud cover.<br>What makes up the clouds?<br><br><a href="http://wisdombliss.blogspot.com/2007/02/what-is-this-me.html" rel="nofollow"></a><br><br>(What Is This Me? by Toni Packer)</div>

When that day comes you will realize nothing has changed, yet everything has changed. It is a feeling and a knowing. An inescapable falling away of untruth. If you think you know it then you donÂ’t. When you know it, you do. And when you do know it, no one can take it away from you.<br><br>~ Steven Norquist</blockquote><blockquote>I ask people this all the time and really piss them off, "Why do you meditate? What are you trying to accomplish? Why do you watch your breath?" I have never met anyone that has given me the correct answer.<br><br>The reason they don't know is because they are not enlightened. If they were, then they might not even meditate anymore, or they might, it would make no difference. You see, the simple truth that is missed by almost every meditator is this, the act of sitting there watching your breath is enlightenment. That is all. You are not doing something to gain something, just sitting there is enlightenment. That still state with calmed mind, just that is enlightenment, yet that annoying gossip over there interrupting your meditation, just that is enlightenment and that guy flipping you off in commuter traffic, just that is enlightenment. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is no doer, no experiencer, no one who acts.

It is a layer of Â‘bondÂ’ that prevents us from Â‘seeingÂ’ somethingÂ…it is very subtle, very thin, very fineÂ…it goes almost undetected. What this Â‘bondÂ’ does is it prevents us from Â‘seeingÂ’ what Â“WITNESSÂ” really is and makes us constantly fall back to the Witness, to the Source, to the Center . Every moment we want to sink back to Witness, to the Center, to this Beingness, this is an illusion. It is habitual and almost hypnotic.<br><br>But what exactly is this Â“witnessÂ” we are talking about? It is the manifestation itself! It is the appearance itself!

There<br>is only being and the nature of that being is emptiness and fullness,<br>nothing and everything, movement and repose.<br>In that wholeness arises the idea "I am a separate individual". This seems<br>to be the beginning of a dream called "me being someone in a world with<br>which I have to negotiate".<br><br>Here in this separation is the root of all fear and feeling of disquiet coming<br>out of a sense of loss. Again it is the appearance of oneness, and in that appearance we embark on a journey in which we meet parents, teachers,<br>maybe priests, bosses and lovers, and learn how to get what we think we<br>want seemingly through personal choice and effort. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The pursuit of<br>pleasure and the avoidance of pain generate transient experiences of<br>gratification and disappointment.</span></strong> <strong>The whole manifestation that we call<br>life is simply the drama of oneness looking for itself, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for all desire is the<br>longing for oneness.</span></strong><br><br>~ Tony Parsons</blockquote><blockquote>...As stated earlier, a helpful concept here is compassion, a heart aspect of the practice and reality related to kindness. You see, wherever there is desire there is suffering, and wherever there is suffering there is compassion, the desire for the end of suffering. You can actually experience this. So obviously there is some really close relationship between suffering, desire and compassion. This is heavy but good stuff and worth investigating.<br><br><strong>We might conceive of this as compassion having gotten caught in a loop, the loop of the illusion of duality. This is sort of like a dogÂ’s tail chasing itself. Pain and pleasure, suffering and satisfaction always seem to be Â“over there.Â” Thus, when pleasant sensations arise, there is a constant, compassionate, deluded attempt to get over there to the other side of the imagined split.</strong> This is fundamental attraction. You would think that we would just stop imagining there is a split, but somehow that is not what happens. <strong>We keep perpetuating the sense of a split <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even as we try to bridge it, and so we suffer.</span> When unpleasant sensations arise, there is an attempt to get away from over there, to widen the imagined split. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This will never work, because it doesnÂ’t actually exist, but the way we hold our minds as we try to get away from that side is painful.</span></strong> When boring or unpleasant sensations arise, there is the attempt to tune out all together and forget the whole thing, to try to pretend that the sensations on the other side of the split are not there. This is fundamental ignorance and it perpetuates the process, as it is by ignoring aspects of our sensate reality that the illusion of a split is created in the first place...<br><br>~ Dharma Dan</blockquote><blockquote>Why are you unhappy?<br>Because 99.9 per cent<br>Of everything you think,<br>And of everything you do,<br>Is for yourself Â—<br>And there isn't one.<br><br>Â— Wei Wu Wei, Ask The Awakened</blockquote><blockquote>Paradoxical though it may sound:<br>There is a path to walk on,<br>there is walking being done,<br>but there is no traveller.<br>There are deeds being done, but there is no doer.<br>There is a blowing of the air, but there is no wind that does the blowing.<br>The thought of self is an error<br>and all existences are hollow as the plantain tree<br>and as empty as twirling water bubbles.<br><br>~ Buddha</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Luminous Mind</strong><br><br><blockquote>I gave a simile to a monk the other night. Imagine an Emperor who is wearing a long pair of trousers and a big tunic. He's got shoes on his feet, a scarf around the bottom half of his head and a hat on the top half of his head. You can't see him at all because he's completely covered in five garments. It's the same with the mind. It's completely covered with sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. So people don't know it. They just know the garments. When they see the Emperor, they just see the robes and the garments. They don't know who lives inside them. And so it is no wonder they're confused about what is life, what is mind, who is this inside of here, were did I come from? Why? What am I supposed to be doing with this life? When the five senses disappear, it's like unclothing the Emperor and seeing what is actually in here, what's actually running the show, who's listening to these words, who's seeing, who's feeling life, who this is. When the five senses disappear, you're coming close to the answer to those questions.<br><br>What you're seeing in such deep meditation is that which we call "mind," (in Pali it's called Citta). The Buddha used this beautiful simile. When there is a full moon on a cloudy night, even though it's a full moon, you can hardly see it. Sometimes when the clouds are thin, you can see this hazy shape shining though. You know there is something there. This is like the meditation just before you've entered into these profound states. You know there is something there, but you can't quite make it out. There's still some "clothes" left. You're still thinking and doing, feeling the body or hearing sounds. But there does come a time, and this is the Buddha's simile, when the moon is released from the clouds and there in the clear night sky you can see the beautiful full disc of the moon shining brilliantly, and you know that's the moon. The moon is there; the moon is real, and it's not just some sort of side effect of the clouds. This is what happens in meditation when you see the mind. You see clearly that the mind is not some side effect of the brain. You see the mind, and you know the mind. The Buddha said that the mind released is beautiful, is brilliant, is radiant. So not only are these blissful experiences, they're meaningful experiences as well.<br><br>How many people may have heard about rebirth but still don't really believe it? How can rebirth happen? Certainly the body doesn't get reborn. That's why when people ask me where do you go when you die, "one of two places" I say "Fremantle or Karrakatta" that's where the body goes! [3] But is that where the mind goes? Sometimes people are so stupid in this world, they think the body is all there is, that there is no mind. So when you get cremated or buried that's it, that's done with, all has ended. The only way you can argue with this view is by developing the meditation that the Buddha achieved under the Bodhi tree. Then you can see the mind for yourself in clear awareness - not in some hypnotic trance, not in dullness - but in the clear awareness. This is knowing the mind.</blockquote><blockquote>When you know that mind, when you see it for yourself, one of the results will be an insight that the mind is independent of this body. Independence means that when this body breaks up and dies, when it's cremated or when it's buried, or however it's destroyed after death, it will not affect the mind. You know this because you see the nature of the mind. That mind which you see will transcend bodily death. The first thing which you will see for yourself, the insight which is as clear as the nose on your face, is that there is something more to life than this physical body that we take to be me. Secondly you can recognise that that mind, essentially, is no different than that process of consciousness which is in all beings. Whether it's human beings or animals or even insects, of any gender, age or race, you see that that which is in common to all life is this mind, this consciousness, the source of doing.</blockquote>~ Ajahn Brahmavamso<br><br>notes: pls note that "mind" here does not refer to "thinking", but certain luminous aspect of our buddha nature.. but relating more to the thought level, not necessarily non dual</div>
