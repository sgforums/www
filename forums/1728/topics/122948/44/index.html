              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong>All that 
              is required is all at once to cease leaving your Self in search of 
              something external. 
              When this is done you will find your Self no different from the Buddha 
              or the 
              patriarch. Do you want to know who the Buddha or patriarch is? He is no 
              other 
              than the one who is, at this moment, right in front of me, listening to 
              my talk 
              on the Dharma. You have no faith in him and therefore you are in quest 
              of someone 
              else somewhere outside. And what will you find? Nothing but words and 
              names, however 
              excellent. You will never reach the moving spirit in the Buddha or 
              patriarch.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Consider the Buddha: although he was wise at 
              birth, the traces of
                                      his six years of upright sitting can yet be 
              seen. As for
                                      Bodhidharma, although he had received the 
              mind-seal, his nine years
                                      of facing a wall is celebrated still. If even 
              the ancient sages
                                      were like this, how can we today dispense with 
              wholehearted
                                      practice?<br> <br> Therefore, put aside the intellectual practice 
              of investigating
                                      words and chasing phrases, and learn to take the
               backward step that
                                      turns the light and shines it inward. Body and 
              mind of themselves
                                      will drop away, and your original face will 
              manifest. If you want
                                      such a thing, get to work on such a thing 
              immediately.</p>

              <p><strong>"The desire for happiness is the disease of attachment;
              one can be happy only when free of desires. Realization is not
              achieved by striving for it; it arises spontaneously when one
              abides in the natural state without seeking anything. So remain in
              the natural state without seeking, without concepts! Even though
              the name "enlightenment" is used for the real nature, this does not
              mean that "enlightenment" concretely exists. If someone believes
              the opposite, [let them go ahead and try to find] enlightenment:
              apart from the dimension of fundamental reality, they will find
              nothing at all. So, instead of aiming for enlightenment, one has to
              understand the nature of one's mind beyond action. On examining
              one's mind, one finds nothing, yet at the same time there is
              clarity that is ever present. It does not manifest concretely, yet
              its essence is all pervading: this is the way its nature presents
              itself."</strong></p>

              <p>It is a dualistic fixation, the tension between "me" -- as self --  
                                     and "my thoughts" -- as other -- that makes 
              thinking problematic,                         tormenting, "sticky," like
               the tarbaby to which Brer Rabbit becomes                         
              affixed by trying to push it away. Thoughts become thick, solid,        
                               and heavy only when we react to them. Each reaction 
              triggers                         further thought, so that the thoughts 
              become chained together in                         what appears to be a 
              continuous mind-state. These thought-chains                         are 
              like a relay race, where each new thought picks up the baton            
                           from the previous thought and runs with it for a moment, 
              passing it                         on again to a subsequent thought. But
               if the meditator can maintain                         presence in the 
              middle of thinking, free of grasping or rejecting,                      
                 then the thought has nothing to pass the baton on to, and naturally  
                                     subsides. Although this sounds simple, it is 
              advanced practice,                         usually requiring much 
              preliminary training and commitment.<br><br>When one can rest in 
              presence even in the midst of thoughts,                         
              perceptions, or intense emotions, these become an ongoing part of       
                                one's contemplative practice, as opportunities to 
              discover a                         pervasive quality of even awareness 
              in all one's activities.</p>

              <p>Act, speak, with full awareness and then you will find a tremendous change in you. The very fact that you are aware changes your acts. Then you cannot commit sin. Not that you have to control yourself, no! Control is a poor substitute for awareness, a very poor substitute; it doesn't help much. If you are aware, you need not control anger; in awareness, anger never arises. They cannot exist together; there is no coexistence for them. In  awareness, jealousy never arises. In awareness, many things simply disappear - all the things that are negative.</p>
              <p>It is just like a light. When the light is in your house, how can darkness exist there? It simply escapes. When your house is lighted, how can you stumble? How can you knock at the wall? The light is there, you know the door, you simply reach the door, you get out or in. When there is darkness, you grope, you stumble, you fall. Anger is nothing but stumbling; jealousy is nothing but groping in the dark. All that is wrong is wrong, not because of itself but because you are living in darkness.</p>
              <p>If Jesus wants to be angry, he can be; he can use it. You cannot use it - you are being used by it. If Jesus feels that it will be good and helpful, he can use anything - he is a master. Jesus can be angry without being angry. Many people worked with Gurdjieff, and he was a terrible man. When he was angry, he would be terribly angry, he would look like a murderer! But that was just a game, just a situation to help somebody. And immediately, not a single moment's gap would be there, he would look again at the same person toward whom he had been angry, and he would be angry and terrible looking.</p>
              <p>It is possible. When you are aware, you can use everything. Even poison becomes elixir when you are aware. And when you are asleep, even elixir becomes poison - because the whole thing depends on your being alert or not. Acts don't mean anything. Acts do not matter - you, your awareness, your being conscious, mindful, is what matters. What you do is not the concern.</p>

              <p>Shunryu Suzuki wrote in his first book, <em>Zen Mind, Beginner's
                                      Mind,</em></p>
              <p><em>I have discovered that it is necessary, 
              absolutely
                                      necessary, to believe in nothing. That is, we 
              have to believe in
                                      something which has no form and no color - 
              something which exists
                                      before all forms and colors appear. This is a 
              very important
                                      point.</em></p>
              <p>................</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>Or, as the ninth-century Chinese Zen teacher 
              Huang Po put it,
                                      "The foolish reject what they <em>see</em>, not 
              what they think;
                                      the wise reject what they think, not what they <em>see</em>."</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead of putting faith in what we believe, 
              think, explain,
                                      justify, or otherwise construct in our minds, we
               can learn to put
                                      our trust and confidence in immediate, direct 
              experience, before
                                      all forms and colors appear. Religion, in its 
              most essential
                                      expression, can help us do this.</p>
              <p>This is faith in its purest form: trust in 
              actual experience
                                      before we make anything of it - before beliefs, 
              thoughts, signs,
                                      explanations, justifications, and other 
              constructions of our minds
                                      take form.</p>

              <p>"You can only be nonattached to thought only if you realize that your thought objects are not Real - that they're little more than objects in a dream.</p>
              <p>Foyan reminds us that the thoughts and signs we conjure up are not the Real world. They're only models of the world and cannot substitute for reality. Thus he's pointing out that our mind objects, including our sense of self and our sense of "the world, out there," are precisely what are <em>not</em> Real."</p>

              <p>Zen practice is not merely about learning to let go of this discontented, noisy, complaining, kicking, screaming mind. it's about learning to forget about it. Whether such a mind lingers or not, we don't worry about it. We just let it go. We turn our attention from the entanglements we conjure up in our mind to what's actually going on, <em>right here, right now, </em>in this moment.</p>

              <p>I may say that there is nothing to be changed but the revolutionary 
              teachers come and tell us
              that there is something there in which you have to bring about a radical
               revolution then we
              assume there is such a thing as soul, spirit or the self. What I assert 
              all the time is that I haven't
              found anything like the self or soul there.
              This question haunted me all my life and suddenly it hit me, “There is 
              no self to realize. What
              the hell have I been doing all this time?” You see, that hits you like 
              lightning. Once that hits
              you, the whole mechanism of the body that is controlled by this thought 
              is shattered. What is
              left is the tremendous living organism with an intelligence of its own. 
              What you are left with
              is the pulse, the beat and the throb of life.</p>

              <p>Do you think that when Rembrandt was painting, he stood there with a brush in

              put it there then it may clash with that. I'm not quite sure, but maybe two more 
              centimeters to the right, let's measure it. It might look better over . . ."
