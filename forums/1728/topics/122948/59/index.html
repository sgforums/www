              <p>A 112-year-old nun who is one of the two oldest currently living in Taiwan, proclaimed that her secret to a long life was simply to practice Buddhism. She is from the central area of Taiwan’s Nantou County.<br>Liu Ching-huan was brought to Taiwan from China’s Sichuan Province, where she was born, when the late President Chiang Kai-shek’s forces pushed her along with many others out of the province. In 1965 at a young age, she was ordained at a Buddhist temple in the county’s Puli Township.<br>Liu who has devoted her life to the teachings of Buddhism still enjoys reading the religious classics related to the religion.<br>Liu told the Nantou Magistrate Lee Chao-ching that chanting “Nam Amitofo” is the secret to a long life. <br>Currently in the Nantou County, there are 13 men and 29 women equalling a total of 42 centenarians. Majority of the living individual practice Buddhism and 14 of them will be celebrating their 100th birthday this year, Jung-sen said.<br></p>

              <p>What you are talking about is called "clarity". The mind 
              can take it's own awareness as an object.Indeed, in all Mahamudra and 
              Dzogchen meditation, this is precisely what is taken as the object. You 
              may not be able to "get rid" of this clarity, but you will never find it
               or be able to say "This is it, this is not it". <span style="font-weight: bold;">This
               clarity is also dependently originated since the mind is dependently 
              originated. There is no awareness or clarity seperate from the mind.</span> The characteristic of the mind is clarity. The essence of the mind is 
              emptiness. These two are non-dual, and that is the nature of the mind 
              i.e. inseperable clarity and emptiness.</p>
              <p>....................</p>
              <p>Yes, the characteristic of clarity is unique to a sentient being's 
              mind. The mahasiddha Virupa stated that "The mind is like space, the 
              difference [between them] is that the mind is aware."</p>

              if you follow those who say that although one realizes emptiness one 
              must cultivate compassion elsewhere, you are similar to someone who 
              claims that although one has water one must seek wetness elsewhere, that
               although one has fire one must seek warmth elsewhere, or that although 
              one is fanned by the wind one must seek coolness elsewhere.  The 
              decisive experience of certainty that samsara and nirvana are supreme

              If you want your loved ones to be happy, you must learn to understand their sufferings and aspirations. When you understand, you will know how to relieve their sufferings and how to help them fulfill their aspirations. That is true love. If you only want you loved ones to follow your own ideas and you remain ignorant of their needs, it is not truly love. It is only a desire to possess another and attempt to fulfill your own needs, which cannot be fulfilled in that way.

              Mogallana: "In what way, Lord, can it be briefly explained how a monk becomes liberated by the elimination of craving: how he becomes one who has reached the final end, the final security from bondage, the final holy life, the final consummation, and is foremost among devas and humans?"
              
              Buddha: "Here, Mogallana, a monk has learned this: 'Nothing is fit to be clung to!' When a monk has learnt that nothing is fit to be clung to, he directly knows everything; by directly knowing everything, he fully comprehends everything; when he fully comprehends everything, whatever feeling he experiences, be it pleasant, painful, or neutral, he abides contemplating impermanence in these feelings, contemplating dispassion, contemplating cessation, contemplating relinquishment. When thus abiding, he does not cling to anything in the world; without clinging he is not agitated; and without agitation he personally attains the complete extinction of defilements. He knows: 'Rebirth has ceased, the holy life has been lived, the task has been done, there is no more of this or that state.'"

              <p><br>I think we can begin to understand the dhamma analytically, by 
              listening to the teachings and then reflecting upon them. But this is 
              just a beginning which has to be developed further and integrated with 
              ethical conduct (sÄ«la) and meditative composure (samÄ�dhi). There are 
              three levels of discernment (paññÄ�): discernment obtained through 
              hearing (sutamayÄ� paññÄ�), discernment obtained through reflection 
              (cintÄ�mayÄ� paññÄ�), and discernment obtained through meditative 
              development (bhÄ�vanÄ�mayÄ� paññÄ�). The first two comprise theoretical 
              levels of discernment where one hears the teachings and reflects on 
              them. This reflection is the beginning of internalizing the meaning of 
              what has been heard. But for discernment to be liberating the process of
               internalization must deepen through meditative development. This level 
              is direct experiential discernment.</p>
