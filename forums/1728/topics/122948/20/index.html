The result of stress should be known. The cessation of stress should be known. The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known.' Thus it has been said. Why was it said?<br><br>"Birth is stress, aging is stress, death is stress; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair are stress; association with what is not loved is stress, separation from what is loved is stress, not getting what is wanted is stress. In short, the five aggregates for sustenance are stress.<br><br>"And what is the cause by which stress comes into play? Craving is the cause by which stress comes into play.<br>"And what is the diversity in stress? There is major stress and minor, slowly fading and quickly fading. This is called diversity in stress.<br>"And what is the result of stress? There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, grieves, mourns, laments, beats his  br east, &amp; becomes bewildered. Or one overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, comes to search outside, 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain?' I tell you, monks, that stress results in either bewildment or in search.<br><br>"And what is the cessation of stress? From the cessation of craving is the cessation of stress; and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress: right view, right aspiration, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Mangala Sutta states, "Support for one's parents, assistance to one's wife and children, consistency in one's work: This is the highest protection." When you have a family, do not forget your responsibility, then happiness will follow you. When you work in a society, do not forget to be a upright person, then you will be accepted by the society. Remember not to give up on yourself, not to blame life and not to waste your resources. Everyone has his own stories and his own paths. Whatever it is, do not blame life for giving us a heavy burden.

            <div class='col-md body'>Questioner: In certain situations in life I feel blocked by a fear which prevents me from acting. How can I be free from this obstacle?<br><br>Jean Klein: First free yourself from the word, the concept, 'fear'. It is loaded with memory. Face only the perception. Accept the sensation<br>completely. When the personality who judges and controls is completely absent, when there is no longer a psychological relationship with the<br>sensation, it is really welcomed and unfolds. Only in welcoming without a welcomer can there be real transformation.<br><br>We are in essence one with all existence; when we truly observe ourselves there is ultimately no observer, only observation - awareness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are three categories of patience. First, tolerate the injuries of physical and verbal abuse. Patience is a virtue. With patience, we have a quiet and pure mind: thus, it would be easier to attain deep concentration and achievement. When we successfully practice patience, we will gain the greatest good fortune. Second, we would do well to be patient with variations of the natural elements, hot and cold, summer and winter, hunger and thrist, as well as natural disasters.<br><br>Third, be patient in the arduous course of our practice. Before attaining the joy of cultivation and before our cultivation become strong, we will encounter many obstacles. However, once we get through this phase, we attain happiness. Why? Because we are on he right path. This is like travelling on an expressway. Before we can get on it, we keep circling and driving around trying to find the entrance. This is very frustrating because there are many cars in our way and we cannot drive fast. We have to remain patient. Once we get on the expressway, it is much more pleasant because traffic moves smoother and faster with no hindrances. Our practice of Buddhism is like this.<br><br>~ Ven.

I still have to live in a world that is completely dominated by time.</span><br><br>Intellectual agreement is just another belief and won't make much difference to your life. To realize this truth, you need to live it. When every cell of your body is so present that it feels vibrant with life, and when you can feel that life every moment as the joy of Being, then it can be said that you are free of time.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">But I still have to pay the bills tomorrow, and I am still going to grow old and die just like everybody else. So how can I ever say that I am free of time?</span><br><br>Tomorrow's bills are not the problem. The dissolution of the physical body is not a problem. Loss of Now is the problem, or rather: the core delusion that turns a mere situation, event, or emotion into a personal problem and into suffering. Loss of Now is loss of Being.<br><br>To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of past for your identity and future for your fulfillment. It represents the most profound transformation of consciousness that you can imagine. In some rare cases, this shift in consciousness happens dramatically and radically, once and for all. When it does, it usually comes about through total surrender in the midst of intense suffering. Most people, however, have to work at it.<br><br>When you have had your first few glimpses of the timeless state of consciousness, you begin to move back and 'forth between the dimensions of time and presence. First you become aware of just how rarely your attention is truly in the Now. But to know that you are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> present is a great success: that knowing is presence - even if initially it only lasts for a couple of seconds of clock time before it is lost again. Then, with increasing frequency, you <span style="font-style: italic;">choose</span> to have the focus of your consciousness in the present moment rather than in the past or future, and whenever you realize that you had lost the Now, you are able to stay- in it not just for a couple of seconds, but for longer periods as perceived from the external perspective of clock time. So before you are firmly established in the state of presence, which is to say before you are<br>fully conscious, you shift back and forth for a while between consciousness and unconsciousness, between the state of presence and the state of mind identification. You lose the Now, and you return to it, again and again. Eventually, presence becomes your predominant state.<br><br>For most people, presence is experienced either never at all or only accidentally and briefly on rare occasions without being recognized for what it is. Most humans alternate not between consciousness and unconsciousness but only between different levels of unconsciousness.<br><br>~ "The Power of Now", 4. MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW</div>
