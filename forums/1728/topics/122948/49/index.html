              <p>"Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Buddha be recognized by means of his bodily form?"</p>
              <p>"No, Most Honored One, the Buddha cannot be recognized by means of his bodily form. Why? Because when the Buddha speaks of bodily form, it is not a real form, but only an illusion."</p>
              <p>The Buddha then spoke to Subhuti: "All that has a form is illusive and unreal. When you see that all forms are illusive and unreal, then you will begin to perceive your true Buddha nature."</p>

A bhikkhu must have control over his tongue; his conduct must be good; his mind must be calm, subdued and not flitting about as it pleases."<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:<br><br>Verse 363: The bhikkhu who controls his mouth (speech) who speaks wisely with his mind composed, who explains the meaning and the text of the Dhamma, — sweet are the words of that bhikkhu.</p></div>

They just stayed close to the Buddha, hardly ever leaving his presence. However, there was a bhikkhu by the name of Dhammarama who kept to himself and did not go near the Buddha. His intention was to strive most ardently to attain arahatship before the passing away of the Buddha. So he strove hard in Insight Meditation Practice. Other bhikkhus, not understanding his attitude and his noble ambition, misunderstood his behaviour.<br><br>Those bhikkhus took Dhammarama to the Buddha and said to the Enlightened One, "Venerable Sir! This bhikkhu does not seem to have any affection or regard or reverence for you; he has been staying by himself while all the time other bhikkhus are staying close to Your Venerable presence." When other bhikkhus had said everything they wanted to say, Dhammarama respectfully explained to the Buddha why he had not come to see the Buddha and also reported that he had been striving his utmost in Insight Meditation Practice.<br><br>The Buddha was satisfied and was very pleased with the explanation and conduct of Dhammarama and he said, "My son, Dhammarama, you have done very well. A bhikkhu who loves and respects me should act like you. Those who made offerings of flowers, scents and incense to me are not really paying me homage. Only those who practise the Dhamma are the ones who truly pay homage to me."<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:<br><br>Verse 364: The bhikkhu who abides in the Dhamma, who delights in the Dhamma, who meditates on the Dhamma, and is ever mindful of the Dhamma, does not fall away from the Dhamma of the virtuous. <br><br>At the end of the discourse Thera Dhammarama attained arahatship.<br><br>1. saddhamma: the Dhamma of the virtuous; i.e., the thirty-seven Factors of Enlightenment (Bodhipakkhiya Dhamma) and the nine Transcendentals (Lokuttara Dhamma).</p></div>

The Gods Adore Virtuous Monks<br><br>Disdaining not his gains,<br>though little he receives,<br>pure of life and keen<br>that bhikkhu devas praise.<br><br>Explanation: The monk may have received only a little but he does not under estimate what was given him. He is satisfied with what he has received. Such a monk, who leads a pure livelihood, is praised by deities.<br><br>The Story of a Bhikkhu Who Associated With a Follower of Devadatta<br><br>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (365) and (366) of this book, with reference to a bhikkhu who was on friendly terms with a follower of Devadatta.<br><br>Once, a bhikkhu disciple of the Buddha, being very friendly with a follower of Devadatta, paid a visit to the monastery of Devadatta and stayed there for a few days. Other bhikkhus reported to the Buddha that he had been mixing with the followers of Devadatta and that he had even gone to the monastery of Devadatta, spent there a few days, eating, sleeping and apparently enjoying the choice food and the comforts of that monastery. The Buddha sent for that bhikkhu and asked him whether what he had heard about his behaviour was true. The bhikkhu admitted that he had gone to the monastery of Devadatta for a few days, but he told the Buddha that he had not embraced the teaching of Devadatta.<br><br>The Buddha then reprimanded him and pointed out that his behaviour made him appear like a follower of Devadatta. To him the Buddha said, "My son, even though you have not embraced the doctrine of Devadatta, you are going about as if you were one of his followers. A bhikkhu should be contented with what he gets and should not covet other people's gains. A bhikkhu who is filled with envy at the good fortune of others will not attain concentration (samadhi), or Insight, or the Path that leads to Nibbana (Magga). Only the bhikkhu who is contented with whatever he gets will be able to attain concentration, Insight and the Path."<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:<br><br>Verse 365: One should not despise what one has received (by proper means), nor should one envy others their gains. The bhikkhu who envies others cannot attain Concentration (Samadhi). <br><br>Verse 366: Though he receives only a little, if a bhikkhu does not despise what he has received (by proper means), the devas will surely praise him who leads a pure life and is not slothful.</p></div>
