              Our world view is not simply the way we look at the world. It reaches inward to constitute our innermost being, and outward to constitute the world.
              ~Richard Tarnas, Cosmos and Psyche, p.16
              
              
              
              So life is what I am making it, and I am what life is making me.
              ...
              What has been described like this is that life is the self, and the self is life.

              Twice now, O Sakyan,
              	I've asked you,
              but you, One with vision,
              	haven't answered me.
              When asked the third time
              the celestial seer answers:
              	so I have heard.
              This world, the next world,
              the Brahma world with its devas:
              	I don't know how they're viewed
              	by the glorious Gotama.
              So to the one who has seen
              to the far extreme,
              I've come with a question:
              	How does one view the world
              	so as not to be seen
              		by Death's king?
              <p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
              View the world, Mogharaja,
              		as empty —
              always mindful
              to have removed any view
              		about self.
              This way one is above &amp; beyond death.
              	This is how one views the world
              	so as not to be seen
              		by Death's king.</div>

              Those who train themselves in Zen should be indifferent to others faults and abilities, negatives and positives, for such an attitude manifests the emotional imperturbability of the empty, selfless, natural mind nature (Samadhi). Those who train themselves for this emotional imperturbability should, in their contact with all situations, emotionally ignore the positives and negatives of it. 
              
              As soon as you open your mouth or mind and emotionally identify negatives or positives, you have deviated from the Dao of Zen. When you become emotionally attached to outer objects, your essential mind nature becomes agitated. When you are emotionally detached to outer objects, the inner peace of your natural mind nature (Samadhi) remains. The reason why we become emotionally perturbed is because we allow ourselves to be carried away and then emotionally attached to the circumstances we are in.

              Buddha:
              
              Grain, wealth, silver, gold, or whatever other belongings you have; slaves, servants, errand-runners, &amp; any dependents: you must go without taking any of them; you must leave all of them behind. What you do with body, speech, or mind: that is yours; taking that you go; that's your follower, like a shadow that never leaves. Thus you should do what is fine as a stash for the next life. Acts of merit are the support for beings in their after-death world.

              "Now the venerable Upali came to the Exalted One, saluted and sat down
              at one side. So seated, he said; "Well were it for me, lord, if the
              Exalted One were to expound Dhamma briefly to me, so that, having
              heard it, I might abide resolute, alone, secluded, earnest and zealous."
              "The doctrines, Upali, of which you may know: "These doctrines lead one
              not to complete weariness (of the world), nor to dispassion, nor to
              ending, nor to calm, nor to knowledge, nor to awakening, nor to the cool"
              - regard them definitely as not Dhamma, not the the discipline, not the
              word of the Teacher.
              But the doctrines of which you may know:"These doctrines lead one to

The absence of cessation is the absence of the cessation of the dependently originated. The absence of arising is called "dependent origination". Whatever is produced dependently is not produced. Whatever is produced was not produced in the past, nor in the future, and is not now. Whatever was not produced in the past, nor in the future, and not in the present, that does not cease. That non-cessation is called "knowledge of non-arising". Whoever knows non-arising, that is also not generated, and also its cessation is not directly perceived. Whever is not generated, that is not made to cease; if there is arising, there is also cessation. Whatever is not generated, that is known and seen as the cessation of all phenomena, and is the best understanding and direct perception.
