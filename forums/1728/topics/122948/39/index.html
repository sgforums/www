              <p>If we are not fully ourselves, truly in the present moment, we miss everything. When a child presents himself to you with his smile, if you are not really there - thinking about the future or the past, or preoccupied with other problems - then the child is not really there for you. The technique of being alive is to go back to yourself in order for the child to appear like a marvellous reality. Then you can see him smile and you can embrace him in your arms.</p>

              <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
              <p>Reconciliation is to understand both sides; to go to one side and describe the suffering being endured by the other side, and then go to the other side and describe the suffering being endured by the first side.</p>

              <p>One day I complained to Suzuki Roshi about the people I was working with. <br>He listened intently. <br>Finally he said, "If you want to see virtue, you have to have a calm mind."</p>

              <p>Although these four [guidelines] sound simple, they are difficult and may even be considered ‘ascetic’ practices.</p>
              <p>1. Avoid insulting others when they insult us.<br>2. Avoid getting angry when others are angry at us.<br>3. Avoid beating others when they hit us.<br>4. Avoid observing other’s faults when they observe ours.<br><br>For some people, these four practices are totally the opposite to what they have been brought up to do.</p>
              <p>From the time they’re little, they have been told that when another child hits them, they should strike them back in order to protect themselves and avoid more harm. Our national ‘security’ is based on such a belief.</p>
              <p>In addition, when someone is angry at us, anger towards them seems to arise automatically in us, and when we’re insulted or our faults are pointed out we feel entitled to humiliate the other person by making them look bad in from of others.</p>

              <p>Whether others practice compassion towards you or not, if you don’t practice the good heart, you may harm other sentient beings throughout your life. One individual without compassion can make many millions of people suffer. That person can destroy the world, if not in this life, maybe in another life. Therefore practicing compassion is the most important meditation, the most important practice, and the best way to lead your life. For everyone – a leader of a country, a business person, a farmer, an actor, an enlisted man or woman, a worker, a married person, an ordained person, a doctor, a nurse, a prostitute – compassion is the best way to live the life.</p>

              <p><em>Why do you focus more on receiving healing blessings yourself than on giving them to others?</em></p>
              <p>When we try to begin our journey on a spiritual path, finding excuses not to move forward is a typical trap for many of us. When we are not pursuing any spiritual path, we don't even think that much about caring for others, but when we are at the starting point of some worthwhile journey, we immediately begin hearing, "Oh, you're so selfish. you're enjoying peace and joy, while many others are suffering. That's not fair!" That freezes us where we are and prevents us from making any progress. At this point, we have to remember two things:</p>
              <p>1. In order to help or heal others, we must first gain the benefit of healing blessings ourselves. It is like wanting to give money to a needy person: first we must have or make some money, because only then can we give it away.</p>
              <p>2. Yes, according to Buddhism, especially Mahayana Buddhism, the best spiritual training is to serve the needs of others, the mother beings, with no selfish motivations. That means that our purpose in generating peace and joy in ourselves must be for the sake of others, or at least that must be our aim.</p>
              <p>Thus we must create and feel peace and joy in ourselves with no hesitation. When we have gained these benefits, we must share them with others, with the greatest joy.</p>
              <p>If we have peace, spontaneously all our words and actions will be expressions of peace and joy. Then, even if we are not actively sharing peace or trying to help others, our good qualities will still have a positive effect on many around us.</p>

This mechanical notion of practice, "If I practice, then I will be (fill in the blank)," leads to discouragement because it is not true that practice inevitably leads to happiness or anything that we can imagine.

              <p>A Ch'an Master once told his disciples: Chan practice is very easy.
              When you eat, just eat; when you sleep, just sleep; when you walk,
              just walk." One disciple said, "I know how to eat, sleep, and walk.
              Everybody knows that, so is everybody practicing Ch'an?" The Master
              said, "That's not true: when you eat, your mind is not on eating;
              when you sleep your mind is either filled with dreams or lost in a
              muddled state of blankness; when you walk, you're just
              daydreaming."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Steven Glazer:</strong><br><br>Sacredness is not understood within a particular religious framework but instead as growing out of two basic qualities of our experience: awareness and wholeness. Awareness is a natural, self-manifesting quality: it is our ability to perceive, experience, and know. A sense of awareness can be cultivated (or enhanced) through mindfulness or attentiveness. The development of awareness enables us to bring a greater and greater sense of presence to the repercussions and meaning of our lives.<br><br>Wholeness is the inherent, seamless, interdependent quality of the world. Wholeness, indeed, is the fact of the matter: the things of this world (including us) are already connected, are already in relationship, are already in union. Wholeness, however, can be cultivated within us by experiencing this nondual quality of the world. Through experiences of awareness and wholeness, we begin to establish the view of the sacred.<br><br><br><strong><br>Sogyal Rinpoche, from Glimpse of the Day<br></strong><br>A wave in the sea, seen in one way, seems to have a distinct identity, an end and a beginning, a birth and a death. Seen in another way, the wave itself doesn’t really exist but is just the behavior of water, “empty” of any separate identity but “full” of water. So when you really think about the wave, you come to realize that it is something that has been made temporarily possible by wind and water, and is dependent on a set of constantly changing circumstances. You also realize that every wave is related to every other wave.<br><br>I often think of the great masters and imagine beings who have their depth of realization as magnificent mountain eagles, who soar above both life and death and see them for what they are, in all their mysterious, intricate interrelation.<br>To see through the eyes of the mountain eagle, the view of realization, is to look down on a landscape in which the boundaries that we imagined existed between life and death shade into each other and dissolve. The physicist David Bohm has described reality as being “unbroken wholeness in flowing movement.”<br>What is seen by the masters, then, seen directly and with total understanding, is that flowing movement and that unbroken wholeness. What we, in our ignorance, call “life” and what we, in our ignorance, call “death” are merely different aspects of that wholeness and that movement.<br><br>If we are interdependent with everything and everyone, even our smallest, least significant thought, word, and action have real consequences throughout the universe. Throw a pebble into a pond. It sends a shiver across the surface of the water. Ripples merge into one another and create new ones. Everything is inextricably interrelated: We come to realize that we are responsible for everything we do, say, or think, responsible in fact for ourselves, everyone and everything else, and the entire universe.</p></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: Garamond;"></span>Louie Wing said, “Ceasing conceptualization is easy
              to understand, but it is difficult to put into practice. Some students
              become frustrated and run off to remote areas or mountain retreats to
              escape the activities of the real world. They sit in dark, quiet
              temples with their tongues pressed to the roofs of their mouths
              listening to themselves breathe. Some of them waste away their whole
              lives like that. That is not ceasing conceptualization; that is ceasing
              to be human.</p>
              <p>True cessation consists of dwelling in the pure and clear luminous
              awareness of your own mind at all times and places. Abiding within the
              void and participating in the world are not two separate things. All
              activities are void; the void is all activities. Do not be deluded by
              false teachers dressed up like ancient Chinese hermits. If they have
              not awakened to true nature, Americans who shave their heads and wear
              Asian robes are simply poseurs.”</p>

              <p>In a sense everything is dreamlike and illusory, but even so,
              humorously you go on doing things. For example, if you are walking,
              without unnecessary solemnity or self-consciousness, lightheartedly
              walk toward the open space of truth. When you sit, be the stronghold of
              truth. As you eat, feed your negativities and illusions into the belly
              of emptiness, dissolving them into all-pervading space. And when you go
              to the toilet, consider all your obscurations and blockages are being
              cleansed and washed away.<br><br>DUDJOM RINPOCHE<br><br><br>In meditation, be at ease, be as natural and spacious as possible.<br><br>Slip
              quietly out of the noose of your habitual anxious self, release all
              grasping, and relax into your true nature. Think of your ordinary,
              emotional, thought-ridden self as a block of ice or a slab of butter
              left out in the sun. If you are feeling hard and cold, let this
              aggression melt away in the sunlight of your meditation. Let peace work
              on you and enable you to gather your scattered mind into the
              mindfulness of Calm Abiding, and awaken in you the awareness and
              insight of Clear Seeing. And you will find all your negativity
              disarmed, your aggression dissolved, and your confusion evaporating
              slowly like mist into the vast and stainless sky of your absolute
              nature.<br><br>Sogyal Rinpoche<br><br>some excerpts from Sogyal Rinpoche (a little Buddhist primer 101)</p>
