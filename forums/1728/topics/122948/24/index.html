            <div class='col-md body'>Understanding the Dhamma allows us also to have a fearless attitude.<br>We begin to realise that we can accept whatever happens. There's really nothing to be afraid of. Then you can let go of life, you can follow it because you are not expecting anything out of it, and you're not trying to control it.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Dzogchen teachings say that the most important thing is discovering our real nature of mind. But first we must discover our own everyday mind. If we never discover in a real sense our own mind and its limitations, then we are jumping too quickly into the real nature of mind. So it is very, very important that we first actually understand our real condition and also our relative condition: our physical body, our energy, and our mind, and how these relate to our existence and our own world with all its problems.<br><br>ChÃ¶gyal Namkhai Norbu, Dzogchen: The Self Perfected State<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people say Buddhism is responsible for certain countries being undeveloped and backward. They also say that Buddhism always draws attention to suffering and insists that people give up the worldly life to sit in a forest to meditate. It is for this reason that Westeners in the past have treated Buddhism as a "pessimistic religion". It is true that Buddhism emphasises the unsatisfactoriness of life. But this does not make it pessimistic. In the same way, we cannot call a doctor who tells a patient that he is dying of cancer "pessimistic". A religion is pessismistic if it simply says life is miserable. But in Buddhism, clear teachings are offered on how to become happy and contented.<br><br>- Ven.

During the debate, they touched upon the question of whether both sentient and non-sentient beings could attain perfect wisdom.

Their titles were "Before Practicing Ch'an," "While Practicing Ch'an," and "After Becoming Enlightened through the Practice of Ch'an."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The first poem read as follows:</span><br>Viewed horizontally, it is a mountain range;<br>while viewed vertically, it becomes a peak.<br>Far and near, high and low -- each is unique.<br>The real face of Lu Shan is not to be seen,<br>Because one is standing on the mountain.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The second poem expressed a different state of mind, while Su engaged in Ch'an practice:</span><br>The misty rain of Lu Shan and the tides of Chekiang,<br>Not seeing them in person is forever regrettable.<br>After arriving, nothing unusual is to be seen --<br>The misty rain of Lu Shan and the tides of Chekiang.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The final poem described Su's feelings after he had attained realization through Ch'an practice:</span><br>The sounds of rippling creeks are long, wide tongues;<br>The mountains are the pure bodies of the Buddhas.<br>Late at night, when contemplating the 84,000 verses,<br>How is one to explain what one has realized?<br><br>After this experience, Su Tung-po thought even more highly of his own understanding of the Dharma. When he was told that Ch'an Master Ch'eng-hao from Yu-ch'uan Temple in Chingnan was so incisive that his timely questions defied response, Su Tung-po refused to believe it. He went to visit the Master in civilian clothing to test the latter's knowledge of Ch'an. As soon as he met the Master, he asked, "I was told that you're very good at Ch'an meditation. May I ask, what is meditation?"<br><br>The Master did not answer Su Tung-po's question, but instead asked, "Sir, may I have your name, please?"<br><br>Su Tung-po replied, "My name is Scale, which weighs all the abbots who are on Earth."<br><br>Upon hearing this, the Master gave a loud shout and asked, "May I ask how much that shout weighs?"<br><br>Su Tung-po had nothing to say in reply, but simply stood up, prostrated, and left.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistdoor.com/oldweb/bdoor/0410/images/z33_c1.gif"><br><img src="http://www.buddhistdoor.com/oldweb/bdoor/0410/images/z33_c2.gif"><br><img src="http://www.buddhistdoor.com/oldweb/bdoor/0410/images/z33_c3.gif"><br><br>In meditations Su Tung-po experienced the three stages described by Ch'an Master Ch'ing-yuan Hsing-ssu: "When one sees a mountain of river before practicing Ch'an, it is simply a mountain or a river. When one sees a mountain or a river during Ch'an practice, it neither looks like a mountain nor a river. When one sees a mountain or a river after practicing Ch'an, it is again a mountain or a river."<br><br>After progressing through these three stages, one acquires a comprehension of the Dharma, however, one still will not be enlightened, for one has yet to attain a realization of what one has understood through personal experience. In other words, a Ch'an practitioner's self-cultivation starts by comprehending the Truth and is perfected by practicing the Truth. A person who lacks either self-cultivation or realization will surely become dumbfounded and speechless by a shout from Ch'an masters such as Ch'eng-hao.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You must also understand that to take revenge on trouble-makers only creates more problems and difficulties. You must realised that negative feelings and actions only bring harm and sufferings to both you and the trouble- maker. In order to take revenge, you have to create a sense of hatred in your own heart. This hatred is like a poison which you inject into a trouble-maker. But since the poison is initially created in you, surely it will harm you before it harm anyone else. Before you can throw any cow-dung at another, you must dirty yourself with cow-dung. Then your behaviour is the same as the action of the foolish person.<br><br>~ Ven. Dr k Dhammananda, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Purpose Of Life </span></div>
