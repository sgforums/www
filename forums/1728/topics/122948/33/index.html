                  integrity can be corrupted. A greedy thought is the seed of fear and confusion. It will grow
                  wildly. The material gain that a greedy act brings is a small gain indeed. To act without greed
                  and lose some material benefit is also, therefore a small loss. But to lose one’s integrity! That is
                  an immense loss! The enlightened person stands in awe of the fulcrum. </span></p>

              I tell students to find out "What am I?" This is a kong-an. Before thinking, what are you? One says "I don't know." But even before speaking, prior to any words or thoughts, this "before-thinking mind" is clear mind.

                                not forget the sky. Each remains homesick for his true home, the place where his nature has
                                decreed that he should be. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #222222; font-size: normal;">Man is born in the state of innocence. His original nature is love and grace and purity. Yet he
                                emigrates so casually without even a thought of his old home. Is this not sadder than the fishes
                                and the birds? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #222222; font-size: normal;">12.	Those who pursue money are always rushed, always busy with urgent matters. Those who pursue
                                the Dharma, go slow and easy. “Boring” you say? Maybe. Maybe it’s downright dreary to stop
                                and smell a flower or listen to a bird. Maybe a glint of gold is really more dazzling than the sight
                                of one’s Original Face. Maybe what we need is a better definition of “treasure”. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #222222; font-size: normal;">13.	The heart’s weather should always be clear, always sunny and calm. The only time the weather
                                could turn bad is when clouds of lust and attachment form. These always bring storms of worry
                                and confusion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #222222; font-size: normal;">14.	A single speck in the eye blurs good vision, we see double or triple images. A single dirty thought
                                confounds a rational mind. Many errors in judgment can arise from it. Remove that speck and
                                see clearly! Remove that dirty thought and think clearly! </span></p>

              <p><em>As a Merchant Marine, a teacher and/or a community are sometimes simply
              not available. However, Dogen’s Shobogenzo-Zuimonki has often been a
              source of encouragement. I thought I would share some lines from that
              source for others in similar circumstances. (From the translation by
              Thomas Cleary)<br><br>The first ones here, are good reminders that we
              don’t need “zendos” “zafus” or any of the other meditation
              paraphernalia to practice and realize the Buddha Way. <br><br><strong>“Though
              you may not have robes and bowl, just think that even in the household
              life, the Buddha Way may be carried out and so you should practice it.
              This is also because robes and bowl are merely the proper trappings of
              monkhood; a true traveler on the Way of Buddhahood does not depend upon
              them.”</strong><br></em><em>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 6:8<br><br><strong>“Even in a
              grass hut or under a tree, pondering even a single phrase of the
              Teaching, practicing a single period of sitting meditation, this is
              indeed the true flourishing of Buddhism.”</strong><br></em><em>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 2:6<br><br><strong>“Gaining
              the Way does not depend upon the sharpness or dullness of the
              faculties: everyone can awaken to the truth. Depending upon zeal or
              sloth, there is slowness or quickness in attaining the Way. The
              difference between zeal and sloth is whether one’s determination is
              thoroughgoing or not.”</strong><br></em><em>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 6:9<br><br>Yet, at the same time, Dogen’s constant insistence on determined, dedicated practice and realization cannot be forgotten.<br><br><strong>“An
              Ancient said, ‘Do not pass time in vain.’ Now I ask you, does time stop
              because you value it? Does it not stop even though you value it? You
              must realize that time does not pass by in vain; it is man who passes
              it in vain. This means that people, like time, should not go idly by,
              but should earnestly study the Way."</strong><br></em><em>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 4:5<br><br><strong>“Those
              who study the Path must let go of mind and body and enter wholly into
              the Way of the Buddha. An Ancient said, ‘Atop a hun-dred foot pole, how
              will you step forward?’ Thus, having climbed to the top of a hundred
              foot pole, there is a mind which thinks that it will die if it lets go
              its foothold, and so holds fast. The admonition to take a step forward
              means that having concluded that it would not be bad, then, so as to
              cast off body and life, one must deliberately aban-don everything, from
              his worldly occupations to his lifetime career. As long as he does not
              abandon this, no matter if he studies the Way with the same urgency as
              of beating out a fire on his head, it would still be impossible to
              attain the Way. You must settle your resolve and cast off body and mind together.”</strong></em><em><br>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 3:1<br><br><strong>“In
              the past, too, they all endured pain and forbore cold and culti-vated
              their practice in the midst of their distress. Students now, even
              though you be in sore distress, still you should just force yourselves
              to study the Way.”</strong><br></em><em>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 4:6<br><br><strong>“An Ancient said, ‘Atop a hundred foot pole, you should still ad-vance another step.’<br><br>What
              this means is that you should be like one who has climbed to the top of
              a hundred foot pole, yet lets go his hands and feet, thus throwing down
              his body and mind.”</strong><br></em><em>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 5:21<br><br><strong>“The
              Ancients did not necessarily have golden bones; it is just that once
              their determination was thoroughgoing, they forgot about other things
              in order to practice. When something critical comes up in life, one
              will inevitably forget about petty things. Since the Way of Buddhas is
              the One Great Con-cern, in hoping to complete it in one lifetime, you
              should determine not to waste the days and hours.”</strong><br></em><em>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 6:8<br><br>Dogen’s
              inspiring insistence that through thorough determination and insistent
              practice we “should not fail to attain the Way” is always most welcome
              to hear. <br><br><strong>“The Buddhas and Patriarchs were all originally
              ordinary men. While they were ordinary men, they could not but have
              done bad things, had bad thoughts, been stupid, been foolish.
              Nevertheless, because they all changed, followed wise teachers, and
              cultivated practice, they all became Buddhas and Patriarchs.<br><br>You
              people now should be likewise. Do not demean yourselves, saying that
              you are stupid and dull. If you do not arouse your minds in this life,
              when will you ever practice the Way? If you now practice insistently
              you should not fail to attain the Way.”</strong><br></em><em>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 6:16<br><br><strong>"As
              long as you study the Buddhist Teaching with the earnest intent to
              obtain awakening before you die, there should not be a single person
              who would fail to attain."</strong><br></em><em>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 2:20<br><br><strong>“Now each of you should be thoroughly determined to practice and see; ten out of every ten of you should attain the Way.”</strong><br></em><em>Shobogenzo-Zuimonki, 1:14<br><br>I hope others find Dogen’s encouraging words as helpful as I have.<br><br>Gassho,<br><br>Ted Biringer</em></p>

Everything about us, within as well as without - our relationships, our thoughts, our feelings - is impermanent, in a constant state of flux. Being aware of this, the mind craves permanency, a perpetual state of peace, of love, of goodness, a security that neither time nor events can destroy; therefore it creates the soul, the Atman, and the visions of a permanent paradise. But this permanency is born of impermanency, and so it has within it the seeds of the impermanent. There is only one fact: impermanence.<br> <br>Book of Life - August 10th</p></div>

              <p>While Buddhism teaches us not to be attached to the material world, it does not condemn the material world. Some people believe that one must be poor to be considered a cultivated or spiritual person. This is not true at all. Wealth by itself does not have any ethical value. It is the immoral pursuit of wealth, as well as its ill use, that gives wealth a bad name. Money, if used properly, can be applied to the betterment of mankind.</p>

              <p><br> <br> Once you have completed such contemplations<br> you should develop experiential wisdom in your process<br> Among the three paths of trascendence in the three Vehicles<br> Here you enter the unexcelled, essential import.<br> First, devote yourself to understanding the nature of reality.<br> <br> Although it takes many forms, depending on the Vehicle,<br> The definitive essence is the indivisible reality<br> Which is the secret treasury of all Buddhas.<br> It is the natural transparency intuition<br> Beginninglessly peaceful, free from perplexity.<br> Like sun and sky, spontaneous and uncreated.<br> <br> Since its natural great purity is primally present,<br> It is vision and voidness inseparable,<br> Free of proof and rejection, going and coming.<br> Beyond the realm of superficial determinations and distinctions,<br> Its indivisible reality is neither proven nor unproven,<br> Experientially vision an voidness are nondual;<br> This reality is called "indivisible."<br> <br> When analyzed by the conventional two realities,<br> All things in cyclic life are mistaken appearances;<br> Untrue and deceptive, they are superficial realities.<br> Things of Nirvana are profound peace of translucency,<br> Accepted as ultimate reality, changeless in nature.<br> <br> This manifold appearances is thus superficial.<br> Illusion, like the reflection of the moon in water,<br> It lacks the intrinsic reality it appears to have.<br> When examined, it lacks basis, root, and substance,<br> Free of intrinsic identity, empty as space.<br> When unexamined, this illusory, enticing diversity<br> Evolves as a relativistic distortion of instinct.<br> <br> Thus, just like a datura hallucination,<br> These things are selfless and unreal.<br> Since that, in reality, is their way of being,<br> The "ultimate appears but superficially,<br> Though appearing, in reality it is unborn;<br> So naturally its reality is indivisible.<br> <br> Its natural primal purity<br> And its transparent ultimacy are nondual,<br> So the life-cycle and liberation are nondual,<br> And its reality is indivisible.<br> <br> Since the life-cycle appears while lacking reality,<br> In that ultimate realm of realitylessness<br> Nothing can be distinguished as separate and distinct,<br> And life-cycle and liberation are taught as equality.<br> Other ideas are false intellectual notions,<br> Quite confused about the nature of reality.<br> <br> Causality exists as it appears to deceptive experience,<br> So cherish understanding of ethical choice.<br> The changeless nature of ultimate reality<br> Is transparency, the Bliss Lord of essence, spontaneity,<br> Natural indivisible awareness of clarity-void.<br> <br> This is the mandala of natural spontaneity<br> Primal natural perfection, essence of enlightenment,<br> Purity, unfabricated, free from partiality,<br> Profound peace, body and wisdom inseparable.<br> <br> It has examples known to all beings;<br> Known to the wise as like underground gold,<br> A lamp in a vase, a body in a lotus.<br> Just as a pauper has a treasure underground<br> But doesn't know and so stays poor,<br> Though you possess natural enlightenment,<br> It is hidden by the earth of body, speech, and eightfold mind,<br> So you stay poor, impoverished by the ills of life.<br> <br> Just as a clairvoyant person can see<br> And find a way to take out the treasure<br> To perfect the wealth of self and other,<br> So the holy ones teach that reality<br> And show how enlightenment can be found within,<br> The wish-granting gem that fulfills both aims.<br> <br> Just as a lamp in a vase might be bright<br> But cannot illuminate, blocked by the vase,<br> So the essential Truth Body abides within<br> Yet does not show, blocked by the vase of obscuration.<br> <br> But it does show when the vase is broken,<br> Just as the world lamp illumines all lands,<br> When all obscurations are removed.<br> Though the Bliss-Lord Body is in the lotus,<br> It does not show when the lotus is closed<br> So the thousands petals of subjects and objects block<br> One's vision of the self-luminous Lord of Victors.<br> <br> When the petals open, it is clear,<br> There is great liberation from the lotus of duality.<br> The three Buddha Bodies become naturally evident.<br> Thus please understand the reality<br> That ultimate-realm translucency<br> Exists within yourself!<br> <br> This reality has names of many different kinds.<br> It is "the realm that transcends life and liberation<br> And the primally present "natural spontaneity,"<br> As the "essential realm" obscured by defilements,<br> As the "ultimate truth," the condition of reality,<br> As the originally pure "stainless translucency,"<br> As the "central reality" that dispels extremisms,<br> As the "transcendent wisdom" beyond fabrications,<br> As the "indivisible reality" clear-void-purity,<br> As the "Suchness" reality free of death transitions.<br> <br> Such names are accepted by the clear-seeing wise.<br> Not understanding this, one adopts a nihilistic voidness,<br> Though claiming to avoid extremes of being and nothing,<br> Since one does not know the ground of freedom<br> And longs to escape to the peak of existence,<br> One falls outside this profound teaching,<br> Sits empty-minded, fit to rub with dust!<br> <br> The Teacher taught the treasury of Dharma,<br> The path of the pinnacle, clear light, essence of all,<br> The "reality of the ground spontaneity."<br> Understanding this ultimate profound view,<br> Liberates one from resistance and obscuration,<br> frees from all absolutism and nihilism.<br> <br> One's practice is fruitful, one soon becomes enlightened,,<br> One gains the eye to see all Sutras and Tantras.<br> Therefore be sure to realize the reality of clear light!</p>

              <h4><a name="miser"></a></h4>
              <p><strong>Miserliness</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The normal hand open and closes</span></p>
              <p>A devotee told Chan Master Moxian, "My wife is extremely stingy. She will not 
              spend even a penny on charity. Could you please come to my house and talk to her 
              about engaging in benevolent deeds?" Very compassionately, Chan Master Moxian 
              agreed.</p>
              <p>The next day, when he went to the devotee's house, the wife came out to 
              receive him. True to her miserly nature, she did not even offer Chan Master 
              Moxian a cup of tea. Chan Master sat down and held out his fist, asking, 
              "Madame, look at my hand. What would you think if my hand remained constantly in 
              a fist?" The wife responded, "If it remained in a fist, then your hand is 
              deformed! Something must be wrong with it."</p>
              <p>Chan Master repeated her words back to her, saying, "It is deformed!" In the 
              meantime, he opened up his fist and held out a flat palm to her, asking, "Were 
              it like this all the time, what do you think?" The wife responded, "That would 
              be deformed too!"</p>
              <p>Seizing this opportunity, Chan Master immediately came to the point, saying, 
              "Madame, you are right! A constant closed fist and a constant opened palm are 
              both deformed. It is the same with the way we use money. If we are always 
              close-fisted, only concerned about getting more money, but never consider 
              giving, we are deformed. If we are always open-handed, only thinking about 
              spending but not saving, we are deformed as well. Money should flow like a 
              smooth current. When it comes in, it should flow out too. There should be a 
              balance in your receiving and giving."</p>

              <p>A Note To My Thoughts- A Poem by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche<br><br><strong>A Note To My Thoughts</strong><br><br>Past, isn't it simply a fleeting thought?<br>Future, isn't it just a projection of mind?<br>Aren't they all simply just happening now?<br>What there is is only this moment --<br>So fresh, yet just another fleeting nowness!<br>The world that you see,<br>And the sounds that you hear,<br>Thoughts that arise randomly,<br>Aren't they all just happening in nowness?<br>Why don't you just let go of the past and future thoughts?<br>Why can't you simply relax in this beautiful world now?<br>Why do you sacrifice your present for your pure imaginations?<br>Hey! Hey! Wake up you, lazy dzogchen lama!<br>dpr</p>

              <p>In the sky, there is no distinction of east and west; people create distinctions out of their own minds and then believe them to be true.<br>---------------</p>
              <p><br>The mind is the source of happiness and unhappiness.</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>When a man is free from all sense pleasures and depends on nothingness he<br>is free in the supreme freedom from perception. He will stay there and<br>not return again.</p>
              <p><br>It is like a flame struck by a sudden gust of wind. In a flash it has<br>gone out and nothing more can be known about it. It is the same with a<br>wise man freed from mental existence: in a flash he has gone out and<br>nothing more can be known about him.</p>
              <p><br>When a person has gone out, then there is nothing by which you can measure<br>him. That by which he can be talked about is no longer there for him; you<br>cannot say that he does not exist. When all ways of being, all phenomena<br>are removed, then all ways of description have also been removed.</p>
