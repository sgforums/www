              <h2>Pseudo-Zen, ‘Pure Awareness’, and the Wisdom of Differentiation</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="post-byline">By Ted Biringer, on September 13th, 2009</div>
              <p></p>
              <div class="post-bodycopy clearfix">
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I have observed pseudo-Zen teachers 
                  who claim that Zen practice and enlightenment is aimed only at realizing
                   this condition, and learning to expand and sustain it… adherents of 
                  this practice are unable to advance and experience the true path of Zen.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Learned audience, many popular “Zen” 
                  books advocate the experience of the universal mirror prajna and the 
                  prajna of equality, but fail to acknowledge, much less encourage 
                  students to realize, the deeper levels of wisdom beyond these partial 
                  aspects of the enlightened mind… such books sometimes assert that 
                  progress on the path of Zen consists only in expanding the duration that
                   the conditions of ‘oneness’ or ‘pure awareness’ can be sustained…</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">[but] failing to recognize the wisdom of
                   differentiation, can effectively bar students from the true wisdom of 
                  the buddhas and Zen masters. The overall effect of practicing such 
                  teachings actually fosters a non-Buddhist disdain for the world of 
                  things and events. If such teachings were true, the highest realization 
                  of Zen would consist of nothing more than living in a detached state of 
                  pure awareness all the time. To become fixated on this aspect of the 
                  enlightened mind is to abstain from the zeal, the passion, the joy, and 
                  the heartache that gives life its flavor.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">…there is much more to Zen Buddhism than
                   experiences of oneness or pure awareness. The practice and 
                  enlightenment of Zen includes the wisdom of differentiation, infinite 
                  variety, and joyful participation in the world.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Becoming attached to or fixated on the 
                  blissful conditions of oneness, or pure awareness is a disease that 
                  causes practice and enlightenment to stagnate and become foul. The 
                  profound wisdom and skillful techniques of the buddhas and Zen ancestors
                   are beyond the reach of practitioners that stop here. Failing to awaken
                   to the wisdom beyond emptiness and equality, they remain powerless to 
                  help others in any truly meaningful way.</p>

              <p>A layman: Every time I clear a thought from 
              my mind, another
                                      appears right away. Thoughts keep appearing like
               that without end.
                                      What can I do about them?</p>
              <p>Bankei: Clearing thoughts from the mind as 
              they arise is like
                                      washing away blood in blood. You may succeed in 
              washing away the
                                      original blood, but you're still polluted by the
               blood you washed
                                      in. No matter how long you keep washing, the 
              bloodstains never
                                      disappear. Since you don't know that your mind 
              is originally unborn
                                      and undying and free of illusion, you think that
               your thoughts
                                      really exist, so you transmigrate in the wheel 
              of existence. You
                                      have to realize that your thoughts are ephemeral
               and unreal and,
                                      without either clutching at them or rejecting 
              them, just let them
                                      come and go of themselves. They're like images 
              reflected in a
                                      mirror. A mirror is clear and bright and 
              reflects whatever is
                                      placed before it. but the image doesn't remain 
              in the mirror. The
                                      buddha-mind is ten thousand times brighter than 
              any mirror and is
                                      marvelously illuminative besides. All thoughts 
              vanish tracelessly
                                      into its light.</p>

              <p>Meditation as I mean it is not something you do for a 
              future result. It is not something "you" do. It is simply awareness 
              itself <em>seeing through</em> the thought-constructed movies and ideas 
              that are so mesmerizing, including the desire for experiences, 
              transformations and future results. It is seeing the false as false, 
              deconstructing every frame, demolishing every landing place, every 
              foot-hold, every answer. It is the wonder of not knowing, not the dead 
              weight of dogma and belief. True meditation is  always only about Here 
              and Now, not some future benefit or attainment. Meditation is the 
              aliveness of actuality (seeing, hearing, sensing, touching, being).  It 
              is the absolute simplicity of what is, not methods or techniques 
              designed to achieve results. It is an invitation to let all the answers 
              and formulas go, to enjoy the extraordinary in the ordinary, and perhaps
               to discover that there is no separate one to be bound or free. 
              Meditation is without repetition. It is always utterly new.</p>

              <p>I see a lot of people wanting to practice yet not finding the time. 
              It affects their self-esteem. We need to ask ourselves what prevents us 
              from meeting our aspirations in life. Are we using our life well, or are
               we simply working to maintain it? How are we using our time? Are we 
              considering what’s at stake? Are we tending to our desire for a 
              meaningful life, or are we simply avoiding it? If so, why?<br><br>How we
               spend our time depends on how we organize our time, and how we organize
               our time depends on how we envision our lives. Once we have sorted out 
              these questions and have made a clear decision to make room in our lives
               for practice, we have to exert ourselves rather than let the mind 
              become too loose and unorganized, and just wait for something to happen.</p>

              <p>Once you decide to practice the Dharma, carry it through to the end. Otherwise, it is as Paltrul Rinpoche said: "When young, we are controlled by others and cannot practice." Usually, until people are about 17 or 18 years of age, they must take orders from their parents or remain stuck in school or at home; they cannot just walk off and practice. Paltrul Rinpoche's quote continues, "In adulthood, we chase after the objects of pleasure and cannot practice. When we are old, we lose our physical strength and cannot practice. Alas, Alas! What do we do now?"</p>

The work was hard, but the harvest was plentiful. And yet, one day he couldn’t help but ask himself, “Why am I working so hard? Life is meaningless and boring! Where is my life leading?” Shortly afterwards, a monk came to his house to ask for alms. The monk looked free and happy, which deeply impressed the farmer cheerfully made up his mind to give up everything and become a monk. As soon as he left his house, he suddenly felt how empty his hands were. He was so used to holding a hoe in his hands to work that without the hoe he now felt a little lost. Therefore, he went back to his house, picked up his hoe and tried hard to think of what he could do with it. It was a fine hoe. The shaft was smooth and shiny from daily use. It would be heartbreaking to throw it away. “Ok, then,” He thought, “I’ll wrap it up and put it away.” He found a secure place in the house to hide it. Now everything was settled. With his mind at ease, the farmer left his house at last. The farmer did all he could to fulfil the requirements to be a true monk. However, he could hardly resist thinking of his hoe whenever he came across green paddles. Every now and then, he would rush back home just to feel the hoe and then return to the temple. Time passed by quickly. After seven or eight years, he felt that something was missing. “ Why haven’t I fulfilled my dream of becoming a free, happy monk after having tried very hard to cultivate morality? There is something I haven’t let go of. Now it’s time to get rid of burden!” He rushed back home, picked up the hoe and threw it into a lake. Splash, there it went! “ I won! I succeeded!” He couldn’t resist crying out loud. Just at that moment, a king, leading his victorious army, happened to pass by. He overheard the cry and went to ask the monk, “What did you win? Why are you so cheerful?” “ I have conquered the devils in my heart. I have let all my burdens go.” The king saw that the monk was really happy and free from earthly burdens and delusions. The king thought to himself, “Now I have won the war. Victory is mine. But am I really happy? I took lands that didn’t belong to me. It is not real victory.” Then and there, the king realizes that although he had won the war, he was not a real winner, but a common person burdened with life’s vexations. He realized that in order to become a real winner and a saint, you have to conquer the devils in your heart.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">“THE UNUSAL ATTITUDE – Your cultivation of love and great compassion should not be left in a state of mere imagination or wish alone; rather a sense of responsibility, a genuine intention to engage in the task of relieving sentient beings of their sufferings and providing them with happiness, should be developed. It is important for a practitioner to work for and take upon him or herself the responsibility of fulfilling this intention. The strong your cultivation of compassion is, the more committed you will feel to taking this responsibility. Because of their ignorance, sentient beings do not know the right methods by which they can fulfil their aims. It is the responsibility of those who are equipped with this knowledge to fulfil the intention of working for their benefit.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">“For people who have the problem of self-hatred or self-loathing, for the time being it is advisable that they not think seriously about the suffering nature of existence or the underlying of unsatisfactory nature of existence. Rather they should concentrate more on the positive aspects of existence, such as appreciating the potentials that lie within oneself as a human being and the opportunities that one’s existence as a human being affords. In the traditional teaching, one speaks about all the qualities of a fully-endowed human existence. By reflecting upon these opportunities and potentials, one will be able to increase one’s sense of worth and confidence.”</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive. “One of the best human qualities is our intelligence, which enables us to judge what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, what is beneficial and what is harmful. Negative thoughts, such as anger and strong attachment, destroy this special human quality; indeed this is indeed very sad. When anger or attachment dominates the mind, a person becomes almost crazed, and I am certain that nobody wishes to be crazy. Under the power of anger or attachment we commit all kinds of harmful acts – often having far-reaching and destructive consequences. A person gripped by such states of mind and emotion is like a blind person, who cannot see where he is going. Yet we neglect to challenge these negative thoughts and emotions that lead us nearly to insanity. On the contrary, we often nurture and reinforce them! By doing this we are, in fact, making ourselves prey to their destructive power. When you reflect along these lines, you will realize that our true enemy is not outside ourselves” – The Dalai Lama.</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt; " lang="EN-SG"></span></p>

It should be done with Bodhicitta, the mind of awakening; this means telling yourself that you are going to do it for the benefit of all beings. Having this inner attitude as the basis of all practices is very important. While progressing on the path, properly speaking, the most important thing, if one can do it, is to understand as much as possible the nature of mind and do such practice with this understanding as the basis. If one can do recitation and physical practices with the speech and body while meditating on the nature of mind, these will bring even great benefit.“Buddha never mentioned that the problems we have encountered are the result of misconstruction of a house or starting a project or work on an inappropriate day or time. Buddha always talked about negative experience as a result of having performed negative actions. So for a good practitioner there is no new year, there is no good or bad day.” – The Dalai Lama.</span></span></p></div>

But when it comes to the Buddha's teaching, telling us to practise conscientiously, why do they keep forgetting these things? Why don't people take these things to heart?</p>

                      self-protective memories. Awareness is not determination nor is it the
                      action of will. Awareness is the complete and unconditional surrender
                      to what is, without rationalization, without the division of the
                      observer and the observed. As awareness is non-accumulative,
                      non-residual, it does not build up the self, positively or negatively.
                      Awareness is ever in the present and so, non-identifying and
                      non-repetitive; nor does it create habit.<br> <br> Just be aware; that is all what you have to do, without condemning,
                      without forcing, without trying to change what you are aware of. Then
                      you will see that it is like a tide that is coming in. You cannot
                      prevent the tide from coming in, build a wall, or do what you will, it
                      will come with tremendous energy. In the same if you are aware
                      choicelessly the whole field of consciousness begins to unfold. And as
                      it unfolds, you have to follow and the following becomes
                      extraordinarily difficult - following in the sense to follow the
                      movement of every thought, of every, feeling, of every secret desire.
                      It becomes difficult the moment you resist, the moment you say, "that
                      is ugly" "this is good", "this is bad", "this I will keep", "that I
                      will not keep".<br> So you begin with the outer and move inwardly. Then you will find, when
                      you move inwardly that the inward and the outward are not two different
                      things, and the outward awareness is not different from the inward
                      awareness, and that they are both the same.<br> <br> Self awareness is arduous; to think-out, feel-out every thought-feeling

              <h1><span style="font-size: medium;">Thich Nhat Hanh on The Practice of Mindfulness<br><br></span></h1>
              <h2>“Breathing in, I know that I am breathing in.” It is such a simple practice, but it can transform your life. The great meditation master Thich Nhat Hanh teaches five mindfulness exercises to help you live with happiness and joy.<br><br></h2>
              <p>Our true home is not in the past. Our true home is not in the future. Our true home is in the here and the now. Life is available only in the here and the now, and it is our true home.</p>
              <p>Mindfulness is the energy that helps us recognize the conditions of happiness that are already present in our lives. You don’t have to wait ten years to experience this happiness. It is present in every moment of your daily life. There are those of us who are alive but don’t know it. But when you breathe in, and you are aware of your in-breath, you touch the miracle of being alive. That is why mindfulness is a source of happiness and joy.</p>
              <p>Most people are forgetful; they are not really there a lot of the time. Their mind is caught in their worries, their fears, their anger, and their regrets, and they are not mindful of being there. That state of being is called forgetfulness—you are there but you are not there. You are caught in the past or in the future. You are not there in the present moment, living your life deeply. That is forgetfulness.</p>

              One evening PaltrÃ¼l Rinpoche taught the daughter of Chokgyur
              Lingpa, KÃ¶nchok PaldrÃ¶n, who was to become my grandmother. She
              remembered his words very clearly, and later repeated them to me. She
              imitated PaltrÃ¼l Rinpocheâ€™s thick Golok accent, and said, â€œDonâ€™t entertain
              thoughts about what has passed, donâ€™t anticipate or plan what will happen
              in the future. Leave your present wakefulness unaltered, utterly free and
              open. Aside from that, there is nothing else whatsoever to do!â€� What he
              meant was, donâ€™t sit and think about what has happened in the past, and
              donâ€™t speculate on what will appear in the future, or even a few moments
              from now. Leave your present wakefulness, which is the buddha nature of
              self-existing wakefulness, totally unmodified. Do not try to correct or alter
              anything. Leave it free, as it naturally is, free and wide-open like space.
              There is nothing more to do besides that. These are the vajra words of
              PaltrÃ¼l Rinpoche, and they are truly meaningful.
              
              
              ~ Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche

              <blockquote>
              <p>“See how far you can gently soften, accepting yourself as you are, without any notion of what you should become. Making friends with who you are —and really feel that friendship, that kindness.</p>
              <p>Then can you extend that friendship, gentleness, softness even to those who have hurt you, disappointed you, frustrated you. Letting go of the hurts and wounds you have been carrying by learning to forgive, by learning to accept our common human-ness.</p>
              <p>Learn to forgive yourself too for all the mistakes you have made in the past, not holding onto these wounds by having guilt and remorse in relation to them; and also letting go of the wounds that have been created by others. Learn to accept yourself as you are, and learn to accept others as they are, without an image of how you or they should be. Learning to be gentle to oneself and gentle to others.</p>
              <p>Thinking: May all beings be well and happy; may all beings overcome the suffering that they create themselves.”</p>
