              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"I have also realised that one must accept the thoughts that go on within oneself of their own accord as part of one's reality. The categories of true and false are, of course, always present but because they are not binding they take second place. The presence of thoughts is more important than our subjective judgment of them. But neither must these judgments be suppressed, for they are also existent thoughts which are part of our wholeness." (So, be mindful of everything.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>- Sayadaw U jotika</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I think the first and most important thing a person should clearly see in their practice is to see the truth that unwholesome thoughts make a person unhappy. It’s not about trying to overcome them, but just to see them plainly and clearly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>- Sayadaw U jotika</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">To see my mind through and through, and not to deceive myself is now the most important task for me. When I don’t believe in something, it is very important for me to see clearly that I don’t believe in it instead of trying to believe it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>- Sayadaw U jotika</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I think a person’s (my) most important task is to understand themself (myself) well; to understand everything happening in life deeply and not just philosophically; to understand my own motive and attitude very clearly when I say something or do something; to understand without distortion how I feel about something I’ve heard, seen, etc. (the true reaction of my mind); not to be deceived by anybody, or to deceive myself; not to follow anybody; not to have an ideal just because it sounds beautiful, but to find out for myself whether it is natural, possible, and about the consequences; and to know my own capacity when I undertake to do something. When I understand all those things clearly then I can think of helping others. Otherwise I will be deceiving myself and also deceiving others in the name of helping others. Helping others can become self-aggrandisement. I see this self-aggrandisement everywhere. </span></p>

              <p>Verses from Master Hsing Yun <em>on everyday life</em>:</p>
              <p>1.) Read at least one newspaper a day to keep up with the world. Read at least one good book a day to nurture a knowledge character</p>
              <p>2.) Stick to a regular daily routine, maintain upright and honest mental and physical behavior. Wake up and go to bed at regular times; maintain regular food intakes during the each day's three meals.</p>
              <p>3.) Develop the habit to exercise and walk at least five thousands steps per day.</p>
              <p>4.) Stay away from tobacco, alcohol, pornography, and drugs. Govern and regulate your own life.</p>
              <p>5.) Develop wholesome habits; refrain from inappropriate eating of snacks or thoughtlessly losing one's temper. Good habits are the best way to maintain a wholesome and healthy life.</p>
              <p>6.) Recitie the Buddha's name thrice before each meal, oberve the Five contemplations at Mealtime when eating at home.</p>
              <p>7.) Travel the world beneath the clouds and moon, and experience the spirit of alms-procession at least once in your life. In other words, embark on a journey on your own.</p>
              <p>8.) Give away all your possessions at least once or twice in your life as a way to experience the state of emptiness.</p>
              <p>9.) Manage your time well, utilize your space wisely, and bring harmony to the human world. Allow these three dimensions to become one, and your life shalll not be lived in vain.</p>

              <p>I bow down at the feet of my Guru.</p>
              <p>Oh good patrons! If you wish to realize the Essence of Mind,<br>You should practice the following teachings:<br>Faith, knowledge, and discipline,<br>These three are the Life Tree of Mind.<br>This is the tree you should plant and foster.</p>
              <p>Non-attachment, non-clinging, and non-blindness,<br>These are the three shields of Mind;<br>They are light to wear, strong for defense,<br>And the shields you should seek.</p>
              <p>Meditation, diligence, and perseverance,<br>These are the three horses of Mind;<br>They run fast and quickly flee!<br>If you look for horses, these are the right ones.</p>
              <p>Self-awareness, self-illumination, and self-rapture,<br>These three are the fruits of Mind;<br>Sow the seeds, ripen the fruit,<br>Refine the fluid, and the essence emerges.<br>If you look for fruit, these are the fruit you should seek.</p>
              <p>Sprung from yogic intuition,<br>This song of the Twelve Meanings of Mind is sung.<br>Inspired by your faith, continue with your practice, my good patrons!</p>

              <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>The Meaning of True 
              Renunciation</strong></span>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Now this expression 'true renunciation' emphasizes the 
              specific type of renunciation sought here. Even animals turn themselves away 
              from obvious painful experiences and are repulsed by such suffering. That is not 
              true renunciation. Likewise, meditators who yearn for birth in the form and 
              formless realms may spurn attraction to pleasurable and joyful sensations - the 
              second level of suffering, the suffering of change - in favor of neutraility. 
              However, that's not true renunciation. The renunciation we are talking about 
              here is a thought that turns away from even the third level of suffering, the 
              suffering of pervasive conditioning. Here, you need to have a deep-rooted 
              recognition of our pervasive conditioning as a form of suffering, and also the 
              recognition that the root of this conditioning is fundamental ignorance. So, 
              true renunciation is a state of mind that genuinely and 
              deeply aspires to freedom from bondage to ignorance. This state of mind is 
              founded on a reasoned understanding and also impelled by 
              wisdom.<br><br>People sometimes misundersand renunciation as being fed up 
              with life. When they struggle for success in the world and fail, running into 
              all sorts of problems, they become discouraged and, out of desperation, say they 
              are renouncing everything. That's not the kind of renunciation we are talking 
              about. That is defeatism. True renunciation is grounded in deep understanding of 
              the nature of suffering and cyclic existence. In fact, the mantra of Buddha 
              Shakyamuni, 'Om muni muni mahamuniye svaha', invokes, 'the Able One, the Great 
              Able One.' An enlightened being has great ability and a high degree of 
              confidence in being able to accomplish a goal. This is not a naive confidence or 
              a naive faith but one grounded in understanding and knowledge. Thus, true Buddhist renunciation is not that of a dejected person who 
              feels powerless and sighs, 'I'm so tired! Poor 
              me!' <br><br></span></span></div>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Meditation is one 
                        of the greatest arts in life-perhaps the greatest, and one cannot possibly 
                        learn it from anybody. That is the beauty of it. It has no technique 
                        and therefore no authority. When you learn about yourself, watch yourself, 
                        watch the way you walk, how you eat, what you say, the gossip, the hate, 
                        the jealousy-if you are aware of all that in yourself, without any choice, 
                        that is part of meditation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">So meditation can 
                        take place when you are sitting in a bus or walking in the woods full 
                        of light and shadows, or listening to the singing of birds or looking 
                        at the face of your wife or child.<br> </span></p>

              <p>The fickle, unsteady mind, so hard to guard, so hard to control, the wise man straightens, as the fletcher straightens the arrow.</p>
              <p>Like a fish that is drawn from its watery abode and thrown upon land, even so does this mind flutter. Hence should the realm of the passions be shunned.</p>
              <p>The mind is hard to check. It is swift and wanders at will. To control it is good. A controlled mind is conducive to happiness.</p>

              <p>If we use the
              analogy of awareness as a mirror, prereflective identification is like
              being captivated by and lost in the reflections appearing in the
              mirror.
              <br> <br> Reflection involves stepping back from the appearances, studying them, and developing a more objective relationship with them.
              <br> <br> And transreflective presence is like being the mirror itself –
              that vast, illuminating openness and clarity that allows reality to be
              seen as what it is.
              <br> <br> In pure presence, awareness is self-illuminating, or aware of itself without objectification.
              <br> <br> The mirror simply abides in its own nature, without either separating from its reflections or confusing itself with them.
              <br> <br> Negative reflections do not stain the mirror, positive reflections do not improve on it. 
              <br> <br> They are all the mirror’s self-illuminating display.</p>

              <p>While all of you here are turned toward me, intent only on hearing my sermon and wondering, "What's Bankei going to say?" you aren't trying either to hear or not hear the cawing of the crows and the chirping of the sparrows out in back. But even so, once they start to chirp and caw, you recognize and distinguish the crow's kaa-kaa and the sparrow's chuu-chuu. And it's not only for crows and sparrows; everything here, when you perceive it with the Unborn, will be simultaneously distinguished and you won't overlook even one thing in one hundred or one thousand... Your distinguishing everything you see and hear like this, without producing a single thought, is the marvelously illuminating dynamic function, the Buddha Mind that is unborn.</p>

              From http://www.mumonkan.org/resources/Dzogchen.aspx
               
              This would be a good time to listen to Harada Roshi's teaching on the Natural State.
               
              http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJOq_BM_zug&amp;feature=related
               
              We conceive that Rigpa or awakened Awareness is some magnificent and unbelievable state of consciousness.  In fact it is absolutely simple and ordinary.  It is simply aware of what is happening.  It has no thoughts about anything nor any opinions nor preferences.  In a certain fashion it is like a video camera that records the sights and sounds exactly as they are experienced.  The video camera does not have the capacity to analyze what it is recording... everything is just left as it is.  Rigpa is just like this.  It is not a way of being or some special way of relating to one's world of experience.  It is just noticing and observing what is manifesting exactly as it manifests.
               
              What then is the Natural State, which is another name for Rigpa or primordial Awareness? In the chair that you are actually sitting in, notice the room.  If there is a window, look out the window...notice what you see.  Just notice it.  Look at your hands... just notice them.  Look at the computer monitor... just notice without assessment or evaluation.  Again now, look out the window...just look without labelling what is perceived.  Move your head and slowly just look around the room that you are in.  Without thinking about anything, totally topic free... just be in that moment of simply observing the room.
               
              That simple observingness is the Natural State of primordial Awareness.  It is not more elaborate or more profound.  It just the observing of what is there.  This observing, aware quality of consciousness is Rigpa.  How easy!  When we just stay with that effortless watching without agenda, that is Rigpa in its Natural State.  When engaged in our thinking and evaluating what is perceived, that is the functioning of mind... the arising of the the make-believe world of labels and opinions.  That is an unnecessary activity added to the basic condition of just being...just observing.  This thinking "about" what is observed is samsara.  When we just are in naked observing we are in Nirvana.  Since our observational awareness is functioning in this moment... how can you say you can't grasp Rigpa or the Natural State?  This simpe observingness is not the result of practice, intellectualizing or study.  You are already observing whatever you are observing.  That is Rigpa or the Buddha Mind in its most Natural State.  When we say relax into Rigpa or Awareness, that is what is relaxed into...just simple noticing-ness or perceivingness.  
               
              In this there is nothing to maintian as you are always observing, you can't help but observing.  This observing quality of consciousness is there by default... isn't it?  You are either observing thoughts, feelings, sensations or external perceptions.  But the observingness never changes, only the experience.  There is absolutely nothing to understand or grasp in this perceivingness.  It never knows itself and has no understanding of anything... it just is observing like a big eyeball.  That is what you are:  just a big eye ball observing, seeing, looking...so to speak.  This observing doesn't think or evaluate ...it just is pure being and pure being is always observing.  If you really don't get this please let me know... we are so close!  We have covered all the angles... nothing is left!
               
              Abandon the "thinking mind" and just be the observing... it is the Absolute as it is.  The "thinkiing mind" is just an unnecessary add-on, the genus and dimension of imaginary existence, which is what samsara is created from.  No thought... no samsara.  The space of room is just there without any need to improve it nor need to try to maintain it.  The same with Awareness, our everyday, ordinary awareness...

              <p>Human beings understand too much. But what they understand is just
              somebody’s opinion. Like a dog barking. American dogs say, “Woof,
              woof.” Korean dogs say, “Mung, mung.” Polish dogs say, “How, how.” So
              which dog barking is correct? This is human beings’ barking,
              not dog barking. If dog and you become one hundred percent one, then
              you know sound of barking. This is Zen teaching. Boom! Become one.</p>

This mind is beginningless and endless, unborn and indestructible. It has no color or shape, neither exists, nor doesn’t exist, isn’t old or new, long or short, large or small, since it transcends all measures, limits, names and comparison. It is what you see in front of you. Start to think about it and immediately you are mistaken. It is like the boundless void, which can’t fathom or measured. The one mind is the Buddha, and there is no distinction between Buddha and ordinary beings, except that ordinary beings are attached to forms and thus seek Buddhahood outside themselves. By this very seeking they lose it, since they are using Buddha to seek for Buddha, using mind to seek for mind. Even if they continue for a million eons, they will never be able to find it. They don’t know that all they have to do is put a stop to conceptual thinking, and the Buddha will appear before them, because this mind is the Buddha and the Buddha is all living beings. It is not any less for being manifested in ordinary beings, nor any greater for being manifested in Buddhas. This pure mind, which is the source of all things, shines forever with the radiance of its own perfection. But most people are not aware of it, and think that mind is just the faculty that sees, hears, feels and knows. Blinded by their own sight, hearing, feeling and knowing, they don’t perceive the radiance of the source. If they could eliminate all conceptual thinking, this source would appear, like the sun rising through the empty sky and illuminating the whole universe. Therefore, you students of the Way who seek to understand through seeing, hearing, feeling and knowing, when your perceptions are cut off, your way to mind will be cut off and you find nowhere to enter. <span lang="EN-SG">Just realize that although mind is manifested in these perceptions, </span><span lang="EN-SG">it is neither part of them nor separate from them. You should not try to analyze these perceptions, or think about them at all; but you shouldn’t seek the one mind apart from them.</span>Don’t hold on to them or leave them behind or dwell in them or reject them. Above, below, and around you, all things spontaneously exist, because there is nowhere outside the Buddha mind. Your true nature is not lost in moments of delusions, nor is it gained at the moment of enlightenment. It was never born and can never die. It shines through the whole universe, filling emptiness, one with emptiness. It is without time or space, and has no passions, actions, ignorance, or knowledge. In it there are no things, no people and no Buddhas; it contains not the smallest hair-breadth of anything that exists objectively; it depends on nothing and is attached to nothing. It is all-pervading, radiant beauty; absolute reality, self-existent and uncreated. How then can you doubt that the Buddha has no mouth to speak and nothing to teach, or that the truth is learned without learning, for who is there to learn? It is a jewel beyond all prices – Huang-Po</span></span></p></div>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">The vast, unnamable, fathomless void is 
              imperceptible, formless, intangible, and unmoving; it was never born and
               can never die. Though it is not separate from the myriad things, the 
              myriad things do not alter it; like a clear mirror, it adapts to all 
              things while fundamentally remaining unchanged by them. Similarly, your 
              own basic awareness is able to perfectly perceive all things, without 
              becoming entangled with them. The unnamable true nature or your own mind
               is, at once, undifferentiated and able to differentiate all things. 
              When the neighbor’s dog barks unexpectedly, your clear awareness 
              spontaneously comprehends it; when a spider walks along the back of your
               neck, your luminous mind registers it. Who hears the dog? Who feels the
               spider?</p>
