The key to Buddhist practice lies in one's disposition and inclination. Do not compare the superiority or inferiority of different Buddhist practices. Some like chanting 'Amitabha Sutra' while others prefer "Sutra of Medicine Buddha' or 'The Universal Door of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva'. The merit of reciting any sutra is the same.

Otherwise, we will take them for granted and they will go to waste. We tend to select one or two small problems in our life, emphasise them, and blow them out of proportion. Then we think: "I can't be happy. I can't practise the Dharma," and this thought itself prevents us from enjoying our life and making it meaningful. We, human beings, are very funny. When something bad happens in our lives we ask: "Why me? Why is this happening to me?" But when we wake up every morning and are alive and healthy and our family is well, we never ask; "Why me?

It's true, you have the buddha-nature. But without the help of a teacher, you'll never know it. Only one person in a million becomes enlightened without a teacher's help.<br><br>If, though, by the conjunction of conditions, someone understands what the Buddha meant, that person doesn't need a teacher. Such a person has a natural awareness superior to anything taught. But unless you're so blessed, study hard, and by means of instruction you'll understand.<br><br></div>
