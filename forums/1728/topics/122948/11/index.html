            <div class='col-md body'>I always tell people, especially intellectuals with knowlege of modern science , that they can refuse to believe everything if they want; but they should keep an inquisitive mind so that it would drive them to seek for answers. But they cannot refuse to believe in the law of cause and effect because this<span style="font-style: italic;"> is </span>the law of Science, no doubts about that.<br><br>The law of karma which Buddha has taught us is most profound and enlightening; not for fortune telling or forecasting misfortune. If one is to dwell on such to explain the law of karma, then one has gone to the wrong path of Fatalism. Sadly, most people start to doubt the law of cause and effect when faced with adversity in life, this is not just  being short-sighted but also ignorance.<br><br>~ Venerable Yan Pei<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The courageous is without fear. One who is able to distinguish right from wrong is wise. Slander cannot destroy a person unless one is without substance. When faced with slander, there is no need to defend oneself. The most common mistake of a manager is to criticize his/her subordinates without giving any training or instructions. A manager must learn how to coach others and not have the attitude that " I am the boss."

            <div class='col-md body'>Then any solution must address both, something that a socially-engaged Buddhism is well equipped to do. Buddhism begins as a personal path that works to transform our own greed, ill-will and delusion into generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom. But to overcome one's own dukkha is to become more aware of the dukkha maintained by unjust and unnecessary social arrangements. To overcome that institutionalized dukkha, we need to work collectively. So we need to avoid two extremes. One is a Buddhism that remains preoccupied only with one's own awakening and personal liberation. The other is a socially-preoccupied Buddhism that loses its roots in personal transformation, because it identifies too much with a "progressive" understanding of our lack as due mainly to social oppression. The challenge today is integrating these two concerns.<br><br>~ David R. Loy, <a href="http://www.bpf.org/tsangha/loycs.html" rel="nofollow">Loy-Civil Society</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enlightenment, True Nature, True Self, Wholeness, the Unconditioned Absolute - whatever words have been given to what is without words, unthinkable, unknowable, ungraspable - is not the effect of a cause. It is luminously present and timeless, overlooked by the roving intellect that is trying to grasp it, and obscured by the bodymind's constantly shifting moods, desires, and fears. Moment-to-moment meditation is clearly coming upon this roving and shifting, resisting and fearing mind and the urge to do something about it!... Meditation that is free and effortless, without goal, without expectation, is an expression of Pure Being that has nowhere to go, nothing to get.<br><br>There is no need for awareness to turn anywhere. It's here! Everything is here in awareness! When there is a waking up from fantasy, there is no one who dos it. Awareness and the sound of a plane are here with no one in the middle trying to "do" them or bring them together. They are here together! The only thing that keeps things (and people) apart is the "me"-circuit with its separative thinking. When that is quiet, divisions do not exist.<br><br>~ The Silent Question: Meditating in the Stillness of Not-Knowing by Toni Packer<br></div>
