This is a shallow idea in the minds of such people who lack real knowledge of living beings.<br><br>They should understand that this world will never become empty since very few wise people will be able to attain Nirvana. As far as world systems are concerned, there is no limit to them. And there is no such thing as either the begining or the end of world systems and the universe. World  systems will always appear and disappear. When one world system disappear, another is born. The dispersed world systems reappear due to the combination of molecules and energies. Living beings who have departed from other world systems also come into existence due to the recombination of these elements, energies and their mental formation with karmic energies. One should not think there are only a limited number of living beings who appear and disappear again and again in this universe. Living beings are numerically unlimited and infinte.<br><br>~ Ven.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Can We Live Without Craving?</strong><br><br>Many people are bothered by this question: if eradication of craving is essential to achieve final liberation, how can we live without craving?<br><br>It is true that certain necessities such as food, clothing, shelter, transport and medicine are indispensible for our living. At the same time, we need to have income to support our families to fulfil our duties. Attachment to one's husband or wife and children is natural. We should not regard such attachment as irreligious craving. The Buddha did say that craving for existence creates problems, but he did not say that we must torture ourselves and those around us whilst striving to give up craving.<br><br>In Buddhism, craving itself is not a 'sin' but it creates mental impurities or unskliful action arising from ignorance which delays our spiritual progress. In Buddhism, we develop spirituality in stages. At first we serve those we love in our own family circles. But we must learn to work for the benefit of all humanity. In this way we can refine our human nature to experience the divine nature. The Buddha only wanted to point out the danger of selfish desires. People develop these selfish desires for worldly gain which motivates non-virtuous deeds. Our striving for neccessities could be decent if we do not develop an undue craving which harms others. Buddhism as well as other religions point out the danger of selfishness.<br><br>Ven. Dr k Dhammananda, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Purpose Of Life</span></div>
