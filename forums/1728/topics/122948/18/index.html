            <div class='col-md body'>It really seems such a pity that the spiritual seeking and ordinary daily living are generally seen as contradictory to each other. Either one is not interested in anything spiritual because one considers oneself to be too young to waste time on such matters, or one shuns the beauties of this world in order to inherit the glories of the next. It seems such a shame that people do not realize that this world can itself be a heaven, a haven of peace and tranquility, if only it is seen with opened eyes and alert senses. Indeed, one does not have to leave this world to find divinity, either in thought or through bodily death.<br><br>~ Ramesh Balsekar</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The realisation of dependent arising is even more difficult than realising that things are impermanent. If we are really able to understand that our lives are changing every moment and our lifespan is being depleted, that every moment we coming closer to death, then our spiritual practice becomes very successful. It becomes very easy for us to follow a spiritual path. The realisation of impermanence is the start of the process.<br><br>~ Ven. Geshe Thubten Chonyi</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once, the car I was in almost met with an accident. The others who were in the car screamed and shouted when our car was nearly hit by the other driver. After a while they turned around and noticed I was not scared, but calm. " Master, why weren't you afraid?" I replied. "If we get hit, we get hit. If we don't, well see how fine we are now." I always tell people that while it is necessary to be cautious, it is unnecessary to worry and be afraid. It is destined that we will die one day on the very day we were born, so it is unnecessary to worry too much. If our time is not up, we won't die, so there's no need to worry.<br><br>~ Zen master Sheng Yan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Question: Many beginner meditators complain of physical (backaches, headaches, etc) or psychological problems ( disorientation, personality shifts, sense of loneliness, etc). What will your advice be to them?<br><br>Ven. Gunaratana: This means they have been practising the wrong type of meditation. If they get instructions from a really good reliable teacher and keep in touch with the teacher and express whatever change in experience they may face, then the teacher could be able to give them proper guidance to avoid those negative effects. For instance, headaches - it is not something unusual. Through discussions and interviews, the teacher should be able to help and support the meditator. Secondly, sometimes people experience fear so the teacher needs to find out the reason for such fear. Then, some people react in violent ways and so we have to find out the reason why. The teacher must be skilful to solve those problems. There are systems and methods to overcome those difficulties.<br><br>~<span style="font-style: italic;"> In Conversation with Ven.

            <div class='col-md body'>When you are confronted with trouble, do whatever you can to overcome it, but if it is insurmountable, then reflect on the fact that this trouble is due to your own actions in this , or a previous life.

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism concept of Karma is most positive. When faced with bad karma, do not despair or panic, we can inject good causes and conditons which will  give us greater solving ability to change or bear the karmic results we are going to meet. As long as we bravely face the unwholesome doings we have created, repent and determined not to repeat such mistakes, and at the same time to do good deeds relentlessly, this is solving all problems from the roots.<br><br>~ Ven.

            <div class='col-md body'>This is the way leading to discernment: when visiting a priest or contemplative, to ask: "what is skillful, venerable sir? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? What, have been done by me, will be for my long-term harm and suffering? Or what, having been done by me, will be for my long-term welfare and happiness?"<br><br>~ MN 135</div>
