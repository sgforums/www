            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism does not advocate that people should forsake their desires completely; it advises people to follow the middle path. We shouldn't allow our desires to become rampant, but we also have to live with the fact that we do have desires. Therefore, we have to use our wisdom to guide us so that we only follow positive desires and not the negative ones.<br><br>~ Ven. Fazhao</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha did not encourage householders to detach themselves from everything at once. Although He pointed out how attachments can create dissappointments. He knew that the life of those whose minds are still defiled, can become very miserable or dull without attachments. This does not mean the Buddha encouraged attachments. He was saying that while we allow ourselves to be attached at a lower stage of our spiritual development, we must discard them at the later stages.<br><br>~ Ven.

            <div class='col-md body'>Religious knowlegde is important to maintain a healthy mental attitude to face unfavourable worldly conditions. When changes and separation take place, we must adjust our way of life. It is meaningless to say Buddhism prohibits people from having craving and attachment. Emotional attachments to property, people or ideas carry no formal punishment tags. All that Buddhism does is to explain the repercussions that occur when one becomes a slave to craving and attachment. This is just like a parent advising a child not to play with fire.<br><br>~ Ven.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Slavery</strong><br><br>The Buddha saw that all beings were slaves of lust and greed, and that moved him to great pity. Living beings serve their lust and greed even at the risk of their lives. They go out in search of the things their lust or greed urges them, and risk their lives to get them. They have to work daily for all their lives to satisfy their lust and greed, and after death, and in the next existence, too, they remain slaves of the same master, craving (tanha). There is no period of rest for them.<br><br>In this world a slave may remain a slave only during his lifetime, but a slave of lust has an unending term of servitude till the time of salvation when he becomes an arahant and thus ends his wandering through samsara.<br><br>Â— Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta<br><br>By Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Listening to the Dhamma</strong><br><br>To attain realization of the Dhamma while listening to a sermon, one must have a settled mind, for it is only through concentrated attention with a settled mind that one can attain samadhi, (concentration), and only samadhi can still the mind for insight. If the mind wanders during the sermon over domestic, economic, and other secular affairs, samadhi will not be attained. If anxiety sets in, it is all for the worse. If distraction and anxiety crop up, the essence of the Dhamma will slip, and as samadhi is lacking, there will be no insight, and if one cannot attain insight for vipassana, how can one attain realization of the Dhamma? Concentrated attention while listening to a sermon is, therefore, an important factor.<br><br>The listener must listen carefully, with full mental involvement, and the words of the Dhamma must be adhered to in practice. If one attends to a sermon in this way, one's mind will be calm and absorbed in the sermon; one will be free from interference, and thus attain purity of mind.<br><br>Â— Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta<br><br>By Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The old man &amp; the scorpion</strong> - One morning after he finished his meditation, the old men opened his eyes and saw a scorpion floating helplessly in the river. As the scorpion was washed closer to the tree, the old man stretched himself out again on the root that branched out into the river and reached out to rescue the scorpion. As soon as he touched it, the scorpion stung him. Instinctively, the old man withdraw his hand. A minute later, he regained his balance, he stretched out again on the roots to save the scorpion. This time the scorpio stung him so badly with its poisonous sting that his hand become swollen and bloody and his face contorted in pain. At that moment, a passerby saw the old man stretched out on the roots struggling with the scorpion and shouted: " Hey stupid old man, what wrong with you? Only a fool would risk his life for the sake of an ugly evil creature. Don't you know you would kill yourself trying to save the ungrateful creatures?." The old man turned his head. Looking into the stranger's eyes he said calmly, " My friend, just because it is the scorpion's nature to sting, that does not change my nature to save it."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Letter to a Dying Man</strong><br><br>Bassui wrote the following letter to one of his disciples who was about to die:<br><br>"The essence of your mind is not born, so it will never die. It is not an existance, which is perishable. It is not an emptiness, which is a mere void. It has neither color nor form. It enjoys no pleasures and suffers no pains.<br><br>"I know you are very ill. Like a good Zen student, you are facing that sickness squarely. You may not know exactly who is suffering, but question yourself: What is the essence of this mind? Think only of this. You will need no more. Covet nothing. Your end which is endless is as a snowflake dissolving in the pure air."<br></div>
