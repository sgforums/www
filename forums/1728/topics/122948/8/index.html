            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Mind that is Learning</strong><br><br>What do we mean by learning? Is there learning when you are merely accumulating knowledge, gathering information? That is one kind of learning, is it not? As a student of engineering, you study mathematics, and so on; you are learning, informing yourself about the subject. You are accumulating knowledge in order to use that knowledge in practical ways. Your learning is accumulative, additive. Now, when the mind is merely taking on, adding, acquiring, is it learning? Or is learning something entirely different? I say the additive process that we now call learning is not learning at all. It is merely a cultivation of memory, which becomes mechanical; and a mind that functions mechanically, like a machine, is not capable of learning. A machine is never capable of learning, except in the additive sense. Learning is something quite different, as I shall try to show you. A mind that is learning never says, 'I know,' because knowledge is always partial, whereas learning is complete all the time. Learning does not mean starting with a certain amount of knowledge, and adding to it further knowledge. That is not learning at all; it is a purely mechanistic process. To me, learning is something entirely different. I am learning about myself from moment to moment, and the myself is extraordinarily vital; <strong>it is living, moving; it has no beginning and no end.</strong> When I say, 'I know myself,' learning has come to an end in accumulated knowledge. Learning is never cumulative; it is a movement of knowing which has no beginning and no end.<br><br>The Book of Life - September 20</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"It easily happens that a man, when taking a bath, steps upon a wet rope and imagines that it is a snake. Horror will overcome him, and he will shake from fear, anticipating in his thought all the agonies caused by the serpent's venomous bite. What a relief does this man experience when he sees that the rope is no snake! The cause of his fright lies in his error, his ignorance, his illusion. If the true nature of the rope is recognized, his tranquility of mind will come back to him; he will feel relieved; he will be joyful and happy. This is the state of mind of one who has recognized that there is no personal self, that the cause of all his troubles, cares, and vanities is a mirage, a shadow, a dream."<br><br>~ Buddha</div>

Constantly moving, it is always still;<br>always still yet constantly moving.<br>In meditation, although the body and mind are still, there is warmth and increased circulation. The body is still outside but inside it is very much alive. Inside the mind is fixed yet it's state expands in vast measure. Although the body moves throiugh the world, the mind is still. It is not confused by states and remains Thus, Thus unmoving "in the face of the 10,000 affairs."<br>Seeking stillness is to be like a corpse or log of wood. Trying to be moving continually is frenetic. Simply do not attach to movement or stillness. This is to be in harmony with the natural. Movement and stillness do not fight and oppose each other. The sea is like this.<br>"Going and returning without border" is the natural enduring cycle of change. The entire universe is in a continual state of flux, yet it neither increases nor decreases. The sea speaks this Dharma and tells us how to regain our true selves: Let go, release your hold; produce the mind that is nowhere attached."<br>"It is like the water in the ocean<br>Which has a unified nature,<br>And waves by the millions, each one diffferent,<br>Yet the water itself has no such difference;<br>And all Buddhadharmas are the same."<br>All living beings in the world are like the "waves by the millions, each one different."<br>Yet the nature of living beings has no difference.

There was never a fish that swam out of the water or a bird that flew out of the sky. When they need just a little water or sky, they use just a little; when they need a lot, they use a lot. Thus, they use all of it in every moment, and in every place they have perfect freedom.<br><br>Yet if there were a bird that first wanted to examine the size of the sky, or a fish that first wanted to examine the extent of the water, and then tried to fly or swim, it would never find its way. When we find where we are at this moment, then practice follows, and this is the realization of the truth. For the place, the way, is neither large nor small, neither self nor other.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Once you understand non-self, then the burden of life is gone. You'll be at peace with the world. When we see beyond self, we no longer cling to happiness and we can truly be happy. Learn to let go without struggle, simply let go, to be just as you are - no holding on, no attachment, free.<br><br>- Ajahn Chah</strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Clear mind is like the full moon in the sky. Sometimes clouds come and cover it, but the moon is always behind them. Clouds go away, then the moon shines brightly. So don't worry about clear mind: it is always there. When thinking comes, behind it is clear mind. When thinking goes, there is only clear mind. Thinking comes and goes, comes and goes, You must not be attached to the coming or the going.<br><br>Â— Zen Master Seung Sahn</strong><br><br><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i119/lamlamgurl1/buddha47.jpg"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The doe who saved her husband's life<br><br>Once upon a time there was a fine stag who ruled a herd of deers in a forest and it had a beautiful wife. The doe was very devoted to her husband and helped him in all matters of life.<br><br>One day, the stag was caught in the trap of a hunter and the doe was very frightened as was the stag. All the friends of the stag left him. But the doe remained steadfast next to him and waited for the hunter to come. She was very devoted to her husband. As soon as the hunter came, she fell on his knees and begged, "Sir! please make a nice bed of leaves for me and my husband and then kill me first and then my husband and you can have a nice feast."<br><br>The hunter was so amazed and surprised by her love, that he went to first free the stag before he prepared the bed of leaves, and in a split second, the stag and the doe ran away being free.<br><br>Moral: Great love can achieve anything.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>(The Jatakas form a part of Buddhist canonical literature.They are popularly believed to be pearls of wisdom from the mouth of the Buddha himself after his enlightenment.
