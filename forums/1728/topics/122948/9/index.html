            <div class='col-md body'>Choice implies consciousness - a high degree of consciousness. Without it, you have no choice. Choice begins the moment you disidentify from the mind and its conditioned patterns, the moment you become present....Nobody chooses dysfunction, conflict, pain. Nobody chooses insanity. They happen because there is not enough presence in you to dissolve the past, not enough light to dispel the darkness. You are not fully here. You have not quite woken up yet. In the meantime, the conditioned mind is running your life.<br><br>~ Eckhart Tolle, The Power of Now</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>"Dzogchen is the Natural Buddha Meditation, based on seeing things as they are. We call this "resting in the View". The View is like the vast sky without limits, corners, distortions or bias. It's clear, radiant and complete. It's simple, profound, peaceful and naturally at rest. This is the nature of the sky; it is also the nature of mind. These are all qualities of nirvana itself. When we are able to rest in the View, seeing things as they are, boundaries drop away; we see into luminous infinity. All we have to do is open to the truth about who we are.<br><br>Stay open-minded and inclusive. Pure presence is a state of non-judgemental, non-interfering choiceless awareness or panoramic attention to the "is-ness" and "now-ness" of all things. Be open to your experience.

Such preachers, by their clever manipulation of words and phrases and various reasoningÂ’s and incantations, being the mere prattle of a child, as far as one can make out and not at all in accordance with truth nor in unison with meaning, only serves to awaken sentient and emotion, while it stupefies the mind.

            <div class='col-md body'>In Japan we have the phrase, "Shoshin," which means "beginner's mind." Our "original mind" includes everything within itself. It is always rich and sufficient within itself. This does not mean a closed mind, but actually an empty mind and a ready mind. If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything. It is open to everything. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind there are few.<br><br>I have discovered that it is necessary, absolutely necessary, to believe in nothing. That is, we have to believe in something which has no form and no color - something which exists before all forms and colors appear. This is a very important point. No matter what god or doctrine you believe in, if you become attached to it, your belief will be based more or less on a self-centered idea .... In constantly seeking to actualize your ideal, you will have no time for composure. But if you are always prepared for accepting everything we see as something appearing from<br>nothing.... then at that moment you will have perfect composure.<br><br>When we inhale, the air comes into the inner world. When we exhale, the air goes out to the outer world. The inner world is limitless, and the outer world is also limitless.

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some meditation advises which I found useful, by Dharma Dan:<br><br><blockquote>If you can perceive one sensation per second, try for two. If you can perceive two unique sensations per second, try to perceive four. Keep increasing your perceptual threshold in this way until the illusion of continuity that binds you on the wheel of suffering shatters. In short, when doing insight practices, constantly work to perceive sensations arise and pass as quickly and accurately as you possibly can. With the spirit of a racecar driver who is constantly aware of how fast the car can go and still stay on the track, you are strongly advised to stay on the cutting edge of your ability to see the impermanence of sensations quickly and accurately.<br><br>------------<br><br>These meditation objects and postures are not that important, but understanding impermanence directly is.<br><br>--------------<br><br>I sometimes meditate when reclining before sleep, when reclining in the morning<br>before I have to get up, when I wake up in the middle of the night, before catnaps on the couch, during boring lectures and meetings, and in the lounge of the school I attend before afternoon classes. I have come to the conclusion that five minutes of really engaged, clear and focused practice in poor circumstances can often produce more benefits for me than an hour of poor, vague and distracted practice in Â“optimal conditions.Â”</blockquote><a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/Mastering%20Adobe%20Version.pdf" rel="nofollow">Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha, Adobe/.pdf version</a>, by Arhat, <a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/about.html" rel="nofollow">Dharma Dan</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Traditionally, books on meditation spend a lot of time discussing the possible hindrances to meditation. I will not. The hindrances are an important topic, but they can easily begin to seem more ominous than they really are. Hindrances are just anything of which we were not mindful and of which we did not investigate the truth. Now that we know to be mindful and investigate the Three Characteristics of all moment-to-moment experiences, there will only be hindrances when we forget to do this.<br><br>If we do not forget to do this, there will be no hindrances. No phenomena are inherently a hindrance unless we do not understand them. If we did not understand at least one of the Three Characteristics of each of the sensations that make up a phenomenon, <span style="font-style: italic;">no matter what it was</span>, it was a hindrance. Remember that the content of reality is not our concern in insight meditation, but the ultimate truth of the sensations that make up experiential reality is. So whatever seems to be in the way of your practice, remember that the experience of that moment is the practice and contains all the truth you could ever need! All phenomena are of the nature of ultimate truth. When we know deeply that these are all of the nature of ultimate truth, phenomena cease to be a fundamental problem.</blockquote><a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/Mastering%20Adobe%20Version.pdf" rel="nofollow">Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha, Adobe/.pdf version</a>, by Arhat, <a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/about.html" rel="nofollow">Dharma Dan</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>From a pure insight practice point of view, you canÂ’t ever fundamentally Â“let goÂ” of anything, so I sometimes wish the popularity of this misleading and indifference-producing admonition would decline, or at least be properly explained. However, if you simply investigate the truth of the Three Characteristics of the sensations that seemed to be a solid thing, you will come to the wondrous realization that reality is continually Â“letting goÂ” of itself! Thus, Â“let it goÂ” at its best actually means, Â“donÂ’t give a bunch of transient sensations an excessive sense of solidity.Â” It does not mean, Â“stop feeling or caring,Â” nor does it mean, Â“pretend that the noise in your mind is not there.Â”</blockquote><a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/Mastering%20Adobe%20Version.pdf" rel="nofollow">Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha, Adobe/.pdf version</a>, by Arhat, <a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/about.html" rel="nofollow">Dharma Dan</a></div>

It blew my mind, as he described exactly what I had gone through in the previous 13 days. I could clearly see how the stages he was describing had unfolded, exactly where I was and what I had to do. <strong>I was also astounded that the path could be so reproducible and straightforward, that I could just follow moronically simple instructions and have it all happen.</strong> Those who want to get lost in the reaction, Â“No, it isnÂ’t so simple. Awakening is a great and intractable mystery! You are lying! It mustnÂ’t be so!Â” should take a few moments to seriously question exactly how this disempowering and inaccurate view helps them feel good about themselves. They should then take a few moments to find another, more empowering view that helps them feel good about themselves, step up to the plate, and hit a home run...</span><br><br>~ Dharma Dan</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LPP: The idea of Buddhism is to clear up the citta so it drops back to purity. That's its natural state.<br>Q: So the citta is in its natural state when it's pure and the kilesas are eliminated?<br>LPP: Yes. That's really the case. Yes.<br>Q: So, I know that this might not be a question that has an answer, but when the citta is pure and the body dies, and I imagine then that the citta goes into Nibbana? Is that how that...?<br>LPP: That is Nibbana.<br>Q: That is Nibbana?<br>LPP: Yes. Really there's nothing it goes into.<br>Q: Ah ha<br>LPP: It isn't going into. That's the Safe. Just there.<br>Q: Yeah.<br>LPP: And that's what we should be, really. All of us. The thing that takes such a long time is the developing of the citta to accept that this world is not what we think it is. It always reverts to the world. It always jumps back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[...]<br><br>Emptiness of mind is not nothingness, nor a state of torpor, for it possesses by its very nature a luminous faculty of knowledge, which is called Awareness. These two aspects, emptiness and Awareness, cannot be separated. They are essentially one, like the surface of the mirror and the image, which is reflected in it.<br><br>Thoughts manifest themselves within emptiness and are reabsorbed into it like a face appears and disappears in a mirror; the face has never been in the mirror, and when it ceases to be reflected in it, it has not really ceased to exist. The mirror itself has never changed. So, before departing on the spiritual path, we remain in the so-called "impure" state of samsÃ¡ra, which is, in appearance, governed by ignorance. When we commit ourselves to that path, we cross a state where ignorance and wisdom are mixed. At the end, at the moment of Enlightenment, only pure wisdom exists. But all the way along this spiritual journey, although there is an appearance of transformation, the nature of the mind has never changed: it was not corrupted on entry onto the path, and it was not improved at the time of realization.<br><br>The infinite and inexpressible qualities of primordial wisdom "the true nirvana" are inherent in our mind. It is not necessary to create them, to fabricate something new. Spiritual realization only serves to reveal them through purification, which is the path. Finally, if one considers them from an ultimate point of view, these qualities are themselves only emptiness.<br><br>[...]<br><br>From:<br><strong>Buddha Nature</strong><br>Â—Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche<br><br>For the full essay:<br><a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/tibetan/buddha_nature__by_dilgo_khyentse.htm" rel="nofollow">click here</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The natural, real Buddha nature is always inherently complete and luminous; it was thus before our parents gave birth to us, it is thus right now, and it will always be thus forever.<br><br>Originally there is not a single thing. Since thereÂ’s not a single thing, what is to be called original? If you can see into this, you will save the most mental energy. When divergent thoughts arise, adamantly cut them off yourself. This is expediently called concentration and insight, but it is not reality; this mind itself is inherently concentrated and at once insightful.<br><br>Huang-po said, Â“This mind is always intrinsically round and bright, illuminating everywhere. People of the world donÂ’t know it, and just recognize perception and cognition as mind. Drop perception and cognition, and the road to mind comes to an end. If you want to know the mind, it is not apart from perception and cognition; and yet original mind is not limited to perception and cognition either.Â”<br><br>When you come to this, it is really essential for you to look into yourself; it is not a matter of verbal explanation. The more the talk, the further removed from the way. Those who are successful at introspection know for themselves when the time comes and do not need to ask anyone. All false imagination and emotional thoughts naturally disappear. This is the effect of learning the Way.<br><br>A thousand falsehoods do not compare to a single truth. If you are not thus, even if you consciously apply your mind, seeking effectiveness daily, it is all in the realm of impermanence, becoming and passing away.<br><br>Ta-tu (17th century)</div>
