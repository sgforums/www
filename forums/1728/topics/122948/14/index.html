            <div class='col-md body'>One, who eats too much, easily becomes sick. One, who talks too  much, easily gets into trouble. Sometimes misunderstandings arise because the listener is sensitive while the speaker is careless. Both parties develope resentment and hatred, which gives rise to endless retaliation in the future. This is why ancient sages advised us to "Talk less and chant the Buddha's name more". The less we speak, the better it is for the less trouble we will be in. Ideally, we would only speak when it was necessary.<br><br>~ Ven. Chin Kung</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ikkyu, the Zen master, was very clever even as a boy.<br><br>His teacher had a precious teacup, a rare antique. Ikkyu happened to break this cup and was greatly perplexed. Hearing the footsteps of his teacher, he held the pieces of the cup behind him. When the master appeared, Ikkyu asked, "Why do people die?"<br><br>"This is natural," explained the older man. "Everything has to die and has just so long to live."<br><br>Ikkyu, producing the shattered cup, added: "It was time for your cup to die."<br><br>~ Zen Teacher Muju, <span style="font-style: italic;">Shaseki - shu</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man travelling across a field encountered a tiger. He fled, the tiger after him. Coming to a precipice, he caught hold of the root of a wild vine and swing himself down the edge. The tiger sniffed at him from above. Trembling, the man looked down to where, far below, another tiger was waiting to eat him. Only the vine sustained him.<br><br>Two mice, one white and one black, little by little started to gnaw away the vine. The man saw a luscious strawberry near him. Grasping the vine with one hand, he plucked the strawberry with the other. How sweet it tasted!<br><br>~ A parable in sutra.</div>
