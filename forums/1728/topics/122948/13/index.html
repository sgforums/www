            <div class='col-md body'>The Dharma is closely connected to our mind. When we are bad-tempered, critical and belligerent, the Dharma shows us that we ourselves hold the key to our emotional well-being. A contented person is happy and energetic.

Only with this attitude in life will we be happy.<br><br>~ Venerable Shi Fazhao</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a retreat in Spain, a woman in her 20's sitting in the front row slowly and silently began to cry with long teardrops rolling down her face.<br><br>1. TEARS OF A YOGI<br><br>I sat opposite her when her tears joined the cheeks<br>like long, slow raindrops on a summer's night.<br>looking intently across, I witnessed<br>her innocence as she gently brought<br>her knees to her chin<br>to comfort a forlorn heart<br><br>No sound emerged in the intimacy of those tears<br>she confided only in the quiet evening air<br>I could feel the pounding of her heart<br>with the swell of her being filling a single moment.<br><br>Her breast heaved with a quiet power<br>to break the dams of restraints and hardened walls<br>letting the tears again create downward rivulets.<br><br>I said nothing.<br>I had nothing to offer.<br>Except presence.<br>She said later that was more than enough.<br>---------------<br>If we took to heart the words of this reflection,<br>we would abide in a wondrous realm!<br><br>2. A DAILY REFLECTION<br><br>I vow to remember that today is a new day<br>Full of new beginnings and fresh moments<br>Today, I will not cling to events of yesterday nor yesteryear<br>But stay connected with what today brings.<br>I will not madly pursue my desires at the expense of others<br>Nor flee from challenging tasks.<br>I will remain true to the unfolding process of today<br>Without losing myself in thoughts of what was or what might be.<br>I will treat today with awareness and sensitivity<br>Even in the most ordinary of tasks.<br>I will apply myself wholeheartedly to the fullness of today<br>For I know that today holds the resource for authenticity.<br>-----------------------<br>The heart of the Buddha's teaching is very simple. It is liberation through non-clinging. We are often hardly aware of how much we cling to in daily life.<br>3. CLINGING<br><br>The mind clings to what it knows,<br>and it clings to what it doesn't know<br>oh, the mind,<br>feckless and reckless<br>unobservant of its own features<br>knowing not itself, nor otherwise,<br>clinging to its image, made of itself<br>clinging to its own pretentiousness<br>clinging to the extensions of a cloud filled day<br>clinging to trappings of associations<br><br>In the intolerance of unfulfilled dreams.<br>promises that torment the imagination<br>with a shattered life<br>splintered like broken glass<br>into countless reflections of clinging<br>distorting the sense of wholeness<br><br>Clinging to the thoughts,<br>improvement and prosperity<br>clinging to worse or better, wrong or right<br>sweet or bitter, yesterday or tomorrow<br>presence and absence, opened or unopened<br>unhelpful or helpful<br>and the fickle edges of inner movement<br><br>It is a strange thing that our potentially noble species<br>leaves unexamined the harassment of clinging<br>and the opportunity to live a gracious existence.<br><br>~ More Poems by Christopher Titmuss at <a href="http://www.insightmeditation.org/poems.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.insightmeditation.org/poems.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I was building the monastry in Australia, I built a brick wall. I made sure that every single brick was perfectly laid. When the wall was finished. I stood back and noticed that two bricks were inclined at an angle. I was so embarrassed that when I showed visitors around our monastry, I'd avoid taking them past that wall. Then one day, a visitor noticed the wall and said," That's a nice wall." He took me by surprise. Couldn't he see the two bad bricks that spoilt the whole wall? But then he said, " Yes, I can see the 2 bad bricks. But I can also see the 998 good bricks as well."<br><br>~ Ajahn Brahm</div>
