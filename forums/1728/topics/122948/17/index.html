            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Do Objects Exist?</strong><br><br>Since, as we have established, when any phenomenon is sought through analysis, it cannot be found, you may be wondering whether these phenomena exist at all. However, we know from direct experience that people and things cause pleasure and pain, and that they can help and harm. Therefore phenomena certainly do exist; the question is <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span>. They do not exist in their own right, but only have an existence dependent upon many factors, including a consciousness that conceptualizes them.<br><br>Once they exist but do not exist on their own, they neccessarily exist in dependence upon conceptualization. However, when phenomena appear to us, they do not appear as if they exist this way. Rather they seem to be established in their own right, from the object's side, without depending upon a conceptualizing consciousness.<br><br>When training to develop wisdom, you are seeking through analysis to find the inherent existence of whatever object you are considering - yourself, another person,your body, your mind, or anything else. You are analysing not the mere appearance but the inherent nature of the object. Thus it is not that you come to understand that the object does not exist; rather you find that its inherent existence is unfounded. Analysis does not contradict the mere existence of the object. Phenomena do indeed exist, but not in the way we think they do.<br><br>What is left after analysis is a dependently existent phenomenon. When, for example, you examine your own body, its inherent existence is negated, but what is left is a body dependent on four limbs, a trunk, and a head.<br><br>~ Dalai Lama, <span style="font-style: italic;">How to Practise </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> If Phenomena Are Empty, Can They Funtion?</strong><br><br>Whenever we think about objects, do we mistakenly believe that they exist in their own right? No. We can conceive of phenomena in three different ways. Let us consider a tree; there is no denying that it appears to inherently exist, but:<br><br>1. We could conceive of the tree as existing inherently, in its own right.<br>2. We could conceive of the three as lacking inherent existence.<br>3. We could conceive of the tree without thinking that it inherently exist or   not.<br><br>Only the first of those is wrong.The other two modes of apprehension are right, even if the mode of appearance is mistaken in the second and the third, in that the tree appears as if inherently existent.<br><br>If objects do not inherently exist, does this mean that they cannot function? Jumping to the conclusion that because the true nature of objects is emptiness, they are therefore incapable of performing functions such as causing pain or pleasure, or helping or harming, is the worst sort of misunderstanding, a nihilistic view.  As the Indian scholar-yogi Nagarjuna says in his<span style="font-style: italic;"> Precious Garland</span>, a nihilist will certainly have a bad transmigration upon rebirth, whereas a person who believes, albeit wrongly, in inherent existence goes on to a good transmigration.<br><br>Allow me to explain. You need a belief in the consequences of actions to choose virtue in your life and discard nonvirtue. For the time being, the subtle view of the emptiness of inherent existence might be too difficult for you to understand without falling into the trap of nihilism, where you are unable to understand that phenomena arise in dependence of causes and conditions ( dependent-arising). For the sake of your spiritual progress it would be better for now to set aside trying to penetrate emptiness. Even if you mistakenly believe the phenomena inherently exist, you can still develope an understanding of dependent-arising and apply it in pracrice. This is why even Buddha, on occasion, taught that living beings and other phenomena inherently exist. Such teachings are the thought of Buddha's<span style="font-style: italic;"> scriptures</span>, but they are not <span style="font-style: italic;">his </span>own final thought. For specific purposes, he sometimes spoke in nonfinal ways.<br><br>~ Dalai Lama,<span style="font-style: italic;"> How to Practise</span></div>

We should realize openness as the playground of our emotions and relate to people without artificiality, manipulation or strategy. We should experience everything totally, never withdrawing into ourselves as a marmot hides in its hole. This practice releases tremendous energy which is usually constricted by the process of maintaining fixed reference points. Referentiality is the process by which we retreat from the direct experience of everyday life.<br><br>Being present in the moment may initially trigger fear. But by welcoming the sensation of fear with complete openness, we cut through the barriers created by habitual emotional patterns.<br><br>When we engage in the practice of discovering space, we should develop the feeling of opening ourselves out completely to the entire universe. We should open ourselves with absolute simplicity and nakedness of mind. This is the powerful and ordinary practice of dropping the mask of self-protection.<br><br>We shouldn't make a division in our meditation between perception and field of perception. We shouldn't become like a cat watching a mouse. We should realize that the purpose of meditation is not to go "deeply into ourselves" or withdraw from the world. Practice should be free and non-conceptual, unconstrained by introspection and concentration.<br><br>Vast un-originated self-luminous wisdom space is the ground of being - the beginning and the end of confusion. The presence of awareness in the primordial state has no bias toward enlightenment or non-enlightenment. This ground of being which is known as pure original mind is the source from which all phenomena arise. It is known as the great mother, as the womb of potentiality in which all things arise and dissolve in natural self-perfectedness and absolute spontaneity.<br><br>All aspects of phenomena are completely clear and lucid. The whole universe is open and unobstructed - everything is mutually interpenetrating.<br><br>Seeing all things as naked, clear and free from obscurations, there is nothing to attain or realize. The nature of phenomena appears naturally and is naturally present in time-transcending awareness. Everything is naturally perfect just as it is. All phenomena appear in their uniqueness as part of the continually changing pattern. These patterns are vibrant with meaning and significance at every moment; yet there is not significance to attach to such meanings beyond the moment in which they present themselves.<br><br>This is the dance of the five elements in which matter is a symbol of energy and energy a symbol of emptiness. We are a symbol of our own enlightenment. With no effort or practice whatsoever, liberation or enlightenment is already here.<br><br>The everyday practice of dzogchen is just everyday life itself. Since the undeveloped state does not exist, there is no need to behave in any special way or attempt to attain anything above and beyond what you actually are. There should be no feeling of striving to reach some "amazing goal" or "advanced state". To strive for such a state is a neurosis which only conditions us and serves to obstruct the free flow of Mind. We should also avoid thinking of ourselves as worthless personsÂ—we are naturally free and unconditioned. We are intrinsically enlightened and lack nothing.<br><br>When engaging in meditation practice, we should feel it to be as natural as eating, breathing and defecating. It should not become a specialized or formal event, bloated with seriousness and solemnity. We should realize that meditation transcends effort, practice, aims, goals and the duality of liberation and non-liberation. Meditation is always ideal; there is no need to correct anything. Since everything that arises is simply the play of mind as such, there is no unsatisfactory meditation and no need to judge thoughts as good or bad.<br><br>Therefore we should simply sit. Simply stay in your own place, in your own condition just as it is. Forgetting self conscious feelings, we do not have to think "I am meditating". Our practice should be without effort, without strain, without attempts to control or force and without trying to become "peaceful". If we find that we are disturbing ourselves in any of these ways, we stop meditating and simply rest or relax for a while. Then we resume our meditation. If we have "interesting experiences" either during or after meditation, we should avoid making anything special of them. To spend time thinking about experiences is simply a distraction and an attempt to become unnatural. These experiences are simply signs of practice and should be regarded as transient events. We should not attempt to re-experience them because to do so only serves to distort the natural spontaneity of mind.<br><br>All phenomena are completely new and fresh, absolutely unique and entirely free from all concepts of past, present future. They are experienced in timelessness. The continual stream of new discovery, revelation and inspiration which arises at every moment is the manifestation of our clarity. We should learn to see everyday as mandalaÂ—the luminous fringes of experience which radiate spontaneously from the empty nature of our being. The aspects of our mandala are the day-to-day objects of our life experience moving in the dance or play of the universe. By this symbolism the inner teacher reveals the profound and ultimate significance of being. Therefore we should be natural and spontaneous, accepting and learning from everything. This enables us to see the ironic and amusing side of events that usually irritate us.<br><br>In meditation we can see through the illusion of past, present and futureÂ—our experience becomes the continuity of now-ness. The past is only an unreliable memory held in the present. The future is only a projection of our present conceptions. The present itself vanishes as we try to grasp it. So why bother with attempting to establish an illusion of solid ground?<br><br>We should free ourselves from our past memories and preconceptions of meditation. Each moment of meditation is completely unique and full of potentiality. In such moments, we will be incapable of judging our meditation in terms of past experience, dry theory or hollow rhetoric.<br><br>Simply plunging directly into meditation in the moment now, with our whole being, free from hesitation, boredom or excitement, is enlightenment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then Subhuti addressed the Buddha, saying: "World Honored One, what should we call this scripture, and how should we practice it?"<br><br>The Buddha said to Subhuti: "This scripture is called the Diamond of Transcendent Wisdom. You should practice it according to this name. And why? That which the Buddha calls 'transcendent wisdom' is not transcendent wisdom. Subhuti, what does this mean? Does the tathagata have a teaching to explain?"<br><br>Subhuti said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, the Tathagata has no teaching to explain."<br><br>"Subhuti, what do you think? Are not the tiniest particles contained in the worlds of three thousand galaxies great in number?"<br><br>Subhuti said, "Extremely great in number, World Honored One."<br><br>"Subhuti, the Tathagata teaches that tiny particles are not tiny particles. Therefore they are called tiny particles. The Tathagata teaches that worlds are not worlds. Therefore they are called worlds."<br><br>"Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Tathagata be discerned by means of his thirty-two bodily characteristics? "<br><br>"No, he cannot, World Honored One. One cannot discern a Tathagata by means of his thirty-two bodily characteristics. And why not? Because the thirty-two bodily characteristics that are taught by the Tathagata are in fact not characteristics. Therefore they are called the thirty-two characteristics. "<br><br>"Subhuti, if a good son or good daughter dedicates lifetimes as numerous as the sands in the Ganges river to charitable acts, and there were another person who memorized as much as a four-line verse of this scripture and taught it to others, the merit of the latter person would be by far greater."<br><br>~ Diamond Sutra, Chapter 13, "Naming of the Sutra"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to the perspective of Mahayana Buddhism, the Bodhisattva vow starts with ordinary people - people like us. When these people make such a vow, they are called a Bodhisattva with the initial aspiration to attain Buddhahood. Now, when they are reborn, some of them forget the vows made in their past lives, but the karmic force is so strong that they will continue to help others, and even suffer on behalf of all sentient beings in this life - such as sacrificing themselves in calamities.<br><br>~Zen Master Sheng Yan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When we talk about health, we refer to the body, environment and the mind. If our mind is healthy and not in a worrisome state, even if the body is ill or the environment is dirty and unhygienic, we can still be considered healthy. Chinese have a saying, "tong ku" or Pain and Suffering. Actually, pain does not necessarily bring about feelings of suffering and bitterness. For instance, a person can be very, very ill but mentally healthy. That is, he is still balanced and will not allow the disease to influence the quality of his life. But if a person is mentally -unbalanced and unhappy, even with a healthy body, one's mind will create problems for onself and create problems for others around one.<br><br>~ Zen master Sheng Yan<br></div>

There are many psyhiatrists and psychologists who use meditaton for such purposes - as a method of relieving anxieties and tensions. Today, the word "meditation" has been misuesd and abused. It is now been misunderstood. There was one occasion when someone wanted to practice vipassana ( insight meditation) but do not wish to have anything to do with mindfulness!

Gunaratana : Sure, in fact some have requested only for vipassana and to exclude the Dhamma. Here, there is some misunderstanding of what vipassana is. You cannot study vipassana without dealing with the core teachings of the Buddha. Therefore, we don't use labels and words. We just explain the truth and soon they will realise the interconnectedness of all aspects of meditation. To those who are really fanatic and rigid - they will eventually drop out. But if they want to persist, then we teach simple type of meditation and tell them that their meditation will not be successful and meaningful. You cannot divorce meditation from the Dhamma and there are many serious meditators who know this.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In conversation with Ven.
