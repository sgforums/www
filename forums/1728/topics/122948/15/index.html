            <div class='col-md body'>" 'This Dhamma is for one who is modest, not for one who is self-aggrandizing.' Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk, being modest, doesn't want it to be known that 'He is modest." Being content, he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is content.' Being reclusive, he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is reclusive.' His persistence being aroused, he doesn't want it to be known that 'His perssistence is aroused.' His mindfulness being established, he doesn't want it to be known that "His mindfulness is established.' His mind being centered, he doesn't want it to be known that 'His mind is centered.' Being endowed with discernment, he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is endowed with discernment.' Enjoying non-complication, he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is enjoying non-complication.'

            <div class='col-md body'>When you run after your thoughts you are like a dog chasing a stick; every time a stick is thrown, you run after it. But if, instead, you look at where your thoughts are coming from, you will see that each thought arises and dissolves within the space of that awareness, without engendering other thoughts. Be like a lion, who, rather than chasing after the stick, turns to face the thrower. You only throw a stick at a lion once.<br><br>~ Milarepa, quoted by the late Dilgo Khyentse in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Like a Mirror, Like a </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Rainbow, Like the Heart of the Sun</span></div>
