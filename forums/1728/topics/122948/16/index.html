            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Awareness</strong><br><br>Awareness cannot be taught, and when it is present it has no context. All contexts are created by thought and are therefore corruptible by thought. Awareness simply throws light on what is, without any separation whatsoever.<br><br>Awareness, insight, enlightenment, wholeness - whatever words one may pick to label what cannot be caught in words - is not the effect of a cause. Activity does not destroy it and sitting does not create it. It isn't a product of anything - no technique, method, environment, tradition, posture, activity, or nonactivity can create it. It is there, uncreated, freely functioning in wisdom and love, when self-centered conditioning is clearly revealed in all its grossness and subtleness and defused in the light of understanding.<br><br>Can the inner noise be entirely left alone while attending? When the changing states of body-mind are simply left to themselves without any choice or judgment - left unreacted to by a controlling or repressive will - a new quietness emerges by itself.<br><br>Sitting motionlessly quiet, for minutes or hours, regardless of length of time, is being in touch with the movements of the body-mind, gross and subtle, dull and clear, shallow and deep, without any opposition, resistance, grasping, or escape. It is being in intimate touch with the whole network of thoughts, sensations, feelings, and emotions without judging them good or bad, right or wrong Â– without wanting anything to continue or stop. It is an inward seeing without knowing, an open sensitivity to what is going on inside and out Â– flowing without grasping or accumulation. Stillness in the midst of motion and commotion is free of will, direction, and time. It is a complete letting be of what is from moment to moment.<br><br>Sitting quietly, doing nothing, not knowing what is next and not concerned with what was or what may be next, a new mind is operating that is not connected with the conditioned past and yet perceives and understands the whole mechanism of conditioning. It is the unmasking of the self that is nothing but masks Â– images, memories of past experiences, fears, hopes, and the ceaseless demand to be something or become somebody. This new mind that is no-mind is free of duality Â– there is no doer in it and nothing to be done.<br><br>~ Toni Packer</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This story is about Emperor Alexandra the Great who was travelling towards India on his Favorite horse Busiphalus. His triumphant march was such a splendid and glorious pageant that everyone rushed to catch a glimpse of it. But by the side of the road along which the entourage marched, a person clad in yellow slept unperturbed by it. The emperor's attention was turned to this one man who was not at all worried about his march. The emperor rode to him. When he came near, that person calmly got up and sat down crossed-legged.<br><br>The emperor asked, "Do you know who am I?"<br>The robed persson replied, "No, I don't know you."<br>"I am Emperor Alexander the Great," said the emperor.<br>The robed person said, "All right, what about it?"<br>"I possess all the land from Macedonia to India." said the emperor.<br>"So?" the robed person replied.<br>"I am the lord of nine great rivers in the land from Macedonia to India, and all the fields, orchards and houses on this vast area of land belong to me."<br>The robed person said, "Emperor, may I ask a question or two?"<br>The emperor replied, "Yes. Go on."<br>"Emperor, do you get hungry sometimes?" the robed person asked gently.<br>The emperor answered, "Yes."<br>"When you are hungry, do you eat all the produce of the flieds, orchards, and lands you own?" he questioned.<br>"No, I eat only a little food." the emperor replied.<br>"Emperor, do you feel thirsty sometimes?" the robed person continued.<br>"Certainly." the emperor replied.<br>"Do you drink the water in all the rivers you own when you are thirsty?" the robed person prodded.<br>"No, I only drink a little to quench my thirst."<br>"Do you feel sleepy at times?"<br>The emperor answered, "Yes, of course."<br>"when you are sleepy, do you sleep on all the lands from Macedonia to India?" the robed person queried.<br>The emperor replied, "No, of course not."<br>"Emperor, then what on earth is the meaning of all the material gains you have acquired?" the robed one finally asked.<br><br>The robed person who taught Emperor Alexander the Great about the difference between  material wealth and spiritual wealth was a Venerable Buddhist monk. What lasts is spiritual wealth.<br><br>The last days of the mighty Emperor Alexander the Great was brought on by a tiny mosquito.

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism emphasizes cultivation or correcting our thoughts and behaviour. It is to correct everything that arises from our body, mouth and mind, the three karmas of erroneous behavior, speech and thoughts. To correct the three karmas, we start from the mind as the Zen school teaches, " cultivation should start from the root". What is the root? The mind. If our mind is proper then our thought, speech and behavior will likewise be proper.<br><br>~Ven. master Chin Kung, <span style="font-style: italic;">Buddhism: The Wisdom of Compassion and </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Awakening</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"SubhÃ»ti, when a bodhisattva wants to confer benefit on all sentient beings, she should practice charity like this. I teach that all notions are not notions. I also teach that all sentient beings are not sentient beings.<br><br>SubhÃ»ti, my words are true Â— they are authentic, and they explain things they way they are. My words are not deceptions, and they are not erroneous.<br><br>SubhÃ»ti, the dharma that I have attained, as a teaching, has neither truth nor falsity. SubhÃ»ti, if a bodhisattva practices charity while abiding in [notions of] the teaching, it is like a person in the dark who cannot see anything. If a bodhisattva practices charity while not abiding in [notions of] the teaching, it is like a person with eyes wide open in the sunlight, seeing all kinds of forms.<br><br>SubhÃ»ti, if, in a future time there are good sons and good daughters who are able to memorize this scripture and recite it, then I will, with my buddha-wisdom, be fully aware of these people, seeing each one of them, as each one attains countless, limitless merit."<br><br>~ Diamond Sutra</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There were five monks on the road heading to somewhere. They decided to take a rest inside a temple when a heavy storm came. The temple had a few statues of deities and ghosts placed by the village officials for praying.<br><br>Four monks said, " It's so terribly cold tonight , let's set a fire and cook some food by burning  the wooden statues."<br><br>The last monk said, "These statues are for praying, we cannot touch them!"<br>He insisted his stance strongly.<br><br>Inside the temple were some man-eating ghosts and they started to discuss among themselves in the middle of the night, "Let's eat this guy.

            <div class='col-md body'>"However, Subhuti, if you think that the Buddha realizes the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind and does not need to have all the marks, you are mistaken. Subhuti, do not think in that way. Do not think that when one gives rise to the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind, one needs to see all objects of mind as nonexistent, cut off from life. Please do not think in that way. One who gives rise to the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind does not contend that all objects of mind are nonexistent and cut off from life.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ALL EXISTENCE IS SPIRITUAL</strong><br><br>THERE was an officer among the retinue of Simha who had heard of the discourses of the Blessed One, and there was some doubt left in his heart. This man came to the Blessed One and said: "It is said, O Lord, that the samana Gotama denies the existence of the soul. Do they who say so speak the truth, or do they bear false witness against the Blessed One<br><br>And the Blessed One said: "There is a way in which those who say so are speaking truly of me; on the other hand, there is a way in which those who say so do not speak truly of me. The Tathagata teaches that there is no self. He who says that the soul is his self and that the self is the thinker of our thoughts and the actor of our deeds, teaches a wrong doctrine which leads to confusion and darkness. On the other hand, the Tathagata teaches that there is mind. He who understands by soul mind, and says that mind exists, teaches the truth which leads to clearness and enlightenment."<br><br>The officer said: "Does, then, the Tathagata maintain that two things exist? that which we perceive with our senses and that which is mental?"<br><br>Said the Blessed One: "I say to thee, thy mind is spiritual, but neither is the sense-perceived void of spirituality. The bodhi is eternal and it dominates all existence as the good law guiding all beings in their search for truth. It changes brute nature into mind, and there is no being that cannot be transformed into a vessel of truth."</div>
