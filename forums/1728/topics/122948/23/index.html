            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha has never forced others to do what others do not like to do. He merely taught virtue and evil, and the choice in one's own life is in one's hands. To find one's peace of mind, one should see that all phenomena are impermanent. Only through that it is possible to be detached in adverse circumtances and to have freedom from vexations. The Buddha's teachings allow us to know that there is no one in the world who can bring you suffering, only yourself. These are indeed words of wisdom and food for thought.<br><br>~ Ven. Fazhao</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since we benefit from the education we receive from the Buddha, what can we do to repay his kindness?<br><br>Nowadays, most people enshrine and worship him, making daily offerings to his image on an altar. Is this the right way to repay him? No. These are only rituals to remind us not to forget the Buddha's kindness. The Buddha's wish is for all sentient beings to hear the truth, practice accordingly and receive the benefits to attain Buddhahood. The only way we can repay him is to take his heart as our own. Only in this way can we repay our respected teacher.<br><br>Therefore, we can request the turning of the Dharma-wheel, in other words, we invite knowledgeable masters to teach us about the sutras. This is also the greatest good deed and virtue. Why? Because it brings the teachings to the world.<br><br>But if no one invites Dharma masters to lecture, they will not have the opportunity to do so. So, people who invite them to give Dharma talks will obtain great merits.<br><br>~ Ven Master Chin Kung, <span style="font-style: italic;">Buddhism: The Wisdom of Compassion and Awakening</span></div>

How much patience did I have to have sitting up in my cave listening to the wholves howl? The point goes home. Ultimately the Buddhadharma is about transforming the mind, which in Buddhist parlance includes the heart.

The Buddha does not need to lie to us.<br><br>It is not a good reason to say they do not exist simply because we cannot see them or have not seen them.

They foolishly concern themselves with erecting statues and stupas, telling people to pile up lumber and bricks, to paint this blue and that green. They strain body and mind, injure themselves and mislead others. And they donÂ’t know enough to be ashamed. How will they ever become enlightened?<br><br>They see something tangible and instantly become attached. If you talk to them about formlessness, they sit there dumb and confused. Greedy for the small mercies of this world, they remain blind to the great suffering to come. Such disciples wear themselves out in vain. Turning from the true to the false, they talk about nothing but future blessings.<br><br>If you can simply concentrate your mindÂ’s Inner Light and behold its outer illumination, youÂ’ll dispel the three poisons and drive away the six thieves once and for all. And without effort gain possession of an infinite number of virtues, perfections, and doors to the truth, Seeing through the mundane and witnessing the sublime is less than an eye-blink away, Realization is now. Why worry about gray hair? But the true door is hidden and canÂ’t be revealed. I have only touched upon beholding the mind.<br><br>~ 1st Chan/Zen Patriarch Bodhidharma</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Chan school, there is a saying: "To perceive one's true nature is to perceive the Buddha-nature". This saying means if one is able to perceive Empitness based on the perception of conditioned arising, we will understand that whatever phenomenon, as long as it follows the workings of conditioned arising, is transient and will naturally perish. Thus, the self is nothing but the temporary existence of a combination of various causes and conditions. And since it is impermanent, there's no need to worry. Once we can understand this, we will be undisturbed by whatever happens to us and achieve liberation.<br><br>~ Zen master Shen Yan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just contemplate: when you get angry you have to think, don't you? If you stop thinking, the anger will go away. To be angry you have to think: 'He said that to me, how dare he. That dirty so-and-so!' But if you should stop thinking and use the breath [breathing in and out], eventually that feeling of the body that comes with anger will fade out and the there is no anger. So if you feel angry, just reflect on what it feels like as a physical feeling. It's the same with any mood: contemplate, reflect on the mood that you're in. Work with it - not to analyse it or criticise it, but merely to reflect on how it is.<br><br>~ Ajahn Sumedho, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Way It Is</span></div>
