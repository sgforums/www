              <p>I just deleted the thread about Buddhism as the best religion.</p>
              <p>If you are wondering why, Aik TC informed me that it is a hoax. General Zhaoyun said:</p>
              <p><em>When you revere Buddhism to the extent of attachment, you tend to glorify it to the point of creating hoax.<br><br> Buddha has taught us not to be attached even to Buddhism or the Buddha 
                  itself or even be attached towards enlightenment. Yet, the truth is that
                   attachment is as equal as to a false image in front of us, attachment 
                  is like a wall blinding us from the real truth and blinds us from seeing
                   the truth of phenomenon.</em> <em><br><br> Just take this incidence as a case study for understanding Buddha's teaching.</em> <em><br><br> Buddhism teaches us not to see things from what it perceive to be, but 
                  from whether it contributes to a well-being or wholesome doing of the 
                  world.</em> <em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>Even if such an award exist and 
                  such award was given to the Buddhism world, it's correct that all 
                  buddhist will not want it, as it's against Buddha's teaching.</em></p>
              <p>This reminds me of a dream I had another day back. (Lately I had a lot 
                  of meaningful, auspicious and very accurate prophetic dreams nowadays, 
                  maybe the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas gave me their blessings - which 
                  happened before I know - so I am grateful to them)<br> <br> In the dream, I was driving past and saw a religious banner. The 
                  religious banner is about charity, about goodness.... it was nothing 
                  pretentious, nothing about promoting their own religion in any way, and 
                  nothing about using fear tactics to convert people!<br> <br> I realized that true religions doesn't advertise itself with anything 
                  pretentious.... but naturally demonstrates itself as sincere, genuine, 
                  and of great qualities... of great compassion, generosity, kindness. 
                  That is when you truly shine of your own accord and not through 
                  pretentious advertisement.<br> <br> When I woke up, I was reminded of what the Buddha said:<br> <br> <br> "There are these ten topics of [proper] conversation. Which ten? Talk on
                   modesty, on contentment, on seclusion, on non-entanglement, on arousing
                   persistence, on virtue, on concentration, on discernment, on release, 
                  and on the knowledge &amp; vision of release. These are the ten topics 
                  of conversation. If you were to engage repeatedly in these ten topics of
                   conversation, you would outshine even the sun &amp; moon, so mighty, so
                   powerful -- to say nothing of the wanderers of other sects."<br> <br> -- AN X.69<br> <br> <br> The Dalai Lama also said the same thing.<br> <br> <br> <br> Narated by Leonardo Boff:<br> <br> In a round table discussion about religion and freedom in which Dalai 
                  Lama and myself were participating at recess I maliciously, and also 
                  with interest,<br> asked him:<br> <br> “Your holiness, what is the best religion?”<br> I thought he would say: “The Tibetan Buddhism” or “The oriental religions, much older than Chritianity”<br> Dalai Lama paused, smiled and looked me in the eyes ….<br> <br> which surprised me because I knew of the malice contained in my question.<br> He answered:<br> “The best religion is the one that gets you closest to God.<br> It is the one that makes you a better person.”<br> <br> <br> To get out of my embarassment with such a wise answer, I asked:<br> <br> “What is it that makes me better?”<br> <br> <br> He responded:<br> “Whatever makes you<br> more compassionate,<br> more sensible,<br> more detached,<br> more loving,<br> more humanitarian,<br> more responsible,<br> more ethical.”<br> <br> “The religion that will do that for you is the best religion”<br> <br> <br> I was silent for a moment, marvelling and even today thinking of his wise and irrefutable response:<br> <br> "I am not interested, my friend, about your religión or if you are 
                  religious or not. What really is important to me is your behaviour in 
                  front of your peers, family, work, community, and in front of the 
                  world.”<br> <br> “Remember, the universe is the echo of our actions and our thoughts.”<br> <br> “The law of action and reaction is not exclusively for physics. It is 
                  also of human relations. If I act with goodness, I will receive 
                  goodness. If I act with eviI, I will get evil.”<br> <br> <br> “What our grandparents told us is the pure truth. You will always have 
                  what you desire for others. Being happy is not a matter of destiny. It 
                  is a matter of options.”<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> When I read this, I prayed to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to bless me 
                  with the wisdom and skillful means of the Dalai Lama. Certainly the 
                  Dalai Lama must be a great bodhisattva. How perfectly he understands 
                  sentient beings mind, how perfected his skillful means are, and how 
                  wonderful and true his answers are.</p>
