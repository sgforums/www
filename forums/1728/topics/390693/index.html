              <p>Hi moderator,</p>
              <p>I hope to be allowed a thread to allow Buddhists to clear up misconceptions, falsehoods, half truths and sometimes downright lies, without side forays into other religions.</p>
              <p>We are all sensitive to comments to our beliefs. So unless it is a direct comparision, avoid commenting on other religions. Too much emotional words, we could get this thread removed too. </p>
              <p>Please consider my request.</p>

              <p><strong>What the Buddha really said before he passed away</strong></p>
              <p>12 Feb 2010 - Temasek Review</p>
              <p>By U Aung Mein</p>
              <p>As a (Theravadin) Buddhist, I thank Pastor Rony Tan for giving me the opportunity here to address some common misconceptions about Buddhism.[1]</p>
              <p>During a session conducted by Pastor Tan to his congregation, he said that Buddha still “could not find the Way” before he passed away and in the end it was “Jesus who showed Buddha the Way.”</p>
              <p>According to the Pali Canon, the earliest historical records of the Buddha’s teachings, the Buddha passed away in 483 B.C., 483 years before the birth of (Jesus) Christ.</p>
              <p>The events leading to the passing of the Buddha can be found in the <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html"><span style="color: #a91b33;">Mahaparanibbana Sutta</span></a> of the Digha Nikaya.</p>
              <p>At the age of 80, the Buddha announced that he would soon reach Parinibbana or the final deathless state abandoning the earthly body.</p>
              <p>The Buddha taught that all sentinent beings (including human beings) are subjected to an infinite cycles of births, aging, sickness and death and the only way to extricate oneself out of this “mass of suffering” completely is to attain Nibbana [2] (Enlightenment) through the practice of meditation as documented in detail <a href="http://www.paauk.org/files/knowing_and_seeing_rev_ed.pdf"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>. It can be attained in this life here and now so long one strives for it.</p>
              <p>Technically speaking, Buddhism is not a religion but simply a method/way to put a stop to dukkha or suffering once and for all. The Buddha did not demand everybody to follow his teachings which can be questioned, debated and challenged.</p>
              <p>Before he passed away, the Buddha asked his disciples if they had any questions for him:</p>
              <p><em>“It may be, bhikkhus (monks), that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, the path or the practice. Then question, bhikkhus! Do not be given to remorse later on with the thought: ‘The Master was with us face to face, yet face to face we failed to ask him.”</em></p>
              <p>But when this was said for the first, ssecond and third time, the bhikkhus were silent.</p>
              <p>A disciple and attendant of the Buddha Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One, saying:</p>
              <p><em>“Marvellous it is, O Lord, most wonderful it is! This faith I have in the community of bhikkhus, that not even one bhikkhu is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, the path or the practice.”</em></p>
              <p>The Buddha replied:</p>
              <p><em>“Out of faith, Ananda, you speak thus. But here, Ananda, the Tathagata (Buddha) knows for certain that among this community of bhikkhus there is not even one bhikkhu who is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Dhamma (Buddha’s teachings), or the Sangha (community of monks), the path or the practice. For, Ananda, among these five hundred bhikkhus even the lowest is a stream-enterer, secure from downfall, assured, and bound for enlightenment.”</em></p>
              <p>And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying:</p>
              <p><em>“Behold now, bhikkhus, I exhort you:  Transient are all compounded things, strive on with diligence!”</em></p>
              <p>These were the last words of the Buddha.</p>
              <p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>
              <p>[1]: There are two major schools of Buddhism today – Theravada and Mahayana.</p>
              <p>[2]: Nibbana is also known as Nirvana in Sanskrit.</p>

              <p><br>That is not an appropriate place discuss buddhism on this issue.   That place has too many unobjective christians who will attack at any time.     As it is I was already personally attacked in one forum : SG: Life in a dot from a christian called Wacky Sung on no reasonable ground.  </p>

              <p>Hi moderator,</p>
              <p>I hope to be allowed a thread to allow Buddhists to clear up misconceptions, falsehoods, half truths and sometimes downright lies, without side forays into other religions.</p>
              <p>We are all sensitive to comments to our beliefs. So unless it is a direct comparision, avoid commenting on other religions. Too much emotional words, we could get this thread removed too. </p>
              <p>Please consider my request.</p>
