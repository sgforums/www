              lies, without side forays into other religions.</p>
              <p>We are all sensitive to comments to our beliefs. So unless it is
              a direct comparision, avoid commenting on other religions. Too much

              <p>By taking interest in this matter is already sending a message to other rabble rousing community leaders to hold their tongue. The government, by being of aware of this issue, realises the denigration of other religions is a sensitive issue, has already sent out notice.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, they are also our fellow citizens. Should this bashing of other religion by a community leader continue, the onus is with the government, let them weigh the consequences, before acting.</p>

              <h1>Pastor Rony Tan was deeply grateful to the PAP and Lee Kuan Yew</h1>

              <p>Lighthouse Evangelism Pastor Rony Tan who was hauled up by ISD for questioning on Monday over his remarks made about Buddhism and Taoism during a church session, was a diehard PAP fan.</p>
              <p>In 2008, he composed and sang a song entitled “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O67SyJiyzY"><span style="color: #a91b33;">The Singapore Song</span></a>” dedicated solely to the PAP:</p>
              <p><strong>“<span>In deep gratitude to our protective and caring government all these 43 years, The Singapore Song was written in their honor. It is also specially dedicated to Mr &amp; Mrs Lee Kuan Yew.”</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>It is an irony that being a self-proclaimed “loyal” Singapore citizen, Pastor Tan should be ignorant that our society is built on secularism and social harmony.</span></p>
              <p><span>Despite his public apology, many netizens remain unsatisfied that he was let off by ISD with only a slap on his wrist.</span></p>
              <p><span>Pastor Tan should lead by example and relinquish all his positions in Lighthouse Evangelism for he has lost all the moral authority to lead.</span></p>
              <p>The lyrics of the song are as below:</p>
              <p>Oh I was born<br>on a cold and rainy morn<br>My mama cried as she<br>held me, frail and small<br>There was no hope in her eyes<br>as the enemies swept by<br>A colony left alone<br>to bleed and die</p>
              <p>Oh it was hard<br>to endure pain and tyranny<br>Beneath the load how we<br>yearned to be free<br>Then came the day of liberty<br>when we took our destiny<br>To build a nation<br>of strong security</p>
              <p>Singapore<br>I hear your call<br>All for one and one for all<br>I stand so tall<br>Now that I’ve finally survived<br>I pledge my heart and life<br>So in this homeland I vow<br>to live and die</p>
              <p>Oh we were born<br>after the war peacefully<br>We’ve never known<br>great suffering and poverty<br>But we know our fathers’ sacrifice<br>And what they’ve left behind<br>A legacy we hold dear<br>in our lives</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore police sends veiled threat to anonymous netizens posting on the internet</strong></p>
              <p>12 Feb 2010</p>
              <p>Written by Our Correspondent</p>
              <p>Embarrassed by its latest flip-flop in letting the three Singapore Polytechnic students off with only a caution for posting racist remarks on Facebook, the Singapore police now sends a veiled threat to anonymous netizens posting on the internet:</p>
              <p>In a brief statement released to the press yesterday, it said:</p>
              <p>“The three boys have since apologised for their actions and the offensive online page and forum removed. Police would like to remind the public that it takes a serious view of acts that can threaten the social harmony in Singapore. This includes those who do so hiding behind a shroud of anonymity afforded by the Internet.”</p>
              <p>The three were arrested almost immediately following a police report lodged against them by a National Serviceman Mr Prhabagaran who has said that he did not want to see them jailed.</p>
              <p>In the aftermath of the arrests which sent shockwaves across cyberspace, the Commander of Bedok Police Division and Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police Teo Chun Ching said:</p>
              <p><em>“Police take a very stern view of acts that could threaten the social harmony in Singapore. The Internet may be a convenient medium to express one’s views but members of the public should bear in mind that they are no less accountable for their actions online.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Straits Times, 4 February 2010]</strong></p>
              <p>However, when police reports were lodged against Lighthouse Evangelism Senior Pastor Rony Tan for making disparaging remarks about Buddhism and Taoism a week later, the police did not arrest him as what they did to the three Chinese youths.</p>
              <p>Instead, he was hauled up for questioning by the ISD and let off with a slap on the wrist after he apologized to representatives from the Buddhist and Taoist faiths.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>With due respect to ACP Teo, the greatest threat to social harmony in Singapore <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not come from anonymous netizens who have little credibility or influence</span>,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> but from religious leaders like Pastor Tan who commands a loyal following</span>.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is religious leaders who should bear in mind the fact that they are no less accountable for their actions though they are well-established leaders in their respective communities</span>.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In fact, they should be held on to a higher standard precisely because they are in a position of authority to influence others</span></span></strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The racist remarks made by the three Chinese youths have little impact on the rest of Singapore compared to the outrage triggered by Pastor Tan’s words: who is a greater threat to social harmony in Singapore?</strong></span></p>
              <p>The Singapore police should not pick on “small fries” like anonymous netizens which will make them appear no better than good for nothing bullies. They should target the real culprits who are generating social tension and conflicts in Singapore with their irresponsible, divisive and offensive remarks.</p>
              <p>The “release” of the three youths is nothing more than a political move to appease angry Singaporeans and doesn’t change the fact that Pastor Rony Tan was spared the punishment he deserved under the law because:</p>
              <p><strong>“A well-established Christian leader being charged under the Sedition Act would send shockwaves through the Christian community and put the community under siege.”</strong></p>

              <p><br>I am not sure how the govt is taking it that there are many mega churches these days.   I wonder if they see it necessary to monitor these churches to see if there is any possiblity of them doing what you mention.    Hope after this case, the govt will step on to monitor the religious places.</p>

              <h1>LEAKED: Email from Lighthouse Evangelism rallying its members in support of Pastor Rony Tan</h1>
              <p><span class="time">February 13, 2010 - Temasek Review</span></p>
              <p><span class="time">
              </span></p><p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>In the aftermath of the Rony Tan fiasco, many Singaporeans have been wondering whether he is really sincere about his apologies or that he was forced to apologize under pressure from the ISD.</p>
              <p>Lighthouse Evangelism Pastor Rony Tan was hauled up by the ISD for questioning on Monday over the disparaging remarks he made about Buddhism and Taoism during a church session which was video-recorded and widely circulated in cyberspace.</p>
              <p>Though police reports had been lodged against him, no action was taken except a warning from the ISD. Many netizens opined that he was let off too easily given his position to influence thousands of people.</p>
              <p>Besides Pastor Tan, do other members of his Church share his misinformed views about Buddhism and Taoism? It is chilling that none of them have stepped forward to denounce his remarks yet. Neither did leaders of the other Churches do so.</p>
              <p>A reader tipped us off with an email sent by Lighthouse Evangelism to mobilize its members to rally in support of Pastor Rony Tan:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/lighthousemail585.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="473"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The email revealed that Pastor Rony will be giving his statement at the Miracle Service on 13 February and urged concerned Church members to come and rally behind their “beloved” Pastor. It also advised members to refrain speaking to the press at the Service.</p>
              <p>Given the size of Pastor Rony’s congregation and the influence he wields on them, it is little wonder that the authorities dare not take serious action against him.</p>
              <p>To quote from The straits Times:</p>
              <p><strong>“A well-established Christian leader being charged under the Sedition Act would send shockwaves through the Christian community and put the community under siege.”</strong></p>
              <p>But wouldn’t a well-established Christian leader mocking other religions pose a far greater threat to social harmony in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Pastor Rony Tan doesn’t deserve any support from his church members. He had made an atrocious mistake and he should retract his statements publicly, admit to his congregation that he had misled them by misrepresenting Buddhism and Taoism and resigned gracefully from his position in Lighthouse Evangelism.</p>
              <p>In fact, all the other pastors should also distance themselves from Pastor Rony’s remarks and condemned them in no uncertain terms. That is the only way to assure anxious and worried Singaporeans that Pastor Rony has indeed learnt his lesson and he will not repeat the mistake ever again.</p>

              <p>Yes, I wholeheartedly hope to have a point by point rebuttal. My sole purpose is to help both beginner Buddhists and non-Buddhists to understand Buddhism better.</p>
              <p>No matter how many times this post gets deleted by the main moderator, I hope that there would be Buddhists among us who will not give up in using the Pastor Rony Tan's issue as a point for meaningful and mature discussion.</p>
              <p>I will support any Buddhist who starts or comments in a thread related to Pastor Rony Tan's issue, as long as their intention is to truly help Buddhists and non-Buddhists to understand Buddhist concepts better and to forge racial harmony.</p>
              <p>Since the main moderator seems to be deleting related threads without any warning, I hope those who are truly concerned will backup the relevant materials regularly so that similar threads can be re-posted again.</p>
              <p>I will do my own backup too to show my support. =)</p>

              <p>I know you don't believe in anything, whether to believe in what I am going to say is all up to you.</p>
              <p>One must understand the Law of Karma and reincarnation in order to fully understand this sentence : YOU ARE THE MASTER OF YOUR FATE. However, not everything that happens in this life is due to karma. You need Buddha's wisdom to differentiate.</p>
              <p>Your past life's doings had decided when (in time of war or peace) you would be born. Cannot remember does not = did not happen. For instance, you have forgotten you have put your car keys in your child's room but that does not mean you did not put your car keys in your child's room.</p>
              <p>When one was born as disabled, though one can't change that but one can decide to live a life of self pity or live as a normal person but with only the physical inconvenience.</p>
              <p>By understanding and following Buddha's teachings, you can change your life for the better. You can decide to die now by commiting suicide. Isn't this your decision ?</p>
              <p>There are many Buddhist books which tell you how to live a long, happy life and how to change your fate (not superstitious at all). People around have seen how my life has been changed. I am changing mine for the better, what about you ?</p>

              <p><strong>'Let there be no criticism of any religion'</strong> 15 Feb 2010, Straits Times</p>
              <p>IN HIS first public appearance since being rebuked for disparaging other religions, Pastor Rony Tan promised again to promote religious harmony and urged church members to do the same.</p>
              <p>The leader of Lighthouse Evangelism, an independent church with 12,000 members, took to the stage and spoke to a crowded floor about 30 minutes into a weekly church service in Woodlands on Saturday evening.</p>
              <p>He was wearing a black suit and spoke slowly. Reading from a prepared speech that lasted about five minutes, Pastor Tan said that since he was told off by the Internal Security Department last Monday, the church had been 'eliminating all possible offensive recorded material' from its website.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore police sends veiled threat to anonymous
              netizens posting on the internet</strong></p>
              <p>12 Feb 2010</p>
              <p>Written by Our Correspondent</p>
              <p>Embarrassed by its latest flip-flop in letting the three
              Singapore Polytechnic students off with only a caution for posting
              racist remarks on Facebook, the Singapore police now sends a veiled
              threat to anonymous netizens posting on the internet:</p>
              <p>In a brief statement released to the press yesterday, it
              said:</p>
              <p>“The three boys have since apologised for their actions and the
              offensive online page and forum removed. Police would like to
              remind the public that it takes a serious view of acts that can
              threaten the social harmony in Singapore. This includes those who
              do so hiding behind a shroud of anonymity afforded by the
              Internet.”</p>
              <p>The three were arrested almost immediately following a police
              report lodged against them by a National Serviceman Mr
              Prhabagaran who has said that he did not want to see them
              jailed.</p>
              <p>In the aftermath of the arrests which sent
              shockwaves across cyberspace, the Commander of Bedok
              Police Division and Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police Teo
              Chun Ching said:</p>
              <p><em>“Police take a very stern view of acts that could threaten
              the social harmony in Singapore. The Internet may be a convenient
              medium to express one’s views but members of the public should bear
              in mind that they are no less accountable for their actions
              online.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Straits Times, 4 February 2010]</strong></p>
              <p>However, when police reports were lodged against Lighthouse
              Evangelism Senior Pastor Rony Tan for making disparaging remarks
              about Buddhism and Taoism a week later, the police did not arrest
              him as what they did to the three Chinese youths.</p>
              <p>Instead, he was hauled up for questioning by the ISD and let off
              with a slap on the wrist after he apologized to representatives
              from the Buddhist and Taoist faiths.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>With due respect to ACP
              Teo, the greatest threat to social harmony in Singapore
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not come from
              anonymous netizens who have little credibility or influence</span>,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but from religious
              leaders like Pastor Tan who commands a loyal
              following</span>.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is religious leaders who should
              bear in mind the fact that they are no less accountable for their
              actions though they are well-established leaders in their
              respective communities</span>.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In fact, they should be held on to a
              higher standard precisely because they are in a position of
              authority to influence others</span></span></strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The racist remarks made by
              the three Chinese youths have little impact on the rest of
              Singapore compared to the outrage triggered by Pastor Tan’s words:
              who is a greater threat to social harmony in
              Singapore?</strong></span></p>
              <p>The Singapore police should not pick on “small fries” like
              anonymous netizens which will make them appear no better than good
              for nothing bullies. They should target the real culprits who are
              generating social tension and conflicts in Singapore with their
              irresponsible, divisive and offensive remarks.</p>
              <p>The “release” of the three youths is nothing more than
              a political move to appease angry Singaporeans and
              doesn’t change the fact that Pastor Rony Tan was spared the
              punishment he deserved under the law because:</p>
              <p><strong>“A well-established Christian leader being charged under
              the Sedition Act would send shockwaves through the Christian
              community and put the community under siege.”</strong></p>

              <p>Rony Tan is not first, and certainly not the last to shoot his mouth off. There will be plenty of others!

These people comes in many sizes and ages, particularly the newly reborned ones. Strange people and definitely not socially acceptable!   </p>
              <p>If you feel so strongly, you may alert the authorities to any religious incitement, if possible with the same kind of documentation as Rony Tan!</p>

              <h1>Buddhist monk expressed skepticism over the usefulness of inter-faith dialogue to prevent another Rony Tan fiasco</h1>
              <p>Written by Our Correspondent - 16 Feb 2010, Temasek Review</p>
              <p>A Buddhist monk Venerable Dhammika has expressed his doubts about the effectiveness of inter-faith dialogue to prevent another Rony Tan fiasco from arising.</p>
              <p>An Australian by birth, Venerable Dhammika have been a Buddhist monk for 32 years and am the spiritual advisor to the Buddha Dhamma Mandala Society in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Lighthouse Evangelism Pastor Rony Tan was hauled up for questioning by the Internal Security Department (ISD) last Monday for making disparaging remarks about Buddhism and Taoism during a church session which was video-taped and uploaded to Youtube.</p>
              <p>He has since apologized to the leaders of the Buddhist and Taoist faiths and the government has refrained from taking further action against him out of fear of sending “shockwaves” to the Christian community.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times carried a report yesterday quoting several religious leaders as saying that inter-faith dialogue may be the way to prevent such unpleasant episodes from recurring in the future.</p>
              <p>Venerable Dhammika, however, was unimpressed with the inter-faith dialogues as conducted in Singapore. Writing on his personal blog “Dhamma Musings”, he shared his experience at such sessions:</p>
              <p><em>“I doubt that inter-religious dialogue, at least as i</em><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_t-zFMe3ahlY/S3QGMRMmVqI/AAAAAAAAC0Q/BPxw7YmIfa0/s1600-h/ps+roni.jpg"></a><em>t is conducted in  Singapore, really brings about a change in how the different religions feel about each other. I have often attended inter-religious gatherings and I have noticed that everyone is friendly, accommodating and open-minded. The participants are already respectful of other faiths. The ones who could do with a bit of tolerance – the bigots, zealots, fundamentalists and the evangelicals, won’t come. Here in Singapore several major denominations have pointedly refused to join the Inter-religious Organization which they see as fratranizing with Satan.”</em></p>
              <p>The Singapore government frequently organized such inter-faith dialogues to promote interaction between leaders of various religious faiths in Singapore.</p>
              <p>As they are not compulsory, the participants are usually those who are tolerant and respectful of other faiths, as pointed out by Venerable Dhammika and as such is “all too often just an exercise in the converted preaching to each other.”</p>
              <p>Venerable Dhammika proposed the government rewards tolerant leaders to marginalize those who are intolerant:</p>
              <p><em>“The government should consider something like the Public Service Award, the PBM or the BBM, but to be given for service to interfaith understanding. When such people are looked upon as commendable, socially responsible and worthy, the bigots gradually come to be seen as out-of-step, as a public nuisance, as un-respectable. You can marginalize the intolerant by rewarding and lauding the tolerant.”</em></p>
              <p>While the state media has been quick to sweep the saga under the carpet, religious fault-lines still lurk beneath the veneer of normalcy in Singapore, waiting to be exposed once more.</p>
              <p>Pastor Rony Tan’s running down of other religions would not have come to light had he not video-taped his preaching and uploaded it to Youtube where it was subsequently circulated in cyberspace.</p>
              <p>With the combustible situation exacerbated by the relentless influx of foreigners in Singapore, the social tension in Singapore society is set to grow in the years ahead.</p>
