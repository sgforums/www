              <p>You are creating a diversification of the Pastor cause of action into a reglious attack and discrimination.I believe Jason will be contacted probably email / phone<img alt=""> and retrieved back all those deleted thread topic.You are just a ring leader starting from those deleted posting thread and now back to Pastor Rony cause of action.Anyway your nick is mentioned as i reported and the case will be refer to Internal Security Department (ISD) for making insensitive remarks.Good luck with all your comments and once i am back to Singapore i believe some others and probably involving you will be dealt with.</p>

              <p>Lighthouse Evangelism Pastor Rony Tan was hauled up for
                      questioning by the Internal Security Department (ISD) last Monday
                      for making disparaging remarks about Buddhism and Taoism during a
                      church session which was video-taped and uploaded to Youtube.</p>
              <p>He has since apologized to the leaders of the Buddhist and
                      Taoist faiths and the government has refrained from taking further
                      action against him out of fear of sending “shockwaves” to the
                      Christian community.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times carried a report yesterday quoting several
                      religious leaders as saying that inter-faith dialogue may be the
                      way to prevent such unpleasant episodes from recurring in the
                      future.</p>
              <p>Venerable Dhammika, however, was unimpressed with the
                      inter-faith dialogues as conducted in Singapore. Writing on his
                      personal blog “Dhamma Musings”, he shared his experience at such
                      sessions:</p>
              <p><em>“I doubt that inter-religious dialogue, at least as
                      i</em><a rel="nofollow" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_t-zFMe3ahlY/S3QGMRMmVqI/AAAAAAAAC0Q/BPxw7YmIfa0/s1600-h/ps+roni.jpg"></a><em>t is conducted in  Singapore, really
                      brings about a change in how the different religions feel about
                      each other. I have often attended inter-religious gatherings and I
                      have noticed that everyone is friendly, accommodating and
                      open-minded. The participants are already respectful of other
                      faiths. The ones who could do with a bit of tolerance – the bigots,
                      zealots, fundamentalists and the evangelicals, won’t come. Here in
                      Singapore several major denominations have pointedly refused to
                      join the Inter-religious Organization which they see as
                      fratranizing with Satan.”</em></p>
              <p>The Singapore government frequently organized such inter-faith
                      dialogues to promote interaction between leaders of various
                      religious faiths in Singapore.</p>
              <p>As they are not compulsory, the participants are usually those
                      who are tolerant and respectful of other faiths, as pointed out by
                      Venerable Dhammika and as such is “all too often just an exercise
                      in the converted preaching to each other.”</p>
              <p>Venerable Dhammika proposed the government rewards tolerant
                      leaders to marginalize those who are intolerant:</p>
              <p><em>“The government should consider something like the Public
                      Service Award, the PBM or the BBM, but to be given for service to
                      interfaith understanding. When such people are looked upon as
                      commendable, socially responsible and worthy, the bigots gradually
                      come to be seen as out-of-step, as a public nuisance, as
                      un-respectable. You can marginalize the intolerant by rewarding and
                      lauding the tolerant.”</em></p>
              <p>While the state media has been quick to sweep the saga under the
                      carpet, religious fault-lines still lurk beneath the veneer of
                      normalcy in Singapore, waiting to be exposed once more.</p>
              <p>Pastor Rony Tan’s running down of other religions would not have
                      come to light had he not video-taped his preaching and uploaded it
                      to Youtube where it was subsequently circulated in cyberspace.</p>
              <p>With the combustible situation exacerbated by the
                      relentless influx of foreigners in Singapore, the social tension in
                      Singapore society is set to grow in the years ahead.</p>

              <p>I have similar views too. I have a Buddhist friend who is working for a well-known Buddhist temple and is regularly selected to attend inter-faith dialogues over lunches or dinners. He knows very clearly that there are irreconcilable differences between each religion, especially between Buddhism and monotheistic religions such as Christianity and Islam.</p>
              <p>There are indeed many Christian and other religious denominations who choose not to attend any single inter-faith dialogue so we cannot really give a clear proclamation of how successful inter-faith dialogue has really been for Singapore.</p>
              <p>Both the government and the media are very eager to sweep everything under the carpet and we are persuaded to think everything is back to normal once more, since apologies have been made and the government continues to reiterate its strong commitment to maintaining inter-religious harmony.</p>
              <p>Indeed if Pastor Rony Tan had not video-taped his speech and released it on his church's website, we would not have the chance to know what is really being preached behind each church's doors.</p>
              <p>Pastor Rony Tan is not first one to do this, and neither will he be the last. The leaders of the inter-religious organisation had expressed their wish for such incidents to never happen again. To me, they are just making politically correct statements to show magnimousity and forgiveness, while deep inside their hearts and minds, they know this won't be the last of such cases.</p>
              <p>But no matter how forgiving we are, there are limits that can't be tolerated further for the sake of appearing to be forgiving. Appropriate punishments that send a very strong and consistent signal to the public have to be enforced decisively at some point in time. The difficulty is in judging what is considered severe enough to merit a jail sentence or a mere official warning.</p>

              <p>Actually I hope to be part of a group of Buddhists, not just in the context of Singapore, but internationally, who are sincerely respectful, loving and wise in their approach towards members of other religions, but at the same time be firm and proactive in clarifying misconceptions about Buddhism. But of course everything has to start somewhere and since Singapore is my homeland, then let me start with me at home.</p>
              <p>By the way, here's another link from a Buddhist blog that gives a point by point clarification of misconceptions found in Pastor Rony Tan's videos:</p>
              <p><a href="http://moonpointer.com/new/2010/02/clarifications-of-misconceptions-in-pastor-rony-tan%E2%80%99s-videos-on-%E2%80%98buddhism%E2%80%99/">http://moonpointer.com/new/2010/02/clarifications-of-misconceptions-in-pastor-rony-tan%E2%80%99s-videos-on-%E2%80%98buddhism%E2%80%99/</a></p>
              <p>I find that the clarifications from the above link can supplement and complement what AEN or others have already written as some misconceptions that are given in short explanations are further elaborated in the above web article.</p>

              <p>Pure Land and heaven are two different things. Heaven, like i pointed above, is still within samsara, whereas the Pure Land(s) is the manifestation of the Buddha's Enlightened Mind, thus it is a realm of Enlightenment and synonymous with Nirvana or Enlightenment itself.</p>
