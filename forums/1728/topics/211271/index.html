            <div class='col-md body'>Here an objection can be raised as to what was the <strong>first cause </strong>or where does the <strong>process of causation end</strong>?<br><br>In primitive times,people saw the wonders of nature and became curious to get some satisfactory explanation of them.Being ignorant and out of fear of the unknown forces of nature,they naturally tried to explain them by superstitous belief in gods or goddesses.The primitive man belived that the wind blows because the Wind God goes in a procession to get married or fire was caused by fire god.If science had accepted it we would not know that the movement of winf is due to differences of atmospheric pressure.<br><br>It is common for people who are exploring religion to ask questions regarding the origins of the world. Since time immemorial people have speculated about this question. Most religions will teach that the world was created by a Creator. For many people, this seems to be satisfactory.<strong> However, if one seriously thinks about it, this answer is merely a placebo - something that does not have any real value other than to satisfy the incessant queries of a questioner. </strong>To say that the world started with a Creator is no better than to say that the origin of yoghurt is milk, or the origin of a plant is the seed. <strong>Simplistic minds do not seem to have a need to see further back beyond that. </strong><br><br>Everything has a cause, that there must be a first cause, and that God is the first cause. This old argument contains its own refutation, for if everything has a first cause then the first cause must also have a cause.These are the basic ingredients of all religions even today..<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A theistic or superstitious explanation puts an end to all free inquiry.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Does Buddhism share this viewpoint?</span>No,Buddha did not recognise such concept but teaches the principle of <strong>Dependent Origination</strong> The purpose of this topic is just to share the ideas and views from Buddhism. <span style="color: red;">(The principle of Dependent Origination is one of Buddhism's most important and unique teachings.Due to the profundity of the principle of Dependent Origination only the very basic rather than the advanced concepts will be discussed)</span><br><br><strong>Please click to read</strong><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=204975" rel="nofollow">Dependent Origination(Part I)-Dependent Origination  vs First Cause</a><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=205683" rel="nofollow">Dependent Origination(Part II)-Where Is The Cracker?</a><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=205686" rel="nofollow">Dependent Origination(Part III)-Who Am I ?</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What are the consequences of the concept of interdependence on cosmological ideas in Buddhism?</strong> The concept of interdependence implies that the elements of the conventional reality we are all familiar with do not possess an existence that is permanent and autonomous. This thing exists because something else exists, that happens because this has occurred. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nothing can exist by itself and be its own cause.</span><br><br>Everything depends on everything else. Suppose that there is an entity that exists independently of all the others. This implies that it is not produced by a cause, that is, either it has always existed or it does not exist at all. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such an entity will be unchanging since it cannot act on others and others cannot act on it. The world of phenomena could not function.</span> <strong>Thus interdependence is essential for phenomena to manifest themselves</strong>.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Because the concept of interdependence implies that nothing can exist by itself and be its own cause, it goes against the idea of a creative principle, a First Cause or a Creator that is permanent, all-powerful, that has no other cause than itself, and which created the universe.</span> In the same vein, Buddhism rejects the idea that the universe can be born out of nothing - a creation ex-nihilo - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because the universe has to depend on something else to emerge.</span> If the universe was created, it is because there was a potentiality already present. The coming into being of the universe is merely the realization of that potentiality. One can thus interpret the Big Bang as the manifestation of the phenomenal world emerging from an infinite potentiality already in existence. In a poetic language, Buddhism speaks about of <strong>Â“particles of spaceÂ”</strong> which carry in them the potentiality of matter. This is strongly reminiscent of the vacuum filled with energy that is thought to have given birth the material content of the universe in the modern Big Bang theory. Material phenomenon and things are not Â“createdÂ” in the sense that they go from a state of non-existence to one of existence. <strong>Rather they go from an unrealized state to a realized state</strong>. Once it has come into existence, the universe goes through a series of cycles, each composed of 4 stages: birth, evolution, death and a state where the universe is pure potentiality but has not manifested yet itself. <strong>This cyclic universe has no beginning nor an end. </strong><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=192663&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">Origin of the world vs No beginning No end</a><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=189927&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">Recycled Universe: Theory Could Solve Cosmic </a></div>
