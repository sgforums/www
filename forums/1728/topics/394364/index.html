              <p>“There’s no jhana for one with no discernment,<br> no discernment for one with no jhana.<br> But one with both jhana &amp; discernment:<br> he’s on the verge<br> of Unbinding.”-Buddha</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>KENNETH FOLK:</strong> I was thinking, at the very most basic
                       level, the questions to answer are: “What is enlightenment?,” “Why does
                       it matter?”, and “How do you get it?”</p>
              <p><strong>JOEL GROOVER:</strong> Yeah. I love that, and one thing, too,
                       I wanted to mention: One thought that occurred to me is the importance 
                      of somehow conveying the depth of these practices, because I’ve read 
                      Wilber and I have heard his point about objectifying, for example, but 
                      it just did not stick. For me the witness practice, for example, has 
                      seemed just like this kind of mantra that some people that I know repeat
                       to themselves. I’ve seen people saying, “I am the witness” as they do 
                      light yoga, for example. Not that there is anything wrong with that! But
                       I did not get it. One thing that has helped me get the depth of these 
                      practices is, for example, reading the <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/Case+Studies">case 
                      studies</a> that you have posted, particularly that one with Monica, for
                       example.</p>
              <p>You get a real sense of what people are doing at a higher level of 
                      yogic attainment and just the depth of the actual practices. It is easy 
                      for people to just gloss over practices. They see so many potential 
                      things that you can do mentioned in books that they read. So I do not 
                      know how to convey that, but I certainly get a sense of it from the case
                       studies.</p>
              <p>I would add that the deft way in which you guide students through the
                       jhanas and help them understand the Progress of Insight—that really 
                      comes through in the case studies on your site. This is not “just open 
                      to it” or “just be with whatever arises.” This is very specific and 
                      high-level instruction.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> I see what you’re saying—for example, you can 
                      read how Wilber describes this process of objectifying and dis-embedding
                       and “OK, great.” It sounds very heady and disconnected from humanity. 
                      But when you read how Monica describes what that feels like, that depth 
                      of emotion that she expresses so well … Wow. People can relate to that 
                      on a human level.</p>
              <p>That is one of the reasons I think that this hardcore dharma movement
                       does not attract women generally. It is because we have left that out 
                      and we keep thinking that people are just going to know without us 
                      telling them how profound this is at every level.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yeah. Right. Right. And it has got to be 
                      conveyed. Another thing that conveys it is descriptions of experiences. 
                      What does progress look like, experientially, to a yogi who is actually 
                      moving through the states and stages of developmental enlightenment? It 
                      is neat when other practitioners are describing having experiences per 
                      your instructions and seeing the results.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> OK, right. So that is verification that it 
                      actually works, that somebody was really doing the technique I suggested
                       and look what happened. Now this is good for me to hear because one of 
                      the things that I worry about with Daniel [Ingram’s] book [<em>Mastering
                       the Core Teachings of the Buddha</em>] is that people will read his own
                       personal idiosyncratic process and think that they are supposed to have
                       exactly that, and of course it does not happen that way.</p>
              <p>People respond to this in their own way but that does not mean that 
                      it is not enormously valuable to tell those stories and explain that 
                      there is great variation in how it can come about.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yeah, the caveats are maybe kind of important 
                      but, you know, where are most practitioners? I don’t really know, but my
                       guess is that many are “chronic yogis.” So they are probably like me, 
                      many of them, where they have had opening experiences. Those have gone 
                      away. They do not know how to get them back and they just kind of—they 
                      do not really know whether meditative practice can progress in the ways 
                      that you and Daniel have made clear. So, they do not see that happening 
                      much because of the “mushroom culture.” So I think it is important.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Now that you have just said “chronic yogi”—that 
                      initially comes from Sayadaw U Pandita, and that is something that Bill 
                      Hamilton talked a lot about. The chronic yogi is my target audience.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yes. Right.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> I love the fact that we are back to that phrase 
                      because people are asking me, “What is your target audience?” Well, it 
                      is the chronic yogi—somebody who has got the arising and passing away, 
                      has had some opening, as you say, in the past, and yet is floundering. 
                      Nobody has clearly expressed what can happen from here, so they have 
                      kind of hunkered down: “All right, I’m just going to have to accept my 
                      lot. I will be like this for the rest of my life and this is really what
                       awakening is all about—it is about being a complacent slug.”</p>
              <p>I want to say, “No! That is not what it is at all!”</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> That is what it is viewed as. People learn to 
                      say, “States, they just come and go.” The ironic part is, there is a 
                      truth to it. You do not want to be attached to having things go one way 
                      or the other, but we are missing something, right?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> That is right. This is one of those near-enemy 
                      teachings. The near-enemy of understanding that progress can be made by 
                      properly applying the technique is, of course, becoming a gung-ho 
                      achiever and thinking that meditative achievement is just like any other
                       category of achievement. “I’m going to become the CEO of Meditation 
                      Inc.”</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> One integral teacher calls approaches based on 
                      doing, or having techniques, “hyper-masculine.” And so the teaching is 
                      “You are perfect the way you are,” because if you engage in 
                      hyper-masculine approaches, it is just a loop.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Interesting. So here we have the reaction to 
                      hyper-masculinity—the pendulum just goes all the way to the other side 
                      and pegs over there where “I’m not going to do anything.”</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yes.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> The interesting part about that is, as always 
                      there is this razor’s edge between heaven and hell. They are right. Once
                       you get it, that is exactly right. This is fine exactly the way it is. 
                      It is perfect. But if you don’t see that and if you are just mouthing 
                      off about it, why bother?</p>
              <p>So there has got to be a scaffolded approach where you can say—you 
                      ring the non-dual bell first and you say, “OK. It’s fine. Do you see 
                      that?” And the answer is yes or no. “Yes I do.” Then OK, fine, don’t do 
                      anything else. You have done it. But for a lot of people the answer is 
                      “No. I don’t see that and any amount of mind-fucking doesn’t help.”</p>
              <p>So then you say, “Let’s give you a practice now.” Now it is time for a
                       technique, and then you find that as you go through those <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/The+Three+Speed+Transmission">three
                       practices of objectifying or investigating the objects of awareness</a>,
                       which is First Gear, then turning the light around and investigating 
                      the subject, which is Second Gear and then at times just giving up the 
                      entire self-improvement project as Tsoknyi Rinpoche or Tulku Urgyen 
                      Rinpoche would say—I can’t remember which—which is Third Gear, they all 
                      reinforce each other and they can all be done in their own season.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And now interestingly, too, surrender seems to 
                      play a role in all of the gears, doesn’t it? For example, with the Pa 
                      Auk Sayadaw system [First Gear] it is a situation where at a certain 
                      point you cannot be doing it. They say “the practice starts doing you” 
                      and you surrender. And yet surrender has to be a part of Third Gear, 
                      right?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes, in fact surrender is the entire program in 
                      Third Gear.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> So you hear at least some conservative 
                      Theravadins talking about surrender as the thing, and then you’ll hear 
                      it from non-dualists as well. Is there anything to say about the way 
                      surrender fits in at all stages or all levels of practice?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> In First Gear, surrender is seasonal, as I like 
                      to think of it. So you’re moving through these seasons of the <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/The+Progress+of+Insight+%28Part+One%29">Progress
                       of Insight</a>. In the first part of the Progress of Insight, there is 
                      effort. And so in my story “<a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/boywhofound.shtml">The Boy Who 
                      Found the Great Ocean</a>,” when the mother says, “Let me give you my 
                      blessing. May you work hard and achieve your heart’s desire,” well, that
                       is the first part of it. You have to arouse some energy/effort. The 
                      Pali word is <em>viriya</em>. So that is a season, because if you do not
                       arouse that energy/effort to get over the hump to look carefully at the
                       changing phenomena of mind and body you end up just staying embedded in
                       your experience.</p>
              <p>OK, you crest that hill of the arising and passing away of 
                      phenomena—the fourth Insight Knowledge—and at that point, as Shinzen 
                      Young says, you have been rubbing two sticks together to catch a fire 
                      and it sparks and it does catch fire. All of the potential energy 
                      contained in those sticks is released. And so now all you have to do is 
                      find a way to go with the energy that is spontaneously arising anyway.</p>
              <p>So you very quickly, after the arising and passing away of phenomena,
                       come to a place where anything you do is just messing you up. So that 
                      is when you’re in the dark night and, by the way, as long as I’m on the 
                      theme of the story of “The Boy who Found the Great Ocean,” the father’s 
                      blessing, which comes right at the crest of the hill, which is the 
                      arising and passing away, the father says, “May you realize that you and
                       your heart’s desire are one.” It is already done at that point. This is
                       the unitive experience that is so common there.</p>
              <p>But when it gets to the point in “The Boy Who Found the Great Ocean” 
                      where Mighty Medicine Woman finally gives her blessing to Putujjana, she
                       says, “May you give up your heart’s desire and so realize a much 
                      greater gift.” Well, you have to surrender there.</p>
              <p>And so I like to say about the dark night, which is what we are 
                      talking about now, this is a season in which you cannot go forward, you 
                      cannot go back. What are you going to do? You just lie down on the cold 
                      earth for seven days and seven nights and surrender. So that is 
                      surrender as it pertains to First Gear. It is situational. Sometimes you
                       surrender and sometimes not. You have got to understand something about
                       this practice to know what is appropriate and when.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> In Pa Auk Sayadaw’s system, surrender in First 
                      Gear comes about as the meditator places all of the attention on the 
                      anapanasati spot or kasina, to the exclusion of everything else, and 
                      regards personal thoughts, feelings and other distractions with a 
                      “benign disinterest,” returning to the object again and again and again 
                      and thus “knowing the self by forgetting the self,” as in Zen. And since
                       the meditator, in Second Gear, is returning again and again and again 
                      to the witness as object, we might say that there is a Second Gear sense
                       of surrender as well—it is a more limited sense of surrender … maybe a 
                      run-up to the ultimate surrender of Third Gear?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> In Second Gear, I’m investigating the subject, 
                      turning the flashlight of awareness back around on itself to look right 
                      down its own pipe and light up the subject. In this moment, I’m not 
                      seeing that the concept of surrender has much to offer there. Because 
                      you are deliberately taking this perspective; you’re looking at this 
                      sense of “I.”</p>
              <p>At first it appears to be a transpersonal witness that is not Kenneth
                       but includes Kenneth, and it does not have a stake in Kenneth’s life. 
                      So this is what I call the “no-dog.” It has no dog in this fight.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> So maybe the surrender is when “the stick is 
                      consumed by the fire,” as Ramana Maharshi put it, right? And is that the
                       transition to Third Gear?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes. Yes. That’s right. Surrender comes at that 
                      moment of transition from Second to Third Gear.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Someone could freak out and not go with it at 
                      that point and not surrender, couldn’t they?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> I think they could, and so it is really useful 
                      to know that the stick is being consumed by the fire because in practice
                       what happens is you have gotten to the point—and this is, again, 
                      seasonal—you are going through one of the circuits, one of these cycles 
                      and you have gotten to the point where everything that is arising in the
                       field of experience is seen, so it is all objectified; it is all Teflon
                       mind. And you have gotten to the point where even the knower, the sense
                       of knowing, is objectified. So you’re just looking at that and you are 
                      saying “OK. I see it. Who am I? Knowing. There is a sense of knowing” 
                      [Kenneth’s tone of voice here conveys that the meditator is, at this 
                      point, regarding the process as blasé or casual or mundane.]</p>
              <p>And yet this has gotten really subtle and even in this place called <em>sat-chit-ananda</em>,
                       “being-consciousness-bliss” that the Advaitists talk about, which is 
                      wonderful, but you’re still going—there is something that still isn’t 
                      right. There’s something missing. And that is the question: What am I 
                      missing?</p>
              <p>So actually there is nowhere to go from there. When you get to the 
                      subtlest levels of noticing this sense of knowing itself, you cannot get
                       behind that. I can’t get behind that, because the only thing that is 
                      behind that does not include any sense of I. So then you have to 
                      surrender entirely. So it is a discontinuity. It could be seen as a 
                      linear development up until that point: Every time I objectified 
                      something at one stratum of mind I was kicked upstairs to the next 
                      stratum of mind. I could look down and go “Ha, look at all that stuff 
                      down there.” You keep getting kicked upstairs until finally there is 
                      nowhere to get kicked. I cannot get kicked upstairs; I just have to go 
                      away.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> You use another term, which is uncompounded.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Uncompounded. Good. So everything has been 
                      compounded all along the way, even including this sense of subtle 
                      knowing. All of those—even sat-chit-ananda—are conditioned phenomena, 
                      and then suddenly, the discontinuity: You surrender even that, the 
                      subtlest possible thing, and then there is the uncompounded, just the 
                      absolute of awareness recognizing itself without me to evaluate and 
                      report on it. That is why it is ineffable and cannot be 
                      expressed—because I am not there to see that.</p>
              <p>It is one thing to be a radical non-dualist, a ruthless practitioner 
                      of Third Gear and say “All I have to do is surrender to the absolute and
                       I’m good.” Well, right.</p>
              <p>And yet, as a human being if you’re not objectifying the content of 
                      the mind at every level—if it is not all seen to arise and pass 
                      away—then you are embedded in it. So it is fine to say “Oh, 100 times a 
                      day I’m able to see that it is perfect.” Yeah, but for the rest of the 
                      day you’re a jerk and embedded in your experience, acting out, because 
                      you haven’t developed Teflon mind, which is what we want. We want Teflon
                       mind so that things don’t stick.</p>
              <p>It is interesting and relevant that, as I understand it, some of the 
                      Tibetans who are teaching Third Gear also spent many years of their 
                      lives developing what they consider to be the lower practices before 
                      they even began practicing Third Gear.</p>
              <p>This is often taken out of context in the West. Tulku Urgyen was a 
                      real pioneer here. He just went out there, sort of an anti-mushroom guy,
                       and said, “This is the highest practice that we know about and so here 
                      it is.” He taught to just surrender to awareness, but he was teaching it
                       to people who had no training in all of this other stuff leading up to 
                      it—the stuff that would normally lead up to it in the traditional 
                      Tibetan approach.</p>
              <p>In order to realize our potential as human beings, I think we really 
                      need the whole package. Whether you teach Third Gear first and then come
                       back and teach First and Second I do not think is so important. It is 
                      just a matter of all of it has to be done.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Do you mind talking about concentration a little
                       more?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Sure.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> My dharma practice started, I was in journalism 
                      school and had a professor who had been a correspondent in the Vietnam 
                      War for The New York Times, and he was standing next to one of these 
                      monks who self-immolated. He said to us, “This man burned away to 
                      nothing and he never flinched, and I will never understand it. There are
                       things in this world that we don’t understand.” And I just thought, 
                      “Wow. I’ve got to find out about that. What is going on?” It just seemed
                       to open up my mind—this whole other potential that I had not thought 
                      about before.</p>
              <p>If you think about the level of concentration, if that story is true,
                       that would be required to do something like that, and then I was 
                      reading about Dipa Ma. Apparently when she first went to Mahasi 
                      Sayadaw’s meditation center, at one point in her walking meditation she 
                      was stopped and she did not realize why she could not keep going. It was
                       a stray dog that had gotten her leg. Her concentration was so strong 
                      that she didn’t even notice that. I guess what I’m trying to say is that
                       there is this level of concentration that is understood in parts of 
                      Asia but that I don’t think we fully comprehend here. You made this 
                      point that it was a problem for the Burmese yogis because their 
                      concentration was so good that they weren’t really doing vipassana, and 
                      so could you talk a little bit about that and how we are missing 
                      something about concentration?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> There does seem to be a cultural component, and 
                      it does seem that Asian yogis have, generally speaking, better 
                      concentration than western yogis. It seems logical that it would happen 
                      that way because we have so many distractions and our lifestyle is based
                       on changing gears every few seconds. So the only kind of TV that we can
                       be engaged in is something where the scene changes about every second 
                      and a half. So if you’re in a culture where it makes sense to be with 
                      something for some period of time—like let’s say your job is cutting 
                      down trees with a handsaw.</p>
              <p>I actually saw this at a monastery in Burma. This one skinny old man 
                      cut down a tree that was enormous. The trunk must have been 10 feet in 
                      diameter, and he got out there with one big two-man saw but it was just 
                      him and for days he just cranked on that saw until he had finally cut 
                      down this big tree. And then he cut it into chunks all by himself. This 
                      was a guy who should have been retired and watching football on TV if he
                       were an American.</p>
              <p>But just look at how that job in that culture reinforces 
                      concentration. But what else are you going to do? For one thing, 
                      presumably he was not a Harvard grad. Maybe he did not have a lot of 
                      complex ideas floating around in his head. He went out there, stood 
                      there, squatted there and cranked on that saw. What was he doing with 
                      his time? Maybe he was concentrating. So the culture supports that.</p>
              <p>Now there are pros and cons to it, I suppose. Or at least depending 
                      upon whether you have a lot of concentration or a little, you are going 
                      to approach your meditation differently. So it is very common for the 
                      Burmese monks, Sayadaw U Pandita for example, to really want to arouse a
                       lot of effort in the yogis because, for one thing, if you are a poor 
                      Burmese person and you get to go to the monastery for the weekend and 
                      just sit there and concentrate, what a break! What a wonderful treat 
                      that is, because probably your life is working from sunup to sundown on 
                      something really difficult every day.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And in a society that is full of ethnic conflict
                       and can be chaotic and dangerous, right?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes. Right. And so now you are relatively safe. 
                      You’re getting good food. Your only job is to sit there on the ground 
                      for some period of time. Well, you might be tempted to just enjoy that, 
                      but the vipassana technique demands that you not only enjoy it, but that
                       you pay careful attention to what is going on.</p>
              <p>So the Burmese monks will say, “You need more effort. Don’t just sit 
                      there like a lump. Investigate your experience and”—here I’m not using 
                      words that they would use—“objectify these phenomena and dis-embed from 
                      them.” Well, now these Burmese monks who are very experienced at 
                      teaching Burmese yogis come to the United States and they say, “You need
                       more effort!”</p>
              <p>Now, Americans don’t need more effort, generally speaking.  We 
                      probably don’t have the ability to concentrate for more than about a 
                      second and a half. We know about striving. We are the masters of 
                      striving. It is all we ever do. What I find with American and Western 
                      yogis in general, I can be on the telephone with somebody and I can lead
                       them through the vipassana technique and very quickly people can 
                      objectify the sensations of the rise and fall of the abdomen; they can 
                      move on to pleasant and unpleasant; they can see mind states.  That is 
                      not particularly hard for them.</p>
              <p>Those are very important things to be able to do because once you can
                       do that you get the arising and passing away of phenomena pretty 
                      quickly, if you have not already had it. But what they cannot do is 
                      access deeper strata of mind that also have to be objectified. And this 
                      is so important. This is why effort alone ends up not working—it ends up
                       creating chronic yogis.</p>
              <p>So in order to make your way through this sequence of paths—the four 
                      paths of enlightenment and the sub stages that make up those paths—you 
                      have to access and deconstruct various strata of mind. Now, we know just
                       logically that you cannot deconstruct something that you cannot access.
                       And some strata of mind require concentration: You just can’t get there
                       and stabilize in that stratum of mind without concentration.</p>
              <p>So you can be the world’s best de-constructor, but you’re not getting
                       there in the first place. So concentration becomes a very important 
                      thing, and concentration is not McMeditation. I can’t say, “OK. I have 
                      been concentrating for a week now and I’m getting pretty good at it.”</p>
              <p>You will be getting pretty good at it when you have been doing it for
                       decades. This is something that we don’t want to hear. That is not part
                       of our culture at all, but it is analogous to learning to play an 
                      instrument. Now, if you have been playing piano for 20 years you might 
                      be good. But if you have been playing it for a year, let’s face it. 
                      There is no way you are good.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> This is where B. Alan Wallace says, “Look. It’s 
                      10,000 hours.” He says, “Look at the Tibetan yogis that are at 50,000 or
                       60,000 hours.” He has a different map. I guess there have been some 
                      efforts to try to draw parallels, and he was a Theravadin for some 
                      period of time, but he really talks about intense concentration states 
                      and how that has been lost in the Tibetan tradition. He describes 
                      talking to the Dalai Lama about what he calls “attaining shamatha”—I’m 
                      not sure where that fits on the Theravada map—and the Dalai Lama says, 
                      “Yeah, nobody does that anymore.” So it is interesting to note that 
                      maybe in the Mahayana world the role of concentration is not what it 
                      was.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yeah. I suppose it is human nature to always 
                      want to get rich quick. So you see it in all traditions. Every once in a
                       while some charismatic teacher will come around and say, “I have got a 
                      better way. You do not have to work so hard, just do what I tell you to 
                      do.” They tend to be pretty popular teachers. They often have something 
                      really good to say. There often is some priceless nugget there that gets
                       misunderstood. I’m thinking specifically of 17th-century Japanese Zen 
                      master Bankei, who said, “Just live in the unborn Buddha mind. That is 
                      all you have to do.”</p>
              <p>Well, that is exactly right. But most people probably don’t know how 
                      to do that without some scaffolding. Well, what he is not saying is “It 
                      would be really conducive to living in the unborn Buddha mind if you had
                       practiced samatha meditation for some thousands of hours.” And that is 
                      what needs to be said.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Right. Right.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> One of my dharma friends the other day, I was 
                      talking to him and he said, “I don’t think I have enough patience with 
                      people on the [Kenneth Folk Dharma] <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/forum">forum</a> because 
                      often when somebody asks a question what I want to say to them is ‘Just 
                      practice for another thousand hours and see if you still have a 
                      question. Just do what I did.’ Why do you want me to just give you 
                      something that cannot be given?”</p>
              <p>Again I think of playing a musical instrument. I used to be a music 
                      teacher, and this would happen all the time when I was teaching guitar. 
                      People would say, “Can you tell me something that will help me play 
                      better?” Every week I tell you everything I can to help you play better 
                      but that is not what helps you play better.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yeah, it’s building a neural network.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Right.  And there’s just no free lunch.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> The Dalai Lama also says something like this, 
                      which is, I think, it is either five or 10 years that you should take 
                      before you evaluate the effects of, or your progress in, any particular 
                      practice.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Right. So here is the dark side of what we do in
                       the so-called hardcore dharma scene, where we are saying, “Look. You 
                      can get enlightened. I did it and you can too. Here’s how.” And we are 
                      saying, “You can have measurable progress literally within a few days.” 
                      And so I’m not kidding when I say I have talked to people on the phone 
                      and they can get the arising and passing away within a few days as soon 
                      as I model the technique for them and talk them through it, walk them 
                      through it in real-time.</p>
              <p>They are getting measurable progress within days. That is very 
                      exciting. And yet it is tempting for people to think, “OK. Then I should
                       be an arahat next week.” Highly unlikely.</p>
              <p>That was one of the reasons I moved away from the Dharma Overground 
                      because we had, with all good intentions, created this McMeditation 
                      culture. There were a lot of problems. One was that every 20-year-old 
                      kid thought that he was an arahat. The other thing was that we had—there
                       was this kind of snarky culture where everybody was saying, “Well, you 
                      don’t even know what you’re talking about. I’m an arahat now and I…” All
                       right. We’ve got to take a deep breath. [laughs]</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And that’s the thing, there will be a shadow 
                      side to anything that is here in our human realm. It is just knowing 
                      what that is and being clear about it I guess—the near enemy or the 
                      shadow or whatever you want to call it.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Right. And on that same theme let’s look at the 
                      shadow of overemphasizing concentration. There is a group of young men 
                      who live in the desert out West. They call themselves “The Blessed 
                      Brotherhood of the BMX” and they ride bicycles all day and that’s their 
                      whole job. They are supported by their adoring fans.  All they have to 
                      do is ride these bikes. They can do incredible tricks. They can do 360s,
                       720s, back-flips on a bike, and all kinds of remarkable things. To 
                      them, unless you can do a back flip on a bicycle you have never even 
                      ridden a bike. And yet all around the world there are billions of people
                       who ride bikes every day to get to work and do the shopping and go 
                      visit their friends. Are they not riding bikes?</p>
              <p>The Blessed Brotherhood of the BMX has a kind of skewed idea of what 
                      bike-riding is. What they do is wonderful, but we don’t want to define 
                      something in terms of the extreme.  So some people have taken an extreme
                       view of what jhana is:  “You haven’t even gotten into jhana unless you 
                      can sit there without thinking in some particular jhana for four hours.”
                       Well, by that definition I have never in my life entered jhana. So I do
                       not find that to be a helpful definition of jhana. I find that to be 
                      like the Blessed Brotherhood of the BMX. People have a reason for saying
                       what they do and it generally has to do with justifying their own 
                      existence.</p>
              <p>What I care about with regard to jhana is, how does it support 
                      awakening? If you can awaken without learning how to be in jhana for 
                      four hours at a time—and you definitely can—then being in extreme jhana 
                      is interesting and wonderful, but let’s not make a big deal out of it. 
                      Let’s not tell people that they are doing it wrong if they cannot do 
                      that.</p>
              <p>So if the mountain is analogous to enlightenment, I want to be able 
                      to get to the top of it and be able to walk up and down it and have full
                       access to every point of altitude. Let’s divide the mountain up into 
                      bands. Let’s say that every 1,000 feet of altitude there is a habitat 
                      band and as I’m walking up there, up and down each day, I go a little 
                      bit higher each day. I’m eventually going to get to the point where I am
                       enlightened. I am at the point where I can just walk up and down the 
                      mountain in each sitting and see virtually everything that is there. 
                      Enlightenment is actually much better than that because you can move to 
                      any point of the mountain at the speed of thought.</p>
              <p>So how much time do I want to spend becoming a master of any given 
                      habitat band? Let’s say I get to the first band and my teacher says, 
                      “OK, but I don’t want you to go on to the second band until you have 
                      identified every animal and every plant in this habitat band.” Well 
                      there are a lot of bands and I just don’t have time. In one lifetime I 
                      cannot spend a lot of time in any given band. It is not that I’m not 
                      interested and it is not that I will not investigate and explore. But 
                      that exploration—every habitat band is infinite.</p>
              <p>There are four parameters that I like for people to have some 
                      facility with as they develop jhana. You want to be able to advert to 
                      the jhana, which literally means to look at it. So you are sliding 
                      around in access concentration and you can go to the particular stratum 
                      of mind where that jhana is and you are looking in, but you haven’t 
                      entered it. And then you want to be able to enter the jhana, which is 
                      the second of the four parameters. You want to be able to dwell in it, 
                      which is the third parameter. And you want to be able to exit it, the 
                      fourth.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> So you are saying “know the terrain of the 
                      mountain that you’re going up and down, but you do not have to be a 
                      biologist and classify every single species.”</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes.  That’s right.  We can see the parallel in 
                      biology where if you really want to be good at reptiles and amphibians 
                      you had better specialize there. If you want to be really good you had 
                      better forget about reptiles and just do amphibians, and you had better 
                      get more specialized. You had better look at a particular species of 
                      newt and make that your life study so that you really understand that 
                      critter.</p>
              <p>Well, it is infinite how many creatures there are and what aspect of 
                      it you want to study. The question that I would ask the people who are 
                      the proponents of what I think of as extreme jhana is, ‘Are you getting 
                      the balance right? Are you getting enlightened? Are your students 
                      getting enlightened?’ If not, maybe it is time to tweak the balance.</p>
              <p>Yes, it is interesting and it is very valuable.  But what is the 
                      priority?  If the priority is awakening, then you might have to spend a 
                      little less time in each habitat band and get really good at going up 
                      and down the mountain.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> With an extreme form of jhana mastery, very few 
                      students might be able to do it.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> You might not live long enough to awaken if you 
                      spend so much time at each level and that is a problem because in my 
                      priority system, awakening is much more valuable than being able to 
                      spend four hours doing anything.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> But I suppose anything can be taken too far and 
                      this is the primary argument, I suppose, that the dry insight workers 
                      make, which is that you might die tomorrow. Do not bother with jhana or 
                      concentration—just do vipassana and understand the three characteristics
                       because that can lead to awakening and enlightenment. And you might get
                       stuck—you might get attached if you focus on concentration.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes. And I think for some people, dry insight 
                      works. It also has its dark side. You can get the striving, over-amped, 
                      anxious yogi. I see a lot of that. People come to my forum who are 
                      actually doing it right and they are making good progress, but they 
                      think it should be faster and if they were really doing it right it 
                      would be going faster. They are hindering themselves because they are 
                      not adding any concentration to speak of into the mix. So they’re just 
                      trying to do it through effort. It is messing with their lives because 
                      they have turned themselves into balls of anxiety and so you have to 
                      find a balance.</p>
              <p>Most chronic yogis are probably at that stage because they do not 
                      have enough concentration. Western yogis tend to be good at 
                      investigating their experience once they get the hang of it, and the 
                      fact is, once you get the first arising and passing away, your mind 
                      knows how to do that. It is going to spontaneously deconstruct whatever 
                      stratum of mind you can access. The question is, are you accessing the 
                      relevant strata of mind? The answer is, no, obviously not, because if 
                      you were you would be enlightened already.</p>
              <p>So concentration becomes the trick. The caveat here, there is 
                      something called <em>khanika samadhi</em>, which means momentary 
                      samadhi, whereby you become concentrated moment by moment as you’re 
                      noting. I will demonstrate here in real-time. If I look at just whatever
                       arises in the mind: pressure, warmth, coolness, pleasant, annoyance, 
                      tension, pleasant, unpleasant. Well if you just keep doing that you 
                      develop khanika samadhi and you can access all of the strata of mind by 
                      doing that. Some people can get away with that and some people can’t.</p>
              <p>If you do that and you access all of the strata of mind at once, you 
                      become an arahat. But then the question is, where does that lead? Do you
                       then become an anxious arahat who still has no ability to concentrate 
                      because you have not developed it? Would you be better off if you had 
                      taken a little more time and had developed platforms of proficiency all 
                      along the way so that you could revisit everything that you saw all 
                      along the way? Would you be a better teacher if you really understood 
                      the way your mind is set up in this stratified structure?</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yes. Otherwise it seems like it would require 
                      some kind of hypervigilance to maintain—if you had not built the 
                      scaffold.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> So teaching is a balancing act with every 
                      individual student. You are trying to find the right ratio of 
                      concentration to investigation to make optimal progress and not drive 
                      that person insane.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And isn’t this just right concentration: 
                      balancing samatha and vipassana, the Buddha’s basic teaching.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> That is exactly right.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And so we just have to ask, “What are our issues
                       in the Mahayana world and in the Theravada world in terms of the 
                      balance of concentration and insight?”</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> It is complex because you’re dealing with 
                      individuals and you’re dealing with different priorities on the part of 
                      the teacher and student. You’re dealing with a dynamic situation. At any
                       given moment, the right balance of concentration changes, from one 
                      moment to the next. One of the things I teach is to understand that it 
                      is dynamic and let your mind find its level in each moment.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yeah, as Richard Shankman said on Buddhist 
                      Geeks, meditation is an art.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes. All of this is really just becoming this 
                      great artist of the mind.</p>
