              <p><span style="font-size: normal;">Something I discussed in another forum, sharing here as well:<br><br>I was trained in this 3 aspects:<br><br>1. The experience<br>2. The realization<br>3. and the View<br><br>I will start with 'experience'. There are different experiences in relation to 'no self':<br><br>1. Impersonality.<br><br>This
                   is the case when practitioners experienced that everything is an 
                  expression of a universal cosmic intelligence. There is therefore no 
                  sense of a personal doer... rather, it feels like I and everything is 
                  being lived by a higher power, being expressed by a higher cosmic 
                  intelligence. But this is still dualistic – there is still this sense of
                   separation between a 'cosmic intelligence' and the 'world of 
                  experience', so it is still dualistic.<br><br>There is also a very 
                  important realization - the realization of Pure Presence or 
                  Consciousness or Beingness or Existence as being one's true identity. 
                  There is an irrefutable undeniable insight into the luminous essence of 
                  mind. Actually self-realization is not related to impersonality in the 
                  sense that impersonality can be experienced with or without 
                  self-realization, however a self-realized person would progress his 
                  experience in terms of impersonality. Nevertheless dualistic tendencies 
                  are strong and awareness is seen as an eternal witnessing presence, a 
                  pure formless perceiving subject. A true experience is being distorted 
                  by the mind's tendency at projecting duality and inherency (to things, 
                  self, awareness, etc)<br><br>2. Non-dual into One Mind.<br><br>Where subject and object division collapsed into a single seamless experience of one Naked Awareness.<br><br>3. No-Mind<br><br>Where
                   even the naked Awareness is totally forgotten and dissolved into simply
                   scenery, sound, arising thoughts and passing scent.<br><br>4. Sunyata<br><br>My
                   experience here is still at the beginning phase. It is when the 'self' 
                  is completely transcended into dependent originated activity. The play 
                  of dharma.<br><br>Next is the 'Realization'. Having an experience of 
                  witnessing, or a state of pure presence, is not the same as having 
                  attained self-realization - in that case the practitioner can be said to
                   have an experience, but not insight/realization. Having an experience 
                  is not the same as having a realization... for example, you may have a 
                  temporary experience where the sense of separation between experiencer 
                  and experience suddenly and temporarily dissolves or there is the sense 
                  that subject and object has merged... temporarily. This is not yet the 
                  realization of non-duality... the realization that separation has been 
                  false right from the beginning... there never was separation.<br><br>Hence
                   having non-dual samadhis are *not* enlightenment... why? The 
                  realization that there never was separation to begin with, hasn't 
                  arisen. Therefore you can only have temporary glimpses and experiences 
                  of non-dual... where the latent dualistic tendencies continue to 
                  surface... and not have seamless, effortless seeing.<br><br>And even 
                  after seeing through this separation, you may have the realization of 
                  non-dual but still fall into substantial non-duality, or One Mind. Why? 
                  This is because though we have overcome the bond of duality, our view of
                   reality is still seeing it as 'inherent'. Our view or framework has it 
                  that reality must have an inherent essence or substance to it, something
                   permanent, independent, ultimate. So though everything is experienced 
                  without separation, the mind still can't overcome the idea of a source. 
                  The mind kept coming back to a 'source' and is unable to break-through 
                  and find the constant need to rest in an ultimate reality in which 
                  everything is a part of... a Mind, an Awareness, a Self.... what this 
                  results is a subtle tendency to cling, to sink back to a ground, a 
                  source, and so transience cannot be fully appreciated for what it is. It
                   is an important phase however, as for the first time phenomena are no 
                  longer seen as 'happening IN Awareness' but 'happening AS Awareness' – 
                  Awareness is its object of perception, Awareness is expressing itself as
                   every moment of manifest perception.<br><br>However, there is still a 
                  constant referencing back to the One Awareness. Until you see that the 
                  idea itself is merely a thought, and everything is merely thoughts, 
                  sights, sounds, disjoint, disperse, insubstantial. There, a change of 
                  view takes place... experience remains non-dual but without the view of 
                  'everything is inside me/everything is an expression of ME' but 'there 
                  is just thoughts, sight, sound, taste' – just manifestation. At this 
                  point you realize no self in the sense of Anatta – just sight, sound, 
                  thoughts, with no one behind or linking them. After anatta, you can then
                   proceed to experience and realize how every experience, every 
                  manifestation is the interaction of the entire universe... the total 
                  exertion of the universe, the totality of causes and conditions, gives 
                  rise to this moment of manifestation.<br><br>On more note... when you 
                  are at the peak of one mind, you will enter no mind territory where 
                  source, mind, awareness is forgotten and what's left is the world as it 
                  is. But it remains a temporary peak experience until realisation of 
                  anatta arises and results in a change of view and therefore effortless 
                  and seamless experience. What led me to the realisation of anatta is the
                   contemplation on bahiya sutta. <a id="link_1306489876819_7" rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-commentary-on-bahiya-sutta.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2....hiya-sutta.html</a><br><br>In seeing is just the seen, seeing is the scenery...

              <p>It is not enough that we perceive things as not being self.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>The Buddha warned:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of
                                          view arises in him: The view <em>I have a self</em> arises in him
                                          as true &amp; established, or the view <em>I have no self</em>...
                                          or the view <em>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive
                                          self</em>... or the view <em>It is precisely by means of self that
                                          I perceive not-self</em>... or the view <em>It is precisely by
                                          means of not-self that I perceive self</em> arises in him as true
                                          &amp; established, or else he has a view like this: <em>This very
                                          self of mine — the knower that is sensitive here &amp; there to the
                                          ripening of good &amp; bad actions — is the self of mine that is
                                          constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will
                                          stay just as it is for eternity.</em> This is called a thicket of
                                          views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of
                                          views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the
                                          uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging,
                                          &amp; death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp;
                                          despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from suffering &amp;
                                          stress."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All these views of existence and non-existence presumes there is a true self, an 'I', that can be pinned down as a truth or reality... in order to have or not have existence.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it can be that they think they are an ultimate self and observer, such that all things they observe are outside and not them - all things are not-self, and so they reject things they see as not-self while clinging to an ultimate self which is the ultimate observer of things.</p>
              <p>This is what the Buddha calls the false view of "<em>the view <em>It is precisely by means of self that
                                          I perceive not-self</em>.."</em></p>
              <p>Clinging to false views as such, we don't see the nature of reality.</p>
              <p>Seeing the nature of reality, we realize the Emptiness of Self... no self as such can be found, pinned down as a truth or reality inside or outside of the five skandhas. There is no agent, perceiver, doer, controller. This is the teaching of Buddha.</p>

              <p>Ted Biringer:</p>
              <p>A skier mustering whole body-and-mind, totally absorbed in the activity of skiing down a mountain, forgets his or her "self" and is actualized by the myriad dharmas (the many things). With no ideas of self and not self, there is simply <em>swoosh, swoosh, chunk, swoosh, swoosh. </em>There is no "snow" there is <em>whiteness, coldness. </em>There are no "sounds" there is <em>shoo, shoo, tweet, weee! </em>There is no "thinking" there is <em>left, right straight, watch out. </em>In <em>Shobogenzo, Hossho, </em>Dogen gives us a delightful expression of this experience:</p>
              <p>"In the Dharma-nature there is no "non-Buddhist" or "demon," but only "Come for breakfast! Come for lunch! And come for tea!"</p>
              <p>The <em>Genjokoan </em>continues:</p>
              <p>"To be actualized by the many things is to allow the body-and-mind of your self and the body-and-mind of other than your self to fall away."</p>
