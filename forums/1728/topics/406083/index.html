              <p>Minority report ,starred by Tom Cruise to find the murderer even before the action is committed ,can be too far -fetched from the basic concept of intent and action .If a person who is bent on killing another guy ,but suddenly gives up when he remember the consequence and his family will be saddened ,destruction of consciousness seeds will occur .</p>
              <p>Lets understand every intent doesnt necessary lead to action ,wholesome or unwholesome .so the intent to kill can be foretold but the doer may repent and such thing will not happen ,resulted in overturning of the avalanche of karmic energy intended upon the doer .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand , Buddha advised us to repent by the various mantra and Buddha name to avert such calamities befall on us.Even if it should happen .the impact of such actions will be reduced</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>several years ago , there is this Hong Kong Serial about Ji gong that in one part , it say someone who is about to be killed cannot avoid this fate .Even if the murderer does not do this lifetime ,the next lifetime he will try again and again ,until the action is done.</p>
              <p>That is a erroneous view of karma and fatalism idea in the 65 brahmin views during the times of the Buddha ,which have no relevance .Buddha have found that Great Repentance by the Buddha name ,if one follow sincerely generate an Energy of Strength that can reduce the impact of such energy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While about inception which use consciousness to kill ,consciousness is still uncontrolled in the lives of a normal person .It is also impossible such person can harness the energy.</p>
              <p>Meditator have the power to control consciousness to do bad things but they understand that if they do it , their next rebirth is in the Burning hells of Avici</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope this explain the science-fiction story that people is curious on the aspect of Mind killing and Intent actions</p>

              <p><strong>Warning: Spoilers included. Please watch the movie first. This is the best movie I've watched for a very long time - on par or better than The Matrix.</strong></p>
              <p>I like the part of Inception where they talked about how an idea when planted very deeply (similar to what Thusness said - it has to be planted very deeply) into the subconscious will keep manifesting itself in the conscious life.</p>
              <p>This is precisely the importance of the Buddhist teaching of the 8th Consciousness. It applies to karma and habitual tendencies. Even the enlightened beings can't escape this (unless they have reached Arhantship and thus freed from samsaric cycles) - they have to plant the seed of anatta and emptiness so that when they are reborn in next life, the seed will grow and manifest easily. Also, when the seed is deeply penetrated, so deep that it replaces all the dualistic/inherent tendencies lying deep into our subconscious, it will persist throughout all three states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. That means one will experience no-self and emptiness in all three states.</p>
              <p>This also explains why if you keep chanting, one day you will continue chanting even in dreams. It's already placed in the 'safe house' so to speak, and I like how they use the 'safe house' or 'store house' as an analogy in the movie - precisely what the 8th consciousness is called. (I'm referring of course, to Cobb's wife Mal, who Cobb spinned the totem in the safe house so that Mal keeps thinking that the world is unreal even when she wakes up because the totem keeps spinning in her subconscious mind - as an imprinted idea)</p>
              <p>Also, what they said about dreams is very true - in dreams, the people/things you see are a symbolic manifestation of your subconscious psyche (this part our moderator Simpo is an expert on and is able to gather information from dreams very well - though I don't think he can steal your subconscious unless you tell him about your dream contents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif">), and you only know you are dreaming when you wake up on hindsight (well unless you are lucid dreaming).</p>
              <p>p.s. I wonder if people have came to the conclusion that actually the whole movie is a dream from beginning to end (Mal: "Do you think you’re living in reality? Being chased around by anonymous corporations all the time?")</p>
              <p>update: just found a comments online -</p>
              <p><em>A truly excellent piece Devin... Like one of the other posters I have 
                          never been to this site before and found it a wonderful piece of 
                          synchronicity to have come across it only days after my first viewing of
                           Inception. I will be going back for a second and maybe third viewing, 
                          but as of now I am pretty convinced by the “it’s all a dream” argument. I
                           found (as some others did) that Mal’s asking Dom whether he really 
                          believes he is being pursued across the globe (and similar urgings for 
                          him to “wake up” that come from Michael Caine’s character) are like 
                          rational voices trying desperately to intrude into a paranoid 
                          schizophrenic’s delusional mind-set. The whole escape from the failed 
                          extraction, including the approaching rioters (a flood of uncontrollable
                           feelings to be evaded?) and walls that felt like they were closing in 
                          (a classic panic attack?) seem to me to fit that interpretation. Though I
                           am also impressed by your analysis of the movie as a representation of 
                          Nolan’s process of directing a film, it is of less interest to me than a
                           possibly even wider frame – that what Nolan is addressing (with or 
                          without full awareness) is the nature of consciousness and the 
                          construction of reality itself. Key to this interpretation is your point
                           about the meaningfulness of the catharsis that Fischer undergoes in the
                           fortress – that “despite the fact that his father is not there, despite
                           the fact that the pinwheel was never by his father's bedside, the 
                          emotions that Fischer experiences are 100 percent genuine”. It made me 
                          remember a favorite line from one of a series of books of “channeled” 
                          wisdom from the 1970’s, in which “Seth”, the channeled entity, said of 
                          human experience: “It’s not real, but it does matter”. The idea that he 
                          was presenting was that our experiences in this life, though not real in
                           any concrete sense, are an educational process of great importance. 
                          Hindu reincarnational beliefs take a similar tack, and the Buddhist view
                           that “all is Maya” – i.e. illusion – are another part of the same map. 
                          In fact, they say that you can only “get off the wheel of reincarnation”
                           when you fully “wake up” from Maya. So for now I will consider this 
                          film another meditation on that theme; and ponder how “breaking up is 
                          hard to do” (Dom and Mal) is related to “waking up is hard to do”. P.S.:
                           Speaking of paranoid schizophrenia, was that the Cabal corporation that
                           Dom failed and was being hunted by?</em></p>

              <p>Nice comments...</p>
              <p>p.s. notice that Cobb's subconscious stuff like Mal and the train etc is appearing even if he is accessing someone elses dream, which shouldn't be happening (only the dreamer's subconscious should be populating the dream, not anyone elses). This is because after all, the entire thing from start to end is Cobb's dream and not anyone elses.</p>
              <p>Notice also, that the kids appearing at the end of the show (when it is supposed to be the 'woken' state) is still wearing the same clothes as his other dream appearance, and acting the same way... which is extremely unlikely to say the least.</p>
              <p>His wife who puts her totem into a broken wine glass no longer believes in her totem... the totem could be something conceived within the dream and thus may after all be a dream item. She told Cobb to take a 'leap of faith' and asked him whether he truly believes without a doubt that he is living in reality. It is interesting to note that Cobb did not say yes, he simply said that 'you know I couldn't do this'.... because he could not leave behind his children etc (which means he has grown attached to his 'dream children').</p>
              <p>Notice also... when Cobb went to to this den full of people dreaming... and the keeper says that they sleep every day to 'wake up' - their dream has become their reality, looked at Cobb and said 'who are you to say otherwise?' suggesting that Cobb himself is in a similar situation. Cobb sort of freaked out after seeing this (he probably knew intuitively at that moment that he was dreaming afterall), and immediately went to the toilet to spin the totem to convince himself that it was real but was at that moment interrupted by Saito.</p>
              <p>There are many other interesting parts of the movie that totally gave away the impression that the entire thing was a dream....</p>

              <p>wah, well observed :)</p>
              <p>so actually, all the characters, the idea of the totem and the idea of inception are just conceptual ideas the mind of Cobb designed to keep the dream alive. Much like the dualistic habitual tendencies 'creates' the illusion of ego self.</p>
