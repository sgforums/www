            <div class='col-md body'>A Very Happy Vesak Day! Vesak Day is the day where Buddha Shakyamuni was borned unto this Earth. He is the embodiment of Loving Kindness and Compassion, he shared with us his wisdom of Enlightenment and brought liberation and bliss to all sentient beings who were able to receive his dharma.<br><br>It is <strong>2549th year</strong> since Buddha entered Parinirvana. I would like to share with you the meaning and significance of Vesak in these following articles.<br><br>Also hopefully you all can attend a Buddhist monastery/dharma centre and take part and observe these vesak ceremonies for yourself.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>The Significance of Vesak Day</strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Adapted from the book "Be a Lamp Upon Yourself"<br>Kong Meng San Phor Kark See</span><br><br><img src="http://xs29.xs.to/pics/05206/pakistan.JPG"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">above: a Gandhara statue, earliest form of image of Buddha</span><br><br>Vesak Day, which falls on the full moon day of the fifth month of the year, is the most important event for the Buddhist community. It commemorates the Birth, Enlightenment and Final Nirvana of the Buddha.<br><br>For some Buddhists, the observance of Vesak begins early in the morning when they assemble at temples to observe the Eight Precepts. Others may join the communal observance by going through the ceremony of taking the Threefold Refuge (expression through faith and commitment to the Buddha, His teaching and the Holy Community), observing the Five Precepts, making offerings at shrines and by chanting and recitation. They may also participate in processions and circumambulation, and listening to sermons of the Buddha's Teaching.<br><br>In some temples, Buddhists take part in the ceremonial bathing of the statue of baby Prince Siddhartha (before he became the Buddha) A small standing statue of the prince is placed in a basin of perfumed water strewn with flowers. The Buddhists scoop the perfumed water with a ladle and pour it over the statue. This act of bathing symbolises the purification of one's unwholesome actions.<br><br>Many Buddhists also take vegetarian meals on this day as they recall the teaching of universal compassion. The temples are often colourfully decorated with Buddhist flags and lights. The shrines are also filled with flowers, fruits and other offerings.<br><br><strong>Significance of Buddhist Observations</strong><br><br>Buddhism in practice is more than just learning about the life of Buddha and His Teachings. It includes many observances, some of which are common to all Buddhists while others are characteristics of a particular culture or country. The significance of some common observances is as follows:<br><br><strong>Buddhist Shrines and Images</strong><br><br>The Buddha image in the centre of shrine represents and reminds us of the Buddha and the ideal of Buddhahood with its perfect qualities of Wisdom and compassion. It serves to inspire us when we see it as we recall the greatness of the Buddha and His Teaching.<br><br><strong>Folded Palms</strong><br><br>Placing the palms together and raising them to the level of the chest is a traditional gesture to express deep reverence to the triple Gem -the Buddha, His Teaching and the Sangha (followers of his Teaching).<br><br><strong>Bowing</strong><br><br>Prostrating before an image of the Buddha or members of the Sangha is an expression of deep veneration. It also acknowledges that the Buddha has attained the perfect and supreme Enlightenment. Such an act helps the Buddhist to overcome egoistic feelings to become more ready to listen to the Teaching of the Buddha.<br><br><strong>Offerings Making the following shrine</strong><br><br>Offerings expresses appreciation and veneration to the Triple Gem:<br><br>* Light symbolises the brightness of wisdom attained on the path towards Enlightenment which drives away the darkness of ignorance.<br><br>* Fresh and beautiful flowers which soon becomes withered, scentless and discoloured serves as a reminder of the impermanence of all things.<br><br>* Fragrant incense which fills the air symbolises the purifying effect of wholesome conduct.<br><br>* Water symbolises purity, clarity and calmness.<br><br>* Fruit symbolises the ultimate fruit of Enlightenment which is the goal of Buddhists.<br><br><strong>Chanting and recitation</strong><br><br>Verses may be recited in praise of the Triple Gem. Sermons of the Buddha can also be recited. Short phrases or syllables (mantras) that symbolises certain teachings or qualities of the Buddha may also be chanted. Chanting and recitation, like meditation, also helps one to concentrate and develop a calm and peaceful state of mind.<br><br><strong>The 3 step 1 Bow Ceremony</strong><br><br>On this occasion, devotees line up in a procession before sunrise to meditatively circumambulate around the perimeter of the temple- bowing once every three steps while chanting " Homage to the Original Teacher (Founder of Buddhism) Shakyamuni Buddha (Na Mo Ben Shi Shi Jia Mou Ni Fo).<br><br><strong>Prostration</strong><br><br>Upon every prostration, the Buddha can be visualized standing upon one's open palm which symbolise lotuses (that denote purity). Every prostration is thus paying respects to the Buddha or the countless Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of every direction. This practice helps to purify the mind, humble the ego, and lessen obstacles along the spiritual path as one repents past misdeeds of body, speech and mind and aspires towards spiritual improvement. It is also an occasion to express gratitude to the Buddha for His compassion.<br><br>Concentration and calmness achieved as one become constantly mindful of the processes of the body, speech and mind during the practice. Unanswered spiritual questions are sometimes answered as one enters deep concentration and realises the roots of the problems.<br><br><strong>Perseverance</strong><br><br>As the ceremony is lengthy and over undulating land, it reminds one of the long and difficult journeys towards Enlightenment. But it also serves to remind us that as long as one has determination, all difficulties can be overcome. Persistence in completing the journey despite its difficulties also strengthens one's faith in the Buddha and His Teaching to lead us towards Enlightenment.<br><br><strong>Wisdom</strong><br><br>The break of dawn at the end of the ceremony represents the light of wisdom dispelling the darkness of ignorance as one advances on the spiritual path towards Enlightenment. Participating in this special event, among others, on Vesak Day is considered very meritorious. It is extremely difficult to describe the spiritual joy one feels upon completion of the ceremony and is definitely something one has to experience for oneself.<br><br><strong>The night of infinite light</strong><br><br>This practice has similar significance to the 3-step-1-bow Ceremony. Instead of prostration, devotees each hold a lotus-shaped candle to their chest level as they pave around the perimeter of the temple in walking meditation while chanting " Na Mo Ben Shi Shi Jia Mou Ni Fo."<br><br><strong>Wisdom</strong><br><br>The "light passing" ceremony is symbolic of the passing of the light of wisdom to every direction of the world to dispel the darkness of ignorance. It also refers to the offering and sharing of the Truth with others. On a personal level, it has the significance of lighting up one's inner lamp of wisdom. The passing on of the light indefinitely to countless others without one's own flame dying out illustrates the fact that wisdom can be shared indefinitely without any loss on one's part, i.e. only goodness can come from such an act.<br><br><strong>Impermanence</strong><br><br>The burning of the wick and the melting of the candle also serves to remind us of the impermanence and transience of all conditioned things - which include our own bodies and lives. Reflecting so helps us to treasure every moment alive without attachment. The candles also symbolise Bodhisattvas who sacrifice themselves to light up the lives of suffering sentient beings.<br><br><strong>Mindfulness</strong><br><br>As the procession goes on, mindfulness has to be practised to not let the flame be extinguished. This is symbolic of the importance of constantly guarding one's mind against any negative factors detrimental to the spiritual life. It is most inspiring and moving to see a single flame light up to a sea of darkness into countless lamps which bring further brightness to each other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>The Significance of Vesak - Buddha Day</strong></span><br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/vesak.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/vesak.htm</a><br><br>The significance of Vesak lies with the Buddha and his universal peace message to mankind.<br><br>As we recall the Buddha and his Enlightenment, we are immediately reminded of the unique and most profound knowledge and insight which arose in him on the night of his Enlightenment. This coincided with three important events which took place, corresponding to the three watches or periods of the night.<br><br>During the first watch of the night, when his mind was calm, clear and purified, light arose in him, knowledge and insight arose. He saw his previous lives, at first one, then two, three up to five, then multiples of them .. . ten, twenty, thirty to fifty. Then 100, 1000 and so on.... As he went on with his practice, during the second watch of the night, he saw how beings die and are reborn, depending on their Karma, how they disappear and reappear from one form to another, from one plane of existence to another. Then during the final watch of the night, he saw the arising and cessation of all phenomena, mental and physical. He saw how things arose dependent on causes and conditions. This led him to perceive the arising and cessation of suffering and all forms of unsatisfactoriness paving the way for the eradication of all taints of cravings. With the complete cessation of craving, his mind was completely liberated. He attained to Full Enlightenment. The realisation dawned in him together with all psychic powers.<br><br>This wisdom and light that flashed and radiated under the historic Bodhi Tree at Buddha Gaya in the district of Bihar in Northern India, more than 2500 years ago, is of great significance to human destiny. It illuminated the way by which mankind could cross, from a world of superstition, or hatred and fear, to a new world of light, of true love and happiness.<br><br>The heart of the Teachings of the Buddha is contained in the teachings of the Four Noble Truths, namely,<br><br>The Noble Truth of Dukkha or suffering<br>The Origin or Cause of suffering<br>The End or Cessation of suffering<br>the Path which leads to the cessation of all sufferings<br><br>The First Noble Truth is the Truth of Dukkha which has been generally translated as 'suffering'. But the term Dukkha, which represents the Buddha's view of life and the world, has a deeper philosophical meaning. Birth, old age, sickness and death are universal. All beings are subject to this unsatisfactoriness. Separation from beloved ones and pleasant conditions, association with unpleasant persons and conditions, and not getting what one desires - these are also sources of suffering and unsatisfactoriness. The Buddha summarises Dukkha in what is known as the Five Grasping Aggregates.<br><br>Herein, lies the deeper philosophical meaning of Dukkha for it encompasses the whole state of being or existence.<br><br>Our life or the whole process of living is seen as a flux of energy comprising of the Five aggregates, namely the Aggregate of Form or the Physical process, Feeling, Perception, Mental Formation, and Consciousness. These are usually classified as mental and physical processes, which are constantly in a state of flux or change.<br><br>When we train our minds to observe the functioning of mental and physical processes we will realise the true nature of our lives. We will see how it is subject to change and unsatisfactoriness. And as such, there is no real substance or entity or Self which we can cling to as 'I', 'my' or 'mine'.<br><br>When we become aware of the unsatisfactory nature of life, we would naturally want to get out from such a state. It is at this point that we begin to seriously question ourselves about the meaning and purpose of life. This will lead us to seek the Truth with regards to the true nature of existence and the knowledge to overcome unsatisfactoriness.<br><br>From the Buddhist point of view, therefore, the purpose of life is to put an end to suffering and all other forms of unsatisfactoriness - to realise peace and real happiness. Such is the significance of the understanding and the realisation of the First Noble Truth.<br><br>The Second Noble Truth explains the Origin or Cause of suffering. Tanha or craving is the universal cause of suffering. It includes not only desire for sensual pleasures, wealth and power, but also attachment to ideas', views, opinions, concepts, and beliefs. It is the lust for flesh, the lust for continued existence (or eternalism) in the sensual realms of existence, as well as the realms of form and the formless realms. And there is also the lust and craving for non-existence (or nihilism). These are all different Forms of selfishness, desiring things for oneself, even at the expense of others.<br><br>Not realizing the true nature of one's Self, one clings to things which are impermanent, changeable and perishable. The failure to satisfy one's desires through these things; causes disappointment and suffering.<br><br>Craving is a powerful mental force present in all of us. It is the root cause of our sufferings. It is this craving which binds us in Samsara - the repeated cycle of birth and` death.<br><br>The Third Noble Truth points to the cessation of suffering. Where there is no craving, there is no becoming, no rebirth. Where there is no rebirth, there is no decay. no, old age, no death, hence no suffering. That is how suffering is ended, once and for all.<br><br>The Fourth Noble Truth explains the Path or the Way which leads to the cessation of suffering. It is called the Noble Eightfold Path.<br><br>The Noble Eightfold path avoids the extremes of self-indulgence on one hand and self-torture on the other. It consists of Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration.<br><br>These path factors may be summarised into 3 stages of training, involving morality, mental culture and wisdom.<br><br>Morality or good conduct is the avoidance of evil or unwholesome actions -- actions which are tainted by greed, hatred and delusion; and the performance of the good or wholesome actions, - actions which are free from greed, hatred and delusion, but motivated by liberality, loving-kindness and wisdom.<br><br>The function of good conduct or moral restraint is to free one's mind from remorse (or guilty conscience). The mind that is free from remorse (or guilt) is naturally calm and tranquil, and ready for concentration with awareness.<br><br>The concentrated and cultured mind is a contemplative and analytical mind. It is capable of seeing cause and effect, and the true nature of existence, thus paving the way for wisdom and insight.<br><br>Wisdom in the Buddhist context, is the realisation of the fundamental truths of life, basically the Four Noble Truths. The understanding of the Four Noble Truths provide us with a proper sense of purpose and direction in life. They form the basis of problem-solving.<br><br>The message of the Buddha stands today as unaffected by time and the expansion of knowledge as when they were first enunciated.<br><br>No matter to what lengths increased scientific knowledge can extend man's mental horizon, there is room for the acceptance and assimilation for further discovery within -the framework of the teachings of the Buddha.<br><br>The teaching of the Buddha is open to all to see and judge for themselves. The universality of the teachings of the Buddha has led one of the world's greatest scientists, Albert Einstein to declare that 'if there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs, it would be Buddhism'<br><br>The teaching of the Buddha became a great civilising force wherever it went. It appeals to reason and freedom of thought, recognising the dignity and potentiality of the human mind. It calls for equality, fraternity and understanding, exhorting its followers to avoid evil, to do good and to purify their minds.<br><br>Realising the transient nature of life and all worldly phenomena, the Buddha has advised us to work out our deliverance with heedfulness, as 'heedfulness is the path to the deathless'.<br><br>His clear and profound teachings on the cultivation of heedfulness otherwise known as Satipatthana or the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, is the path for the purification of beings - for the overcoming of sorrows and lamentation, for the destruction of all mental and physical sufferings, for the attainment of insight and knowledge and for the realisation of Nibbana. This has been verified by his disciples. It is therefore a path, a technique which may be verified by all irrespective of caste, colour or creed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>- Venerable Mahinda</strong></span><br></div>

Over and above the general importance of the Vesak Full Moon day this year's festival takes on an added meaning. This year's is the first Vesak Full Moon day of the 2000's marking a new era of hope and aspiration for the whole of mankind. Because of the promise it holds, this year's Vesak Full Moon day is undoubtedly outstanding.<br><br>To the Buddhist devotees Vesak Full Moon is the holiest of all the full moon days. This particular full moon is associated with a whole series of events connected with the life of the Supremely Enlightened Buddha and with the progress of the Buddha's Dispensation.<br><br>These sacred events of the Vesak Full Moon season can be classified this way:<br><br>The Buddha's birth as Prince Siddhartha took place on this day at Lumbini in Kapilavatthu (modern Nepal).<br><br>Ascetic Siddhartha Gautama attained Supreme Enlightenment on this day at Buddha Gaya under the sacred Bodhi Tree.<br><br>The Supreme Buddha's Great Demise (Parinibbana) happened on Vesak Full Moon day at Kusinara. In terms of the evolution of the Supremely<br><br>Enlightened One in the course of His migrations in Samsara (Cycle of Rebirths) Vesak Full Moon possesses a tremendous significance.<br><br>The Aspirant Buddha, in His existence as Ascetic Sumedha, received his confirmation of the attainment of Buddhahood from Buddha Dipamkara on a Full Moon day.<br><br>The Supreme Buddha's display of His psychic powers through the performance of Yamaka Maha Patihariya (The Miracle of the Twin Wonders) took place on a Vesak Full Moon day. This event is a crucial turning point in His Dispensation as this convinced numerous skeptics "doubters" - about the Supreme Buddha's Enlightenment.<br><br>In practical terms Vesak is celebrated mainly for the three-fold events in the life of the Buddha - Birth, Enlightenment and the Great Passing Away. In the whole of mankind no one else's birthday has been so regularly and without an interruption, celebrated for over 2,500 years.<br><br>Generally, mankind does not celebrate year after year the spiritual victory won by an outstanding human hero. Even shattering military and political victories are not celebrated by mankind for so long and with such pageantry. These worldly victories tend to get forgotten and neglected with shifting military and political changes. But the celebration of the Buddha's Birth, Enlightenment and His Great Demise (Parinibbana) continues without a break, with ever-increasing vigour.<br><br>To those who do not follow the Buddhist faith, the Birth and Enlightenment of the Buddha is also of the greatest significance when one considers the unique contribution made by the Buddha over 2500 years ago to the various branches of modern knowledge.<br><br>Moreover, one marvels, whether he be a Buddhist or non-Buddhist, at the rational and scientific teachings of Buddhism, which indeed is in keeping with the scientific temper of this modern age. It is no wonder then that the brilliant minds and thinkers of the East and West have bowed their heads in reverence and acknowledged Gotama the Buddha as the greatest man ever born, beyond compare, the greatest combination of heart and mind that ever existed.<br><br>On this hallowed day, our hearts and minds are naturally directed to the Blessed One who through countless aeons strove earnestly and strenuously to gain supreme enlightenment, and proclaim the Dhamma for the benefit of gods and men. His Enlightenment at the Bodhi Tree, at Buddha Gaya, on this of memorable full moon day is of tremendous importance. It is an epoch making event in the annals of history, because He discovered the remedy for the ills of life and death. Moved by deep compassion and boundless love for suffering humanity He proclaimed the Dhamma which is glorious in the beginning, glorious in the middle and glorious in the end, for forty-five years which is unprecedented and unsurpassed by any other religious teacher.<br><br><strong>BUDDHA'S ENLIGHTENMENT</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.buddhamind.info/leftside/arty/requiz/b-lit1.jpg"><br><br>The Buddha's Enlightenment is significant to us mortal beings because the Buddha as a man reached the acme of perfection and the pinnacle wisdom through his own inherent Powers without the aid of any supernatural agency or an omniscient God. This stupendous achievement of the Buddha gives us ordinary men, enmeshed as we are in the storms and tempests of life much encouragement and inspiration in that we ourselves could, if we make the necessary effort attain that glorious state of Buddhahood.<br><br>Among the world's religious teachers the Buddha alone has the glory of having rightly judged the intrinsic greatness of, Man's capacity to work out his own salvation without any extraneous aid. If the worth of a truly great man consists in his raising the worth of all mankind, who is better entitled to be called truly great, than the Blessed One, who instead of degrading man by placing another being over him, has exalted him to the highest pinnacle of wisdom and love.<br><br>Therefore the Teachings of the Buddha holds out hope for the modem man, who is sunk in the mire and morass of drab materialism, by offering a path which leads to spiritual illumination and ultimate deliverance from physical and mental bondage. The Buddha was inviting man to move out of the entanglements of mental and spiritual slavery into the rarefied spiritual atmosphere of peace and perfection, which has been reserved for a specially graced person by other religions. In doing so, he has paid the highest tribute and singular honour to man.</div>

It is usually celebrated in May and is also known as Buddha Day. It is particularly strong in the Theravadin tradition in countries such as Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand. In such places temples will be adorned with lanterns, light symbolizing the Buddha's enlightenment, and lay followers will involve themselves in acts of generosity, meditation and observing extra precepts. Besides these opportunities for extra devotion, what significance does Vesak have?<br><br><strong>A Special Human Being</strong><br><br>First it celebrates the birth of a unique and very special human being. The Buddha was born into a life of privilege and pleasure, surrounded by all that one could wish for in a material sense. Although his mother died soon after he was born, there seems little doubt that he was loved and cherished by his family. His father hoped that one day his son was succeed him as the head of his people. As he grew up, he experienced much that - on the face of it - should make one happy.  But despite all this, there was something gnawing away at him, a sense that all these natural pleasures could not last and would one day vanish. He saw himself, his father, his wife, his child and, indeed, all mankind, subject to the vicissitudes of life - old age, sickness and death. His sense of desolation in the face of this awareness must have been acute. Why else would he have been prepared to leave it all behind?<br><br><strong>Enlightenment</strong><br><br>Second, it celebrates the Buddha's awakening. After six years of hardship and continual striving the Buddha finally gained enlightenment. The profundity of this experience left him in no doubt that he had achieved final knowledge, that there was something beyond the cycle of old age, sickness and death, that there was an end to suffering. As he sat meditating under the Bodhi tree, he realized that he had been reborn many times; that all beings were reborn according to their deeds; that suffering was fueled by craving and that there was a means of bringing this suffering to an end. What comes through in the scriptures is the Buddha's absolute certainty that he had attained ultimate realization and that he knew the precise means by which others could attain it too. The Buddha's enlightenment experience, therefore, is a beacon of hope - enlightenment is possible and you don't have to be superhuman or a god to walk the path that leads to it.<br><br><strong>Parinibbana</strong><br><br>Third, it celebrates the Buddha's final passing into nibbana (referred to as his parinibbana). The Buddha died. But as he lay dying, there was no miraculous transformation, no magical ascension into heaven, no inexplicable escape. His death was ordinary - possibly from food poisoning. He died, just as all people must die. This was what he taught. In other ways his death was extraordinary as it was at this point he was freed from the circle of life and death, freed from suffering, totally liberated in nibbana. His final words were simple and direct: 'All things are impermanent - strive on with diligence'.<br><br>Buddha Day, therefore, is a day to remind oneself of the Buddha's example, of what is possible and what it is that is worth striving for! It is a day for focusing the mind on just what a remarkable individual the Buddha was, and what an amazing example he gave to the world of what it means to be a complete human being.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">Life of the Buddha</span></span></strong><br><br>A Brief History: Life of the Buddha<br>1 of 1<br>The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche<br>Excerpted from the transcript of a public talk on Buddhism (New Brunswick, Canada 1999)<br><br><img src="http://www.nalandabodhi.org/BuddhaBorobordur.jpg"><br><br>More than twenty-five hundred years ago, in ancient India, a very inquisitive young prince began to explore his world. He explored the environment of his lifestyle within the royal palace, as well as the different walks of life outside. His father, the King, had a great fear of his son discovering the true nature of life, which from the Buddhist point of view, is full of suffering, pain, and struggle. It was said that if the young Prince discovered this, he might renounce his princehood and become a saint, a practitioner of the spiritual path. Therefore, the King tried his best to prevent his son, the Prince, from seeing the true nature of the world. Consequently, he offered the Prince everything he wanted. The King did everything in his power to prevent the Prince from seeing the true nature of life.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Recognizing The Nature Of Life</span></strong><br><br>However, one day, the Prince looked out of his window, and he accidentally saw several things. First, he saw a very old person. Next, he saw a very ill person. Finally, he saw a corpse being carried to a funeral. Afterwards, the Prince asked his friends in the palace about what he had seen. The prince then thought to himself that the nature of life is such that: you are born, you grow up, you get old, and young or old, you sometimes you get sick, which leads to death. That is the nature of life. The prince then asked, "How can we prevent these sufferings of sickness, old age and death?"<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Seeking Freedom From Suffering</span></strong><br><br>The Prince found that there is only one way to overcome this suffering, which is to discover the true path of spirituality. Therefore, he renounced his life as a prince and ran away from the palace. This is a very important part of the Buddhist teachings: that he was born a prince and later ran away, renouncing his palace. He ran away from his palace as we sometimes run away from our house. However, we go back home, but the Prince never returned. He went away for many, many years. He went into the jungles, somewhere in the northeastern part of ancient India. There, he found many Hindu practitioners, followers of the ascetic path of Hinduism, and he practiced with them for many years.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">The Middle Way</span></strong><br><br>After a time, he discovered that undertaking the religious trip of asceticism was not the way to overcome our pain, our suffering and causes of suffering. At that point, he renounced the path of asceticism. In other words, he renounced the path of religious fanaticism. Now, we can see what he was going through. First, he renounced ordinary life and entered the path of asceticism. Next, he renounced the ascetic path or the trip of being a religious fanatic. Then, where did he go from there? He found the "middle way," the path that does not fall into either of the "two extremes" of completely trusting and believing in the religious path of asceticism, or of totally ignoring our pain, our suffering and causes of suffering, which we try to deny. Twenty-five hundred years ago, we did that and the tradition of shielding ourselves from our pain still continues today. In fact, we are finding better ways today to ignore our pain. We have a highly developed medical science and other resources through which we can totally deny our pain.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Complete Awakening</span></strong><br><br>Through having found the middle way devoid of these two extremes, the Prince achieved the spiritual insight, the spiritual realization, which is called "complete awakening," true awakening. That awakening is like waking from a dream state. When we are sleeping, and we dream, we have a variety of experiences; we might have the beautiful experience of hiking a high Himalayan mountain. We are on top of a high mountain, seeing a beautiful view from the peak of the mountain, even the clouds are  in the dream. There are such beautiful experiences in our life. At the same time, we could have a dream in which we are being chased eternally by a poisonous snake, like an anaconda. We could have that kind of nightmare going on and on and on, but not being able to wake up. Being in that state of dreaming and not recognizing that we are dreaming is what the Buddha called "samsara," the confused state. Whereas, when we wake up from that, it is called "enlightenment" or "buddhahood." We become buddhas, awakened ones, fully awakened ones.<br><br>When the Prince achieved the state of the inner awakening, in the northeastern part of India, in a place called Bodhgaya, in his last stage of practice on the spiritual path, he was sitting under a beautiful tree called a "bodhi" tree. "Bodhi" means "awake" in Sanskrit; therefore, bodhi tree means something like "awake tree." The prince was sitting under that tree on a cushion of kusha grass. He was peacefully resting his mind, exploring further and further the nature of mind, the nature of suffering, the pain that he was going through in his mind, and the calmness that he was experiencing through his meditative spiritual journey. Then, finally, one day under that tree in the early morning (Rinpoche snaps his fingers), he just clicked in. He just (snaps fingers) awakened in that click, all the way; finally, (snaps fingers) he clicked in and that was the experience of enlightenment, awakening.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Teaching</span></strong><br><br>The Buddha shared his experience of the path, the spiritual journey. He shared his experiences of realization, of spiritual insight into the nature of mind. In one of his earliest discourses, the Buddha addressed his audience of monks and lay people and said, "You should examine my teachings thoroughly. Like a gold merchant looking to acquire pure gold, you should thoroughly go through the process of analyzing these teachings." Buddha said that a substance could be examined to see if it were pure gold by first striking it, then cutting it, then rubbing it with different cloths. Through this testing, it is possible find out if a substance is pure gold or fake gold. In a similar way, Buddha said, "It is extremely important for you to analyze and examine my teachings, and then, in the end, you can decide whether to adopt them. If there is any wisdom, you can adopt it. If there is nothing, just leave it. You do not have to accept these teachings." Buddha said, "Do not accept my teachings because they are taught by a King, or a Prince. Do not accept them because they are taught by someone called "Buddha." However, accept them if they are logical, if they are reasonable, if there is wisdom in them, and if there is some benefit."</div>
