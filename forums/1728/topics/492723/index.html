              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Shaila Catherine
              on how a balanced attitude can afford true happiness.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Neither<strong> </strong>the
              coarse feeling of unpleasantness nor the agitated feeling of pleasure,
              equanimity, the Buddha said, is one of the highest kinds of happiness, beyond
              compare with mere pleasant feelings. Superior to delight and joy, true
              equanimity remains undisturbed as events change from hot to cold, from bitter
              to sweet, from easy to difficult. This neutral feeling is so subtle that it can
              be difficult to discern.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Equanimity is
              steady through vicissitudes, equally close to the things you may like and the
              things you do not like. Observe when the tendency to move away from what you do
              not like ends and the tendency to hold on to what you like is also absent.
              Personal preference no longer dictates the direction of attention. Equanimity
              contains the complete willingness to behold the pleasant and the painful events
              of life equally. It points to a deep balance in which you are not pushed and
              pulled between the coercive energies of desire and aversion. Equanimity has the
              capacity to embrace extremes without getting thrown off balance. Equanimity takes
              interest in whatever is occurring simply because it is occurring. Equanimity
              does not include the aversive states of indifference, boredom, coldness, or
              hesitation. It is an expression of calm, radiant balance that takes whatever
              comes in stride.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The taste of a
              favorite meal, perhaps eggplant Parmesan, may be exquisitely clear: the
              sweetness of cooked tomatoes, the aroma of basil, the soft texture of the
              eggplant that melts on the tongue, the saltiness of the Parmesan cheese. Each
              taste may be discerned with acute precision and clarity. They are also enjoyed
              as a unique blend and appreciated for their combined qualities. When equanimity
              is dominant, the experience of craving another morsel is absent. The eggplant
              Parmesan will instead be fully experienced with equanimity rather than delight.
              For many people such balance around taste would be a unique moment.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Some of my
              beginning students have told me, “But I don’t want that kind of happiness. I
              enjoy the <em>gusto</em> of delight. I relish a passionate involvement with my
              life. I love the excitement of experience.” I understand. As a concept,
              equanimity may appear unappealing, but students nonetheless discover, quite to
              their surprise, that the exquisite peace of balanced states has a taste of
              happiness beyond pleasure and beyond pain. Every experience of liking something
              has as its counterpart disliking something else. The fickleness of personal
              preference agitates consciousness. The deeply balanced state of equanimity
              makes a sustained investigation of things possible. Out of this combination of
              concentrated stability, penetrative investigation, and mindful awareness,
              consciousness may awaken the unshakable nature of happiness.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Spiritual
              practitioners thrive in unpredictable conditions, testing and refining the
              inner qualities of heart and mind. Every situation becomes an opportunity to
              abandon judgment and opinions and to simply give complete attention to what is.
              Situations of inconvenience are terrific areas to discover, test, or develop
              your equanimity. How gracefully can you compromise in a negotiation? Does your
              mind remain balanced when you have to drive around the block three times to
              find a parking space? Are you at ease waiting for a flight that is six hours
              delayed? These inconveniences are opportunities to develop equanimity. Rather
              than shift the blame onto an institution, system, or person, one can develop
              the capacity to opt to rest within the experience of inconvenience.</span></p>

              <p>The above experience is quite generic. Probably revisit the below argument for much breakdown details</p>
              <p><br style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: medium; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">The Buddha said, "You say it is in the middle. That middle must not be haphazard or without a fixed location. Where is this middle that you propose? Is it in an external place, or is it in the body? If it were in the body, the surface of the body cannot be counted as being the middle. If it were in the middle of the body, that would be the same as being inside. If it were in an external place, would there be some evidence of it, or not? If there would not be any evidence of it, that amounts to it not existing at all. If there were some evidence of it, then it would have no fixed location. Why not? Suppose that middle were indicated by a marker. When seen from the east, it would be to the west, and when seen from the south, it would be to the north. Just as such a tangible marker would be unclear, so too the location of the mind would be chaotic." </span><br style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><br style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: medium; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">Ananda said, "The middle I speak of is neither one of those. As Bhagavan has said, the eyes and forms are the conditions which create the eye-consciousness. The eyes make discriminations; forms have no perception, but a consciousness is created between them: that is where my mind is." </span><br style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><br style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: medium; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">The Buddha said, "If your mind were between the eyes and their object, would such a mind's substance combine with the two or not? If it did combine with the two, then objects and the mind-substance would form a chaotic mixture. Since objects have no perception, while the substance has perception, the two would stand in opposition. Where could the middle be? If it did not combine with the two, it would then be neither the perceiver nor the perceived. Since it would lack both substance and nature, what would such a middle be like? Therefore you should know that declaring the mind to be in the middle is an impossible statement." </span><br style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><br style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: medium; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">Ananda said to the Buddha, "Bhagavan, when I have seen the Buddha turn the Dharma Wheel in the past with Mahamaudgalyayana, Subhuti, Purna, and Shariputra, four of the great disciples, he often said that the nature of the mind which is aware, perceives, and makes discriminations is located neither within nor outside nor in the middle; it is not located anywhere at all. That very non-attachment to everything is what is called the mind. Therefore, is my non-attachment my mind?" </span><br style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><br style="font-family: -webkit-standard; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: medium; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">The Buddha said to Ananda, "You say that the mind with its aware nature that perceives and makes discriminations is not located anywhere at all. Everything existing in the world consists of space, the waters, and the land, the creatures that fly and walk, and all external objects. Would your non-attachment also exist? If it did not exist, it would be the same as fur on a tortoise or horns on a rabbit. Just what would that non-attachment be? If non-attachment did exist, it couldn't be described as a negation. The absence of attributes indicates negation. Anything not negated has attributes. Anything with attributes exists. How could that define non-attachment? Therefore you should know that to declare that the aware, knowing mind is non-attachment to anything is an impossible statement." </span></p>

              <p>I think you missed the point by referring to the context of mind as in object and sense consciousness. This(your reply) is a good subject for contemplation, no doubt. However, you have missed the context which poster is trying to convey.</p>
              <p>Interestingly,I am surprised that you do not recognise the mind state and what of the experience.</p>

              <p>Allow me my opinion:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To attain a jhanic state in Buddhism simply means in a concentrated state of mind which leads to " which lead to "state of perfect equanimity and awareness (upekkhii-sati-piirisuddhl)."</p>
              <p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DhyÄ�na_in_Buddhism</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ones must also be free of the five hindrances " namely:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.Sensory desire (kÄ�macchanda): the particular type of wanting that seeks for happiness through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and physical feeling.</p>
              <p>2.Ill-will (vyÄ�pÄ�da; also spelled byÄ�pÄ�da): all kinds of thought related to wanting to reject, feelings of hostility, resentment, hatred and bitterness.</p>
              <p>3.Sloth-torpor (thÄ«na-middha): heaviness of body and dullness of mind which drag one down into disabling inertia and thick depression.</p>
              <p>4.Restlessness-worry (uddhacca-kukkucca): the inability to calm the mind.</p>
              <p>5.Doubt (vicikicchÄ�): lack of conviction or trust.</p>
              <p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_hindrances</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of the time we assume jhanas are attained within the context of sitting meditation in solitary cultivation. There also a tendency to separate shamantha(concentration) and vipasanna(awareness or insight) training as if they are two different things. </p>
              <p>They are simply two aspects attainable by our mind, with one common denominator, focus. Difference is the degree of focus of our consciousness. Focus of mindfulness deepens also means concentration deepens. </p>
              <p>Difference lies in the situations in which we apply our focus.</p>
              <p>We engage our sense consciousness, in the instance the of this article, we refer sense of taste, not solely true as when we eat, eg. put in the morsel in our mouth, as the bottom process will show.</p>
              <p>Before eating we see the food first before we pick it up(with fork, for example). We engage our eye consciousness.</p>
              <p>Then put it through our lips into our mouths and chew, sense that touch is engaged. We sense the texture within our mouths.</p>
              <p>As the the aroma is released as we chew, sense taste and smell come to us.</p>
              <p>Back to the article:-</p>
              <p>Very often we crave the emotional and mental craving of our experiences and tend to relate to gross or stronger and coarser sensations. We have expectations in our cravings of our sense, including and especially our mind consciousness.</p>
              <p>That's why we swing between attraction and aversion, we are not happy nor content.</p>
              <p>What this article is telling us fundamentally about the Four Noble Truths, our unsatisfactory state of being.</p>
              <p>It encourages us by being mindful of our mind,  ever vigilant.</p>
