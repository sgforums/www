              <p>Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche explains the importance of the yidam:</p>
              <dl><dd>When we consider all the great masters of the Indian and Tibetan traditions, we find that in every case, their accomplishment came about through their practice of a yidam. They chose a deity and guarded that practice like their very life force, and on the basis of that complete commitment to the path of deity yoga, they practised the stage of generation, the stage of completion, and integrated these arriving at their final realisation of complete accomplishment and enlightenment. </dd></dl><dl><dd>But nowadays there are people who say, “Oh, what a lot of bother! Deities and mantra, I hate all that. I’m just going to meditate.” And they sit there, and close their eyes, and that’s what they call practice. They say, “I just want to do effortless meditation.” But as Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche said, “Although there are people like that, I’ve not seen them gaining any sign of attainment.” </dd></dl><dl><dd>In one of the texts of Ratna Lingpa’s cycle of Vajrakilaya practice, there is a passage which recounts how on one occasion Yeshe Tsogyal asked Guru Rinpoche about the nature of kyérim practice. “Do we really need a yidam deity?”, she questioned. Guru Rinpoche replied, “If there is no yidam, where is the source of siddhis? Without siddhi, how could there be enlightenment?” </dd></dl><dl><dd>In fact, if we look at the great masters of the Indian and Tibetan traditions of Vajrayana practice, we find there is no-one who did not meditate upon a yidam deity. </dd></dl><dl><dd>In the Nyingmapa school, all the great vidyadharas have had a main yidam deity which they practised. If their practice was of a peaceful deity, it was almost always Vajrasattva. If it was a wrathful deity, it was almost always Vajrakilaya. Guru Rinpoche and Vimalamitra themselves attested to the fact that Vajrakilaya was their yidam deity. </dd></dl><dl><dd>Nowadays however, the Nyingmapas are perhaps the worst when it comes to practising a yidam on a daily basis. When Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö was giving the Rinchen Terdzö empowerment, he scolded us as Nyingmapa practitioners and said, “You Nyingmapas don’t do any kind of regular daily practice. You don’t even say the Sampa Lhundrupma prayer; you just lie around all day! We Sakyapas must do the path empowerment practice of Hevajra every day , which takes about two or three hours. You don’t do anything. You just lie around. You don’t do any kind of regular practice.” </dd></dl><dl><dd>He said to us, “If you want yidam deities, you Nyingmapas have more than anybody.” He showed us all the texts of the Rinchen Terdzö, which consists of dozens and dozens of volumes, and said, “This is filled with sadhanas of the three roots—lama, yidam and dakini—but none of you practises any of them.” </dd></dl><dl><dd>What he said was true. Perhaps the reason is that so many of us in the Nyingma tradition place great emphasis on the Dzogchen tradition and its effortlessness. Often we make the mistake of just paying lip service to effortlessness, while really just being kind of lazy. </dd></dl><dl><dd>Look at someone like Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. No-one would question that his realisation was higher than anyone’s, and yet day and night he would recite prayers and mantras and do his practice. And he was inseparable from Vimalamitra! Look at the kind of effort that he put into his practice. Then there are others who just don’t do very much of that at all. They just sit there with their mouths open. </dd></dl><dl><dd>On one occasion, I asked Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, “Is it necessary for someone with realization to recite prayers and mantras?” And he replied, “Someone who has that kind of realisation is like space. What harm could recitation possibly do to space?”And he continued, “To recite even a single mani mantra, or to recite the Vajra Guru mantra a few times, is only going to help. It’s not going to hurt, is it?” </dd></dl></div>

              <p>In Dzogchen, those who do not recognise the Master's introduction of Mind will not be able to do effortless meditation, or resting in recognition of the View. I mean if the View is not even glimpsed in the first place, how to rest in the View?</p>
              <p>In such cases, one has to do the two Dzogchen ngondros. So Loppon Namdrol states:</p>
              <p><em class="bbc"><br> 'Dzogchen is always non-gradual: for example, if the student does not 
              "get it", as a reuslt of receiving direct introduction he or she can use
               the methods of semzin and <span class="searchlite">rushan</span> which 
              are "self-introductions."<br> <br> N'</em><br> <br> <br> <em class="bbc">...This is not correct-- once you have given people 
              direct introduction, they also receive to things-- authorization to 
              practice guru yoga, for "blessings" and to engage in the preliminary 
              practices for tregchod, <span class="searchlite">rushan</span> and 
              semzin.<br> <br> <span class="searchlite">Rushan</span> and semzin are methods used to 
              discover on one's own the knowledge introduced in the direct 
              introduction.<br> <br> Of course, I always think is it better than people have grounding in 
              Abhidharma before they practice anything-- but that is in an ideal 
              world...<br> <br> <br> ...<span class="searchlite">Rushan</span> and Semzin are used to find 
              the gdangs of one's rigpa after direct introduction if one did not 
              recognize it at that time or to renew one's acquaintance with it, if you
               will...</em><br> <br> - Namdrol<br> <br></p>
              <p>As for Yidams: depending on which teacher you follow, some Dzogchen teacher may not require you to do that, but Yidams are very common Vajrayana practice so it is not uncommon for Vajrayana practitioners to have some kind of Yidam practice.</p>

              <td>Emaho is the shortest Dzogchen teaching. It means wondrous, Amazing!
                  Dzogchen masters always say it. The word expresses a tremendous sense of
                  joy and wonder. Love of life in all its forms is a by-product of 
                  spiritual
                  development. Let's not forget that joy is an important ingredient in a
                  meditation practice. The aspiration for enlightenment can be happily 
                  balanced
                  with appreciation of just where we are.
              <p><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080430234538/http://fortunecity.com/westwood/carving/417/medstar.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="95"></p>
              <p>     People often ask how Dzogchen differs from
                  concentration or insight meditation. As we learn to meditate, we 
                  typically
                  go through three distinct stages. The first stage of concentration 
                  meditation
                  initially implies real effort as we learn to hold our attention on an 
                  object
                  of meditation.</p>
              <p>     In the second stage, we have trained the mind;
                  we are able to hold a concentrated state for longer periods of time. Our
                  directed attention stays wherever we place it.</p>
              <p>     In the third and final stage, we have really
                  mastered the art of focused attention. In this stage we are able to 
                  relax,
                  yet we remain almost effortlessly concentrated and undistracted. The 
                  weighty
                  gravity of our heightened awareness keeps us centered. Our attnetion 
                  remains
                  nautrally in place, like a calm and reflective clear lake when no winds
                  or undercurrents move it.</p>
              <p>     Concentration practice is extremely helpful
                  as a foundation for the more advanced, deeper, broader, and more 
                  inclusive
                  awareness and discriminating insight practices such as the advanced 
                  forms
                  of Vipasssana, Zen, and Dzogchen. Concentration techniques help us to 
                  get
                  where we are going.</p>
              <p>     However, concentrated states of mind are put
                  together, fabricated, built-up through intensive, continuous, 
                  one-pointed
                  focusing practices. Whatever is put together inevitably falls apart. 
                  Like
                  muscle tone, concentration disappears when it isn't used. However, the
                  insight, wisdom, and understanding we can realize through meditation 
                  training
                  does stay with us. This greater perspective becomes part of us.</p>

              <td>     Part of the unique preliminary practice for
                  Dzogchen is called rushen. It includes analytical contemplations that 
                  emply
                  the rational powers of the mind; in these contemplations we use the 
                  well-honed,
                  focused mind like a sharp tool to penetrate further into reality. This
                  special self-inquiry helps us recognize the essential nature of mind.
              <p>     The word rushen literally means " discerning
                  the difference between" --traditional images are separating the wheat 
                  from
                  teh chaff or a kernel from its husk. We use the practice of rushen to 
                  distinguish
                  between the dualisms that confront and confuse us; between samsara and
                  nirvana, between bondage and freedom, between small mind and Big Mind,
                  or Buddha-mind; between finite and conceptual mind and infinite 
                  awareness;
                  between finite self and our true Buddha-nature.</p>
              <p>     Now let's use the self-inquiry part of rushen
                  practice. Let's penetrate further into heart and soul, and perceive the
                  essential nature of mind. We can use investigative self-inquiry to 
                  unmaske
                  ouselves and deconstrct the illusory prison that ego built, thus gaining
                  insight and the wisdom of awareness.</p>
              <p>     Exploring the age-old question "Who am I?"
                  is an open-ended inquiry that takes us beyond thoughts and mere 
                  concepts.
                  This is one of the very best pracitces to help you get to know your true
                  nature, beyond your illusory conventional self. Recognizing our natural
                  mind, Buddha-nature, helps us live freely in the present moment, without
                  preconceptions about what we'll get out of it. Let's discern  the
                  difference between the ego, which strategizes and manipulates, and the
                  spontaneous natural heart-mind. The heart and mind are beautiful in 
                  their
                  natural state. We can afford to leave them alone. The better we come to
                  know and accept ourselves, the more at home and profoundly at peace we
                  can be, wherever we are. Whoever we may be.</p>

              <p>     Does the mind have a particular shape or form? 
                  A color? A size or weight? Is it always the same or simply a stream of
                  consciousness, a collection of various mind-moments and mental 
                  events--like
                  the ever changing weather, dependent on fluctuating circumstances and 
                  conditions?
                  Do I have one mine, several, or many? Is it separate from the mind of 
                  another
                  being and of all others--or is it connected? Is it perhaps part of 
                  universal
                  cosmic consciousness?</p>
              <p>     In a moemnt of no thought, how is it, and what
                  is it? When one dies, where does it go? Can you tell me? Can you say? 
                  Where
                  do your thoughts come from? Where do they go when they pass on? Where 
                  does
                  thinking stem from? Try to say something about this. the effort could be
                  extremely revealing. Your could have a close encounter with yourself. 
                  Who
                  is thinking, hearing, seeing, wondering?  Who am I? What am I? What
                  is happening right now, this immediate instant?</p>
              <p>     Turn the mind back upon itself with this laserlike
                  question:
                  <br>Who is experiencing your experience right now? And then let go of 
                  thinking.
                  See what comes up. Sense directly.

              <tr>
              <td>     Dzogchen meditations often empahsize nature
                  - the awesome mystery and splendor of it all. Mother Nature is like a 
                  great
                  goddess. In the Diamond Skydancer Tantra, the Great Kakini says, "The 
                  whole
                  universe is my body, all sentient beings my soul, my heart-mind." The 
                  salient
                  principle in this meditation is merging into five elements of nature 
                  --water,
                  earth, fire, air, and space. This helps us return to our natural, innate
                  Buddha-mind.
              <p>      Let's meditate, let's contemplate; let's
                  unify ourselves with these elements. The element of water with its 
                  cooling
                  nature and natural flow is a good way to begin.</p>
              <p>     We can practice this meditation by the ocean,
                  a laker, a river, or a pond. We can even p ractice this meditation while
                  washing the dishes. The sound of water could be the tranquil lapping of
                  waves against a dock, the dripping of a faucet in a kitchen sink, the 
                  melodic
                  flowing  of the water in an aquarium, a waterfall, or the thundering
                  surf. The vision of water may range from a shimmering puddle to the 
                  Pacific
                  Ocean. Water is water. The natrual element is the same.</p>
              <p>     Merging and dissolving the natrual elements
                  helps us to go beyond ourselves. We enter into the dimension of that 
                  element,
                  unifying ourselves and the universe. In this way we transcend our 
                  separate
                  selves and realize our primordial nature.</p>

              <br> 
              <p>     Listen to the "white sound" of water. Enter
                  into the contemplative space, the flow, the reflectiveness of water. 
                  Concentrate
                  on the sound of water. Let it wash everything else away. Just focus on
                  listening to the sound. Dzogchen meditation calls for the senses to be
                  left in their natrual state. And the state is Natrual Great Perfection,
                  Dzogchen. Let the sound of the water wash over you, wash through you. 
                  Leave
                  your senses open, sensitive, and receptive. Enter the resonant spiritual
                  dimension of pure sound.</p>
              <p>     Open your eyes. Look at the water. Let all
                  thoughts fall into the water and dissolve into the lake of your mind, 
                  like
                  snowflakes settling and dissolving in the ocean. All waves of thought 
                  and
                  feeling, and emotion and energy, gradually slow down and dissolve, like
                  gentle ripples in a stream or in the placid sea of natrual awareness. 
                  The
                  ocean's waves come and go; watch them until you forget yourself and 
                  become
                  one with the waves.</p>
              <p>     Contemplating the waves - just listening -
                  let everything else be washed away. Enter into non-dual dimension of 
                  just
                  being. Be that sound, flow with the water. Relax into the natural state
                  of the water element as if worshipping the spirit of nature or the deity
                  of water. All of the elements are like embodied deities. Attend to them.
                  Rest in their shrines. Be one with them. Enter into that sacred 
                  dimension
                  right now.</p>
