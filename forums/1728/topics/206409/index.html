            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">(A Discourse delivered to the assembly of Western Monks, Novices and Lay-disciples at Bung Wai Forest Monastery, Ubon)</span> </strong><br><br>A confused body and mind means a confused person and a peaceful body and mind, a peaceful person.Actually, the mind, like rain water, is pure in its natural state. If we were to drop green coloring into clear rain water, however, it would turn green. If yellow coloring it would turn yellow.<br><br>The mind reacts similarly. When a comfortable mental impression 'drops' into the mind, the mind is comfortable. When the mental impression is uncomfortable, the mind is uncomfortable. The mind becomes 'cloudy' just like the colored water.<br><br>When clear water contacts yellow, it turns yellow. When it contacts green, it turns green. It will change color every time. Actually, that water which is green or yellow is naturally clean and clear. This is also the natural state of the mind, clean and pure and unconfused. It becomes confused only because it pursues mental impressions; it gets lost in its moods!<br><br>Let me explain more clearly. Right now we are sitting in a peaceful forest. Here, if there's no wind, a leaf remains still. When a wind blows it flaps and flutters. The mind is similar to that leaf. When it contacts a mental impression, it, too, 'flaps and flutters' according to the nature of that mental impression. <strong>And the less we know of Dhamma, the more the mind will continually pursue mental impressions. Feeling happy, it succumbs to happiness. Feeling suffering, it succumbs to suffering. It's constant confusion!</strong><br><br>In the end people become neurotic. Why? Because they don't know! <strong>They just follow their moods and don't know how to look after their own minds</strong>. When the mind has no one to look after it, it's like a child without a mother or father to take care of him. An orphan has no refuge and, without a refuge, he's very insecure.<br><br>Likewise, if the mind is not looked after, if there is no training or maturation of character with right understanding, it's really troublesome.<br><br>One of the  method of training the mind is Kammathana. "Kamma" means 'action' and "thana" means 'base'. In Buddhism it is the method of making the mind peaceful and tranquil. It's for you to use in training the mind and with the trained mind investigate the body.<br><br>Our being is composed of two parts: one is the body, the other, the mind. There are only these two parts. What is called "the body", is that which can be seen with our physical eyes. "The mind", on the other hand, has no physical aspect. The mind can only be seen with the 'internal eye' or the 'eye of the mind'. These two things, body and mind, are in a constant state of turmoil.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is the mind? The mind isn't really and 'thing'. Conventionally speaking, it's that which feels or senses. That which senses, receives and experiences all mental impressions is called "mind". Right at this moment there is mind. As I am speaking to you, the mind acknowledges what I am saying. Sounds enter through the ear and you know what is being said. That which experiences this is called "mind".<br><br>This mind doesn't have any self or substance. It doesn't have any form. It just experiences mental activities, that's all! If we teach this mind to have right view, this mind won't have any problems. It will be at ease.<br><br>The mind is mind. Mental objects are mental objects. Mental objects are not the mind, the mind is not mental objects. In order to clearly understand our minds and the mental objects in our minds, we say that the mind is that which receives the mental objects which pop into it.<br><br>When these two things, mind and its object, come into contact with each other, they give rise to feelings. Some are good, some bad, some cold, some hot, all kinds! Without wisdom to deal with these feelings, however, the mind will be troubled.<br><br><img src="http://www.brainconnection.com/med/edimg/l/measure-mind.jpg"></div>

Within itself it's already peaceful. <strong>That the mind is not peaceful these days is because it follows moods.</strong> The real mind doesn't have anything to it, it is simply (an aspect of) Nature. It becomes peaceful or agitated because moods deceive it. <strong>The untrained mind is stupid. Sense impressions come and trick it into happiness, suffering, gladness and sorrow, but the mind's true nature is none of those things. That gladness or sadness is not the mind, but only a mood coming to deceive us. The untrained mind gets lost and follows these things, it forgets itself.</strong> Then we think that it is we who are upset or at ease or whatever.<br><br>But really this mind of ours is already unmoving and peaceful... really peaceful! Just like a leaf which is still as long as no wind blows. If a wind comes up the leaf flutters. The fluttering is due to the wind -- the 'fluttering' is due to those sense impressions; the mind follows them. If it doesn't follow them, it doesn't 'flutter.' If we know fully the true nature of sense impressions we will be unmoved.<br><br><strong>Our practice is simply to see the Original Mind.</strong> So we must train the mind to know those sense impressions, and not get lost in them. <strong>To make it peaceful. </strong>Just this is the aim of all this difficult practice we put ourselves through." </span><br><br><span class="large">-- Venerable Ajahn Chah (Pra Bhodinyana Thera)</span></div>
