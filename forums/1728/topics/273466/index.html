            <div class='col-md body'>I remember the PM once mentioned to the Straits Times abt going to the church on the advice of some of the cabinate members yrs back when he first suffered cancer. But after going through many life incidents, he said that he has come to accept the theory of Karma as well. That report was abt the time he was newly appointed as the PM. I think can check out the newspaper in the library.<br><br>As for MM, I also remember a report in the ST where the MM was asked by a foreign papers on his religion. He replied that he doesn't have any, but follows some simple chinese traditional  practices. But when pressed for a preference, he stressed that he cannot or will not  accept the belief of one Almighty Creator God; but he is more inclined towards the theory of Buddhism. Sorry I cannot recall which year was this report ( 2 yrs ago?), but I guess interested parties can check it out in the library as well.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I remember ( again) a report in the ST that SM's twin children became christain during their JC years on the advice( again) of a minister in his cabinet. His wife may be a Buddhist, I think; cos she was seen in  many Buddhist  functions and seem to be very close to the late Ven Yan Pei.</div>

Nevertheless, we can't confirm they are non-Buddhist or Buddhist because, there aren't recounts saying what are their beliefs. It is indeed true both SM and his wife are present for many Buddhist occasion such as the groundbreaking ceremony at Kong Meng San Phark Kak See of their newly built hall.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Great Founding fathers of nations have their own religion and the really good ones don't mixed religion and politics, often they don't stress much of their faith. Even early US presidents don't mix religion and politics.<br><br>I think good governing of a country is not about what country leaders' religion is. It is about what he/she can deliver. Afterall, "<strong>the greatest science of all is love</strong>" (Mother Theresa) - the love for the country and the love for it's people regardless of race and religion. There is also an English saying "<strong>God has no religion</strong>". And "<strong>My religion is love and compassion</strong>" (Daila Lama).<br><br>Religion is just a label - it's just a BRAND. More importantly, it has to be what one can offer for the betterment of mankind with acceptance, tolerance, respect and understanding in the world of great diversity - The recipe for peace and harmony. Which Singapore has effectively and successfully proved it.<br><br>I think, there are many labelled Buddhists who are Christians and I believe there are also many Christians who also demonstrated wholesome deeds encouraged by Buddhist teachings. Honestly, imho, at times we are Buddhists, we are Christians, we are Muslims, we are Taoist and Hindus and etc just that we are not mindful about it. We can be an "Angel" or "Devil" as well. We are just too concerned about our "<strong>TITLE/LABEL</strong>". At any one time, when our actions/lifestyle jell/blend with the these religions' doctrine - we instantly become part of it. "WE ARE REALLY ONE".<br><br>So PM's religion is quite secondary. PM's passion, wisdom, love, compassion and abilities are more important. We as Singaporeans, are very lucky.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There has to be a uniform understanding/definition of the term religion. Otherwise we will have difficulty keeping to this thread. The dictionary meaning of religion is belief system. In previous thread I elaborated on belief system and its elements.  Those are my POVs.<br><br>I think aside from the moral teaching, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">central to every religion</span> is the worship or veneration of a 'special' being that is beyond human. Whether this being is a spirit, creator-god, cosmic or reincarnation of something, whatever it is called, and whether its existence is proven or not. It could also include the worship of elevated or exalted humans whether alive or dead.<br><br>Do not be confused by one's affinity to a particular philosophy or morality. There are many great philosophers and moralists who are respected and quoted but never exalted to a higher being or worshipped.<br><br>In this regards, I don't see the three PMs as having any religion although they may professed to be 'nominal' this or that. A free-thinker or non-believer is not against any religion per se. Also, it doesn't mean they don't have a philosophy or they don't have any moral!<br><br>Looking around us and thru history, the most corrupted countries are actually more 'religious' than the secular countries! Take Thailand (predominantly Buddhist), Indonesia (predominantly Muslim), Philippines (predominantly Catholic). Japan (Buddhist) waged a war of expansion (not provoked) against China and SEA. Many innocent people were massacred or tortured or raped!<br><br>Similarly, Christian Europe waged holy wars and crusades. And Muslims are waging wars against 'infidels' now thru terrorism.</div>
