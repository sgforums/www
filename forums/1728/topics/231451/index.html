            <div class='col-md body'>Because.. yoga is not Buddhism. So it is not right to promote yoga in the name of Buddhism, even though Buddhists may very well practise yoga for its benefits, but nevertheless I thank John C. Kimbrough for sharing his knowledge and experiences here. His articles are still readable as they have not been deleted.<br><br>But being as a moderator of a Buddhist forum I have to clarify certain points so that readers may be aware. Yoga is at most a samatha, concentration practise, and at worse it is just some physical exercises. Ancient yogas in India may lead to deep concentrations and even samadhi, psychic powers, but these are no means to attain the enlightenment that Buddhism is talking about. In short, Yoga is at most a Samatha practise.<br><br>Insights and enlightenment can only be developed through Vipassana/Vipasyana  whether it is Theravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana.<br><br>I just posted this yesterday:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">I've found a wonderful definition of Vipasyana (Insight) Practise by Kalu Rinpoche from the "Luminous Mind" from another forum:<br><br>"When the mind abides in its natural state, its profound nature can gradually reveal itself, and all its qualities are uncovered.  This is Vipassyana practise...  Vipassyana...is to see clearly, to have insight into mind's nature and clear vision of its basic state.<br><br>...there are differences between the approaches of Shamatha and Vipassyana.  Shamatha uses an object or reference, although a subtle one, upon which the mind meditates; a dualistic relationship is estblished between the mind and its object.  In Vipassyana, however, mind and object are essentially one, not two, and remain this way.<br><br>...In Vipassyana, many thoughts go through the mind, but they are niether suppressed or followed.  They arise and pass away without our having to interfere..Vipassyana...consists of letting go of thoughts, letting them be pacified and liberated by them selves..."<br><br>He mentions to always verify these experiences with a qualified teacher, to prevent from going astray.</div></blockquote>To be continued tomorrow...</div>
