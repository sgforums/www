              <p>Surely
                  all things happen for a reason - understand that although the source of
                  our suffering derive from attachment, but having to remove attachment
                  so as to remove suffering (albeit is a good method of removing
                  suffering by eliminating desire), it would have nevertheless question
                  about the existence of human in general.</p>
              <p>Hence, what's the
                  point of existence from a Buddhist perspective? Understand that seeking
                  enlightenment is the goal of any Buddhist practice (regardless of
                  school), but that is still intrinsically the goal of this philosophy,
                  but it is not the point &amp; purpose of existence itself.</p>
              <p>By removing ourselves from earthly desire, that would make the
                  'final cause' (based on Aristotelian's thought) of human life vague.
                  For example, say if am a Musician and music is my art and my life.
                  Surely, if I fail to have any break-through in my art and become
                  frustrated - the source of my art would also naturally be the source of
                  my misery. Although I may suffer a lot from my pursuit in music in this
                  lifetime, but at the end of the day, I live, breathe and die as a
                  musician and that is also the point of my purpose in this lifetime -
                  the seed of this purpose which had all the potentiality and self
                  actualized in a form of my profession as a musician. </p>
              <p>Thus, how do one explain the purpose of existence from a Buddhist perspective, since we eliminate individuality altogether? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>

              <p>Our subconscious tendencies in our 8th consciousness becomes our 'purpose' and as far as I can see it, it is individual for each person. It is however not a 'soul'.</p>
              <p>Longchen says:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>During one meditation (many years ago) I had 
              one experience that
                                      might be what is termed as the alaya 
              consciousness. By comparision
                                      to normal state of consciousness, this state is 
              very subtle and
                                      profound. (To AEN, this is not the eternal 
              witness experience, but
                                      a different one).</em></p>
              <p><em>In that state, one will feel that one knows 
              the purpose/reason
                                      of incarnation and that information of 
              past-lives are 'stored'
                                      there. It is like a very high vibration, vast 
              consciousness that
                                      holds 'seed intentions' and is aware of all the 
              rebirths.</em></p>
              <p><em>Had i not come back to Buddhism, I will be 
              stuck there thinking
                                      that this is the ultimate purpose. This is where
               other people from
                                      other practices and religion will term as Higher
               Self, Oversoul or
                                      God. It is very easy to get stuck there as the 
              experience is so
                                      profound.</em></p>
              <p><em>Sometime after that, I came back to Buddhism 
              and have
                                      experiences of the non-dual. Even so, for a 
              period of time, i was
                                      wondering, should i 'base' on the experience of 
              the Alaya or should
                                      i continue with the non-dual practice. It took 
              me a long while to
                                      realise that at the state of the Alaya, there 
              isn't any realisation
                                      of the non-dual. That state is seems as a 
              supreme self (with vast
                                      information/knowledge) but there isn't any 
              understanding of the
                                      non-dual nature of existence. Because of not 
              realising that
                                      non-duality is the basis of reality, 'it' 
              functions in a certain
                                      manner.</em></p>
              <p><em>If all these is very confusing, please 
              disregard this post.</em></p>
              <p><em>Just want to stress that Buddhism is 
              extremely profound and
                                      Buddha has covered areas that will leave 
              virtually all other
                                      mystics and meditators stuck in mistaken views. 
              During meditation,
                                      we will experience many different subtle 
              experiences. Without
                                      someone who has covered the entire territory, it
               is very easy to
                                      get stuck at half-truths or mistaken views. The 
              various experience
                                      can move one off unto different paths away from 
              realisation.</em></p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> An Angsana seed given the right condition will grow into an Angsana tree. In the process of growth, surely there will be obstacles that prevents this self actualization from taking place - should the negative forces be overwhelming, it would limit or even eliminate this self actualization from taking place altogether. </p>
              <p>Although we do not live life in a singular purpose - but ultimately, the existence of life from the time of birth till death would have a purpose - just like an Angsana seed seeks to become an Angsana tree, disgarding the conditions that this little seed will face in its pursuit. Of course, there are other secondary function of an Angsana tree; simple example would be that it acts as a place of habitat/shelter or food source for various community of insects and animals.</p>
              <p>But this quality is accompanied by the fact that the seed attempts to grow into a tree and not because it is it is <em>made </em>to provide food and shelter for these creatures in a cosmic sense.</p>
              <p>Hope I am still making some sense here.</p>
              <p>Therefore, if human life is going through existence after existence, living in identity of various 'selves' - is life a combination of several purposes of many existences or is there an ultimate purpose in life itself, in which these transitory self are by a secondary function, like the Angsana tree? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>

              'purpose' and as far as I can see it, it is individual for each

              <p><em>During one meditation (many years ago) I had one experience
              that might be what is termed as the alaya consciousness. By
              comparision to normal state of consciousness, this state is very
              subtle and profound. (To AEN, this is not the eternal witness
              experience, but a different one).</em></p>
              <p><em>In that state, one will feel that one knows the
              purpose/reason of incarnation and that information of past-lives
              are 'stored' there. It is like a very high vibration, vast
              consciousness that holds 'seed intentions' and is aware of all the
              rebirths.</em></p>
              <p><em>Had i not come back to Buddhism, I will be stuck there
              thinking that this is the ultimate purpose. This is where other
              people from other practices and religion will term as Higher Self,
              Oversoul or God. It is very easy to get stuck there as the
              experience is so profound.</em></p>
              <p><em>Sometime after that, I came back to Buddhism and have
              experiences of the non-dual. Even so, for a period of time, i was
              wondering, should i 'base' on the experience of the Alaya or should
              i continue with the non-dual practice. It took me a long while to
              realise that at the state of the Alaya, there isn't any realisation
              of the non-dual. That state is seems as a supreme self (with vast
              information/knowledge) but there isn't any understanding of the
              non-dual nature of existence. Because of not realising that
              non-duality is the basis of reality, 'it' functions in a certain
              manner.</em></p>
              <p><em>If all these is very confusing, please disregard this
              post.</em></p>
              <p><em>Just want to stress that Buddhism is extremely profound and
              Buddha has covered areas that will leave virtually all other
              mystics and meditators stuck in mistaken views. During meditation,
              we will experience many different subtle experiences. Without
              someone who has covered the entire territory, it is very easy to
              get stuck at half-truths or mistaken views. The various experience

              <p>Hi Yunhaier,</p>
              <p>Firstly, i would like to state that this is not definitive and it is impossible to fully describe this 'higher self/store alaya' state.</p>
              <p>This 'state' seeks the resolution of fulfillments. Because of awareness of past lifes of the being, at that state there is the understanding of deathlessness. Therefore, death is not a concern at that level of consciousness. At that level, the seeking of resolution of 'unfinished business' drives the rebirth process..</p>
              <p>Let me describe an example. In my previous life, I was a european soldier who participated in WW1. The war left a fearful imprint about the pain of war. 'High self/alaya' state seeks to resolve the trauma of war imprint. This drives the process of reborning in an  environment where a similar scenario can be experienced. In this case, I am born in Sg who has a national service... must join army.</p>
              <p>This joining of army is not a coincidence but is the karmic factor driven by the fear of war. A similar scenario is now manifested to recreate a similar feeling in order for the chance of resolution.</p>
              <p>This 'higher self' is a very subtle sense of self that is different from the personality of a reborned being. Note: Experiencing this 'higher self' is not enlightenment. Note: the word 'self' is used here. Most new-age teaching will be based on this level of understanding. However, non-duality and emptiness are deeper mysteries that can still be veiled even when this 'higher self' state is being experienced.</p>
              <p>Non-duality realisation, however, will function differently. That is, it is a turn-about insight and understands that no-separation has occured. Non-duality insight understands a deeper level of dynamics and do not seek to resolve in the typical way. It resolves by 'doing nothing'... instead of outward projection of activity.</p>
              <p>Higher self seeks to resolve by fullfilling the desires or through whatever understanding that it has accumulated in the past life experiences... and this becomes the purpose of life. Non-duality sees a deeper dynamics at work and resolves through releasing the desires.</p>
              <p>Do you roughly understand?</p>

                      grow into an Angsana tree. In the process of growth, surely there
                      will be obstacles that prevents this self actualization from taking
                      place - should the negative forces be overwhelming, it would limit
                      or even eliminate this self actualization from taking place
                      altogether. </p>
              <p>Although we do not live life in a singular purpose - but
                      ultimately, the existence of life from the time of birth till death
                      would have a purpose - just like an Angsana seed seeks to become an
                      Angsana tree, disgarding the conditions that this little seed will
                      face in its pursuit. Of course, there are other secondary function
                      of an Angsana tree; simple example would be that it acts as a place
                      of habitat/shelter or food source for various community of insects
                      and animals.</p>
              <p>But this quality is accompanied by the fact that the seed
                      attempts to grow into a tree and not because it is it is
                      <em>made</em> to provide food and shelter for these creatures in a
                      cosmic sense.</p>
              <p>Hope I am still making some sense here.</p>
              <p>Therefore, if human life is going through existence after
                      existence, living in identity of various 'selves' - is life a
                      combination of several purposes of many existences or is there an
                      ultimate purpose in life itself, in which these transitory self are
                      by a secondary function, like the Angsana tree? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>

              <p>The angsana tree does what it does by being itself without any conceptualisation on it's part unlike us.  All life exists with ideal range of conditions present. Any less, life would not exist.</p>
              <p>Each existence,without the conciousness of previous life, is an  existence in itself. You exist because you simply exist. More purposeful life or less purposeful, you still live and die regardless! Ask yourself, are you looking for affirmation of self worth? If so, what yardstick or whose expectations are trying to live up to? Do you judge yourself / others according to what standards? What are you clinging to?   Why do your self conciousness arise?</p>

              <p>Helen Keller's fortitude comes for her immense suffering, yes, accomplishments are real, but so is her suffering of a conciousness locked in body unable communicate see or hear.</p>
              <p>Karma in this instance is precondition, but also shows it is not fatalistic. It is also due her karma that she met her teacher, Annie Sullivan, without which she will never be able to emerge out of herself.  </p>

              <p>Hi Yunhaier,</p>
              <p>Firstly, i would like to state that this is not definitive and
              it is impossible to fully describe this 'higher self/store alaya'
              state.</p>
              <p>This 'state' seeks the resolution of fulfillments. Because of
              awareness of past lifes of the being, at that state there is the
              understanding of deathlessness. Therefore, death is not a concern
              at that level of consciousness. At that level, the seeking of
              resolution of 'unfinished business' drives the rebirth
              process..</p>
              <p>Let me describe an example. In my previous life, I was a
              european soldier who participated in WW1. The war left a fearful
              imprint about the pain of war. 'High self/alaya' state seeks to
              resolve the trauma of war imprint. This drives the process of
              reborning in an  environment where a similar scenario can be
              experienced. In this case, I am born in Sg who has a national
              service... must join army.</p>
              <p>This joining of army is not a coincidence but is the karmic
              factor driven by the fear of war. A similar scenario is now
              manifested to recreate a similar feeling in order for the chance of
              resolution.</p>
              <p>This 'higher self' is a very subtle sense of self that is
              different from the personality of a reborned being. Note:
              Experiencing this 'higher self' is not enlightenment. Note: the
              word 'self' is used here. Most new-age teaching will be based on
              this level of understanding. However, non-duality and emptiness are
              deeper mysteries that can still be veiled even when this 'higher
              self' state is being experienced.</p>
              <p>Non-duality realisation, however, will function differently.
              That is, it is a turn-about insight and understands that
              no-separation has occured. Non-duality insight understands a deeper
              level of dynamics and do not seek to resolve in the typical way. It
              resolves by 'doing nothing'... instead of outward projection of
              activity.</p>
              <p>Higher self seeks to resolve by fullfilling the desires or
              through whatever understanding that it has accumulated in the past
              life experiences... and this becomes the purpose of life.
              Non-duality sees a deeper dynamics at work and resolves through
              releasing the desires.</p>
              <p>Do you roughly understand?</p>

              <p>No, I am not an army regular. During the NS and reservist days, I was a sectcomd/Platoon sergeant in a Guards/infantry based unit. I will get stressed when called up for reservist. But one mystical experience, during one reservist exercise greatly reduced my fear.</p>

              <p>Hi RJ,</p>
              <p>Thank you for writing and sharing. I perfectly understood what you are talking about. Karmic lessons, cycle of life and lifeplans, these are what I have meant by 'Higher self' level purposes. As said, this are the 'seed intentions' for the reincarnation. As mentioned above, this level is not really concerned about physical deaths of individual lifetimes, it is more concern about learning karmic lessons, resolution, completion of life plans and so on so forth.</p>
              <p>There is no right or wrong. This is one perspective from a specific level.</p>
              <p>However, may i also  invite you to take a deeper evaluation of Buddhism, especially its  teaching about no-self/non-duality and emptiness. We need not discard what we already know, but insights into non-duality and emptiness will give us a new perspective that may not be incompatible with what you already know. :)</p>
              <p>I hope the other forummers are not too protective of what is Buddhism or is not. This is just my sharing with our friend.</p>

              are the causes, you will continue to exists, hence rebirth. when
              you exists, there is the law of karma. you inherit both good and
              bad karma. no one can escape the effects of their karma. When you
              have ended the causes of existence, you have attained
              enlightenment. This will be your last rebirth.</p>

              <p>What is your views on the split of theravada and mahayana?</p>

              <p>Hi Rooney9,</p>
              <p>So sorry, I really don't have a definite view on this.</p>
              <p>However, from a practical point of view, i feel it is better to understand and practice the Theravada teaching first, although Theravada teaching is generally included in Mahayana.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arhatship (Theravada) is very hard to attain already... before we can even embark on the Bodhisatva (Mahayana) path.</p>
              <p>That's just purely my opinion, though.</p>

              <p>When one learns that grasping and clinging leads to suffering, one tries to learn how to let go. Whether it is one life time or many live times, it can be be sum up as one experience, or many experiences of one individual. It  gives context to one's goals, purpose or path. It can mean the same or different depending on each situation.</p>
              <p>For  Buddhist, on learning in as long as one is in samsara, sufferings continues. As such, one learns or tries to let go. </p>

              <p>For different people leading different lives will interpret them differently especially initially. </p>
