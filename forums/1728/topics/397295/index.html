              <p><em><a href="http://www.fpmt.org/teachers/yeshe/default.htm"><span style="color: #b85b5a;">Lama Thubten Yeshe</span></a> gave this teaching at Assembly Hall, Melbourne, Australia in April 1975. Edited by Nicholas Ribush.</em> <a href="http://www.fpmt.org/teachers/yeshe/switzerland81.htm"></a></p>
              <p>The way we live and think everything is dedicated to material pleasure. We consider sense objects to be of utmost importance and materialistically devote ourselves to whatever makes us happy, famous and popular. Even though all this comes from our mind, we are so totally preoccupied by the external objects themselves that we never look within, we never question what makes them so interesting. However, this mind is an inseparable part of us; as long as we exist our mind is there within us. Thus we are always up and down. It is not our body that goes up and down, it is our mind Â– the mind whose way of functioning we do not understand. Therefore, sometimes you have to examine yourself; not just your body but your mind, which is the thing that is telling you what to do. You have to know your own psychology, or, in religious terminology, perhaps, your inner nature. But no matter what you call it, you have to know your own mind.</p>
              <p>Don’t think that examining and knowing the nature of your mind is only an Eastern trip. That’s a wrong conception; it’s not an Eastern trip, it’s your trip. How can you separate your body, or the picture you have of your self, from your mind? You can’t say, “I have the material power to separate my body from my mind.” That’s impossible. You think you are a free person in the world, enjoying everything. That’s what you think, but you are not free. I’m not saying that you are under the control of someone else; it’s your own attachment, your own uncontrolled mind that you are oppressed by. If you can discover how it oppresses you, the uncontrolled mind will disappear automatically. Thus knowing your own mind is the solution for your mental problems.</p>
              <p>One day the world is so beautiful; the next day it is so bad. How can you say that! Scientifically it’s impossible for the world to change radically like that. It’s simply your mind that makes this happen. Don’t think that this is religious dogma; our going up and down is not religious ma. I’m not talking about religion; I’m talking about the way you lead your life, which is what sends you up down. The people and the environment don’t change radically; the changes are in your own mind. Surely you can understand that Â– it’s so simple.</p>
              <p>Similarly, one person thinks that the world is beautiful and people are wonderful and kind, but another thinks that everything and everyone are horrible. Who is right? How do you explain that scientifically? It’s just their individual mind’s projection of the sense world. Hence you feel, “Today is like this, tomorrow is like that; this man is like this; that woman is like that.” But where is the absolutely fixed, forever-beautiful woman? Who is the absolutely forever-handsome man? They are non-existent; they are simply creations of your mind.</p>
              <p>Also, you should not expect material objects to satisfy you and make your life perfect; that too is impossible. How can you be satisfied by even vast amounts of material objects? How can you be satisfied by sleeping with hundreds of different people? It’s impossible. Satisfaction comes from the mind. Your dissatisfied mind wanting to keep changing from one person to another, from one trip to another, can never satisfy you. This is just your mind.</p>
              <p>So you see, if you don’t know your own psychology, you might ignore what’s going on in your mind until it breaks down and you go complete crazy. People go mad through lack of inner wisdom, the ability to examine their own mind. They cannot explain themselves to themselves; they don’t know how to talk to themselves. Thus they are constantly preoccupied with all these external objects while their mind within is running down until it finally cracks. They are ignorant of their internal world; their minds are totally unified with ignorance instead of being awake and engaged in self-analysis. It is so necessary to examine your own mental attitudes; it is essential that you become your own therapist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <img style="margin: 10px 0px 20px;" src="/img_pdf/line.gif" alt="" width="200" height="1">
              <p>You people are intelligent: you know that material objects alone cannot bring you satisfaction. However, you don’t need to embark on some emotional, religious trip to examine your own mind. Some people think they do; they think that this kind of self-analysis is something spiritual or religious. To do this it’s not necessary to classify yourself as a follower of this or that philosophy or religion. But if you want to be happy you do have to check the way you lead your life. For this you don’t need to put yourself into some religious category; your own mind is your religion.</p>
              <p>When you check your mind, you should not rationalize or push. Relax. Do not be upset when problems come. Just be conscious of them and their origin, knowing their root. Introduce the problem to yourself: Here is this kind of problem. How has it become a problem? What kind of mind has made it a problem? What kind of mind feels that it’s a problem:, This is so simple, and when you check thoroughly, the problem automatically disappears. That is simple, isn’t it? For that to happen, you don’t have to believe in something. Don’t believe anything! All the same, you can’t say, I don’t believe I have a mind. You can’t reject your mind. You can say, I reject Eastern things Â– I agree. But can you reject yourself? Can you reject your head, your nose? You cannot reject your mind. Therefore, treat yourself wisely and try to discover the true source of satisfaction.</p>
              <p>When you were a child you loved and craved chocolate and cake, and you thought, “When I’m old like my parents, I’11 have all the chocolate and cake I want, and then I’11 be happy.” You made that kind of mental decision. Now you have so much chocolate and cake, but you’re bored. So you decide that since this doesn’t make you happy you’ll get a car, a house, television, a husband or wife Â– then , you’ll be happy. So now you have everything, but there are more problems. The car is a problem; the house is a problem; the husband or wife is a problem; the children are a problem. You realize, Oh, this is not satisfaction.</p>
              <p>Then, what is satisfaction? Go through all this mentally and check; it’s very important. Examine your life from childhood to the present Â– meditate. This is meditation, analytical meditation. At that time my mind was like that; now my mind is like this. It has changed this way, that way. You see, your mind has changed so many times but still you have not reached any conclusion as to what really makes you happy. My interpretation of this is that you are lost. I don’t care that you know your way around the city, that you know how to get home, that you know where to buy chocolate; as far as I’m concerned, you’re lost; you can’t find your goal. Check honestly, you’ll find that this is so.</p>
              <p>Therefore, Lord Buddha is saying that you only have to know what you are, how you exist; that’s all. You don’t have to anything. Just understand your mind: how it works; how attachment and desire arise; how ignorance arises; where the emotions come from. It is sufficient to know the nature of all that; just that gives so much happiness and peace. Your life changes completely; everything gets turned upside down; what you interpreted as horrible becomes beautiful. It’s truly possibl e.</p>
              <p>I’m sure that if I told you that all you were living for was chocolate and ice cream you’d think I was crazy. No, no, no, your arrogant mind would say. But look deeper into your life’s purpose. What are you here for? Gaining a good reputation? Collecting possessions? Trying to be beautiful? I’m not exaggerating Â– check for yourselves, then you’ll see. Through thorough examination you can realize that if your entire life is dedicated to seeking happiness through things like chocolate and ice cream, there is no significance in your being born human. Birds and dogs have the same kind of attitude to life. If you think you’re intelligent you should dedicate your life to goals higher than those of chickens!</p>
              <p>I’m not deciding your life for you, but you check up. It’s much better to have an integrated life than to live in mental disorder. Otherwise your life is not worthwhile, not beneficial to yourself or others. Ask yourself what you are living for Â– for chocolate? For steak? Perhaps for education. But that also comes from the mind. Without the mind, what is education, what is philosophy? A philosophy is somebody’s way of thinking, thoughts put together in a certain way. Without the mind there’s no philosophy no doctrine, no university subjects. these things are mind-made.</p>
              <p>How to check the mind? Just watch how your mind perceives or interprets any object that it contacts; what feeling Â– comfortable or uncomfortable Â– arises. Then you check: When I perceive this kind of view, this feeling arises; that emotion comes; I discriminate in such a way. Why, This is how to check the mind; that’s all; it’s very simple.</p>
              <p>When you have checked your own mind properly you stop blaming others; you recognize that actions come from your own defiled, deluded mind. When you are preoccupied with material, external objects, you always blame them and others for your problems. Then you become miserable because you project that view onto external phenomena instead of seeing their reality. So you can realize your fade-conception view Â– the attitude, or nature, of your own mind.</p>
              <p>You might think that this is all very new for you, but it’s not. Whenever you are going to do anything, first you check whether to do it or not and then make your decision. Since you do this already, I’m not giving you something new; the difference is that you are not doing it enough. You have to do more checking. To do this you don’t have to sit in some corner on your own Â– you can be checking your mind all the time, even while talking or working with other people. Also, you shouldn’t think that examining the mind is something only for those who are on an Eastern trip. Don’t think that way.</p>
              <p>You should also realize that the nature of the mind is different from that of the mesh and bone of this physical body. The mind is like a mirror, reflecting everything without discrimination. If you have understanding-wisdom you will control the sort of reflections you allow in your mind-mirror. If you totally ignore what is happening in your mind, it will reflect all kinds of garbage Â– things that make you psychologically ill.</p>
              <p>Your checking-wisdom should distinguish between reflections that are beneficial and those that bring psychological problems. Eventually, when you realize the nature of subject and object, all your problems will dissolve.</p>
              <p>Some people think they are religious, but what is religious? If you are not examining your own nature, not gaining knowledge-wisdom, in what way are you religious? Just the idea that you are religious Â– I am Buddhist, Jewish Â– does not help at all. It does not help you; it does not help others. If you have knowledge-wisdom, you can really help others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <img style="margin: 10px 0px 20px;" src="/img_pdf/line.gif" alt="" width="200" height="1">
              <p>The greatest problems of humanity are psychological, not material. From birth to death, people are continuously under the control of their mental sufferings. Some people never keep watch on their minds when things are going well, but when something goes wrong Â– an accident or some other terrible experience Â– they immediately say, God, please help me. They call themselves religious but they’re just joking. In happiness or sorrow, a serious practitioner maintains constant awareness of God and their own nature. You’re not being realistic or even remotely religious if you forget yourself when you are having a good time, surrounded by chocolate and preoccupied by worldly sense pleasures, and turn to God only when something awful happens. That doesn’t help.</p>
              <p>No matter which of the many world religions we consider, their interpretation of God or Buddha or whatever is simply words and mind; only these two. Therefore words don’t matter so much. What you have to realize is that everything Â– good and bad; all kinds of philosophies and doctrines Â– comes from mind. The mind is very powerful; therefore it requires strong direction. A powerful jet plane needs a good pilot; your mind-pilot should be wisdom understanding the nature of the mind. Then powerful energy can directed to benefit your life instead of being allowed to run uncontrollably like a mad elephant, destroying yourself and others.</p>

              <div class="author">by Lama Thubten Yeshe</div>
              <p><em>Lama Yeshe gave this talk at the Melbourne University, Australia on April , 1975. Edited by Nicholas Ribush.</em></p>
              <p>People often talk about spirituality and materialism, but what do these terms really mean? You’ll find that, as individuals, each of us has a different view.</p>
              <p>Some think they’re opposites, two irreconcilable extremes. Others think you can’t lead a spiritual life while living in a materialistic society, that to do so you have to abandon all enjoyment of material things. Then there are those who think spiritual seekers are rejects from society who couldn’t succeed in the material world. Yet others think, “I’m a rationalist, I don’t believe anything,” considering religious people blindly ignorant believers.</p>
              <p>Some people, especially those brought up in materialistic societies, become attracted to Buddhism or some other religion the moment they hear about it. Without understanding or even checking that it suits their mind, they immediately grasp at that religion as “fantastic!” This is very dangerous and not at all a spiritual attitude.</p>
              <p>Religion is not just some dry intellectual idea but rather your basic philosophy of life: you hear a teaching that makes sense to you, find through experience that it relates positively with your psychological makeup, get a real taste of it through practice, and adopt it as your spiritual path. That’s the right way to enter the spiritual path.</p>
              <p>If, for example, after you encounter Buddhism for the first time you think it contains wonderful ideas and immediately try to make radical changes to your life, you won’t make any progress at all. You have to implement it step by step. To actualize Dharma you have to look at your basic situation, what you are now, and try to change gradually, checking as you go.</p>
              <p>So, why do we all have different views of what spirituality and materialism are? Because we have all had different experiences and therefore think differently.</p>
              <p>To follow the spiritual path you do not have to abandon material things, nor does leading a materialistic life mean that you can’t engage in spiritual practice. In fact, even if you are totally materialistic, if you check deep within your psyche, you will find that there is already a part of your mind that is flowing in a spiritual direction. It may not be intellectualized, it may not be your conscious philosophy, you may even declare, “I am not a believer,” but in the depths of your consciousness there is a spiritual stream of energy constantly in motion.</p>
              <p>From the point of view of religious tolerance, the world today is a much better place than it was even less than one hundred years ago. People held extreme views; the religious were afraid of the nonreligious and vice-versa; everybody felt very insecure. This was all based on misconceptions and is mainly in the past, but some people may still think that way. Certainly, as I’ve been saying, many people feel that spiritual and material lifestyles are completely incompatible. It’s not true.</p>
              <p>Therefore, take the middle way as much as you can; avoid extremes. If you spiritual practice and the demands of your everyday life are not in harmony, it means there’s something wrong with the way you are practicing. Your practice should satisfy your dissatisfied mind while providing solutions to the problems of everyday life. If it doesn’t, check carefully to see what you really understand about your religious practice.</p>
              <p>Everything Lord Buddha taught was for us to penetrate to the essence of our being in order to realize the nature of the human mind. But he never said we had to believe what he said just because he’d said it. He encouraged us to understand the meaning of what he said. Without such comprehension, your entire spiritual trip is a fantasy, a dream, a hallucination: one skeptical question from a doubter and your whole spiritual life collapses like a house of cards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <img style="margin: 10px 0px 20px;" src="/img_pdf/line.gif" alt="" width="200" height="1">
              <p>Therefore, put it all together. Enjoy your material life as much as you can, but at the same time, understand the nature of both whatever it is that you’re enjoying and the mind enjoying it, and how the two relate. If you understand all this at a deep level, that is religion. If all your narrow mind sees is what is external and you never know what’s happening in your own mind, that’s a materialistic view. It’s not the fault of the materials, but that of your view.</p>
              <p>You can’t dedicate your life to just one object: “This flower is so beautiful it makes my life worthwhile. If this flower dies, I won’t be able to live.” That is stupid, isn’t it? I mean, the flower is just an example; we do this with other people and all sorts of other things, but such is the extreme view of the materialistic mind. A more realistic approach would be, “Yes, the flower is beautiful, but it won’t last; alive today, dead tomorrow. But my satisfaction does not depend on that flower and I wasn’t born human just to enjoy flowers.”</p>
              <p>Whatever you understand by religion, or Buddhism, or even simple philosophical ideas, should be integrated with the basics of your life. Then you can experiment: does satisfaction come from your own mind or not? That is enough. You don’t need to make extreme changes to your life to learn that dissatisfaction is created by your own mind. You don’t need to suddenly sever your connection with the world. You can lead a normal life while observing the nature of the dissatisfied mind. This approach is both realistic and practical, and guaranteed to give you an answer.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you accept some extreme idea, intellectually try to give something else up, and all it does is agitate your life. For the human body to exist you have to eat; you can’t become an extreme ascetic overnight. Be realistic; it is unnecessary to make radical changes. Change on the inside; change the way you see things, instead of hallucinating.</p>
              <p>We also have to accept the fact that everything is constantly changing. Many of us have fixed ideas about the way things should be and suffer when they don’t turn out like that. Lord Buddha’s psychology teaches us to free ourselves from that kind of grasping Â– not in an emotional, rejecting way but rather by taking the middle way, between the two extremes. If you put your mind wisely into this balanced space, you will find there happiness and joy.<br><br><em>This page appears courtesy of the Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive, established as a separate FPMT entity in 1996 by Lama Zopa Rinpoche to facilitate the preparations of the teachings it contains Â– those of Lama Yeshe and Lama Zopa himself.</em></p>

              <p><em><a href="http://www.fpmt.org/teachers/yeshe"><span style="color: #b85b5a;">Lama Yeshe</span></a> gave this talk at the Chinese Buddhist Society, Sydney, Australia on April 24, 1975. Edited by Nicholas Ribush.</em></p>
              <p>Those who practice religion or meditation Â– whatever their religious philosophy or doctrine Â– should never grasp any idea with attachment. Check up on that. Ideas are not fixed externally, from their own side; rather, you get some information from somewhere, perhaps someone tells you something, and if it appeals to you, your mind grasps on to it so tightly. This is very dangerous.</p>
              <p>We often accept some ideas as good; “Oh, meditation is great.” There are many examples of things that are beneficial, and of course, those who truly understand their nature and follow the right path will definitely find a satisfactory answer to all their questions. But the danger is for those who simply cling to the idea, the philosophy, the doctrine. Whatever your trip, you should not be attached to it. Again, I’m not talking about the external object but rather about the inner, phychological aspect. If you want to be psychologically healthy, you must avoid all such attachments. This is the way to achieve what Buddhism terms indestructible understanding-wisdom, the ultimate healthy mind.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you enjoy your meditation and what you get from it, but at the same time you cling to the intellectual ideas of your spiritual path: “Oh, this is perfect for me. I’m getting results; I’m so happy.” Then someone asks you what you’re doing, and when you tell them, they put you down.</p>
              <p>The same thing goes for you yourself. When people say you are good or bad, your mind should never go up or down in response. You know that words cannot give value to your character, that they can’t change the reality of who you are. Therefore, why do you go up and down according to what people say? Because of attachment, the mind that clings, the fixed-idea mind. So make sure that when you do practice Dharma, you abandon attachment and make it worthwhile.</p>
              <p>Check up on this; it is psychologically very interesting. If you don’t react when somebody tells you that your entire trip is wrong, I’d say you have a pretty good understanding of the psychological nature of the mind. Without this understanding, you hallucinate easily and are easily hurt; your peaceful mind is disturbed Â– by words and ideas alone. Our minds are incredible! Our ups and downs have nothing whatsoever to do with reality, nothing to do with the truth. It is very important to understand this psychology.</p>
              <p>It is common to find people who think that their own ideas and path are perfect. But by strongly emphasizing how wonderful their own beliefs are, these people indicate that they are automatically putting other, different ideas down. For example, say I believe that yellow is a fantastic color. With logical explanations, I convince you too, so that you believe, “Yellow is the perfect color; it is so good.” Automatically, there arises in your mind the idea that, “Red is not so good.” There are two things; this is common. Especially in connection with religion should we avoid this kind of contradiction. Accepting one thing should not make you dark and ignorant of others. If you check up what’s going on here, you’ll see that it is not that you are just blindly following something external, but rather that your mind is unbalanced. If one view is too extreme, it automatically generates another that is opposed to it. This imbalance destroys your inner peace. The culprit is your own unbalanced mind.</p>
              <p>This is where religious partisanship comes from. “I am a follower of this religion!” Then, when you see a follower of another religion, you feel afraid and insecure. This is totally your insecure mind, your weak knowledge-wisdom, grasping one extreme. Your mind is polluted; you do not understand the reality of the truth of your own mind. You must try to improve your psychological health. The purpose of practicing religion, Buddhism, Dharma, meditation, is for your mind to reach beyond the unhealthy, contradictory mental attitude. That’s all; so you check up.</p>

              <p>Lord Buddha himself exhorted his students not to get attached to his teachings: “If I give you this teaching, promise me that you won’t get attached to it.” Can you imagine? Lord Buddha’s teachings are incredible, his methods are universal, but still we should not get attached to them. He even said that we should not get attached to enlightenment, nirvana, or inner freedom; we should practice without attachment.</p>
              <p>However, this is very difficult to do, especially in the modern world. It is almost impossible for us to deal properly with material things, and this attitude spills over into our spiritual life. Of course, it is difficult, but you have to check into how to become perfectly psychologically healthy. Avoid extremes.</p>
              <p>I mean, in our ordinary samsaric worldly life, if someone says, “Oh, Lama, I like your teachings so much, blah, blah, blah,” we automatically grasp, “Oh, yes, thank you so much, I’m glad you like me.” We never say, “Don’t be attached.” Just observe how we react in our own everyday lives. Check up on that. Remember Lord Buddha; his methods and goals were the highest, but he still admonished us not to be attached to them. “If you get attached to this, you are psychologically ill; you’re destroying your chance of attaining perfect enlightenment.” Isn’t that too much?</p>
              <p>Lord Buddha never said, “Join my group. Following my path is good; following other religions is bad.” He never said that. Even one of the vows he gave to bodhisattvas was not to criticize any other religious doctrine. Check up why he did this. It shows a fantastic, perfect understanding of the human mind. If it were us, we’d say, “Follow me; I’ll give you the highest method of salvation. The others are nothing.” We regard our spiritual path as some kind of materialistic competition. If you do that, you will never be healthy, will never discover the bliss of liberation, will never discover everlasting peaceful enlightenment. Impossible. Then, what’s the point?</p>

              <p><em><a href="http://www.fpmt.org/teachers/yeshe/default.htm"><span style="color: #b85b5a;">Lama Thubten Yeshe</span></a> gave this teaching during a five-day meditation course he conducted at Dromana, near Melbourne, Australia, in March 1971. Edited by Nicholas Ribush.</em></p>
              <p>You are so fortunate being able to put much effort of body, speech and mind into seeking inner reality, your true nature. When you check how you have spent most of your life, you can see how fortunate you are having the chance to make this search even once. So fortunate!</p>
              <p>I’m not just making it up, “Oh, you’re so good,” trying to make you feel proud. It’s true. However, to really discover that all human problems, physical and mental, come from attachment, is not an easy job. It takes much time.</p>
              <p>For example, if you’re having difficulty at a meditation course, you might start thinking about home: your warm house, your comfortable bed, chocolate cake. You remember all these nice things. Then your ego and attachment get to work, “Oh, I don’t know about this course. I’d be better off at home. At least there I know I can enjoy myself.” But we all know what’s going to happen when you get there. Still, attachment follows your ego’s view, “My bed is so good, I’ll be so comfortable back home; my family is there, I can relax and do whatever I feel like, I’ll be free. Here I’m not free and I have to try to be serious. Anyway, my serious mind doesn’t seem to be functioning, so I might as well leave.” Your dualistic attachment kicks in, telling you so much stuff, convincing you until you say, “Yes, yes, yes” and leave.</p>
              <p>So then you get home, and you’re sitting in your room, and you check up. How silly! Nothing’s new. There’s no place on earth where you’re guaranteed to find satisfactory enjoyment. Don’t think Tibet must be a fantastic place, a paradise where everything is pleasure. Never! Never! Since dissatisfaction and attachment inevitably come with this body and mind, your samsaric mandala of dissatisfaction accompanies you wherever you go. Even if you leave your own country and go to a cave in the mountains, attachment comes along. You can’t leave it back home.</p>
              <p>Trying to face your problems is far more worthwhile than trying to run away from them without understanding their root. You’ve been that way before; it’s not a new trip. It’s the same old trip. You go, you change, you go, you change, on and on like that. In this life alone you’ve taken so many attachment tops.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <img style="margin: 10px 0px 20px;" src="/img_pdf/line.gif" alt="" width="200" height="1">
              <p>With effort, everything is possible. In order to attain the realization of indestructible, everlasting peace, you have to have an indestructible mind for training. Realizations don’t come without your training your mind the right way. First you have to make the determination, “For such a long time I have been servant to the two mental departments of attachment and ego, trying to please them. But in fact, they are my greatest enemy, the root of all my problems, the destroyers of my peace and enjoyment.” You have to understand how these two minds occupy and control your internal world.</p>
              <p>According to Lord Buddha’s teachings, as long as you don’t realize that your real enemy is within you, you will never recognize that the mind of attachment is the root of all the problems your body and mind experience. All your worries, your depression, everything comes from that. Until you do recognize that, even though you might occasionally have an hour’s good concentration, it never lasts. If, however, you do see the psychological origin of your problems and understand the nature of attachment and how it works to cause aggression, desire and hatred, your mind becomes very powerful.</p>
              <p>When you’re in a peaceful environment, you think, “Oh, I’m so peaceful, my meditation is so good, I have such good realizations.” But when you’re out shopping in the street or in a supermarket and people bump into you, you freak out; because you’re not sitting in meditation but walking around, your mind is completely uncontrolled. If, however, if you understand the psychology of attachment and how it lies at the root of your various reactions, you will not freak out easily and will really be able to control your mind, no matter where you go or who you’re with.</p>
              <p>This is not just some philosophical theory, either. It is really true, based on living experience. In fact, not only Buddhism, but all religions recognize the shortcomings of attachment. Even worldly people talk about its drawbacks. But, you know, even though we say the words, “Attachment this, attachment that,” we don’t really recognize it as the biggest problem on earth.</p>
              <p>Therefore, what I’m saying is, it would be wonderful if you could recognize that your own attachment is the cause of every single problem that you experience. Problems with your husband, wife, children, society, authorities, everybody; having a bad reputation; your friends not liking you; people talking badly about you; your hating your teacher, your lama or your priest; all this truly comes from your own attachment. You really check up.</p>
              <p>We Westerners always have to blame something external when things go wrong. “I’m not happy, so I’d better change this.” We’re always trying to change the world around us instead of recognizing that it’s our own attachment that we have to change.</p>
              <p>Just take a simple example. When someone hurts you by telling you that you’re greedy, although you blame the person for how you feel, the hurt actually comes from your attachment. First of all, people, perhaps even your parents or your spouse, don’t like your attachment-driven behavior, so they complain, “Oh, you’re so greedy,” hurting your ego. And then, instead of accepting their pointing out your selfish behavior, your attachment to always being right, perfect, causes you angrily to reject what they say. The fact that your ego, your wrong-conception mind, cannot accept criticism is itself a big problem: your ego wants you to be right all the time, and your attachment creates its own philosophy of never listening to advice, no matter who gives it, closing off your mind. It is very important that you learn to deal with these problems in the best possible way.</p>

              <div class="feature">
              <div class="author">by Lama Thubten Yeshe</div>
              <p><em>Lama Yeshe gave this five-day meditation course he conducted at Dromana, near Melbourne, Australia, in March, 1975. Edited by Nicholas Ribush.</em>  We always use the word, “ego.” But although we’re all the time saying, “ego, ego, ego,” we don’t realize the ego’s psychological aspects, its mental attitude. We interpret the ego as some sort of physical entity. Therefore, it is necessary to discover that the ego is mental, not physical. That’s so worthwhile.</p>
              <p>We have such a short time to realize egolessness, but searching for it is what differentiates us from animals. Otherwise, what’s the difference? Animals enjoy the sense world and conduct their lives to the best of their ability. Just like ourselves, they like those who feed them and dislike those who beat them, isn’t it? What’s the difference?</p>
              <p>Perhaps you think, “Rubbish! I can intellectualize, I can write; I can make money to support and enjoy my life.” But even rats and mice can look after themselves with ego and attachment. They can collect and store food many times their own weight. Look at the bees: even though their lives are so short, they collect enough honey to last for maybe hundreds of years. So, what difference is there between bees and so-called intelligent humans if the mental attitude is the same, where both are living only for sense pleasure? Perhaps bees are even more intelligent than us Â– they live such short lives but still accumulate vast amounts of what gives them pleasure.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I think it’s so worthwhile and so important that while we occupy these precious human bodies, with all our intelligence and where everything has come together, we use our ability to seek our inner nature and release ourselves from all the problems of mental defilement, which come from our ego. Everything weÂ’ve done since the time we were born until now has come from our ego, but it’s all been so transitory and our pleasure has been so small.</p>
              <p>But don’t think, “Oh, I’m too bad; my mind is completely dominated by my ego.” Don’t put yourself down. Instead, be happy to realize such things.</p>
              <p>Realizing that only your own mind and effort can bring you release from your ego is so worthwhile. For years and years, ages and ages, all you’ve done is build up your ego, and under the influence of its hallucinated projection of he sense world, youÂ’ve run, run, run from one thing to another, as if you’d lost your mind. So to now have just one flash of recognition of all this is most worthwhile; it really is worth putting in the effort.</p>
              <p>Don t think that without your own effort, without your own wisdom functioning, you can stop the schizophrenic mental problems that result from the energy force of your own ego. It’s impossible.</p>
              <p>Lama doesn’t believe that he can solve your problems without your own effort and action. That’s a dream; if that’s your attitude, it’s a complete misconception. “God can do everything for me; Buddha can do everything for me. I’ll just wait.” That’s not true! “I don’t have to do anything.” That’s not true! You did everything, now you have to experience the powerful consequences. You can see now, with your own experience, can’t you? Just one meditation session is all it takes.</p>
              <p>What Lama wants is for you to become a wise human being instead of one who is dominated by the energy force of a super-sensitive ego. At the end of a meditation course, I’d like you to be thinking, “Well, that was my own meditation course, given by my own wisdom.” If you feel like that, the course was worthwhile. Otherwise, if you just go, “A high Tibetan lama gave a meditation course; I went,” it’s just another ego trip. What’s the purpose? Your old habits, your schizophrenic mental attitudes haven’t changed a bit. So what meditation did you do? Lord Buddha is already enlightened; through his own effort, with his own wisdom, he freed himself from his schizophrenic mind, but here we are in a still agitated condition.</p>
              <p>So you can see, realization is so individual. It depends upon each individual’s mind, effort and wisdom. Realization is so personal. From morning until night, you all have different experiences, even though you’re all trying to meditate on the same thing Â– different experiences according to the individual level of the individual mind.</p>
              <p>If you think, “Oh, I have so much to do at home … my house, my family, my friends … it’s difficult to sit and meditate,” it means your mind is ensnared by the worldly life. You’ve been like that from the time you were born until now, and if you keep going that way, you’ll end up dying with nothingness. How can you ever finish anything like that? Work in the materialistic life continues to pile up, one thing after another, then another, another, another, and you can never say, “Ah, at last I’ve finished everything, now I can sit and meditate.” That time will never come.</p>
              <p>You can see, when your mind is occupied ego energy, it’s like constantly having needles stuck into your body. That would be pretty uncomfortable, wouldn’t it! It’s the same thing, exactly the same thing. So you can realize how Important it is to release attachment and ego. When you do release them, you will experience everlasting joyful realization, inner freedom, inner liberation, nirvana … it doesn’t matter what you call it. But instead, all we do is try to please our ego; it’s like we’re praying to our ego. We dedicate all our energy to our ego, and what we get in return m mental pollution; there’s such a bad smell in our minds that they can’t even breathe.</p>
              <p>So from now on, instead of welcoming your ego’s energy force, stand guard against it with mindfulness and wisdom, watching with penetrative attention for the first sign of its arrival. And when it comes, instead of welcoming it, “How are you, ego? Come right in! Have a cup of tea, have some chocolate,” examine it with a big wisdom eye, a wisdom eye bigger than your head! Just watch it. When you give your ego the big wisdom eye, it disappears, all by itself.<br><br><br><br><em></em></p>

              <h1 id="pageName" style="display: none;">Death, Intermediate State and Rebirth</h1>
              <div class="author">by His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama</div>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Death</span></p>
              <p>Through the afflictions of desire, hatred and ignorance, contaminated karma (actions) are performed, which establish potencies in the mind in the form of predispositions. When a lifetime finishes, a person who has such predispositions is born again in cyclic existence with a mind and body appropriated through these contaminated causes.</p>
              <p>Some persons die upon the full exhaustion of the impetus of that action which, in another lifetime, laid the foundation for this one. Others die without having used up their allotted time, through the incompletion of the causes of sustaining life, such as lack or necessities. This is called untimely death, or death upon the consumption of merit; for the impetus of the action that established this life remains, but external concordant circumstances that are achieved through other meritorious actions in previous lives do not.</p>
              <p>A person dies within a virtuous, non-virtuous or neutral mind. In the first case, the dying person might take to mind a virtuous object Â– such as the Three Jewels (Buddha, his Doctrine and the Spiritual Community) or his own lama, thereby generating a mind of faith. Or he or she might cultivate immeasurable equanimity, becoming free from desire and hatred toward any sentient beings, or meditate on emptiness or cultivate compassion. This can be done either through one’s own remembering to do such or through others’ urging. If such attitudes are cultivated at the point of death, one dies within a virtuous mind, through which one’s rebirth is improved. It is good to die in this way.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, however, it happens that others, even though not purposely seeking to arouse anger, annoy the dying person with their nervousness, thereby making him or her angry. Sometimes, also, friends and relatives gather around the bed lamenting in such a manner that they arouse manifest desire. Whether it be desire or hatred, if one dies within a sinful attitude to which one is well accustomed, it is very dangerous.</p>
              <p>Some die within a neutral attitude, neither taking a virtuous object to mind nor generating desire or hatred.</p>
              <p>These three attitudes Â– virtuous, non-virtuous and neutral Â– occur until the point of the subtle mind of death. According to the sutra system, this final subtle mind necessarily neutral; for, unlike Highest Yoga Tantra, sutra does not describe techniques for transforming subtle minds into virtuous states, only for treating coarse ones. A qualified practitioner of tantra, however, can convert the subtle minds associated with death into a virtuous path consciousness. At that point one’s practice is very profound.</p>
              <p>In any case, the attitude just before death is very important; for, if even a moderately developed practitioner is disturbed at that time, manifest desire or hatred will be generated. This is because we all have predispositions established by former non-virtuous actions, which are ready to be activated upon meeting with disadvantageous circumstances. It is these predispositions that provide the impetus for lifetimes as animals, and so forth. Similarly, we have predispositions established by former virtuous actions, which, upon meeting with advantageous circumstances, will provide the impetus for lifetimes in happy migrations as humans and so forth.</p>
              <p>These capacities that are already in our mental continuums are nourished by attachment and grasping, leading to a bad or good rebirth. Thus, if the predisposition left by a bad karma is activated, a life as an animal, hungry ghost or hell-being will result.</p>
              <p>Similarly, if a person who usually behaves sinfully dies within a virtuous attitude, he or she will probably be reborn in a good situation. Therefore, it is very important for both the dying person and those around him or her to avoid creating situations of desire or hatred and instead to foster virtuous states of mind. We need to know this.</p>
              <p>Those who die within a virtuous attitude have a sense of passing from darkness into light, are free of anxiety and see pleasant appearances. There are many cases of very ill persons who, near the time of death, speak of being in great comfort despite their illness. Others with little illness fall into great fright, with labored breathing. These latter are sunk in non-virtuous thoughts, have a sense of going from light to darkness and see unpleasant forms.</p>
              <p>Some whose physical warmth has diminished through illness become desirous of heat, thereby fortifying predispositions for rebirth as a being in a hot hell, whereupon they take rebirth in a place of extreme heat. Others become attached to a feeling of coolness wishing, for instance, for a drink water, they fortify predispositions to be reborn as a being in a cold hell, thereby making the connection to such a rebirth. Thus it is very important to avoid desirous thoughts at the time of death and direct the mind to salutary objects.</p>
              <p>In everyday life, attitudes of desire, hatred, jealousy and so forth, to which we are well accustomed, become manifest with only slight provocation; but those with which we have little familiarity take considerable provocation, such as recourse to reasoning, to manifest themselves. Similarly, at the time of death, attitudes of long familiarity usually take precedence and direct the rebirth. For this same reason, strong attachment is generated for the self, since one fears that one’s self is becoming non-existent. This attachment serves as the connecting link to the intermediate state between lives (bardo); the liking of a body, in turn, acts as a cause establishing the body of the intermediate being.</p>
              <p>For those strongly involved in non-virtuous actions, the warmth of the body withdraws first from the upper part of the body and then from other parts; whereas, for those strongly involved in virtuous actions, the warmth first withdraws from the feet. In both cases, the warmth finally gathers at the heart, from which the consciousness exits. Those particles of matter, of combined semen and blood, into which the consciousness initially entered in the mother’s womb at the beginning of the life, become the center of the heart; and from that very same point the consciousness ultimately departs at death.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Intermediate state</span></p>
              <p>Immediately thereupon, the intermediate state begins Â– except for those reborn in the formless realms of infinite space, infinite consciousness, “nothingness” or peak of cyclic existence, for whom the new life begins immediately upon death. Those born within the realms of desire and form must pass through an intermediate state, during which a being has the form of the person as whom he or she is to be reborn. The intermediate being has all five senses, but also clairvoyance, unobstructiveness and an ability to arrive immediately wherever he or she wants. He or she sees other intermediate beings of his or her own type Â– hell-being, hungry ghost, animal, human, demigod or god Â– and can be seen by clairvoyants.</p>
              <p>If a place of birth appropriate to one’s predispositions is not found, a small death occurs after seven days, and one is reborn into another intermediate state. This can occur at most six times, with the result that the longest period spent in the intermediate state is forty-nine days.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Rebirth</span></p>
              <p>This means that those beings who, even a year after dying, report that they have not found a birthplace are not in the intermediate state but have taken birth as a spirit.</p>
              <p>If taking rebirth as a human, one sees one’s future mother and father as if lying together. If one is to be reborn as a male, this sight generates desire for the mother as well as hatr ed for the father Â– and vice versa if one is to be reborn as a female. Being desirous, one rushes there to engage in copulation; but upon arrival, one sees only the sexual organ of the desired partner. This creates anger, which causes cessation of the intermediate state and makes the connection to the new life. One has entered the mother’s womb and begun a human life. When the father’s semen and mother’s blood are conjoined with this life or consciousness, they naturally and gradually develop into the elements of a human.</p>
              <p>One is desirously attracted to one’s future birthplace, even if it is to be a hell. For instance, a butcher might see sheep in the distance as in a dream; upon his rushing there to kill them, the appearance would fade, causing him to become angry, whereupon the intermediate state would cease and his new life in hell begin. Also, as said before, those to be reborn in hot hells are attracted to heat; in cold hells, to coolness. The intermediate state of one who is to be reborn in a bad migration is itself very frightful; in the end, one rushes to the place of rebirth and, when one’s wish is not achieved, gets angry, whereupon the intermediate state ceases and the new life begins.</p>
              <p>The connection to a life is, therefore, made under the influence of desire, hatred and ignorance. Until these afflictions are overcome, one is as if bound in chains without freedom. Indeed, there are good and bad rebirths; but, while one is still bound, one must bear the burden of mental and physical aggregates that are under the influence of contaminated actions and afflictions. This is not done just once, but again and again without break.</p>

              <p>To overcome the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness and death, desire, hatred and confusion must be overcome. Their root, in turn, is ignorance Â– the conception of an inherent existence of persons and other phenomena. External medicines alleviate superficial suffering but cannot cure the central problem. Internal practices Â– such as resorting to specific antidotes to desire and hatred Â– are more helpful, but their effects are temporary however, if one can destroy ignorance Â– their root Â– then all of these cease of their accord.</p>
              <p>If ignorance is eliminated, then the contaminated actions that depend on it are stopped.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, without ignorance, the attachment and predispositions established by previous actions cease to operate, whereupon the cycle of uncontrolled rebirth is ended.<br><br><em>Published as the foreword to</em> Death, Intermediate State and Rebirth<em> by Lati Rinpoche and Jeffrey Hopkins.

              <h1 id="pageName" style="display: none;">When We Study Buddhism We Study Ourselves</h1>
              <div class="author">by Lama Thubten Yeshe</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When we study Buddhism we are studying ourselves Â– learning about the nature of our own minds. The emphasis is not on something supreme; it is on practical things like how to Live the daily life and how to integrate it with the mind so that the mind remains peaceful and healthy. In other words, the emphasis is on experiential knowledge-wisdom, not dogmatic views. Actually, in Western terminology we would not say that Buddhism is religion, but rather philosophy, science or psychology.</p>
              <p>An instinctive tendency; of the human mind is to search for happiness; in this respect Eastern and Western people are no different. But if your life-style overemphasizes the sense world and you grasp at it emotionally, it is very dangerous Â– you have no control. Now control is not an Eastern custom or a Buddhist trip; we all need control. Especially those who live a materialistic life and psychologically are too attached to objects. From the point of view of Buddhist philosophy such a mind is not healthy, is mentally sick. You already know that external scientific technological advances alone cannot satisfy the desires of your attachment or stop your emotional problems.</p>
              <p>Thus the method of Lord Buddha’s teachings is to show you the nature of the human mind, your human potential and how you can develop further. Moreover, this method does not emphasize blind belief in, rather than understanding of, metaphysical processes. However, whether you are religious or non- religious, or a believer or a non-believer, the important thing is to know the nature of your own mind. If you don’t, it is so easy to think that you are healthy and functioning well in your daily life while in fact the root of disturbing emotions is growing firmer and deeper within your mind. With this fundamental cause of psychological disease within you, a tiny change of conditions can precipitate mental illness. As long as you are totally immersed in blind attachment to the sense world, not knowing the nature of your mind, this can happen. You can’t reject this: “I don’t believe it.” You can’t reject your nose: “I don’t believe I have a nose.” Whether you believe you have a nose or not, it’s there!</p>
              <p>Many Western people say, “I don’t believe in anything”; they are so proud of being non-believers. But check this Â– it’s very important to know. In the West there are so many contradictions: scientists think they are non-believers; religious people think they are believers. However, whether you think you are a believer or a non-believer, you have to know the nature of your own mind.</p>
              <p>You always talk about attachment, but you don’t know how to control it. To say the word is easy, but to know the nature of attachment is very difficult. A simple example: cars and aeroplanes were invented to allow people to do things more quickly, leaving them more time for leisure; but the result is that people’s minds are more restless than ever. I’m not complaining, but you examine your daily life. What I’m saying is that when the whole country is involved in the sense world under the control of attachment, you don’t have the chance or time to see the reality of your mind. I call that kind of life-style difficult. There is no way you can really enjoy yourself and experience satisfaction, because true enjoyment comes from the mind, not from external phenomena.</p>
              <p>Modern, intelligently skeptical young people do have some understanding of what is worthwhile in life, and know that enjoyment does not come from temporal Â– or, in Buddhist terminology, “samsaric” Â– objects alone. Thus they are searching for that which truly satisfies. When Lord Buddha talked so much about suffering he was not referring primarily to physical illness and pain but to dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction is the real suffering. No matter how much you get, your desires do not abate; you always want more. That is suffering; that is deluded frustration.</p>
              <p>Buddhist psychology enumerates six fundamental delusions, which frustrate and disturb the peace of the human mind and cause it to become restless: attachment, anger, ignorance, pride, deluded doubt and holding distorted views. These are mental, not external phenomena. So, when Lord Buddha taught people how to overcome these delusions, he emphasized the necessity of understanding their nature, not simply belief and faith. Without investigating your mind and developing introspective knowledge-wisdom it is not possible to develop such understanding. Even though we talk a lot about delusions, we don’t really know anything. Those fundamental delusions come from the ego, they make the mind restless. To be free you don’t have to give up your possessions. You can keep your possessions, but if you do so with attachment you will make yourself restless and your life difficult; you will keep your mind foggy and polluted. The unclear mind is by nature ignorant and agitated; the light of wisdom cannot grow in such a mind. The solution to this problem is meditation.</p>
              <p>Meditation does not imply sitting in a corner doing nothing, trying to develop single-pointed concentration. It is a type of wisdom free from sluggishness whose function is awareness of the state of mind. In your daily life you should be aware of everything you do and why and how you do it. Usually we do everything unconsciously: we eat unconsciously, drink unconsciously, talk unconsciously. We have no idea of what is happening in our minds, even though we say we are conscious. I’m not judging you, putting you down, but you look for yourself. The way of Buddhism is to put forward ideas for you to examine and experience. I’m not talking about something way up in the sky. This is very simple.</p>
              <p>If you do not know the nature of attachment and its object it’s impossible for you to have loving kindness for your friends, parents and country. Since your mind is unconscious you hurt those close to you. Similarly, someone who is angry completely forgets himself; he has no idea what’s going on in his mind. You know how it is; these are just examples of what we do. Many times we hurt others through being unconscious: we are not aware of our own behaviour or mental attitude and have no respect for others.</p>
              <p>In the West there are people who have specialist education in psychology. But Lord Buddha wants us all to become psychologists; you should know your own mind. Lord Buddha feels that it is definitely possible, that every human being has the potential ability to understand, and thereby to control, his own mind. When you understand your mind, control comes naturally. Don’t think that investigating the mind is just a Himalayan trip, something only for those who have no material possessions. Just check; whenever you are emotionally involved with something, instead of acting, relax; try to be aware of what you are doing. Ask yourself, “What am I doing? How? What is making me do this?” It is really wonderful if you can analyze yourself like this. With understanding you can stop your problems so easily. Our problem is that we lack intensive knowledge-wisdom, or awareness, or consciousness…it doesn’t matter what you call. it.</p>
              <p>Therefore, to show others loving kindness you have to know the nature of the object. If you don’t you will get caught up in yet another arrogant ego trip. “I love him,” “I love her.” Make sure you know how and why Â– it is so important that you become your own psychologist. Then you can treat yourself with your own wisdom, and enjoy your material possessions with a relaxed mind instead of a restless and berserk one, which ruins your life.</p>
              <p>To become a psy chologist you don’t have to learn some big philosophy; all you have to do is examine your own mind every day. You examine material things every day Â– the food in your kitchen, for example-so why can’t you check your mind? This is far more important. Life in the West is based on an “I can always buy the solution to my problems down at the supermarket” mentality. You think that you can always go to the pharmacy and pick up some pills, that whenever you are emotionally frustrated you can get some drug from your doctor. Do you think remedies like those are really helpful? Of course they are not. Although they seem to help, they are so transitory. They don’t even destroy the symptoms of deluded emotions; they only make you sluggish and more ignorant.</p>
              <p>Your materialistic mind thinks that pleasure and happiness can be bought, but they can’t. In its depths lies the idea that you can buy a peaceful mind in the supermarket. That’s a total misconception. Religious people should also try to understand their own minds instead of just trying to believe in something. That is far more practical. Belief alone cannot solve your problems; only understanding knowledge-wisdom can do that. Lord Buddha even said that it is dangerous to believe in Buddha and exhorted us to understand our own nature instead. When you have discovered something with your own mind, then it is all right to believe in it. Belief based on realizations or clear intellectual understanding is perfectly acceptable. But if you are not clear why you believe what you do, your faith can easily be destroyed by others. Many spiritually inclined people are weak because they don’t understand the true nature of their spirit, or mind. Understanding is a form of mental energy: it supports your mind and keeps it healthy.</p>
              <p>When you understand your mind’s view, or perception of things, you realize that all along you have been grasping at the sense world Â– and at an imaginary, idealistic future that is simply a projection of your mind and has not the slightest physical reality Â– you have been completely unconscious of the present. You must agree that this is an unhealthy state of mind.</p>
              <p>It is very important to maintain awareness throughout your day. The nature of wisdom and awareness is peace and joy. You don’t have to grasp for the experience of joy or at anything that might bring it Â– you simply have to act correctly with right understanding. Thus the result of joy arises spontaneously. You don’t have to think, “If I spend my life acting in this way, next life I’ll experience the good result.” You don’t have to be obsessed with attaining some realization or other. As long as you act with as much understanding as you can, you will quickly attain the realization of everlasting peace.</p>

              <div class="author">by Lama Thubten Yeshe</div>
              <p><em>Lama Yeshe gave this teaching at Latrobe University, Melbourne, Australia, in March, 1975. Edited by Nicholas Ribush.</em></p>
              <p>Buddhism can be understood on many different levels, and people who actualize the Buddhist path do so gradually. Just as you pass slowly through school and university, graduating from one year to the next, so do Buddhist practitioners proceed step by step along the path to enlightenment. In Buddhism, however, we’re talking about different levels of mind; here, higher and lower depend upon how much spiritual progress you have made.</p>
              <p>Also, in the West, there’s a tendency to consider Buddhism as a religion in the Western sense of the term. This is a misconception. Buddhism is completely open; you can talk about anything – the evolution of both the external and the internal worlds. Buddhism has its doctrine and philosophy but it also encourages scientific experimentation, both inner and outer. Therefore, please don’t think of Buddhism as being some kind of narrow, closed-minded belief system. It isn’t. And also, Buddhist doctrine today is not an historical fabrication derived through imagination and mental speculation. Rather, it is a true psychological explanation of the actual nature of the mind.</p>
              <p>When you look at the outside world you have a very strong impression of its substantiality. You probably don’t realize that that strong impression is merely your own mind’s interpretation of what it sees. You think that the strong, solid reality really exists outside, and when you look within, perhaps you feel empty. This is also a misconception, the wrong mental attitude that fails to realize that the strong impression that appears to truly exist outside of you is actually projected by your own mind. Everything you experience – feelings, sensations, shapes and colors – comes from your mind.</p>
              <p>If you get up one morning with a foggy mind and the world round you also appears to be dark and foggy, or when the world seems beautiful and light, you should understand that basically, those impressions are coming from your own mind rather than from changes in the external environment. Therefore, instead of misinterpreting whatever you experience in life through judgmental wrong conceptions, you should realize that it’s not outer reality but only mind.</p>
              <p>For example, when everybody in this auditorium looks at a single object, me, Lama Yeshe, each of you has a distinctly different experience, even though simultaneously you are all looking at the one thing. These different experiences don’t come from me; they come from your own minds. You are probably thinking, “Oh, how can he say that? We all see the same face, the same body, the same clothes,” but that’s a just a superficial interpretation. If you check deeper you’ll see that the way you perceive me, the way you feel, is individual, and that at that level, you’re all different. These various perceptions do not come from me but from your own minds. That’s the point I’m making.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <img style="margin: 10px 0px 20px;" src="/img_pdf/line.gif" alt="" width="200" height="1">
              <p>So then perhaps you think, “Oh, he’s just a lama; all he knows about is mind. He doesn’t know about powerful scientific advances like satellites and other sophisticated technology. There’s no way you can say that those things come from mind.” But you check up. When I say “satellite,” you have a mental image of the object that you’ve been told is a satellite. When the first satellite was made, its inventor said, “I’ve made this thing that orbits the earth; it’s called a ’satellite.’” Then when everybody else saw it, they thought, “Ah, that’s a satellite.” But ’satellite’ is just a name, isn’t it?</p>
              <p>Before the inventor of the satellite actually made it, he speculated and visualized it in his mind. Then, on the basis of this image, he acted to materialize his creation. Then he told everyone, “This is a satellite,” so everyone thought, “Wow, a satellite; how beautiful, how wonderful.” So that shows how ridiculous we are. People give things names and we grasp at the name, believing it to be the real thing. It’s the same thing no matter what colors and forms we grasp at. You check up.</p>
              <p>If you can understand what I’m explaining here, you’ll see that indeed, satellites and so forth do come from the mind, and that without mind, there is not a single manifest material existence in the entire sense world. What exists without mind? Look at all the stuff you find in supermarkets: so many names, so many foods, so many different things. First people made it all up – this name, that name, this, this, this – so then, this, that, this, this and this all appear to you. So if all these thousands of supermarket items as well as jets, rockets and satellites are manifestations of mind, what then does not come from mind? That’s why it is so very important to know the way your own mind works.</p>
              <p>Thus, if you check really deeply into how your mind expresses itself, your various views and feelings, your imagination, you will realize that all your emotions, the way you live your life, the way you relate with others, all come from your own mind. If you don’t understand how your mind works, you’re going to continue having negative experiences like anger and depression. Why do I call a depressed mind negative? Because a depressed mind doesn’t understand how it works. A mind without understanding is negative. A negative mind functions to bring you down, because all its reactions are polluted. A mind with understanding functions clearly. A clear mind is a positive mind.</p>
              <p>Therefore, any emotional problem you experience arises because of the way your mind is functions, and your basic problem lies in the way you misidentify yourself. You normally hold yourself in low esteem; you see yourself as a poor quality human being, while what you really want is for your life to be of the highest quality, perfect. You don’t want to be a poor quality human being, do you? So, in order to correct your view and become a much better person, you don’t need to squeeze yourself or to jump from your own culture into another. That’s not the solution. All you need to do is to understand your true nature, the way you already are. That’s all. It’s so simple.</p>
