            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder why u think this topic is not suitable for discussion...<br><br>Anyway, we usually associate the term "retribution" as a negative attribute which we hope that the person will have misfortunate befalls onto him as it is right and so we think. However, by karma, if you have aversion, hatred, selfish thought/feeling for him or delighting in his misfortunate, you are also creating bad karma for yourself.<br><br>Well if you ask me about retribution. By karma, there person will reap what he has sowed. If he sowed bad seeds, he will reap bad harvest but it also depends on whether he knew his mistakes and repented. The anology is akin of planting a seeds but if he hasn't provide the condition for the seeds to grow. He will not reap the bad harvest or lessen the negative effects.<br><br><strong>Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love, this is the eternal rule - Buddha </strong><br><br>my 2 Nickle of thought</div>
