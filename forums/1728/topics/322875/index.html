                                          on earth?", "Where did the ancestors of the human race come from?"
                                          or "How did the world come about?" Questions such as these have
                                          plagued mankind since time immemorial. The answers lie in the
                                          Buddhist scriptures and over the next four issues, Venerable
                                          Shen-Kai shall deliberate on them.</span></span><br> <br> The ancestors of the human race came from the Light-sound heaven
                                          (Abhasvara)<br> <br> In the Ekottaragama Sutra and other Buddhist scriptures, it was
                                          precisely stated that the human race originated from the
                                          Light-sound heaven. Being the most intellectual of all living
                                          things on this earth, the ancestors of the human race could not
                                          possibly have been made from clay by some divine gods; this is a
                                          myth. They could not have been evolved from apes; this is a
                                          fallacy.<br> <br> People often ask:<br> <strong>Where is the Light-sound heaven?<br> Why is it called the Light-sound heaven?<br> How did the human race come from the Light-sound
                                          heaven?</strong><br> <br> According to Buddhism, the various celestial levels of existence,
                                          in ascending order, are divided into three worlds, namely:<br> <strong>(i) Field of Desires<br> (ii) Field of Forms<br> (iii) Field of Formless</strong><br> <br> <strong>(i) Field of Desires:</strong><br> Within the Field of Desires, there are:<br> <br> Heaven of Four Heavenly Kings (Catummaharajika)<br> Thirty-three Heavens (Tavatimsa) - (there are 33 devas in this
                                          heaven comprising 8 devas in each direction of East, West, North
                                          and South together with the centre being that of Sakka. Sakyamuni
                                          Buddha was once the deva-king of this heaven.)<br> Heaven of Devas Yama<br> Tusita Heaven<br> Nirmanarati Heaven<br> Paranirmitavasavartin Heave<br> <br> <strong>(ii) Field of Forms:</strong><br> Above the Field of Desires is the Field of Forms where beings
                                          delight in Jhanic bliss achieved by renouncing sense-desires. This
                                          field consists of 4 Dhyana Heavens - the Heaven of 1st Dhyana, the
                                          Heaven of 2nd Dhyana, the Heaven of 3rd Dhyana and the Heaven of
                                          4th Dhyana.<br> <br> In the Heaven of the 1st Dhyana or Jhana, there are:<br> - The Heaven of Brahma's Retinue<br> - The Heaven of Brahma's Ministers<br> - The Heaven of Maha Brahma (Sakyamuni Buddha was once the heavenly
                                          king of this heaven)<br> In the Heaven of the 2nd Dhyana, there are:<br> - The Heaven of Minor Lustre<br> - The Heaven of Infinite Lustre<br> - The Heaven of Light-sound or Radiant Lustre<br> In the Heaven of the 3rd Dhyana, there are:<br> - The Heaven of Minor Purity<br> - The Heaven of Infinite Purity<br> - The Heaven of Extensive Purity<br> In the Heaven of the 4th Dhyana, there are:<br> - The Heaven of blessing-arising<br> - The Heaven of blessing-attached<br> - The Heaven of vast-reward<br> - The Heaven of no thought<br> - The Heaven of no vexation<br> - The Heaven of no heat<br> - The Heaven of virtue-view<br> - The Heaven of virtue-appear<br> - The Heaven of form ultimate<br> <br> <strong>(iii) Field of Formless:</strong><br> There are 4 other heavens within this Field of Formless. The
                                          heavens are totally devoid of matter or bodies. These are:<br> <br> The Sphere of infinite space<br> The Sphere of boundless consciousness<br> The Sphere of nothingness and<br> The Sphere of no thought, no no-thought<br> From the above three Fields, there are altogether 28 levels of
                                          heavens.<br> <br> The Light-sound heaven or Radiant Lustre is at the 3rd level of the
                                          Heaven of the 2nd Dhyana or Jhana of the Field of Forms. The beings
                                          of this heaven communicate not through sounds, but they emit pure
                                          radiant lights from their mouths that represent what they wish to
                                          express and the receiving party on seeing the lights is able to
                                          understand what they mean. As lights represent sounds, hence this
                                          heaven is called the Light-sound heaven. It is the most unique and
                                          wonderful level of the three heavens of the 2nd Dhyana and is also
                                          called the "Heaven of Radiant Lustre."<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Â… to be continued in the next

                                          often ask, "Why are there human beings on earth?", "Where did the
                                          ancestors of the human race come from?" or "How did the world come
                                          about?" Questions such as these have plagued mankind since time
                                          immemorial. In the Abhidhamma Patika and other Buddhist scriptures,
                                          it was precisely stated that the human race originated from the
                                          Light-sound heaven.<br> In this Part 2 of The Earth People, Venerable Shen-Kai talks about
                                          the first phase of the earth's formation and the arrival of the
                                          "earth people".</span></span><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">The evolving world goes through
                                          four stages, namely:</span><br> <br> 1. Formation<br> 2. Existence<br> 3. Destruction<br> 4. Void or Emptiness</strong><br> <br> Each stage has a time span termed a "medium kalpa" [1]. Twenty
                                          "small kalpas" make one "medium kalpa". The four stages, each
                                          termed a "medium kalpa", make up a "great kalpa".<br> <br> When the world reaches the final phase of the Stage of Destruction,
                                          there will be great fires burning down hell, planet earth, other
                                          stars and their cosmic worlds as well as the various heavens within
                                          the Field of Desires. Prior reaching the heaven of the 1st Jhana of
                                          the Field of Forms, the Devas, Bodhisattvas, Sages and those
                                          sentient beings who have performed great virtuous deeds in the
                                          lower worlds will naturally be saved. They have already been
                                          ascended to the Heaven of Radiant Lustre where they will enjoy
                                          happiness and heavenly bliss.<br> <br> Following the passing of twenty small kalpas in the Stage of Void
                                          or Emptiness, the world will return to the beginning of a new Stage
                                          of Formation. A big golden heavenly cloud will appear from the
                                          Heaven of Radiant Lustre and heavy rain will fall to drench the
                                          burning worlds. After the floodwater has receded, the various
                                          heavens below the heaven of the 1st Jhana (or Dhyana) will
                                          reappear. The massive forces of swirling on the remaining materials
                                          left over by the receding floodwater will gradually solidify. This
                                          process is accompanied by the reappearance of various planets in
                                          the sky - many are spherical in shape and others, elliptical. This
                                          will, of course, include our earth and the orbiting moon, as well
                                          as all the worlds below including the lowest level of hell. As the
                                          extreme heat energies rotate and concentrate, many suns are formed
                                          - this is what the astronomers called the stars, planets and
                                          satellites. Within each galaxy system, the stars have their orbits
                                          rotating around the sun, planets have their own orbits around the
                                          stars, and satellites around the planets. The revolving stars,
                                          planets and satellites coupled with their own rotations maintain
                                          motions, thus creating day and night. Further, the process produces
                                          day, month, year and the four seasons. However, it is to be noted
                                          that the time scales are different between earth, the various
                                          worlds of existence in heavens and other stellar systems.<br> <br> For this period, a passage in the Chinese Old Text story
                                          "Qiong-Lin" recorded similar description on the formation of the
                                          world. The text reads:<br> "When earth was first separated from heaven;<br> pure light air float to form the sky and the polluted air sink to
                                          form the ground;<br> the sun, moon and five stars are called the seven-Polis;<br> the heaven, earth and humans are called the three-lords; and<br> the sun is the master of the "Yang" [2]<br> with the moon as the image of the "Yin" [3]<br> <br> The above description is very close to what the Buddha said.
                                          Further, records from Buddhist scriptures match very well with what
                                          astronomers of today have found. It is in this manner that the
                                          world is returned to the great natural phenomenon of the
                                          universe.<br> <br> During the first phase of the formation of earth, the earth's crust
                                          covering the ground was not fully solidified. The ground surface
                                          appeared milky in colour. Looking from the celestial plane, the
                                          earth shone brightly and afar. In the heaven of Radiant Lustre,
                                          many of those celestial beings whose blissful life in the heaven
                                          was coming to an end and who by disposition were more restless and
                                          impetuous, on seeing the brightness, and out of curiosity, began to
                                          travel down to the earth. They used their "clairvoyance feats" to
                                          fly down and reached different continents of the earth. They saw
                                          fluid springing out from the ground and they dipped their fingers
                                          in it. They tasted the fluid and found it extremely tasty, sweet
                                          like honey. While the fluid was so tasty, everyone craved for more.
                                          Those who had most, their bodies became rough and heavier. They
                                          began to lose their light illusory physical forms and their bodies
                                          slowly formed into the material body of bone and flesh. The weight
                                          forced them to the ground and they lost their "clairvoyance feats"
                                          and "natural heavenly clothes", and were unable to fly through the
                                          skies to return to the celestial world. They began to lose many of
                                          their intrinsic celestial qualities such as celestial colours,
                                          fragrant scent, brightness, beauty, wisdom and their innate
                                          miraculous quality. In particular, their "clairvoyance eyes" turned
                                          into human eyes; and their "clairvoyance ears" became human ears.
                                          They became unable to remember their past lives. They lost their
                                          special ability to read the minds of others. They were unable to
                                          communicate by radiant light from their mouths and they needed to
                                          depend on sounds from the movements of their tongues. While without
                                          sufficient languages and vocabulary, they needed sign language to
                                          assist them to fully communicate with each other. They became
                                          ordinary human beings on earth. After running out of the tasty
                                          fluid, they resorted to feed on thick weedy plants, then hard crops
                                          from the wild. At that time, the life span of human being was long
                                          and there was no disease or sickness. Later, they learned to plant
                                          crops and vegetables. During the period of feeding from nature,
                                          those who were greedy in feeding themselves acquired darker skin
                                          colours, ranging from brown to black. Others who did not feed as
                                          much and those who arrived later had lighter skin colour, ranging
                                          from fair to yellow. As time went on, together with the influence
                                          by climatic conditions of different regions (equatorial, temperate
                                          and cold regions), various skin coloured races of people were
                                          formed.<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Â… to be continued in the next

                                      that the human race originated from the Light-sound heaven. How do
                                      they become the human race of today? What will happen to this earth
                                      eventually? Venerable Shen-Kai answers these questions and more, in
                                      this concluding serial of The Earth People. In addition we learn
                                      that the earth, as with all phenomena in the universe, is subject
                                      to the four stages of formation, existence, destruction and
                                      emptiness. There is no beginning and no end, and the best way for
                                      us to live is to emulate the spirit and virtuous deeds of the
                                      Bodhisattvas.</span></span><br> <br> In the early days, small groups of people lived in scattered
                                      places; each group used its own language for communication. The
                                      physical separation between the groups and the lack of efficient
                                      means of transportation resulted in the creation of hundreds and
                                      thousands of different languages. These people were the ancestors
                                      of the many different races in the world today.<br> The early inhabitants, after losing their Â“celestial clothingÂ”,
                                      moved around naked. While they played, their emotions on love and
                                      relationship arose resulting in sexual desires. They began to feel
                                      shy and shameful. At that time, grass and other plants were grown
                                      on earth and they used leaves as clothes, partly to cover their
                                      naked bodies and partly to protect themselves from the cold.<br> <br> From the perspective of the other worlds, the earthÂ’s light had
                                      turned green, separating the seas and the land. The devas from
                                      other celestial worlds dared not come anymore. The human beings on
                                      earth began to live as husbands and wives. They raised children.
                                      They lived in caves and later, they learned to build dwelling
                                      houses. With improved conditions, the population grew. The
                                      six-sensory organs of the human being (eyes, ears, nose, tongue,
                                      body and mind) began to differentiate and this resulted in
                                      affliction and vexation. The innate bright and innocent celestial
                                      nature disappeared, and in their places arose greed, anger,
                                      ignoranceÂ….thereby formed the basis of Asura sentient beings. The
                                      Devas, Human and Asura are beings of the three good realms. With
                                      the arising of the evil deeds of killing, stealing, sexual
                                      misconductÂ… resulting in the sentient beings in the three evil
                                      realms of animal, ghost and hell. Together, these formed the
                                      transmigration process in the six realms of existence. With this,
                                      all sentient beings have four modes of birth, namely,<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">i. Womb-born beings
                                      (jalabuja);<br> ii. Egg-born beings (andaja);<br> iii. Moisture-born beings (samsedaja);<br> iv. Gaseous form-born beings (opapatika).</span></strong><br> <br> and thousands and millions of different life forms.<br> <br> These constitute the corresponding living spheres of the seas,
                                      land, sky and motion.<br> <br> The thinking of humanity and their lives changed from simple to
                                      complex states. Some portions of the human race turned from the
                                      barbaric stage to a civilised world. Some portions of primitive man
                                      that fed on raw flesh and blood of birds and beasts gradually
                                      changed to civilisation. The introduction of farming and trading is
                                      the beginning of agriculture and commerce sectors. Some lived on
                                      making of farming tools, cooking utensils and production of
                                      building materials, this was the beginning of industry. In order to
                                      administer peace and justice arising from arguments and fights
                                      caused by greed, anger, ignorance, killing, stealing and sexual
                                      misconduct, virtuous and upright people were elected to maintain
                                      law and order, and to manage the affairs of people in the society.
                                      From these came education, social ethic and democratic government.
                                      The advent of languages created written texts which led to the
                                      flourishing of modern civilisation. The barbaric era ended.
                                      Communities moved from small tribal groups into big societies, from
                                      societies to countries, and from the competitive nature between
                                      countries, and they further evolved through scientific progress
                                      into the atomic age and the cosmic age.</p>
