            <div class='col-md body'>This is a good question. I came across this before. I probably be not the best person to explain it well.<br><br>But I believe the answer you are seeking is about the 1st to 8th sense (in our mind/conciousness).<br><br>I cant remember exactly about these senses, maybe someone else can explain this better.

            <div class='col-md body'>i'd like to share a meditation experience some time ago.<br><br>during that time, i sat down completely relaxed and let go of everything around me. frankly, my mind never rested for a single moment. anything that is micro-scopic small, the mind continued to notice. is that what is called the formation or perception? i was aware of that, the arising and falling of the formations in thoughts, colors or feelings. how about blankness, is that a perception too when you know it is blankness?<br><br>i ever had my mind focus on the wide vast empty space in the eyes(mind). i asked, do i have to fly in a rocket to space to look at space? no.... that space is already inside my mind here and now...... slowly mind seemed to become that space. is that formation? when it was starting to form, i didn't realised it was forming..... untill when i realised my body and mind has become one with space, i saw the connection. again this seeing of connection has formed another perception which is identifying the separation. that's when form and perception is formed through this awareness. and this awareness i felt is not pure awareness for me because by nature and truth, we are actually all dissolved into space as one both body and mind indivisibly.<br><br>well i am still not good at practicing. i admit i still need alot of guidances and more practices.......<br><br>to add on...<br>i also realised one thing is that, one can choose to continue to be in this state for as long as you want or as short as you want. the call is yours. you can continue to realise this formation and you can also do not have to associate or think about the formation. there is actually no form to form at all actually. it is there and again it is actually not really there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually this posting catches my eye<br><br>Orginally posted by Thusness in the emptiness thread:<br><br><strong>From a conventional point of view, it is. If we feel, see, hear and think in terms of Â‘entityÂ’, then it seems that there is a Â‘selfÂ’ leaving the body. This is because all along, we experience all phenomenon appearances as Â‘solid thingsÂ’ existing independently. Such conventional mode of comprehending our meditative experiences masked the true character of these experiences.<br><br>If we treat consciousness to be an atomic-like-particle residing in our body somewhere, then we are making it as a self too. Do not do that. The true character of Consciousness is not a thing, it does not enter, leave, reside within or outside the body. Clear Luminosity is bonded by karmic propensities, causes and conditions. There is no need for a place Â‘withinÂ’. Yes, there is a Â‘mental phenomenonÂ’ arising but the sensation of Â‘enteringÂ’ and Â‘leavingÂ’ is the result of associating it with a Â‘selfÂ’. Just like it is illusionary to see a Â‘selfÂ’ succeeding from moment to moment, an Â‘entranceÂ’ and Â‘exitÂ’ is equally illusionary.<br><br>Mystical experiences are extremely crucial during the journey of enlightenment. Do not discard them unwisely but assign them correct places. These experiences loosen karmic bonds that latent deep down in our consciousness where it is almost impossible to break through ordinary means. It is an essential condition for the awakening of penetrating insight. The main different between non Buddhist and Buddhist practitioners is that transcendental and mystical experiences are not molded into a Â‘selfÂ’ but correctly understood and purified with the wisdom of emptiness. This applies true to the Luminous Clarity Knowingness that is non-dual, it is not wrongly personified into Brahman. In perfect clarity, there are no praises for radiance bright, only the Dharma is in sight. The wisdom of emptiness is so deep and profound that even if one has entered the realm of non-dual, he/she will still not be able to grasp its essence in full. This is the wisdom of the Blessed One. The second level of Presence. Smile[b]</strong><br><br>From the above posting, it seem that you have experienced it in meditative experience..? what meditation do you practise?<br><br>what you say make sense to me...<br><br>However to realise the essence... it's rather hard... need experience it myself<br><br></div>

Examine and investigate. Smile<br><br>SELF AND NO-SELF<br>-Tan Chade Meng<br>(This article explores the very difficult question of "no-self". It is one of my favourites among all the articles I've written.)<br><br>I'm a Research Engineer by profession and the bulk of my work is in the areas of Neural networks and Computer vision. I have also recently developed an interest in Artificial Life (Alife). I approach the issue of "self" both from what little I've learned from my work and what little I've learned as a meditator.<br><br>In my line of research, I find it useful to think of "intelligence"; as an "emergent" quality. Perhaps an example will illustrate this idea. Take the example of a flock of birds flying in one direction. The amazing thing about the flock is that it's always organized in a "V" shape, which can be proven to be the most energy-efficient formation (The bird in front generates air movements that lessens the load of the birds behind. When the front bird gets tired, some bird from behind takes over).
