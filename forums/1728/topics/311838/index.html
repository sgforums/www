              <p>Hey guys. I'm starting this thread for anyone who have a wish to share some of the good dharma books that you have read.</p>
                  <p>So, I'm starting with one I am currently reading... bought it from Pearl Center's Evergreen Buddhist bookshop, and now Thusness and another friend of ours are getting their copies. After that it will be out of stock so if anyone wishes to buy, you may have to check out Awareness Place, not sure if they have it.</p>

                  <p>Both me and our moderator Thusness found it profound and a great
                                                                                                              guide, the book is full of insights, good advices, and will be a valuable guide for a practitioner/meditator and Thusness thinks that the author is deeply enlightened. The book is very practical and invites us to investigate and discover for ourselves our natural state, rather than being an intellectual or philosophical understanding -- this is a practical, practice manual. Coming from the Mahamudra tradition, the book contains a very detailed step by step manual starting with the various stages of
                                                                          Shamatha (calm-abiding) and Vipashyana (insight) meditation. Very clear and direct.</p>

                  This is a wonderful translation of very pithy instructions on the
                              stages of Mahamudra meditation. A very detailed step by step manual
                              starting with the various stages of Shamatha and Vipassana meditation.
                              Very clear and direct. This is the pith of the instructions and will be
                              a great aid in working with your Lama in a more detailed fashion. Every
                              time I read this text I get more and more out of it, it clearly fills
                              any gap in understanding or clearly indicates what needs to be
                              addressed with ones teacher. A must have, so go ahead and buy it!

                  This is one of the best step-by-step elucidations of the stages of
                              unfolding rigpa, or "natural, timeless awareness," minus the usual
                              obfuscating overhead of Tibetan/Buddhist trappings. Offers exceptional
                              clarity in differentiating each stage from the next, and gives helpful
                              markers to discern when you're there, and when you're not. Extremely
                              helpful on the path!

                  This book contains a very fine description of the "Natural State" or
                              "Ordinary Mind" of Mahamudra -- quite similar to the view of Dzogchen.
                              Interestingly, it's referenced in Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche's recent
                              work, "An Ocean of the Ultimate Meaning." The author's work,
                              "Mahamudra: The Quintessence of Mind and Meditation" (though his name
                              is spelled "Takpo" vs. "Dakpo" I believe it's the same author)
                              originally entitled "Moonbeams of Mahamudra" is also in print;
                              translated and annotated by Lobsang P. Lhalungpa. It is a much larger
                              work (close to 500 pages). I have seen it referenced numerous times in
                              contemporary works (e.g. Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche's). I own one but
                              haven't read it yet.

                  This is a short effective book, with a good attempt at the pointing out instructions. 
                              <br>If not treated as a "how-to" manual, it does a marvelous job of being a signpost of the "natural state."

              						The Doctrine of Paticcasamuppada shows the

              						flux of all the physical and psychical (mental) 
              						phenomena that make up individual existences. An 
              						understanding of the Doctrine is essential if we are to

              						Paticcasamuppada and in the Abhidhamma</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          </span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Group One</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Group one of the Paticcasamuppada is made up of 
              						Avijja and Sankhara. Avijja is ignorance of what really 
              						constitutes individual existence. It is delusion 
              						regarding Truth and Reality of existence, that in all 
              						the bodily and mental phenomena of existence, there is 
              						nothing that can ultimately be regarded as a satisfying, 
              						self-reliant, independent, abiding "self" or "ego". 
              						Ignorance is not to understand suffering, its origin, 
              						its extinction, and the path leading to its extinction. 
              						Because of ignorance and delusion regarding existence, 
              						we are constantly engaged in Sankharas, or 
              						kamma-formations, which are wholesome or unwholesome 
              						deeds, of body, speech and mind. Kamma-formations are 
              						deeds born of our volitions, or our wishes and desires.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Most people are thus engaged in all kinds of 
              						activities without an understanding of what really 
              						constitutes individual existence; they are proceeding 
              						like the blind. They are unable to think correctly, they 
              						are unable to act correctly and they are unable to speak 
              						correctly. They will never get to where they wish to go. 
              						It is only the Ariya, or Noble Disciples, of the Buddha 
              						who have been able to penetrate into the truth of 
              						existence, into the understanding of the related nature 
              						of mind and matter, of the cause and effect of all mind 
              						and matter, and the impersonality (lack of abiding self) 
              						of all such phenomena. In the Buddha's dispensation, 
              						there are four stages of purity or sainthood, namely the 
              						stages of Sotapanna, Sakadagami, Anagami and Arahanta or 
              						fully purified saint, who is no longer bound by any 
              						fetters or defilements. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">         Looking at Group One of the Paticcasamuppada, we 
              						can say that life or existence, for most people, is 
              						"delusion and kamma-formations or delusion and 
              						activities which is with delusion". Our delusions keep 
              						us always active, always making new kamma. </span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">         </span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Group Two</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">         Group Two comprises 5 components, namely 
              						vinnana, nama-rupa, salayatana, phassa, and vedana, or, 
              						in English, consciousness, mind and matter, six bases, 
              						impression, and feeling. We will look at each component 
              						to deepen our understanding of the continuous flux of 
              						life or existence.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">         Consciousness appears for the first time at 
              						conception in the mother's womb. Consciousness is to be 
              						aware of something. It is Consciousness which brings 
              						into effect the interplay of mind and matter, which is 
              						existence. Mind and matter in turn are linked to the six 
              						bases. The six bases are the 5 sense bases, namely, the 
              						eye-base for sense of sight, the ear-base for sense of 
              						hearing, the nose-base for sense of smell, the 
              						tongue-base for the sense of taste, and the body-base 
              						for sense of touch, and finally, the sixth base is the 
              						mind-base, which is the sense of knowing or being aware 
              						of sensual impression. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          When a visual object comes into contact with 
              						the eyebase, there is consciousness or being aware of 
              						this visual object. This however is a very brief look at 
              						the process of becoming conscious of a visual object. 
              						The Abhidhamma teaches that 14 subtle subfunctions come 
              						into play in the process of becoming conscious of an 
              						object (vinnana kicca). Similarly for the other bases. 
              						Because of the six bases, there is a continuous stream 
              						of consciousness; consciousness of sights, sounds, 
              						smells, tastes, bodily feelings, and thoughts and 
              						fantasies.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          </span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">What then is "Life" or 
              						"Existence"</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Because of the Six Bases, we spend our time 
              						seeing and enjoying visual form, hearing and enjoying 
              						sounds, smelling and enjoying scents, tasting and 
              						enjoying flavours, touching and enjoying bodily 
              						feelings, thinking and fantasizing and enjoying 
              						thoughts, imaginings, day-dreams. From the time we wake 
              						up, until we fall asleep again at night, because of the 
              						six bases, we spend our time looking, listening, 
              						smelling, tasting, feeling, or lost in thoughts and 
              						fantasies. There is no rest at all from these 
              						activities. We are led by the six bases into spending 
              						all our time and all our energies, whether these 
              						activities are wholesome or unwholesome, whether they 
              						are of use or no use at all. From the day of our birth 
              						until the day we are put into our coffins, the six bases 
              						take up all our time, How else do we spend our time, if 
              						not with our six bases?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          "Life" or "existence", from two points of view, 
              						is therefore nothing but the six bases leading us into 
              						all kinds of physical, verbal and mental activities. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          </span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Group Three</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Group Three of the Paticcasamuppada consists of 
              						tanha, upadana, and kamma-bhava, in English. craving, 
              						clinging, and volitional acts. Bhava here refers to 
              						kamma-bhava, all the volitional activities that cause 
              						becoming into existence. (upapatti-bhava is the 
              						resultant rebirth or the coming into existence or Jati 
              						of Group Four.) </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Craving, clearly, is to desire, to want, and to 
              						long for somethings. But not to want somethings, or to 
              						dislike somethings, is also a form of craving. If we 
              						dislike the heat, it may be because we like cold. If we 
              						dislike the colour green, it may be because we like the 
              						colour red.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Clinging is strong attachment to something. It 
              						is compulsive or obsessive craving. We refuse to let go. 
              						Even if we do not actually possess something, we are 
              						mentally obsessed by it. We think of it constantly. We 
              						will do anything to get it. Do we therefore not create 
              						more kamma formations? Thus, upadana paccaya bhavo; 
              						"through clinging is conditioned the process of 
              						volitional acts".</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          We have look at the Group Three constituents. 
              						What do they tell us about "Life" or "Existence"?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Group Three tells us that Life is nothing but 
              						likes and dislikes. We meet with something we like and 
              						we are all smiles. We meet with something we dislike and 
              						we are all frowns. So life is nothing but likes and 
              						dislikes, smiles and frowns. We meet with something we 
              						like, and we be come strongly attached to it. We cling 
              						to it mentally, and we react. We react if we like 
              						something, and we react if we dislike something. This is 
              						kammabhava.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          If we wish to judge a person's character, we 
              						need only look at his behaviour, and how he reacts 
              						physically and verbally to external stimuli. It is said 
              						that the famous palmist Cheiro once said that he could 
              						judge a person by looking at his hands. Regarding this, 
              						Napoleon, the famous French general, is reported to have 
              						replied that he judged a person by looking at his face. 
              						It is a person's face that betrays his clinging 
              						(upadana) to his likes and dislikes, and to his views 
              						and opinions.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          To summarize, what does Group three tell us 
              						about life? Group Three constituents, tanha, upadana and 
              						kamma bhava, tell us that "life" is nothing but our 
              						likes and dislikes, and resulting smiles or frowns. In 
              						other words, life is nothing but our reacting to 
              						external stimuli. We like some thing and we react in a 
              						certain way. We dislike something and we react in 
              						another way.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          </span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Group Four</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Group Four is concerned with future resultant 
              						period. Group Four constituents are Jati, and 
              						jara-marana; in English, rebirth, and old age-death. 
              						What then is "life" according to Group Four? Group Four 
              						tells us that "life" is to be born, and then to die. 
              						This, very briefly and very truly, is what life is. 
              						"Life" starts with birth, and it ends with death.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Once, there was a King, and he one day summoned 
              						his Prime Minister and ordered that biographies of all 
              						the learned men in the world be compiled. The Prime 
              						Minister in turn sent orders to all the writers and 
              						scholars throughout the kingdom to begin compiling this 
              						great work. There was no such thing as writing paper as 
              						we know it today. All this great compilation was done on 
              						the finest leather parchments available. There were, 
              						even then, a great many learned men in the world, and it 
              						was some years before the compilation of the biographies 
              						was completed. The Prime Minister then informed the 
              						King. The king was much pleased. He would read the 
              						biographies and at last, he would know all there was to 
              						know about all the learned men of the world. The King 
              						decided that he would review the biographies on a 
              						special day, and when the day arrived, the King and his 
              						ministers gathered in the great reception hall of the 
              						palace. The order was given for the biographies to be 
              						brought before the King, and carriage after carriage 
              						rolled into the palace grounds. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          There was such a great number of carriages that 
              						a great cloud of dust was raised. It was as if an 
              						invading army had entered the Palace grounds. Carriage 
              						after carriage was filled to capacity with leather 
              						parchment biographies. What was the King to do? There 
              						was no way he could read all the biographies. He turned 
              						to his Prime Minister and ordered, "Make a summary of 
              						all the compilations!" What now was the Prime Minister 
              						to do. He too had neither the time, nor the inclination, 
              						to read the biographies. It would take his whole 
              						lifetime. However, the Prime Minister was a wise man, 
              						and he had some knowledge of the Abhidhamma. The next 
              						day, he presented the King with a summary of the 
              						biographies of all the learned men in the world. The 
              						summary had three lines. The King read the three lines, 
              						and was so pleased with what he read that a great smile 
              						spread across his face. The King had read:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          1. Learned men were born. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          2. Learned men lived.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          3. Learned men died.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          You cannot get a closer summary than that! And 
              						this is what Group Four of the Paticcasamuppada tells us 
              						too. "Life" has three parts; is to be born, to live, and 
              						then to die, or Jati, jara, marana.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          When we look at the Paticcasamuppada, we see 
              						two constituents that belong to the future, namely, Jati 
              						and jara-marana. If we, in our present life, are unable 
              						to rid ourselves of the causes, tanha, upadana, kamma 
              						bhava, then unfailingly, we will reap these two results, 
              						which are Jati and jara-marana. As the Prime Minister 
              						wisely realized, no matter how many lives are left to us 
              						before we realize the Eternal Bliss of Nibbana, we can 
              						say for certain that we will be born, and we will die. 
              						Birth and death. There is no need to elaborate, no need 
              						to say more than this. It is the biography of all men.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          In this world, man is faced with all kinds of 
              						troubles, problems, pain and misery. It is no wonder 
              						that people wish to be reborn as celestial beings in the 
              						deva world or the brahmas world. But even in the deva 
              						and Brahma worlds, where some constituents such as our 
              						gross mind-matter component may not be present as in the 
              						human world, all remain subject to Jati and jara-marana, 
              						birth and death. There is no need to elaborate, no need 
              						to say more than this. It is the biography of humans, 
              						devas and Brahmas. According to the Abhidhamma, life or 
              						existence is nothing more than an unending sequence of 
              						discrete phenomena, which arise and then pass away. 
              						Phenomena come into being or arise (uppada), they exist 
              						for an infinitesimally short moment (thiti) and then 
              						they pass away and disappear (bhanga). There is nothing 
              						else apart from these three phases. People in an 
              						intensive retreat for insight meditation should strive 
              						to realize this truth. </span></span></p>

              						to them. We allow these effects to anger us, or to

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          We have said that all biographies can be

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          They were born. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          They lived. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          They died. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Individual lives of course vary greatly in 
              						detail. Some are born into wealthy families. Some are 
              						born poor. But wealth is not all. Rich people can have 
              						lives filled with difficulties, hardships, great 
              						unhappiness, while materially poor people can have lives 
              						that are filled with happiness. Some are born with 
              						excellent health. Some are sickly. Some are long-lived, 
              						some are short-lived. Some are born with happy 
              						dispositions, or with inborn courage; others are easily 
              						agitated, frightened or worried. Some are born good- 
              						looking, some are ill-formed. Some are intelligent, 
              						other are less so. The list of differences between 
              						people is endless.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          And each of us lead lives, no two of which can 
              						be identical. Shakespeare wrote, "All the world's a 
              						stage." But who is the stage-master who assigns to each 
              						of us our roles? This stage-master is none other than 
              						our kamma, for the Buddha has said, </span></span><em> <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> "Beings are heirs to their kamma."</span></span></em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> To help us understand individual existences better, let 
              						us review Paticcasamuppada in reverse order. The 
              						Abhidhamma examines the experience of death in detail, 
              						but here, we will consider just two kinds of death, a 
              						good death, and a bad death. A good death is one in 
              						which a dying person recalls or thinks about wholesome 
              						deeds. If a person of bad character remembers or 
              						performs a good deed just before dying, he may receive a 
              						good rebirth. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          Alternatively, a good person may remember or do 
              						a bad deed before dying and thereby get a bad rebirth. 
              						Generally speaking, a person's death will be a 
              						reflection of how he has lived. To have lived well is 
              						generally to die well, and to have lived badly is 
              						generally to die badly. If a person desires a good 
              						death, he should live a good moral life, with goodwill 
              						and compassion towards all. If a person has lived in an 
              						agitated way, if greed, anger, delusion, self-deceit, 
              						envy, pride and self-interest have been the dominant and 
              						controlling factors in his life, then he is unlikely to 
              						have a gentle and peaceful death. Paticcasamuppada 
              						teaches us <em><span style="color: #800040;">"Jatipaccaya 
              						Jaramaranam"</span></em> The stage of becoming creates 
              						different deaths. It is because of the great variety and 
              						complexity of past deeds, or kamma, that there are a 
              						great variety and complexity of lives. Who is 
              						responsible for our well being in life? Who is to be 
              						blamed for our troubles? Who is to be thanked for our 
              						comforts. The truth is that our deeds are responsible 
              						for our present conditions in life. This is a basic 
              						tenet of the Buddha's teachings. A good Buddhist 
              						realizes that no one else is responsible for the 
              						conditions of his present life. He does not blame any 
              						one else for his troubles. They are self-made, the 
              						fruits of his past deeds. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          In general, past good kamma will give rise to 
              						good things in the present, and conversely, past bad 
              						kamma will give rise to bad things. If we have committed 
              						both good and bad things in the past, then we can expect 
              						our life to have ups and downs, like the flight of a 
              						wood pecker which is said to be high one moment, and low 
              						the next. But whatever ups and downs you may encounter, 
              						don't point the finger of blame at other people. 
              						Instead, review your past actions. Review your past 
              						states of mind to determine whether it is mostly 
              						goodwill or anger that has governed your deeds. This 
              						proposition teaches that wholesome and unwholesome 
              						kamma-formations are the cause of future rebirth and 
              						destiny. Also, <em><span style="color: #800040;"> "bhavapaccaya Jati"</span></em>- through the process of 
              						volitional acts is conditioned rebirth. This proposition 
              						teaches that through the whole some and unwholesome 
              						kamma process (kamma-bhava) is conditioned the 
              						rebirth-process (upapatti-bhava).</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          By kamma is meant not only actions in a past 
              						life, but past actions in this present life, and even 
              						actions in lives before the previous life. A person will 
              						do a great many deeds in a lifetime. Good or wholesome 
              						deeds, motivated by goodwill, compassion, faith, wisdom 
              						or knowledge, duty; and bad or unwholesome deeds 
              						motivated by desire, greed, anger, fear, envy, pride, 
              						selfish interest, and so on. There will be deeds done 
              						with great enthusiasm, or deeds done half-heartedly, or 
              						without interest. There will be deeds done with 
              						mindfulness, and deeds done in a careless or automatic 
              						way. People may appear to be carrying out similar 
              						actions, such as praying at the pagoda, or giving alms 
              						or donations, or cooking a meal, or speaking to friends, 
              						but what cannot be seen or guessed at will be their 
              						inner thoughts. Their outward actions may look the same, 
              						but their states of mind will vary greatly. And in all 
              						these acts, it is volition or "cetana' which is of great 
              						importance - "cetana', which is unseen, unknown to 
              						others, and varying greatly from one person to another. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          In any one situation, there is a great variety 
              						and complexity of acts being carried out by many people, 
              						each with different states of mind. Even within just one 
              						person, state of mind is extremely complex varying 
              						constantly, not just from hour to hour, but even from 
              						one moment to another. Even in the act of worship, in 
              						the calm of the early morning, many people are unable to 
              						maintain concentration and mindfulness but vagrant 
              						thoughts must flit constantly across their minds. Having 
              						come into a new existence, as we have stated previously, 
              						past kamma will bear fruit when the time and conditions 
              						are appropriate. There is no escaping kamma, although 
              						the interplay of kamma is so complex that weak kamma may 
              						be replaced or cancelled by stronger opposing kamma, or 
              						strengthened by similar kamma. Thus, a person may be 
              						enjoying a period of great comfort or success in life 
              						due to past wholesome kamma being in effect, when 
              						suddenly, counter-active or opposing kamma may come into 
              						play, bringing illness, or material loss. On the other 
              						hand, a person leading a rather miserly existence due to 
              						past unwholesome kamma may unexpectedly find life taking 
              						a turn for the better as past wholesome kamma come into 
              						effect.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          To illustrate the working of kamma, we here 
              						digress a little with the story of King Kusa, the 
              						Bodhisatta, and Princess Pabhavati (Papawati), who was 
              						in a later life to be Princess Yasodhara.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          In a previous lifetime, the Bodhisatta was the 
              						younger of two brothers, and lived with his elder 
              						brother. One day, he returned home late to find a cake 
              						meant for him had just been put into the bowl of a 
              						Pacceka-Buddha (silent Buddha) by his sister-in-law. He 
              						therefore spoke angrily to her, and snatched back his 
              						cake from the monk's bowl. Thereupon, his sister-in-law 
              						filled the monk's bowl with fresh butter, and made this 
              						wish: "As a result of this gift, may I be reborn 
              						beautiful, and not ever again have to live in the same 
              						household as this rude person (her brother in-law)". Not 
              						to be outdone, the younger brother put back the cake in 
              						the monk's bowl and wished: "And however far away she 
              						may be reborn, may I have with the power to make her my 
              						bride." The sister-in-law was reborn as Princess 
              						Pabhavati, the eldest and most beautiful daughter of a 
              						king. The younger brother was reborn as King Kusa. For 
              						first angrily snatching back the cake from the monk's 
              						bowl, he was born ugly,</span></span></p>

                come to practice meditation?</p>
              <p>           U Kyaw
                Thein: Yes Sire, I have come to practice meditation.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: All right,
                does your family give you the permission?</p>
              <p>            They
                gave me the permission Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Why do you
                come to meditate, is it that I have only asked you?</p>
              <p>            I want
                to be free of the suffering in Samsara, my lord.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Have you
                developed faith (Saddha) in your mind as well?</p>
              <p>            I have
                the faith Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: If that’s
                the case you must decide in your mind that you have the rarest opportunities
                for being a human who is born in the Buddha’s Sasana, and to have the chance
                to practice Vipassana that I am going to give you. You must also develop
                faith in you mind that it will help you to escape from the Samsaric
                sufferings of old age, ailments, death, and other misfortunes and make up
                your mind to follow the instructions meticulously.</p>
              <p>            Yes my
                Lord.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Maung Kyaw
                Thein, you must also decide not to think of your business and your family.
                Try to be detached from these by using wisdom.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire, I will renounce them.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You must
                rely on the three main principles (Adipadhi).</p>
              <p>            All
                right, but what are these three principles Sire?</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Yes, I will
                tell you. Firstly, you must remember that you need to rely on yourself; that
                you practice meditation not for your livelihood, but to release from the
                suffering of old age, disease, death, misfortunes and inconveniences. This is
                the Attadipadhi (self-reliance principle).</p>
              <p>            Yes Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Secondly,
                you must regard life as your next principle (Lokadipadhi). You must not
                pretend to meditate and think of all your life affairs. Don’t be lazy,
                apathetic, asleep and don’t let your mind roam. Don’t do anything that is not
                right for your guardian angel, good Devas and those who have Abhinna (super
                natural powers) know. So you must be shameful of yourself if you are not
                leading a good life.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You must
                regard Dhamma as the third principle (Dhammadipadhi). You must pay respect to
                the Dhamma and try to experience insight wisdom (Vipassana nana) directly.
                You must know that if you were not enlightened it was not that there was no
                Dhamma, but it was your fault that you did not pay due respect to the Dhamma
                principle. You must decide to have faith in this principle and strife with
                all your might.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire. If I take these as the main principles and meditate shall I be awakened
                in this very life, my Lord?</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Have you
                committed the Panchanandriya kamma (five cardinal sins)? Have you killed an
                Arahat?</p>
              <p>            No
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Have you
                killed your mother or your father?</p>
              <p>            No
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Have you
                ever caused a split among Sangha?</p>
              <p>            No I
                haven’t Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: All right,
                I won’t ask you whether you have caused any physical harm to the Buddha as it
                is not relevant now. If you have not committed any of these sins just try
                your best in the practice. It will take only seven years if a person is very
                dull, seven months for an average and seven days for very bright persons with
                the right practice. It won’t happen without practice. You must work hard with
                faith, mindfulness, concentration, energy, and wisdom (Saddha, Sati, Samadhi,
                Viriya and Panna).</p>
              <p>            Yes my
                Lord, I will work hard and follow your instructions.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: All right
                then. You take the eight precepts.</p>
              <p>[ After taking the eight precepts (refrain from killing, stealing,
                practising celibacy, refraining from telling lies, taking intoxicants, taking
                solid food after mid-day, and refraining from sensual indulgences such as
                perfume, cosmetics, music &amp; dancing, and handling money &amp; financial
                matters) ]</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Now you
                need to do the five rituals (Pubbakissa) during meditation.</p>
              <ol type="1">
              <li class="MsoNormal">Devote yourself to the
                     Buddha both, physically as well as mentally.</li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">Ask for pardon if you
                     have done any wrong to parents and holy people either physically,
                     verbally or with your mind.</li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">Propagate loving
                     kindness towards all sentient beings including your guardian angel and
                     those who watch over your property, your city and the Sarsana.</li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">Make a wish
                     (Adithanna) for all the merits that you have gained during this life and
                     in previous lives to result in enlightenment.</li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">Try to realise the
                     nature of dying (Marananussati) by thinking that you have died in your
                     uncountable past existences and that you will have to die some day. Try
                     to realise and persuade yourself that you must work hard before death
                     arrives and thereby develop the effort and energy to meditate. Do you
                     understand?</li>

                Sayadaw: All right, I’ll tell you. When you consider vision you have the eye

                the Nama. Likewise, all six sense organs and their objects are Rupas and the

              <li class="MsoNormal">        You
                     must recognise and differentiate between mind and matter in the present
                     sensation that develops. This is called Nataparinana.</li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">        You
                     must recognise and realise the impermanence, suffering and impersonal
                     qualities (Anissa, Dukkha and Anatta) of the present sensation. This is
                     called Tiranaparinana.</li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">        You
                     must realise that the present sensation is neither your body, nor your
                     mind and try to avoid clinging (Tanha) and self conceit (Mana) and
                     delusion or wrong view of regarding consciousness as your soul (Ditthi).
                     This is called Pahanaparinana. </li>

                Sayadaw: You must differentiate between mind and matter. Then do not go after
                the Jhana way (for attaining super natural powers). If a Yogi wants to
                overcome live and death and become awakened he needs concentration of the
                mind just enough to develop Samadhi. Then he must practise Vipassana.</p>

                Yes Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Switching over to Vipassana is just like a locomotive changing rails
                from one to another. The contemplation of the mind is moved from Samatha (one
                point) to the arising and dissolving phenomenon of the current Rupa-Nama
                (sensation). You must remember that this is led by the mind.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: You must do the contemplation of breathing (Anapanna) first. It is
                mindfulness of the incoming and outgoing breath. You must breathe in normally
                and fully. Do not force it or reduce it, but breathe in and out regularly.</p>

                Sayadaw: You can focus your mind on the lips at the tip of nostrils or at the
                sternum, but it is better to keep it at the tips of nostrils (to be sharper
                in developing concentration). Whatever site you have chosen you must try to
                be mindful continuously.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Yes Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Anapanusatti is the mindfulness that occurs when contemplated on the
                incoming and outgoing breaths. A Yogi practising Anapananusatti fixes the
                mind strongly on the breathing while taking breaths regularly and normally.
                He first focuses the mind on the tip of nostrils and watches as the air goes
                in and out.</p>

                Sayadaw: Apart from this mindfulness of the touch of air he must not divert
                his attention to any other object.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Yes Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: A Yogi who has developed concentration after practising Anapana must
                know that the person is not "you, I, male or female," but a
                collection of Rupa (matter) and Nama (mind) and a collection of the five
                aggregates. Then the Yogi must realise that the mind that registers this
                knowledge is the Nama. This Nama dwells in the heart. The physic that is in
                sitting meditation is the Rupa. You will come to know this reality by direct
                experience.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        After
                this differentiation of Rupa and Nama you must understand that the collection
                of twenty-four physical objects is the Rupatkhanda. The consciousness that
                knows is the Vinnanakhanda. Feelings that associate with the mind when
                contemplated on sensations are the aggregate of Vedanatkhanda. Recognition of
                the sensations that associate with the mind is the aggregate of Sanatkhanda.
                The other fifty concomitants of the mind, which include all volitional
                perceptions except consciousness and recognition, are known as the aggregate
                of Sankharatkhanda.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        I
                will need to explain further using the Paticca Samupadda to differentiate
                cause and effect relationships, as you may not understand thoroughly.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Yes Sire, its getting more and more clear by your explanations.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: That’s right. It is better to let a Yogi know the basics before
                giving the practical aspects.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: After you know the five aggregates you must also understand roughly
                that the past Avijja-Tanha (ignorance and attachments) are the causes of
                Rupa-Nama (body and mind).</p>

                respect to the Mogok Sayadaw and went to his allotted place, which was not
                far from the Sayadaw’s room. He then started to practise Anapana as he was
                instructed, but could not prevent his mind from roaming for the first half an
                hour. He over heard the dialog between the Mogok Sayadawand a traditional
                medicine practitioner who was attending to the Mogok Sayadawin his room. The
                practitioner was discussing about a certain medicine text and the Mogok
                Sayadaw:told him that Metta was even more effective than medicine. U Kyaw

                heard the Sayadaw’s voice as it was not possible for the Mogok Sayadaw:to see
                him from his room. There was another room in between his place and that of
                the Sayadaw. He did not know how he was caught, but became very astonished
                and concerned and tried his best to build up the concentration. He could not
                remember how long he had been meditating when he was summoned to see the
                Sayadaw. ]</p>

                Thein did you practise as I told you?</p>
              <p>            Yes I
                did. I have kept my mind at the sternum Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Did it stay
                where it was kept then?</p>
              <p>            No
                Sire, it didn’t at the beginning, but it stayed there later on.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: When
                Anapana is practised for an hour and have obtained Samadhi, it was not
                possible if you did not have perseverance. That is Viriya (effort) and with
                this effort you have managed to sit for an hour. This is called Samma vayama,
                the right effort.</p>
              <p>        Did your mind notice the
                movement of air at the sternum while you were breathing?</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire, I did.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right, you
                noticed the movement of air as you were mindful. This is called Samma sati,
                the right mindfulness.</p>

                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: When you
                were practising Anapana did you mind wander to your home? Where did it go?</p>
              <p>            No
                Sire, it didn’t go anywhere. It stayed at the sternum where it was kept.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right, that
                was Samma samadhi, the right concentration. Your mind has stayed where it was
                kept.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: All right,
                you have developed Samadhi. However, you need to develop it further by
                breathing through the nose, but not through the mouth. When you are breathing
                do not try to notice if you are breathing with your right or left nostril,
                but try to develop Samadhi. You don’t need to follow other Samatha methods.
                If you breathe through the nose you must know that it is through the nose and
                if you take a deep breath you must know that you are doing so.</p>
              <p>            Very
                well, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You have
                been instructed to keep your mind to the sternum at first. Now you must watch
                as the air touches the nostrils, sternum and umbilicus while you breathe in
                and vice versa as it goes out.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You must
                notice the outgoing and incoming air as if through the bellows and as a
                string of a lathe-file rubs the stick you must continuously watch the air at
                the place where it touches. You must notice when you breathe faster, and must
                know when it is slow. You must be aware when you breath is long/deep and also
                knows when it is short/shallow. However, you don’t need to watch the breath
                in a continuos stream. Just watch at the point of contact as if a saw cuts
                through the timber, but not along the edge of the saw. You must focus your
                mind at the point of contact of the air with the nostrils.</p>
              <p>            I will,
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: If you
                practise in this way and be mindful you can develop Samadhi within fifteen
                minutes when you become accustomed to it.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You need to
                know that it is the Rupa (matter) that was doing the breathing and it is the
                Nama (consciousness) that knew what you were doing. When you can
                differentiate between Nama and Rupa the knowledge developed is called
                Namarupa pariccheda nana (analytical knowledge of mind and matter). Cleansing
                of views is also involved simultaneously, which is known as Ditthi visuddhi.
                Remember this carefully.</p>
              <p>            Yes

              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: When you
                meditate you must know the followings.</p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li class="MsoNormal">You need to know that
                     there are two components of the mind. Mental factors (Cetisaka) and
                     consciousness (Citta).</li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">The mental factor
                     (thought) must be in line with the consciousness when you contemplate.</li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">Do not let the mental
                     factor go astray from the consciousness.</li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">Do not think of
                     anything while meditating. Don’t let any thoughts come into the mind. If
                     you can master your mind you can eliminate defilement (Kilesa). If you
                     don’t you will neither be successful in your life nor can you eradicate
                     the 1500 Kilesas.</li>

                a herd tender wanted to tame a raw cow he needs to put a post firmly into the
                ground, insert a rein into the cow’s nose, and tie it to the post and tame
                her. Likewise, you must tame your mind by fixing it to the cord of
                mindfulness (Sati) and tie it up to the post of the object of contemplation
                in your practice. Do you understand?</p>

                went into a burrow that had six holes, you need to close five holes and wait
                at the sixth. The analogy to this procedure would be to close all the five
                sense doors, namely your ears, eyes, nose, body, your tongue and then to wait
                at the last door, which is your mind. You will surely catch the thought as it
                occurs, just like you catch the lizard. Is that clear?</p>

                I started at 11.30 PM and stopped
                at 1AM, Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: How was your Samadhi?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                I could manage to get it Sire, but barely.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Why was that?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                I must admit that I felt sleepy Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Shame on you. That was due to excess in your determination. You must
                have persisted to meditate in your sitting posture. You should have changed
                it and did walking meditation instead, if you felt sleepy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Yes Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: It is all right to change the posture for beginners. As you become
                more experienced you may not need to change the posture when you feel sleepy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                How would I do it Sire? I don’t know how to evade sleepiness without changing
                posture.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: When you become sleepy how was your breathing? Was it quicker or
                slower?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                It was slow and shallow, Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Right, the breathing will be slower and you feel sleepy. Then what
                about your Sati at that time?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                It was poor, Sire. I was not mindful at that time.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: "Ca catawva acasati, ca tawva pacasati." As mentioned in
                the Maha Satipatthana Sutta a Yogi who practises Anapana must breathe in and
                out with mindfulness. But you have lost mindfulness, you must never let it
                go.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                I admit I lost mindfulness, Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: You must breathe in fully and then breathe out fully. (You must
                notice as soon as the breathing becomes slower and correct it by breathing
                fully again. If you do not notice as soon as the breathing gets slower you
                may go into torpor and soon become sleepy) You must never let the mindfulness
                escape. If you breathe fully in this way for ten to fifteen minutes you can
                become alert again.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Yes Sire, now I understand.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Another thing is, when you become angry don’t you breathe more
                harshly?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Yes I do, Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Right, why does the breathing become quick and harsh?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                I have no idea, Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Maung Kyaw Thein, you note this down well. When you are angry your
                blood in the heart is bright red and hot. As the heart needs to beat faster
                it needs more energy and you have to breathe much faster. (Thus, the blood
                became redder and hot due to increased turbulence and flow)</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Yes Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: When you recover from anger don’t you feel that your body is weary
                and tired?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                It is, Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Why is that?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                I don’t know, Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Because your heart beats much faster, but you do not realise it
                during the anger as you are not aware. Only after it you came to know about
                the situation and you become weary and tired.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Exactly Sire, I have the experience.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: Sometimes when you are carried away by greed or desire, you say you
                do not have the time to become tired, don’t you?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Yes I do, Sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: That is you have followed your desires instead of your mind.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Yes sire.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: When you meditate Anapana you must relax your body and your muscles.
                Only then you can breathe regularly and correctly. The Buddha said
                "Pacambayan Kayasankharan." That is you must breathe neither slowly
                nor quickly, and neither shallow nor deep, but regularly.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">           
                Yes Sire, I will follow your instructions, but what shall I pay more
                attention?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">        Mogok
                Sayadaw: You remember this very carefully. It is only Sati (concentration)
                that is never in excess. Saddha, Samadhi, Viriya, Panna (faith,
                concentration, effort and knowledge) must be developed simultaneously. If you
                could not develop them simultaneously and equally they would not be well
                balanced and either Uddhacca (distraction) or Htina middha (torpor or sloth)
                would result. At present, you have been instructed to meditate just to
                develop Samadhi. Don’t let it mix with anything else!</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">

              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You
                continue with the meditation after you have your breakfast. Only then you
                will develop the Samadhi. When you meditate let faith, knowledge,
                concentration and effort be well balanced as I have told you earlier. I am
                taking my time to explain in detail as you are a beginner. What’s so
                difficult to about practising Anapana. Go and practise till your Samadhi is
                strong and then come back.</p>
              <p>        [ When the Mogok Sayadaw
                left U Kyaw Thein had his breakfast and continued his practice from six to
                eight in the morning. However, he did not have strong Samadhi despite the
                extended practice and he had to try repeatedly using all available means. ]</p>
              <p>        [ After eight o’clock U
                Kyaw Thein helped preparing the meal for the Mogok Sayadaw together with
                those who came to the monastery for offering the necessities for Sangha. When
                everything was done he went to the Mogok Sayadaw:at nine o’clock to be assessed on his progress. ]</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: How are you
                doing Maung Kyaw Thein? Have you developed good Samadhi?</p>
              <p>            Yes my
                Lord, I have developed a strong Samadhi now.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: What
                position have you taken to meditate?</p>
              <p>            Sire, I
                have done sitting meditation at the first hour and then did the walking
                meditation for the rest of the time.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You didn’t
                look like you have strong Samadhi though you said so.</p>
              <p>            Can
                you, my Lord, tell exactly if a person has Samadhi or not just by looking the
                external appearances?</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw smiled and
                replied "Dear Maung Kyaw Thein, I will explain to you later how
                different a person looked if he had the Samadhi. Take a bath after you have
                your meal and then make sure that you have no inconveniences. Otherwise you
                may have to disrupt the practise if you have the call of nature while
                meditating. These things are very interfering with the practice."</p>
              <p>        [ Only then U Kyaw Thein
                realised his fault of having inconveniences while he was meditating earlier
                as he did not go to the loo before the six o’clock
                sitting. Now he did as he was advised and started the meditation from twelve noon till two o’clock. Later on he went to see the Mogok
                Sayadaw:in his room. Being a beginner he was given a special privilege to
                visit the Mogok Sayadawas often as he wished if he had any problems. ]</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Have you
                developed a strong Samadhi now?</p>
              <p>            Yes
                sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right, you
                now have the Samadhi, but you must remember that Samadhi is like a column of
                mercury in a thermometer. It can go up and down according to the condition.
                When you are in meditation it is good. However, if you encounter with crude
                sensuality it can go down again.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire, but I have a strong Samadhi now.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: All right,
                it’s enough. You can change over to Vipassana. First you must try to develop
                good Samadhi and then go to Vipassana.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You are
                asked to do Samadhi not to encourage you to practise Samatha. You must let go
                of the mindful breathing as soon as the mind is calm and then contemplate on
                any sensation that develops without any breach. If you contemplate more and
                more on sensations you will come to a point where you can overcome them. You
                will no longer register them as sensations, but only as arising or dissolving
                phenomenon. You will realise that all sensations including pleasant ones,
                unpleasant ones and neutral ones dissipate and come to an end. When you
                contemplate on sensations Vedana will appear, but when you watch them with
                analytical knowledge you will come to know that they are impermanent
                (Aniccha). If this wisdom is developed it can be regarded as the overcoming
                of Vedana (sensual perception). If you couldn’t comprehend the impermanence
                of sensual perceptions you haven’t overcome Vedana as yet. When a Yogi has
                surpassed Vedana or has eliminated them the Yogi will feel light, agile and
                fresh even after the meditation is over. That is why one needs to try hard to
                overcome Vedana. Mindfulness of breathing in Samatha is just to make the mind
                calm, but it cannot lead to Nibbana. You must remember this very well.</p>
              <p>            Yes my
                Lord.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Vipassana
                is to keep the mind on the wisdom path and watch and realise the phenomenon
                of mind and matter as they are. The physical body that we have at present is
                continuously forming and decaying from cradle to coffin. It must be
                comprehended that impermanence (Aniccha), suffering (Dukkha) and impersonal
                characteristics (Anatta) are the only realities that can be found.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: When Rupa
                and Nama (body and mind) are comprehended as Aniccha, Dukkha and Anatta
                repeatedly, and the arising and dissolving phenomenon are perceived it is
                known to have reached the Udayabbaya nana. You remember? Do you understand?</p>
              <p>            Yes my
                Lord.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You need to
                know these facts clearly. If they are not clarified beforehand using acquired
                knowledge your progress will not be substantial. So I will have to go further
                to remove false views (Ditthi) and doubts (Vicikccha). Maung Kyaw Thein, if
                you want to be a stream winner (Sotapanna) what should you remove first?</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire, I need to remove Ditthi and Vicikiccha first.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right,
                where do false views and doubts lie?</p>
              <p>            I have
                no idea, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Ditthi and
                Vicikiccha are attached with the five aggregates of mind and matter.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire, now I know.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Now you
                know that they are attached to the five aggregates. If you do not know where
                these five aggregates come from and how they are arising and dissolving, you
                could not remove false views and doubts by any means.</p>
              <p>            All
                right, my Lord.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You may
                have the book knowledge or have acquired from teachers that the five
                aggregates are Rupakhanda, Vedanakhanda, Sannakhanda, Sankharakhanda and
                Vinnanakhanda, but if you do not know the causes and reasons for their
                becoming and disintegration false views would adhere to you despite the acquired
                knowledge. That is why you need to know Paticcasamupadda, the cycle of
                dependant arising first if you want to have insight into the five aggregates.
                So, I will teach you the Paticcasamupadda. Go and fetch the cycle of
                dependant arising chart from my room. Do you still remember anything about
                Paticcasamupadda?</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire, I could remember only a few aspects.</p>
              <p>        [ When he brought the
                chart]</p>
              <p>        The Mogok Sayadaw said
                "Right, place it in front of you. I’ll show you. What you have learnt
                about dependant arising in the past was only an acquired knowledge."</p>
              <p>            I have
                only the book knowledge, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: If you do
                not know Paticcasamupadda there is no way you can know the aggregates. If you
                do not know the aggregates, false views will adhere. That’s why you need to
                comprehend Paticcasamupadda. Book knowledge is not enough.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire, I will try to understand it.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Do you
                still remember it by heart?</p>
              <p>            Yes I
                do, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: In that
                case I won’t elaborate on it (Please refer to Paticcasamupadda on the web
                site). You must remember that there are two forms of dependant arising. What
                you know from the book about Paticcasamupadda is one thing and there is also
                another Paticcasamupadda that is arising and dissolving in the body. You must
                understand the Paticcasamupadda of the body in order to make progress. Do you
                follow me?</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>Pointing at the diagram of the circle of dependent arising The Mogok Mogok
                Sayadawcontinued "That’s why I am going to show you the causes and
                reasons for arising and dissolving of the five aggregates. Do you know that
                your volitional responses (Sankhara) of the past existence, which were
                carried out without wisdom (Avijja) have resulted in the body that you have
                it now?"</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Those were
                in the past and therefore they were out of your control. They were past
                Paticcasamupadda and did not concern you. Again the future Paticcasamuppada has
                not arrived yet and so it does not concern you. The most important thing is
                to understand the present Paticcasamupadda. Is that clear?</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Which
                Samupadda concerns you?</p>
              <p>            The
                present one my Lord.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: What about
                the past?</p>
              <p>            It
                doesn’t concern us, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: And the
                future?</p>
              <p>            No
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Where do
                false views and doubts attach?</p>
              <p>            To the
                five aggregates, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right, they
                are attached to the five aggregates. If I ask you whose hair is this, you
                will answer that it is your hair. The false view attaches to Rupakhanda, the
                hair. If I say that the tea is very nice, it attaches to Vedanakhanda, the feeling
                or taste. If I say that this sentence is written by me, I note down this
                line, then the false view attaches to Sannakhanda, the interpretation of a
                feeling. When I say that my weaving is exceptionally good, then the false
                view attaches to Sankharakhanda, the reaction to a feeling. And if I say
                "Don’t you dare try me" then the false view attaches to the
                Vinnakhanda, the consciousness or self esteem. These are the places of
                attachment, do you follow me?</p>
              <p>            Yes
                sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Then you
                must detach the false views and doubts from the aggregates. Theoretically, if
                Rupa and Nama (matter and mind) can be differentiated they say that false
                views are detached. However, there is one more thing to understand.</p>
              <p>        Only when you understand the
                cause of Paticcasamupadda and the effect of Paticcasamupadda you will detach
                yourself from false views and doubts. If you know the cause of aggregates you
                can eliminate the false views. If you don’t, the false views will stay. If
                you know that the effect (of anything that happens in you) is due to the
                causes of aggregates, then you can eliminate the false views totally.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: If you
                understand that there are only causes and effects, but no persons and beings
                (non-personalised view) you can eliminate the false views.</p>
              <p>            Very
                well, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: What you
                need to work is the present Paticcasamupadda. It doesn’t mean the whole day,
                but what you see or hear at the present moment. It is important to watch the
                present moment when you meditate now. Don’t recall the past and don’t look
                forward to the future, but watch what is happening at present. By the way,
                how old are you now?</p>
              <p>            Forty,
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right, even
                if your are forty you may consider that you have the same appearance as you
                were in your younger age, then it is Sassata Ditthi, the unchanging perverted
                view.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: If you
                consider that you can risk your life for money, that you do not care about
                your life as you think that there is nothing after dying (dying is better
                than suffering), then it is Uccheda Ditthi, the annihilation view. You must
                not consider like this as well. Do you understand?</p>
              <p>            Yes, my
                Lord.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You must
                cleanse of these two false views (Sassata and Uccheda dtithi) first before
                you meditate.</p>
              <p>            Yes,
                I’ll do it, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: If you know
                the disintegration phenomena of mind and matter you cleanse the Sassata ditthi,
                and if you know the arising phenomena you cleanse the Uccheda ditthi.</p>
              <p>            I’ve
                cleansed them, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right, it
                is only with the book knowledge. Is that clear? Don’t attach yourself to mind
                and matter as "You, me."</p>
              <p>            Very
                well, Sire. I will no longer get attached.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Then it is
                enough. Go to a quiet place and start the meditation. You practise Samatha
                only to get a good Samadhi (concentration). Sit straight, know the incoming
                and outgoing breaths, the Samadhi will become good, then you must not lax the
                effort at that time. Let the awareness (Sati) and knowledge (Panna) go
                together, the physical body will start showing changes and you will notice
                sensations (Vedana). Try to overcome the feeling that arises, if you watch
                your mind focus on the thoughts. If a sound is heard while watching thoughts
                you must notice that it is heard.</p>
              <p>            Very
                well, Sire. I will watch and register whatever comes.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right,
                after you register it you must consider that your mind is your consciousness.
                Then contemplate on the incoming and outgoing breaths with your consciousness
                and consider that those are the two hosts of consciousness. If you hear a
                sound while watching it is the hearing consciousness, if you smell anything
                with your nose it is the smelling consciousness. Likewise you register your
                taste consciousness with your tongue and seeing consciousness with your eyes.
                If you feel a pleasant sensation on your body it is the pleasant consciousness,
                if it is unpleasant it is the unpleasant consciousness.</p>
              <p>        "Dukkha sahagata
                kayaVinnana sukha sahagata kayaVinnana" as the literature goes, there
                will be an unpleasant feeling on the body sometimes and a pleasant feeling on
                the body. There are altogether six consciousness including these two on the
                body. You note it down.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Are these
                six thoughts always occurring in the mind?</p>
              <p>            No
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: They occur
                occasionally, so they must be regarded as "External Visiting
                Consciousness."</p>
              <p>            Right
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: When one
                thought occurs the other five thoughts do not arise. If a mosquito bites you
                while watching (your two hosts) breathing consciousness, an itching or an
                unpleasant consciousness may follow, then watch that itching consciousness.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: How many
                external visiting thoughts are there altogether?</p>
              <p>            Six,
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right, are
                these thoughts always there?</p>
              <p>            No
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Next, there
                are five "Internal Visiting Thoughts" that associate with
                consciousness. They are thoughts of greediness (Loba), anger (Dosa), delusion
                (Moha), absence of grasping (Aloba), and absence of aversion (Adosa). Amoha
                is not included here as it is the consciousness that must watch other
                thoughts. Therefore, the five internal visitors and six external visitors,
                altogether eleven visiting thoughts must be watched whatever that arises in the
                consciousness. When one thought arises the other five do not arise. Just
                watch the existing thought that occurs.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right, if
                none of these thoughts occur go back to the consciousness of breathing in and
                out and watch continuously. These two are the hosts consciousness, remember?</p>
              <p>            Yes I
                do, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You must
                follow the example of a spider while meditating. Spiders make webs and wait
                in the middle to catch any insects that are caught in the web. They go after
                whatever insect that is caught in the web, devour them and return to the
                middle. As a spider waits in the middle when there is no insect, you must
                also do the same and watch your breath when there is no thought.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: When you
                contemplate on consciousness a thought that tells you to start meditating
                will arise first. Watch that first thought and you will notice that it arises
                and falls subsequently. It will disappear as soon as you sit down to
                meditate.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Try to see
                it with your mind. When you contemplate on it you will know that it has
                disappeared. This sort of knowing of actual phenomena (what’s happening) is
                called Yathabuta nana.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: If there is
                no thought arising, you watch the incoming and outgoing breaths alternately.
                You need to watch this very carefully. If you can follow this quickly you
                will progress, but if you are less aware of it your progress will be slow. If
                there is a defilement (Kilesa) in-between the two breathing consciousness you
                won’t progress. Try to prevent the Kilesa intervention. If there is no object
                of meditation and you don’t watch, Avijja can come in. You must be aware of
                this fact. Do you understand? Now go and meditate.</p>
              <p>            Very
                well, Sire.</p>

              <p>            Yes my
                Lord, and I also saw the Divine light.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Oh no, you
                don’t have to bother these. When Samadhi is good you can experience all
                Panata nimita (conditioned signs such as light, halo, smoke, rapture etc.) as
                well as Paramatta nimita (unconditioned signs). You do not have to follow
                these (as they can retard the progress).</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire. Mogok Sayadaw: Did you experience Vedana as well? Yes I did, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: How did you
                experience?</p>
              <p>            When I
                sat for a long period my legs became painful, Sire.</p>
              <p>         Mogok Sayadaw: Did you
                follow that?</p>
              <p>           Yes I
                did, Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: You have
                created yourself pain unnecessarily. You need to know the right posture for
                sitting meditation.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire, I do not know how to sit properly.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Sit in a
                cross-legged position, put your spine straight, don’t lean to either the
                front or to the side. Don’t let your head bend either. When your body above
                the spine moves back and forth or sideways, the spinal column doesn’t stay in
                alignment and you will feel pain often. If that was the case you couldn’t get
                Samadhi, let alone to overcome Vedana. The lower part of the body should also
                not to be under severe pressure. Don't’ let the legs press each other
                (semi-lotus position). If you let the legs pressed, they will become numb and
                painful as the vessels are occluded. If you do not sit in the proper position
                you create pain unnecessarily. Do you understand? These facts are important
                for beginners like you. The Sayadaw let the Yogis meditate in whatever
                posture they prefer, but he recommended sitting posture as it could give
                concentration easily. For those who haven’t started the practise yet they
                should consider their health in choosing the posture. Sayadaw mostly used
                layman terms and examples to suit the audience. The following dialog has been
                written from U Kyaw Thein’s notes while he attended the Sayadaw every night.
                The author expressed his responsibility if there were any errors.</p>
              <p>         Mogok Sayadaw: The
                incoming and outgoing breaths must be regular. If they are too harsh or too
                rapid it will be like a self-torture. When you inhale your breath air and
                heat (Tejo) enters the lungs through the pharynx, larynx, trachea, right and
                left bronchus. It then reaches the air sacs through very small tubes and the
                energy (Tejo) is transferred to the various parts of the body. So, you must
                sit straight to let the lungs expand. Only when the air sacs are filled with
                air you can sit for hours. If you cannot fill or empty the lungs fully you
                can become breathless and tired. This is important for those who meditate.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: When you
                take a breath the heart beats four times. You breathe approximately sixteen
                to eighteen times per minute, then the heart beats from sixty four to seventy
                two times. If you breathe rapidly just imagine how much the heart has to
                beat. You may get ailments instead of the Dhamma.</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire we are sure to get disorders instead.</p>
              <p>         Mogok Sayadaw: A Yogi
                meditates in order to attain Nibbana that is free of all sufferings. It is
                not possible to acquire the objective by an extreme practice such as
                self-mortification. The Buddha had admitted that he did not obtain Magga and
                Phala nana when he practised Dukkhacariya (self-mortification). That’s why
                you need to strive moderately following the Middle Path (Majjima padipadda,
                in-between the two extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification).</p>
              <p>            Yes
                Sire, I will strive moderately.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Right, I
                will tell you further how the body functions. Powered by Tejo, energy
                obtained through the lungs, nourishment is produced in the intestinal tract
                and it is distributed towards all parts of the body (the arising phenomenon).
                The blood carries back the waste products that are harmful and toxic. They
                are excreted from the respective organs and are disposed off as sweat,
                gasses, faeces and urine (the dissipating phenomenon). The toxic and bad
                gasses must be disposed off through the lungs with the expired air. Blood is
                pumped through the vessels by the beating of the heart and is therefore
                rising and falling as well. The bad blood that is foul and dark is pumped to
                the lungs and the purified red blood that carries new Tejo comes back to the
                chamber of the heart. This excretion and purification process goes on and on
                and we call this as staying alive. (The Sayadaw explained the physiology that
                he had experienced in layman’s terms)</p>
              <p>            Yes Sir
                only with your explanation I now know how we are staying alive.</p>
              <p>        Mogok Sayadaw: Our heart
                is about the size of a fist. It has a dry red colour and has a hollow
                chamber. In this chamber there is a fistful of red blood. This good blood is
                pumped towards various parts of the body four times during a singl</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>

              <h1>Daniel Ingram's Free Book and Handouts</h1>
              Nearly all of my earlier writings have been compiled, edited, expanded and integrated into a work called <em>Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha, An Unusually Hardcore Dharma Book</em>.
              I think it is one of the more practical and technically detailed
              manuals for high-level insight and concentration practice available,
              and its maps of spiritual terrain and advice for navigating in unusual
              territory are world-class. It is available in Adobe (.pdf) format for
              download below and is about 1.4 megabytes. When printed, the book is
              about 392 pages. In 2007 and 2008 I rewrote a substantial portion of
              the chapter on the Models of the Stages of Enlightenment.<br> <br> The book is also available in <a href="http://web.mac.com/danielmingram/iWeb/Daniel%20Ingram%27s%20Dharma%20Blog/The%20Blook/The%20Blook.html">blog format (blook)</a> to make for easier browsing and on-line reading for those who don't want to download one of the files below.
              <br><br> Aeon Pulications, a division of <a href="http://www.karnacbooks.com/catfulllist.php?CAT=aeon">Karnac</a>, out of London, will be publishing the book sometime this year if all goes well. I'll let you know when it is done.
              <br><br> My book has parts of it that are suitable for beginners, but some of it
              is likely to be somewhat daunting unless you are into hardcore
              practice.
              <br><br> Many books that are very suitable for beginners may be found in my <a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/booklist.shtml">book list</a>.
              <br><br> You may quote my book if you reference it properly, do not alter the text you quote, and do not use quotes out of context.
              Please realize that it is bound by the standard limitations of language and the author.

              <p>I see... thanks for the resources. Where do you live by the way?</p>
              <p>Regarding arhat,</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/arahats.shtml">http://www.interactivebuddha.com/arahats.shtml</a></p>
              <p>...The basics about arahats:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Arahat is a Pali word that gets spelled a lot of ways and translated a lot of ways, such as Saint, Conquerer, Holy One, etc.</li>
              <li>Arahatship is the goal of Theravada Buddhism, which some people call Hinayana Buddhism.</li>
              <li>Arahatship designates the perfection of mastery of training in
                  Wisdom, the Third Training in Buddhism, with the other two trainings
                  being Morality and Concentration.</li>
              <li>Saying one his an arahat is the same as saying that one has
                  directly and completely realized the Truth of Things that is beyond
                  conditions.</li>
              <li>Another way of saying it is that the process of falsely imputing a
                  "self" from the sensations that make up the body, mind, and world has
                  stopped because these sensations have been directly perceived as they
                  are.</li>
              <li>Theravada Buddhism defines 5 basic stages of awakening, called the
                  Four Paths and Buddhahood, with some subcategories noted on occasion.</li>
              <li>The Four Paths are increasingly complete perceptions of Ultimate Reality.</li>
              <li>The Four Paths are, in order of increasing understanding, and with Pali names in parenthesis:<ol>
              <li>Stream Entry, a.k.a First Path (Sotapanna)</li>
              <li>Once Returner, a.k.a Second Path (Sakadagami)</li>
              <li>Never Returner, a.k.a Third Path (Anagami)</li>
              <li>Pick your favorite traslation as above, a.k.a Fourth Path (Arahat).</li>
              </ol></li>
              <li>Arahatship is also called the opening of the Wisdom Eye, as
                  differentiated from the Dharma Eye which opens at stream entry. These
                  are simply fine points that poetically restate what those realizations
                  entail.</li>
              <li>There is a phenomena in which the Wisdom Eye may open, which
                  qualifies one as an arahat, but then close again. These people are
                  arahats, but they are a lesser subcategory of arahats. Full arahats
                  have had the Wisdom Eye open and stay open, meaning that they have
                  obtained the understandings listed below and those have not faded.</li>
              <li>Arahatship designates an understanding that has the following characteristics:
                  <ol>
              <li>The arahat has seen through the sense that there is a continuous,
                  separate, or special controller, doer, observer, or centerpoint that is
                  "who they are" in a very direct perceptual way that is not merely an
                  intellectual or conceptual understanding.</li>
              <li>They know the sensations that seemed to imply these to be just more
                  sensations arising and vanishing according to conditions as they always
                  have been.</li>
              <li>This is not something they have to work to maintain, but instead is something that has stopped.</li>
              <li>The arahat knows in real time and directly what is meant by such phrases and concepts as:<ol>
              <li>"in the thinking is only the thought, in the seeing is only the seen, etc."</li>
              <li>intrinsic luminosity</li>
              <li>the emptiness of phenomena</li>
              <li>that Nibbana is found in Samsara</li>
              <li>and a whole host of other poetic metaphors and attempts as description.</li>
