            <div class='col-md body'>In total, Totality in Buddhism is the functioning of all 18 Dhatus. As Thusness comments further, an insight practitioner further does away with mental labeling and perceptions, and experiences 18 Dhatus as 18 Dhatus (as Thusness and my Dharma teacher used to say, a practitioner only has the first 2 skhandas in play, while perception, volition, and dualistic consciousness is dissolved through practise, insight and bare awareness), only sense awareness and objects of sense awareness.<br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.001.than.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.001.than.html</a><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>The Tathagata</strong><br><br>"The Tathagata Â— a worthy one, rightly self-awakened Â— directly knows earth as earth. <strong>Directly knowing earth as earth, he does not conceive things about earth, does not conceive things in earth, does not conceive things coming out of earth, does not conceive earth as 'mine,' does not delight in earth.</strong> Why is that?

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>25. The term unity refers to a homogeneous spiritual brilliance which separates into six harmoniously blended 'elements'. The homogeneous spiritual brilliance is the One Mind, while the six harmoniously blended 'elements' are the six sense organs.<br><br>These six sense organs become severally united with objects that defile them -- the eyes with form, the ear with sound, the nose with smell, the tongue with taste, the body with touch, and the thinking mind with entities. Between these organs and their objects arise the six sensory perceptions, making eighteen sense-realms in all.<br><br>If you understand that these eighteen realms have no objective existence, you will bind the six harmoniously blended 'elements' into a single spiritual brilliance -- a single spiritual brilliance which is the One Mind.<br><br>All students of the Way know this, but cannot avoid forming concepts of 'a single spiritual brilliance' and 'the six harmoniously blended elements'. Accordingly they are chained to entities and fail to achieve a tacit understanding of original Mind.</strong><br><br>~ Zen Master Huang Po, from 'The Zen Teaching of Huang Po: On the Transmission of Mind' translated by John Blofeld</div>
