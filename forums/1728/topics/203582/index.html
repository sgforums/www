            <div class='col-md body'>I believe it could be possible (just a guess) to manipulate the different dimensions and access the past or the future in consciousness, just as certain clairvoyants and psychics may achieve such feats. My Shi Fu actually once looked into a building and all the visions and images of the entire building's past, who build it, when was it built etc spontaneously manifested to him. He asked those around him to look and it will reveal, but even Missionary Chen could not understand him at that time. In another instance, in one of his dharma talks, he said that 'there is something very strange and amazing' - that we can all access the past in a few hundred years time (advanced technology?) and everything that is said in this talk will be seen (not by audio and video but literally like "accessing the past")<br><br>However the dharmadhatu is beyond all space, time, dimensions, and also pervades all space, all time, all dimensions.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Buddha abides in the infinite, the unobstructed, ultimate realm of reality, in the realm of space, in the essence of True Thusness, without birth or death, and in ultimate truth, appearing to sentient beings according to the time, sustained by past vows, without ever ceasing, not abandoning all beings, all lands, all phenomena....<br><br>How should enlightening beings see the body of Buddha? (Dharmakaya) They should see the body of Buddha in infinite places. Why? They should not see Buddha in just one thing, one phenomenon, one body, one land, one being--they should see Buddha everywhere. Just as space is omnipresent, in all places, material or immaterial, yet without either arriving or not arriving there, because space is incorporeal, in the same way Buddha is omnipresent, in all places, in all beings, in all things, in all lands, yet neither arriving nor not arriving there, because Buddha's body is incorporeal, manifesting a body for the sake of sentient beings.<br><br>- Garland Sutra</span><br><br>I think all dimensions from 1 to 10 are based on relativity.

Great mystics though experienced the Â‘Apparent in the RealÂ’ knows not the emptiness nature seek the invisible from the visible, hold tightly to the formless.  Not knowing that neither the form nor formless are both notions of the marvelous activities of emptiness nature.

            <div class='col-md body'>here's a similar links that i posted before:<br>u can listened to the interview, it's quite interesting.<br><a href="http://www.mkaku.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mkaku.org/</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dr. M.

            <div class='col-md body'>..but regarding the 11th dimension thingy...<br><br>as we know there's the 6 samsaric realms and the 4 noble realms adding up to 10. and beyond them is the One True Realm. Buddha West land and the Avatamsaka World IS part of One True Realm. so we have a 11th dimension so to speak.<br>if not it's just sort of corresponding to the desire realms only. 11th dimension is Paranirmitavasavartin(Devas Wielding Power over the Creation of Others).<br><br><img src="http://web.singnet.com.sg/~alankhoo/Desire.JPG"><br><br>hmm..<br>/\<br></div>
