              Dalai Lama?’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Owen Gleiberman August 8,
              2017 | Variety</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Twenty-four
              years after his first film about the 14th Dalai Lama, director Mickey Lemle
              takes you right up close to the Tibeten holy one's presence — and wisdom. But
              will China crush his legacy?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              thing you want from a documentary about his holiness the 14th Dalai Lama is the
              chance to get right up close to him, in the way that movies can do. You want
              the chance to bask in his presence and come out with a heightened sense of what
              he’s about. “The Last Dalai Lama?” accomplishes that, and with an offhand eloquence,
              though it’s a sketchy, catch-as-catch-can movie — an update, of sorts, by the
              director Mickey Lemle of his previous documentary about the incomparable
              Buddhist leader, “Compassion in Exile: The Story of the 14th Dalai Lama,”
              released 24 years ago.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              new film makes extensive use of footage that was shot for that one, back when
              the Dalai Lama, then in his late 50s, was still relatively youthful and hale.
              In “The Last Dalai Lama?,” the twinkle in his eye hasn’t aged, and neither has
              his offhand way of staring at whoever he’s talking to with a concentrated gaze
              that’s more worldly than beatific. He’s canny, sage, playful, serious; he
              drinks people in and sizes them up. But the eyes now crinkle, and he is bent
              over, with a bad knee that makes him walk slowly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              Last Dalai Lama?” opens in 2015, during a celebration in New York of the Dalai
              Lama’s 80th birthday, and as he saunters on stage in his red-and-yellow monk’s
              robes, with his shaved head and his trademark glasses and purse-lipped smile,
              it’s a little like watching an event organized to honor the Buddhist Santa
              Claus. The Dalai Lama would probably be the first to point out that everything
              about him that’s famous and iconic and legendary and “one-of-a-kind” is stuff
              that just gets in the way of letting you really see him. He has become a cosmic
              celebrity, and there isn’t a concept on earth that could be less Buddhist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              film goes back to paint in his history, with photographs and film footage from
              the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s, and it’s a wonder to see these silvery dusty images
              now, because they have the effect of a true-life fairy tale: the boy who was
              plucked from the obscurity of poverty, at age two, and declared to be the
              reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama, then raised and molded into a kind of
              Jedi Knight of enlightenment — and who then, in 1950, after the birth of
              Communist China, when he was a skinny teenager with a bright eager grin, went
              to have a summit meeting with Chairman Mao.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              fascinating now to hear his first impressions of Mao, whom he found, on a
              personal level, to be “so gentle, so friendly”; in hindsight, it’s a bit like
              hearing that Ted Bundy always came off as such an all-American nice guy. He
              initially believed that Mao would let Tibet stand as an independent region, but
              in 1959 the Tibetan government was crushed, and Tibet itself was coerced into
              the People’s Republic of China. We hear tales of the Dalai Lama’s escape to
              India, and of what happened to a number of his associates — including one of
              his brothers — who were captured and imprisoned by the Chinese.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              brother, interviewed by Lemle, says that his single greatest struggle during
              that time was to hold onto his compassion — that is, his compassion for his
              captors. To see their humanity, regardless of their cruelty. That’s the sort of
              comment where you hear it in a documentary and think, “That’s way beyond me,”
              but when the Dalai Lama, turning his face to the camera, speaks of
              “compassion,” the power of it is that he’s not talking about some lordly
              self-sacrificial higher state of being designed to be scrawled onto a
              world-peace poster. He’s talking about the fundamental impulse that makes us
              human. If we lose that, then we’re lost.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Tibet, the loss of the Dalai Lama’s presence has never ceased being a matter of
              tragic anguish. Over the years, 144 young monks have immolated themselves to
              protest his enforced exile (the film includes several brief shots of these
              horrific and profound events). Yet the Dalai Lama we see is no self-serious
              holy man. He’s endlessly self-deprecating, with an exuberant laugh, especially
              when he confesses that he inherited a short temper from his father. You only
              wish that you could see what that looked like. (My impression is: If he’s
              admitting it at all, he’s probably understating how bad it gets.) We see a
              portrait of his holiness painted by none other than George W. Bush, who speaks,
              with more insight than you’ve ever heard from him, about why he felt compelled
              to make an alliance with the Dalai Lama — in explicit disavowal of the will of the
              Chinese leadership — in a way that no previous American president had.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Will
              there ever be another figure like the Dalai Lama? “The Last Dalai Lama?”
              reaches beyond its title question mark to suggest that there may not be. The
              Chinese government has already declared (indeed, has written into law) that it
              will choose the next Dalai Lama — which, according to the film, could lead to
              the disturbing possibility of two Dalai Lamas (one true and Tibetan, the other
              a puppet guru of the Chinese state), or none at all. Whatever does happen when
              the 14th Dalai Lama is gone, what may prove to be unique about him is that he
              grew up in Tibet during the pre-modern age, and is encoded with the spirit of a
              time when the Buddhist heart and mind was as organic as breathing. But in
              exile, he became a larger-than-life figure whose radiant serenity now melts
              through a world of noise that may never again allow that radiance to be
              matched.</span></p>
