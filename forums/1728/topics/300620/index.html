              </blockquote>
              <h1>THE LAST TEACHING OF THE BUDDHA</h1>
              <p>Beneath the sala trees at Kusinagara, in his last words to his
                      disciples, the Buddha said:
                      Make of yourself a light.  Rely upon
                      yourself:  do not depend upon anyone else.  Make my teachings your light.  
                      Rely upon them:  do not depend upon any other teaching.</p>
              <p>Consider your body: Think of its impurity. Knowing that both
              its pain and its delight are alike causes of suffering, how can you
              indulge in its desires? Consider your 'self'; think of its transiency;
              how can you fall into delusion about it and cherish pride and
              selfishness, knowing that they must all end in inevitable suffering?
              Consider all substances; can you find among them any enduring 'self'?
              Are they not all aggregates that sooner or later will break apart and
              be scattered? Do not be confused by the universality of suffering, but
              follow my teaching, even after my death, and you will be rid of pain.
              Do this and you will indeed be my disciples.</p>
              <p>My disciples, the teachings that I have given you are never to be
                      forgotten or abandoned.  They are always to be treasured, they are to be thought
                      about, they are to be practiced.  If you follow these teachings you will always be
                      happy.</p>
              <p>The point of the teachings is to control your own mind.  
                      Keep your mind from greed, and you will keep your behavior right, your mind pure and your
                      words faithful.  By always thinking about the transience of your life, you will be
                      able to resist green and anger, and will be able to avoid all evils.</p>
              <p>If you find your mind tempted and so entangled in greed, you
                      must suppress and control the temptation; be the master of your own mind.</p>
              <p>A man's mind may make him a Buddha, or it may make him a
                      beast.  Misled by error, one becomes a demon; enlightened, one becomes a
                      Buddha.  Therefore, control your mind and do not let it deviate from the right
                      path.</p>
              <p>You should respect each other, follow my teachings, and refrain from
                      disputes; you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and
                      water, mingle together.</p>
              <p>Study together, learn together, practice my teachings
                      together.  Do not waste your mind and time in idleness and quarreling.  Enjoy
                      the blossoms of Enlightenment in their season and harvest the fruit of the right
                      path.</p>
              <p>The teachings which I have given you, I gained by following
                      the path myself.  You should follow these teachings and conform to their spirit on
                      every occasion.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000000;">If you neglect them, it means that you have never really met me.
                        It means that you are far from me, even if you are actually with me; but if you
                      accept and practice my teachings, then you are very near to me, even though you are far
                      away.</span></em></p>
              <p>My disciples, my end is approaching, our parting is
                       near, but do not lament.  Life is ever changing; none can escape the dissolution
                      of the body.  This I am now to show by my own death, my body falling apart like a
                      dilapidated cart.</p>
              <p>Do not vainly lament, but realize that nothing is permanent
                      and learn from it the emptiness of human life.  Do not cherish the unworthy desire
                      that the changeable might become unchanging.</p>
              <p>The demon of worldly desires is always seeking chances to
                      deceiver the mind.  If a viper lives in your room and you wish to have a peaceful
                      sleep, you must first chase it out.</p>
              <p>You must break the bonds of worldly passions and drive them
                      away as you would a viper.  You must positively protect your own mind.</p>
              <p>My disciples, my last moment has come, but do not forget that death is
                      only the end of the physical body.  The body was born from parents and was nourished
                      by food; just as inevitable are sickness and death.</p>
              <p>But the true Buddha is not a human body:  -- it is
                      Enlightenment.  A human body must die, but the Wisdom of Enlightenment will exist
                      forever in the truth
                       of the Dharma, and in the practice of the Dharma.  He who sees merely my body does
                      not truly see me.  Only he who accepts my teaching truly sees me.</p>
              <p>After my death, the Dharma shall be your teacher.  Follow
                      the Dharma and you will be true to me.</p>
              <p>During the last forty-five years of my life, I have withheld
                      nothing from my teachings.  There is no secret teaching, no hidden meaning;
                      everything has been taught openly and clearly.  My dear disciples, this is the end.</p>
              <p>In a moment, I shall be passing into Nirvana.  This is my instruction.</p>
              <p> </p>
