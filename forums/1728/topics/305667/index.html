                      was a monk by the name of Seyyasaka, who was not happy with the religious life

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When the
                      Buddha heard about his, he admonished the monk to refrain from acts that would

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the same
                      time, the Buddha introduced the disciplinary rule for bhikkhus to abstain from

              <p class="MsoNormal">My views (æœ¬äººæ„�è§�)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Although the above refrain about curbing sexual desire is explained from a monastic context, I personally think it can be applied to layman as well, where the same high awareness and prevention is required of us.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Regardless of whether you are a Buddhist or non-Buddhist, any thought or action that progressively increases your sexual desire and dependency, will not bring about long-term physical and emotional benefits for you (male or female).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Sexual stimulation of any kind (including masturbation) should not be encouraged or allowed, regardless of age, sex and sexual need.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Cos sexual stimulation essentially, ultimately, is a form of self-addiction. And addictions are easy to cultivate but extremely hard to wean off totally from.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">What worries me most are the various and countless sexual messages or sexual heath advice dispensed through the mass media and medical professionals. It is not easy for everyone to discern what or which kind of advice is the most useful and beneficial in the long term to follow. This is especially true for young children and teens.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Hopefull one day someone (Buddhist or non-Buddhist) will be brave and compassionate enough to want to guide anyone, by sharing their own experiences of how they succeed in weaning off the habit. Even though this may or cannot be publicly disseminated at the end, but at least those affected should preferably be able to receive the full guidance of such recovered addicts. They are indeed the true real-life models for us all to follow, or at least carefully listen to.</p>

              <p>Seriously, sexual desire in itself is not totally bad, but neither totally good. Sexual desire expressed in the context of marriage is considered by the society and Buddha to be legally, morally and health-wise, acceptable.</p>
              <p>Have you heard of people with high sexual desire eventually splitting up with their spouses at some point in time in their marriage? (You can easily find statistics and real-life stories from people in Western countries, example: United States)</p>
              <p>Why? Cos people with high sexual desire cannot be easily satisfied, although they can appear to be satisfied with their marriages and sex lives for quite some time to others.</p>
              <p>The Law of Cause and effect states that people who commit adultery (I take this to mean extramarital sex at the moment) will experience general restlessness throughout their lives, and after their death, they may be reborn as animals like peacocks, mandarin ducks. They will eventually fall into hell. If they are reborn as humans, they will likely be subjected to sexual abuse or be deeply involved with the adult sex industry. </p>
              <p>All the above can be directly lifted or inferred from Buddhist sutras. So I hope this helps to clear some doubts about the 'righteousness' of sexual desire from both secular and Buddhist perspective.</p>

                  applied to layman as well, where the same high awareness and
                  prevention is required of us.</p>
              <p>Regardless of whether you are a Buddhist or
                  non-Buddhist, any thought or action that progressively increases
                  your sexual desire and dependency, will not bring about long-term
                  physical and emotional benefits for you (male or female).</p>
              <p>Sexual stimulation of any kind (including masturbation)
                  should not be encouraged or allowed, regardless of age, sex and
                  sexual need.</p>
              <p>Cos sexual stimulation essentially, ultimately, is a
                  form of self-addiction. And addictions are easy to cultivate but
                  extremely hard to wean off totally from.</p>
              <p>What worries me most are the various and countless
                  sexual messages or sexual heath advice dispensed through the mass
                  media and medical professionals. It is not easy for everyone to
                  discern what or which kind of advice is the most useful and
                  beneficial in the long term to follow. This is especially true for
                  young children and teens.</p>
              <p>Hopefull one day someone (Buddhist or non-Buddhist)
                  will be brave and compassionate enough to want to guide anyone, by
                  sharing their own experiences of how they succeed in weaning off
                  the habit. Even though this may or cannot be publicly disseminated
                  at the end, but at least those affected should preferably be able
                  to receive the full guidance of such recovered addicts. They are
                  indeed the true real-life models for us all to follow, or at least
                  carefully listen to.</p>

              <p>Full sexual abstainance is not something that every lay person can do/are willing to do, so I do not think it is helpful to tell people to stop all sexual activities. All we can do is to discourage indulgance. We should also offer assistance and guidance to those struggling with such addictions. For monks it is a little different because they have taken the vow of complete celibacy, which is the complete abstainance of any sexual activities whatsoever.</p>
              <p>What is important is inner cultivation and learning how to overcome sexual lust, and this requires years of practice using various Buddhism cultivation methods, but it can definitely work. It is said those who reach Anagami level have risen above the influences of sexual lust.</p>

              <p>Nope, full sexual abstinence is indeed possible, but like you have said, it takes time. But one needs to have the right amount of understanding and insight about the harmful effects of sexual desire in order to even want to start to learn how to overcome sexual lust. In other words, one needs to recognise that ultimately, sexual desire, of any kind, in any context, does not lead up to true and everlasting peace and happiness.</p>
              <p>I am not trying to tell or demand any layman, Buddhist or not, to
                  practise full sexual abstinence. I am actually trying to share with
                  them what Buddha has said regarding the curbing of sexual desire. Only those who truly understand the nature and consequences of acts arising from sexual desire will seriously want to do something about it. The rest will just remain indifferent, cynical or critical.</p>
              <p>For any kind of addicition or problem, you need someone or something to help you truly understand why you need to change. And when you start to change, you will also need to depend on the right understanding to help you stay motivated and focused on attaining the right change for your problem.</p>
              <p>I absolutely agree we need to offer guidance and assistance to those suffering from any kind of addictions, and this means some real-life, face to face interaction is required. For without understanding his/her unique personality and living environment, it is difficult to guide them to understand and practise in accordance with their level of understanding and acceptance.</p>
              <p>One of my dreams is to set up an addiction management centre that helps both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. For non-buddhists, we will make use of secular medical knowledge whereas for Buddhists, it will be a matter of using the right mix of secular and Buddhist practical knowledge to help them cope while enrolled under the treatment programme.</p>

              <p>I think the Buddhist Vinaya is very good and is created in a way to guide monks to spiritual development, not just a 'punishment' or 'get rid of bad apple' system. If a monk made a mistake, instead of asking him to disrobe, I think it is good he is given more attention and help to overcome his problem through mental development. Of course, unless, the offence is too serious then disrobing may be the only choice.</p>

              cause for the breakdown of marriages culminating in divorces, let
              alone total abstinence. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p>When I use the word 'sex', I refer strictly to sexual intercourse, be oral, anal or you know what. Some say the word 'sex' can mean just kissing, or hugging, or just enjoying each other's company, which is up to individual interpretation.</p>
              <p>As you have correctly pointed out, sexual desire, once cannot be satisfied, can lead to divorce. But it is also widely known that even as females now are more assertive when it comes to initiating sex with their partners but most would need some time to get sexually aroused and finally sexual satisfaction. Whereas for males, sexual arousal and urges are always there most of the time, so naturally not all wives would be able to fulfill a husband with excessive sexual desire.</p>
              <p>However, the question is, what is considered excessive sexual desire? This is something no one can answer for certain until it causes marriages to break down, and then you realise probably your sexual desire is the one that brought you 'satisfaction', but yet gives you suffering as well. Well, of course, there are some who say, too bad he/she cannot/don't want to satisfy, I will go find another one...</p>
              <p>Therefore it is through this personal observation, that I finally understand why the ultimate goal of any practitioner of Buddhism or anyone who wants to find true happiness and peace for himself and others, will eventually have to find a way to totally dissolve the hold that any kind of sexual desire has on them.</p>

              <p>In the context of lay people, what you said is ok.</p>
              <p>For lay persons what we must observe is the 5 precepts, and for the 5 precepts we should never think in terms of "excessiveness" -- i.e. as long as I do not kill excessively, as long as I don't steal excessively, or don't lie excessively, it's fine. Or to have just a little bit of sexual misconduct... It is NOT fine.. so when we talk about 5 precepts, NO means NO. It is not a question of 'excessiveness'. Even to drink the point of intoxication is not right for a layperson who upholds 5 precepts -- you shouldn't reason yourself as being a "once in a long time occasion".</p>
              <p>But when we talk about things like sex between two faithful partners, then it is a question of 'is it too much' and what is healthy.</p>
              <p>Of course it is an eventuality that a practitioner can overcome the desire for sexual experience, but we should not emphasize sexual abstainance as a <em>requirement </em>especially for lay persons and those who have just begun to practice. Buddha never made it a requirement for lay persons, so we shouldn't. I do not see having a healthy sexual relation as being a major impediment to one's practice, unless one is obsessed about it.</p>

              <p>Just to clarify, I am not trying to emphasise sexual abstience as a requirement for understanding or practising Buddhism in this post. I am trying to reason out what will ultimately be the most beneficial thing to do after having understood clearly and completely the pro and cons of sexual desire from both a personal/secular and Buddhist point of view.</p>
              <p>The Shurangama sutra (æ¥žä¸¥ç»�) cautions us that sexual desire is the main karmic force that drives each being into samsaric deaths and births, be it whether it is healthy relationship or a personal obsession.</p>
              <p>At first I didn't see, understand or agree with the need for sexual abstinence mentioned in th above sutra as I'm a layman Buddhist. Ii was when I came to understand more about my own sexual desires and continue to read or hear about how sexual desire in humans expressed in mass media affects all of us, in many important aspects of our lives.</p>
              <p>Sexual dissatisfaction in a healthy man and wife relationship will lead to indifference at first, later affairs or worse divorce. (I have seen real-life examples from relatives, so I'm not trying to conjure anything from imagination or discussing for the fun of it)</p>
              <p>Sexual dissatisfaction in casual sex partners will lead to each separating to search for more satisfying sex from other new faces.</p>
              <p>This cycle will go on and on and will not stop, until their physical bodies can no longer function sexually.</p>
              <p>So it is up to the individual Buddhist brother/sister to decide, if they are still single and have no girlfriends/boyfriends, and/or are pondering about whether to find a girlfriend, like me.</p>
              <p>Well, unless you can tell me you can enter into a marriage without any sex at all (i strictly refer to normal kind of reproductive sex) throughout your entire life, then congrats! I see no problems at all. Actually I wish I can achieve that too. But I realise I still can't...haiz.</p>
              <p>I apologise to anyone if my tone come across as imposing or over-bearing. I just want to share my experience with those Buddhist brothers or sisters who are at the moment, hesitating on starting a relationship.</p>
              <p>For non-Buddhists, you are definitely free to have a normal man and wife relationship. For layman Buddhists, it is up to you to decide what you want, preferably after reading through the scriptures and the Shurangama sutra.</p>

              <p>Sexual dissatisfaction in a healthy man and wife relationship
                                  will lead to indifference at first, later affairs or worse divorce.
                                  (I have seen real-life examples from relatives, so I'm not trying
                                  to conjure anything from imagination or discussing for the fun of
                                  it)</p>
              <p>Sexual dissatisfaction in casual sex partners will lead to each
                                  separating to search for more satisfying sex from other new
                                  faces.</p>
              <p>This cycle will go on and on and will not stop, until their
                                  physical bodies can no longer function sexually.</p>
              <p>So it is up to the individual Buddhist brother/sister to decide,
                                  if they are still single and have no girlfriends/boyfriends, and/or
                                  are pondering about whether to find a girlfriend, like me.</p>
              <p>Well, unless you can tell me you can enter into a marriage
                                  without any sex at all (i strictly refer to normal kind of
                                  reproductive sex) throughout your entire life, then congrats!
                                  I see no problems at all. Actually I wish I can achieve that too.
                                  But I realise I still can't...haiz.</p>
              <p>I apologise to anyone if my tone come across as imposing or
                                  over-bearing. I just want to share my experience with those
                                  Buddhist brothers or sisters who are at the moment, hesitating
                                  on starting a relationship.</p>
              <p>For non-Buddhists, you are definitely free to have a normal man
                                  and wife relationship. For layman Buddhists, it is up to you to
                                  decide what you want, preferably after reading through the
                                  scriptures and the Shurangama sutra.</p>

              <p>Although sexual desire, and in fact more fundamentally dualistic attraction and aversion is behind samsaric birth and seeking, in my opinion it is not solved by mere sexual abstainance.</p>
              <p>It is a matter of developing wisdom and insight such that the fundamental root cause of ignorance is dissolved.</p>
              <p>In the meanwhile, I do not see (healthy) sexual activities as being any major obstacle to practice, as long as one doesn't do it excessively or becomes obsessed.</p>
              <p>Of course if you find sexual lust as a distraction in your practice then maybe taking a vow of complete abstainance can be helpful, depending on circumstances. Complete sexual abstainance is good if you are willing, but not a 'must'.</p>
              <p>If sexual lust has become so habituated that thoughts of lust arise often or even in your practice or meditation, then it is best to do contemplate on the impurities of the body and enter samadhi from there.</p>
