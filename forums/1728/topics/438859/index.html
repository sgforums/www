              <p>If you wish to be reborn in Amitabha Buddha's Western Pureland, then be single-minded about wanting that.  Channel your craving/clinging to this one wish to be reborn in the Pureland of Ultimate Bliss. </p>
              <p>It helps to think about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">why</span></strong> you wish to go to the Pureland in order to keep alive this <strong>Aspiration</strong>.  (Usually, the wish to help liberate sentient beings is a strong motivating factor.  It's certainly a stronger motivation than simply wanting to liberate oneself, although the wish to be free from suffering is also a powerful motivator in itself!)</p>
              <p>---------------- </p>
              <p>If you ask Buddhists from other schools, they will also tell you that working towards Awakening by following the Noble 8-fold Path, coupled with various forms of meditation, are what will eventually help you overcome your afflictions (clinging, anger, ignorance, arrogance, etc.).  Personally, I feel there's no harm in also learning to meditate, or at least, picking up some mindfulness practices. </p>
              <p>The way I see it, the exhortation to cultivate one Dharma door deeply (ä¸€é—¨æ·±å…¥) should not be mistaken as an instruction to overlook other methods which could help you awaken within your current lifetime.  I see it more as an exhortation not to be greedy by chanting many different mantras and Buddha names to the point where at the time of death, you may become confused and scattered, not knowing which to concentrate on. </p>
              <p>Most certainly, Right Mindfulness is something that Buddhists from all schools and traditions do follow.  It is by being constantly mindful and aware that we can recognise our afflictions, hence giving them less power over us.</p>
              <p>----------------</p>
              <p>Another thing...</p>
              <p>Sometimes, it is also by being faced with impermanence time and time again in our lives that it finally sinks in for us that clinging is futile.  It becomes easier then to be more relaxed and to go with the flow.</p>

              <p>I remember one shifu said many people thought impermanence was pessimistic and negative. He said it was not actually the case. When we were caught in a bad situation, we should tell ourselves that things would pass as everything was impermanent.</p>
              <p>What he said makes sense to me. Before that, I also think impermanence is more of negative and pessimistic.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the replies everyone.</p>
              <p>Today, I realize that it is aging I fear, even though I know I cannot stop it. I will direct my clinging towards rebirth in the western pureland and try to think of this world to be nothing worth clinging on to.</p>

              <p>There is no simple way to let go of attachments. Trying to reason yourself the impermanence and futility of samsaric attachments can help to some degree, but attachments cannot be fully 'reasoned out'.</p>
              <p>At some point if you want to end all attachments, you might want to practice insight meditation. Insight and knowledge into the way things are will lead to dispassion and relinquishment of attachments.</p>

              Yes, Meditation is good practice too.
              
              But here I would like to clarify about what many forumers might think that going to Pureland just by chanting Amituofo Amituofo Amituofo....
              
              No offence to anyone. This is what I always remind myself, I am talking about myself now.
              
              I told myself - to be a buddhist alone is not enough merit to go to Pureland,
              
              to chant Amituofo alone, is not enough merit to go to Pureland,
              
              to have a firm resolution to set our mind to go to Pureland alone, is not enough merit to go to Pureland either.
              
              To be able to go to Pureland, practice my 10 heavenly Precepts, do the 10 good deeds and follow the Noble Eightfold path.
              
              The Ten Precepts:
              1. I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures.
              2. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking that which is not given.
              3. I undertake the precept to refrain from sexual activity.
              4. I undertake the precept to refrain from incorrect speech.
              5. I undertake the precept to refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to carelessness.
              6. I undertake the precept to refrain from eating at the forbidden time (i.e., after noon).
              7. I undertake the precept to refrain from dancing,singing, music, going to see entertainments.
              8. I undertake the precept to refrain from wearing garlands, using perfumes, and beautifying the body with cosmetics.
              9. I undertake the precept to refrain from lying on a high or luxurious sleeping place.
              10. I undertake the precept to refrain from accepting gold and silver (money).
              
              The 10 good deeds is based on the above too - for example - to refrain from killing,
              the good deed would be to save as many life as possible.
              
              The noble eightfold path you can google it.
              
              Its just like some religion (you know which one), believe in Him only can go heaven,
              so easy ah?? of course other than refrain from doing bad, also must put into
              Actions - do the good deeds too.

              perhaps ageing is more of an issue for ladies. male would prefer to be more mature. :p
              
              yea, actually, must understand the real meaning of non-clinging. clinging to non clinging is also a form of clinging. cling can cling, but cling without clinging, bias and thinking too much about it. that way, if u learn Buddhism, Buddhism become not so stressful. Aviod evil, do good, purifed the Mind. only do good cannot. will end up in heavens. must purifed the Mind. eventually everything (yes everything) can do, but do without attachment, dualism and wandering thoughts. this is the highest state of Buddhism or Hua Yen Sutra(said MCK). :)
