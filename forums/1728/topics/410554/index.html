              <p>Start as a vegan first, eg. with unfertilised eggs and milk as  part of the diet.</p>
              <p>Also you may try indian vegetarian if you do not mind pungent spices like garlic and onions.</p>
              <p>Try to understand matching of food groups with complete protein and vitamin profile, eg. grains or cereals with legumes and such.  Also have good mix of fruits and vegetables in your diet. Eat raw is preferable for the enzymes unless you have a cool constitution.</p>
              <p>The only long term drawback I see is a B12 deficiency which may or may not be helped with supplementation with parsley. Or you may augment you diet with vegetarian vitamins.</p>

              <p>I know some nice vegetarian stalls. You can also check out Bright Hill website, sometimes they will have vegetarian cooking class or you can buy vegetarian cooking book for reference.</p>
              <p>If you tell your family members that you want to be  vegetarian because of health reasons, they will be more receptive than telling them because of religious purpose. They tend to think that you are superstitious if you want to be  vegetarian because of religion.</p>

              <p>Many people find vegetarian food bland because many of the chinese veg stalls or eateries don't use onions, leeks, shallots, chives, garlics and asafoetida in their cooking.</p>
              <p>These plants are considered strong smelling and tasting in nature and is always used in meat dishes for flavouring purposes, so you may need to take time adjusting to the veg food outside which seems to be bland. However, after some time on a veg diet without these pungent plants, your taste buds will become more sensitive, and you will be able to really taste the actual taste of food itself.</p>
              <p>If you are practicing meditation it is best to avoid pungent plants to aid your practice, which also means avoiding buying from non-veg stalls as their veggies almost always cooked with onions or garlic. Indian veg stalls also uses onions and garlics except for a few, but they may still have asafoetida in the curries.</p>
              <p>If you are fine with onions and garlics and do not mind that the veggies are cooked with meat or non-veg oil, non-veg gravy, etc then you can practically eat from anywhere.</p>

              <p>You will be surprised that not many people share your view especially non Buddhists. As most of my family members are non Buddhists, thus I know what they are thinking of.

              <p>You can explain to them from a non-buddhist point of view - health, animals, environment. It's not the meat that is really delicious, it's the spices they used to flavour them that they find delicious - the onions, garlics etc, as well as the chilli, pepper etc.</p>
