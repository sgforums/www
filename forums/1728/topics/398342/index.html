              <p>Taken from Kenneth Folk Dharma forum, quotations from Adam West.</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>Hey Michael!<br><br>Yeah, to realize Rigpa, is to 'recognize' the nature of mind, of one's own mind. It is an expereince insofar as it is an instance of conscious recognition here and now; you might say it is the same as recognizing the Tao as one's very own nature, Being and self. In so doing, one recgnizes that this has always been the case, and nothing in fact has changed. Before this recognition we were ignorant of the nature of things, now, in this moment, we are not. We are omniscient insofar as we know the true nature of things as they are here and now and have always been; not in terms of we know all concepts and ideas. In this recognition we directly apprehend that there is no-self, 'I' or ego as any kind of permaent substrate or atman. And yet, existence, experience and beingness has alwasy been the case, yet there is no one that experiences, nor any thing that is experienced; just experience or be-ing itself.<br><br>Often, due to mental habits, we cannot maintain this recognition, and slip back into ignorance where we no longer have real-time recogniztion or contact with the Tao; it becomes but a memory.<br><br>In kind regards,<br><br>Adam.<br><br>--------------<br><br>Hey Gozen!<br><br>Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experience. Yeah, correlation, definitely not causation. ;-P I think we can say Rigpa or the inherent wakefulness of reality - and to realize it or 'know' it here and now, rather than being distracted from what is obvious here and now in ordinary awareness - is foundational and causeless - its already here and so can't be caused; it is by virtue of its existence of beingness that we can communicate and be aware of this text before our eyes. However, just because it is always present does not mean we ‘know’ it or notice its presence and the true nature of our mind. To simply be in a relaxed, thought free state is not the same as to ‘know’ or recognize Rigpa. Rigpa seems to be more than just our natural state, which is always causelessly present, Rigpa is more than a name, it is also a verb, it is an ‘act of knowing or recognition’ of the nature of mind here and now - not of ego - it is to ‘know’ and recognize this natural state in real time. Most of us do not, even when we are relaxed and thought free, as we can see when watching TV, or gently gazing at a camp fire. Gazing at a fire in particular or wall-gazing or sky-gazing are probably the best conditions to notice rigpa though, aside from direct pointing out from an adept.<br><br>The problem seems to be that we are distracted from this wakefulness or our inherent nature by dualistic thought or dualistic consciousness - Rigpa or our natural state is simply present, but unnoticed, and more accurately stated, ‘obscured’ by dualistic consciousness, which may be as simple as the presence of thought. Point being, while dualistic consciousness is active, we can observe that the pranas are active in pingala and ida. When dualistic thought and consciousness is inactive, we can observe the pranas have entered into the central channel, and thus, there is no longer any obscuration of our inherent nature - Rigpa is unvailed.<br><br>Some tantric practices work on bringing the pranas into the central channel, thus, revealing the clear light of the nature of mind - Rigpa. Other practices work on directly cutting-through dualistic consciousness like sky-gazing or pointing out instructions etc., and one may instantly notice wakefullness as it is and always was here and now. In so doing, it seems there is a process where the pranas enter the central channel, removing obsurations. So Rigpa is always present regardless of our condition of mind, yet it is obscured and goes unnoticed. Further, dualistic consciousness seems directly dependent upon the whether or not the pranas are in our out of the central channel – which does indeed seem to have a symmetrical causal relationship.<br><br>In kind regards,<br><br>Adam.<br><br>--------------<br><br>When we are thinking, awareness is aware of thinking; when we are not thinking, awareness is aware of not thinking. When there is distraction, there is being lost in distraction, and yet, we are conscious of being absorbed in that, if nothing else. What is it that is aware at all times during this awareness? Wakefulness. It is always present regardless of our mind state. However, it is a matter of recognition, is it not?<br><br>What is it that obscures this basic sentient ground of reality; obsures our own 'clear-seeing' of the nature of things? Distraction, right? Because we already are it, but fail to notice it, right? This is where I think Kenneth has done a great job in pointing to the simpleness of not thinking, and what is left is the ground itself. It is an effective separation practice - a Rushan. By practicing this, we are setting up conditions for the noticing of what is here and now, or put another way, cutting through the distraction.<br><br>I think for most people, this ground is not immediately recognized in the thought free state. I have been practicing the thought free state for most of the morning and day, and it is clear that in so doing, the pranas move into the central channel and my mind becomes progressively naked in luminous clarity of wakefulness - the sense of subjectivity disolves, and impersonal lucidity presents from the background the to the foreground. it is like a presence of pristine freshness of wakefulness increasingly becomes the dominant foreground of clarity with an accompanying energetic presence of awareness.<br><br>I then notice that there is a deep fundamental stillness that is now recognized and known, and now as I am writing and thinking, I am finding that the stillness persists, and that it always was there, just unnoticed. It is like 'I' as formless presence-stillness just am, an infinitely deep stillness without ground or end, and thinking is like waves of ripples on the surfaces of my mind which I kind of see as a heads-up digital display - not literarily of course - and so I as stillness witness the thinking, and yet am untouched by it. This is what I think is meant by recognizing Rigpa through the 24 hour cycle, regardless of the conditions of mind - thoughts, dreams, and dreamless sleep.<br><br>Gozen, I completely agree that 'state' is problematic. I just use it because the Tibetans do - natural state, natural condition, nature of mind - to denote, that which is completely natural to us, and thus not contrived or caused by an act of 'me', ego or a spiritual practice - something that already is. It is like when dust settles in the air or sediment in the water, what you have left is the natural pristine clarity of the natural, 'impersonal' condition of the water or air - this groundless, formless sentient fresh luminosity.<br><br>Personally, I would be careful about using Rigpa as the sate that contains all others, even though I think it fair to say it does, like our mind contains our thoughts; I would say it is that which apprehends all states, conditions, thoughts, sensations and displays. That way it is not considered to be a dimension or to be something in and of itself. Is seeing a thing, or hearing a thing? Or does seeing just apprehend the thing. Conventionally, it is a process of cause and effect. What if there was no person there to see, and no thing that was seen, and yet, there still was just hearing, just seeing, just experience, being, existence? Ultimately, there is no proces, thing or person that sees, is there? Just experience, but there is no one home who experiences. ;-P To recognize that is to recognize the nature of things, is it not?<br><br>In kind regards,<br><br>Adam. <br><br>--------------<br><br>So that is a great starting point. To realize the unborn is to realize 'cognizant emptiness' itself as your true nature in real time, or the nature of reality. This is the perceiving-knowingness quality of reality, thus, where there is awareness or sentience, there it is, whether recognized for what it is or not. Thus, it is here and now perceiving and knowing this text on your computer, and it is here and now perceiving and reconizing these thoughts in your mind - that is it, that is our true nature - that is vipassana - "clearly seeing the nature of reality". Since it is that which perceives and recognizes all phenomena, it is that which is present in all phenomena, and also that which is present in the absence of all phenomena. Adittionally, all phenomena are seen to be the energetic display of this one basic reality, as Alex says, waves on the ocean; so ontologically, there is no separation or distinction between phenomena and reality - there is but one reality and it is non-dual, and all is empty luminosity. <br><br>This is what Jake, as I understand it, went to great length to point out also. It has been discussed many times before.</p>
              <p>Once that recognition is made, all is seen from that view, and thus all is seen as fundamental to and intrinsic to that nature - hence, non-dual.<br><br>Since all is seen as arising and passing away from and within this nature, which itself does not arise nor pass away - always present whether recognized or not - then it follows all phenomena are recognized as the display of empty luminosity i.e. non-dual - nothing is excluded from reality as it is - non-dual, luminous and empty. It would seem to follow that once this recognition has been stabilized, since nothing is excluded from it, there is no necessary condition that must exist in order for it to persist - that is, phenomena may come and go, and yet recognition of the true nature of that phenomena and reality remains. Right?<br><br>In kind regards,<br><br>Adam.<br><br>--------------<br><br>Hey Alex!<br><br>Do you think that the final and exhaustive realization and view is a cosmic suicide? Yes, insofar as there is no 'I', but no, insofar as there never was one, thus, nothing is lost. We can see this when we have these occasional exhaustive, no trace of a self, realizations of just seeing, just hearing, just sitting etc.; we realize the nature of things, and yet 'things' continue on as they always were and are - there is no 'I', and yet there is still 'being' and existence, it is just that there is no one that is being or that exists. You've been there, as have I, and others; I wouldn't call that suicide, except by a very narrow definition. And even in this realization, there still is awareness of existence or being, just that there is no one there that is aware; otherwise there could be no consciousness of the realization itself. Without awareness there could be no consciousness of the no-self, just seeing realization, could there? And in this realization, form continues - there is still cutting wood and carrying water - appearance and display - so nothing has changed, and yet everything has. In this way we can see lucidity and impermance are fundamental to reality. I would strongly argue they are not an aggregate nor contingent phenomena.<br><br>We may say that in some mysterious way, experience is 'all' there is, and yet there is no-thing that is experienced, nor anyone who experiences - that is the nature of reality - mind-only; and yet there is no mind either.<br><br>In kind regards,<br><br>Adam.<br><br>--------------<br><br>If people find the term Rigpa unclear, then change it to Buddha Nature or one's Original Face, or one's true nature; all Buddhist terms that point to that which has no name, so it does not matter what we call it. We are just attempting to point to that which is fundamental to reality - that which is unborn; unchanging; is not a thing or ontological essence; is empty; is that which is pure perceiving and knowingness, but which is not a thing, person or entity - just perceivingness-knowingness, without a knower or a separate object that is known; it is presence-awareness; it is cognizant-emptiness; it is sentience, without a being who is sentient; it is *reality* itself at its most fundamental, and yet all phenomena are of it, arise from it and return to it, and yet never were separate from it; and are its energetic display - it is that which is *always* present, but which is *unrecognized* by the unenlightened, and is this very same perceivingness-knowingness that sees this text before you - that cognizant-emptiness *is* your true nature, is *you* here and now. This *is* the 'always-already' of the direct path.<br><br>Because it is that which is fundamental to you and is always present at all times, and is the very basis of all reality in every phenomenal presentation, it is by definition, present and recognizable during the presentation and display of all phenomena at all times i.e. thoughts, aversive emotive states, no-thought, sex, killing, and all aspects of ordinary life.<br><br>I hope it is clear by now, that special states come and go i.e. jhana, no-thought, high samadhi etc., that which is fundamental to us, Buddha Nature or Rigpa, or the unborn, is always present, and it is *not* an object of meditation - not a state or condition that we perceive - rather it IS the source of all perception-knowing-ness that experiences-knows-perceives-sees all passing states and phenomena; and its recognition may be stabilized and permanently realized as the very definition of Buddha-hood. In this recognition, there is no self, witness or subjectivity, there is simply experience, without an 'experiencer' or an object of 'experience' - there is merely the direct apprehension of the dependently arising nature of phenomena as the energetic display of cognizant emptiness.<br><br>This recognition of Buddha Nature is not dependent upon conditions or states, and thus is untouched by them, and is present through *all* states including thinking and all else. This, I hope is clear, as per the logical basis of the model just outlined; the very same model outlined by the Buddha and his lineage holders as per its various traditions, as I understand them. To realize this Buddha nature as none other than reality itself, in its ordinary, everyday, here and now sense – inclusive of all phenomenal existence-display - is the ‘clear seeing’ of vipassana – enlightenment.<br><br>In kind regards,<br><br>Adam.<br><br>--------------<br><br>Yep, I'm with you there Ken. I don't advocate a *perfect* recognition of Dharamakaya. As such idealistic thought, like perfect round circles and perfectly straight lines do no exist in realty, they are logical entities and exist only in our mind. In the same way that we are all normally distracted from being aware of ourselves through working, or thinking or drifting off in thought - I forget me, Adam, am distracted from this fact, then I recognize it again, that I am Adam, without effort, completely naturally, so is an enlightened person, I would propose, distracted from recognition of reality as it is, and then effortlessly returns to this recognition as their base-line, just as Adam is my base-line.<br><br>Recognition of me as Adam is my ongoing base-line state. Distraction continues, but I always come back to it. Enlightenment, I would propose is the same. Recognition of me as none other than *reality* itself in this completely ordinary sense here and now, and not as 'me' as a distinct, persistent, separate entity that experiences 'us and them'; rather, there is just reality, just seeing, just hearing, just doing the laundry, completely ordinary, yet wholly fresh and perfect - distinctions and self-reference are conceptually imposed as socially constructed conventions, and prevent us from recognizing *this* - reality as it is here and now. When distinctions are imputed to have a solid, real and necessary existence, that is when we suffer, and fall from grace. Such distinctions serve a functional purpose, but have no ontological necessity in and of themselves.<br><br>In this way we can see, to be enlightened is to live this as one's base-line; even in enlightenment this convention continues, it is a part of reality as it is - no artificial distinctions or 'this is reality and that is not reality' all is reality and reality is inclusive of distinction, it is just that distinctions are seen for what they are, I would propose. Distraction is ongoing as described above, as is distraction into identification with old ways of perceiving one's self and reality, due to habitual patters of thought and ways of relating to each other and the world. However, to be enlightened, as I see it, is for our basic self-identity as *reality* to be our base-line for most of the time; in which we effortlessly and naturally return from distraction to this enlightened base-line over and over again.<br><br>Adam is my base-line, it cannot be lost - just distraction for a greater or lessor amount of time. So too, is enlightenment as this very reality, our base-line. That is the model of enlightenment I am proposing, and suggesting other traditions are proposing also.<br><br>In kind regards,<br><br>Adam.</p>

               oral commentary on the Trekcho teaching "The Three Words that Hit the

              TEXT<br>Homage to the guru.<br>The view is Longchen Rabjam (Infinite 
              Great Expanse)<br>The meditation is Khyentse Oser (light rays of 
              Knowledge and Love)<br>The action is Gyalwai Nyugu (Son of the 
              Victorious Ones)<br>For the one who practices in this way,<br>There is 
              no doubt about enlightenment in one lifetime.<br>But even if not, there 
              is still happiness - a la la.<br><br>The view, Longchen Rabjam, is as 
              follows:<br>To hit the vital point with the three lines,<br>First, let 
              your mind rest loosely.<br>Without projecting, without concentrating - 
              without thoughts.<br>While relaxed and remaining evenly in that state<br>Suddenly
               exclaim a mind shattering PHAT!<br>Forceful, short and sharp - emaho!<br>Nothing
               whatsoever - totally blank.<br>A blankness which is utterly open.<br>A 
              total openness which is indescribable.<br>Recognize this as the 
              Dharmakaya awareness.<br>TO RECOGNIZE YOUR NATURE; THAT IS THE FIRST 
              VITAL POINT.<br>After this, whether you are thinking or still,<br>Whether
               you are angry, or attached, happy or sad,<br>At all time and on all 
              occasions<br>Acknowledge the recognized Dharmakaya (this is our basic 
              awareness)<br>And let the child luminosity unite with the already known 
              mother.<br>Rest in the state of inexpressible awareness.<br>Destroy 
              again and again stillness, bliss, clarity and thinking.<br>Let the 
              syllable of knowledge and means suddenly strike down.<br>No difference 
              between meditation and post meditation.<br>No division between sessions 
              and breaks.<br>Rest continuously in the undivided state.<br>However, as 
              long as you have not attained stability,<br>It is essential to give up 
              distractions.<br>Divide your meditation into sessions.<br>At all times 
              and in all situations</span></p>

               SECOND VITAL POINT.<br>At this time, your likes and dislikes, joys and 
              sorrows<br>And all your passing thoughts without exception<br>Leave no 
              trace in the state of recognition.<br>By recognizing Dharmakaya (basic 
              awareness) in what is liberated,<br>As in the analogy of drawing on

               occurs is fresh food for the empty awareness.<br>Whatever is thought is
               an expression of the Dharmakaya king.<br>Traceless and naturally free -
               a la la.<br>The way thoughts occur is the same as before,<br>But the 
              way they are freed is the most essential key point.<br>Without this, 
              meditation is but the path of confusion.<br>Possessing it is the 
              uncultivated state of Dharmakaya (awareness)<br>TO GAIN CONFIDENCE IN

              victorious ones.  Even if the victorious ones of the three times were to
               confer together, They would have no oral instruction superior to this.<br>The
               Dharmakaya treasure revealer of awareness-display<br>Discovered this as

               the state of non-dual contemplation has been arrived at, one has to 
              continue in it. This continuation has two levels of practice: tregchöd 
              and thödgal. These are main practices presented in the Menngagde series 
              (Oral Instruction Series) of the dzogchen teachings.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzogchen#Tregch.C3.B6d_and_th.C3.B6dgal<br><br>The
               following quotes are from the commentary on the above root text on the 
              precious inner secret instructions of Dzogchen Trekcho.  Secret because 
              without first-hand realization, they make minimal sense.  <br><br>"The 
              Second Word: Decide On One Thing (the Meditation)<br>In the last posting
               we completed the presentation of the first of the Three Words, which is
               the recognition within oneself of the innate wisdom that is the 
              fundamental nature of one's mind and the ground of all experience.  The 
              second point is concerned with the manner in which one can bring this 
              recognition into one's experience, through maintaining it in 
              meditation."<br><br>"To begin with, if there has been no recognition  of
               the innate wisdom, then there is nothing to meditate upon.  There is no
               way to go further.  That recognition must occur first.  But once one 
              has recognized the innate wisdom, the next concern is the cultivation of
               a meditation that is continuous and unbroken like the flow of a river, a
               meditation that consists of simply allowing the mind to rest naturally 
              within that which has been recognized, and maintaining such a meditation
               in all situations and at all times.  If one does not waver from this 
              recognition, then it makes no difference what else is going on in one's 
              mind."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024555" class="threadText">"Therefore, other than 
              resting within this recognition of the innate wisdom, there is no 
              fabrication, change or effort that one needs to make.  There is nothing 
              else to do in meditation than simply to maintain that recognition.  
              There is no need to attempt to establish a state of stillness, or to 
              attempt to get rid of the movement of thought within the mind.  If the 
              mind rests within the recognition of innate wisdom, then the mind is 
              manifesting as the nature of the Dharmakaya (our true nature), as the 
              nature of that innate wisdom itself."<br><br>"If the mind is active, if 
              there is the occurrence of thought within the mind, as long as this 
              recognition is not lost, then whatever thought arises is merely the 
              expression of that wisdom and is experienced as such, as the "magical 
              display" of awareness.  Hence, when there is recognition, then it 
              becomes irrelevant whether there is stillness or occurrence in the mind.
                So therefore, the next line in the root text says, "THEN IT MAKES NO 
              DIFFERENCE WHETHER THERE IS OCCURRENCE OF THOUGHT OR STILLNESS."<br>With
               regard to the occurrence of thought within the mind, examples of such 
              thoughts are kleshas, such as aversion towards that which one perceives 
              as threatening, or attachment towards that which one perceives as 
              pleasant or as affording some kind of security.  One would classify such
               thoughts as pertaining to the Second Noble Truth, the truth of the 
              origin of suffering, since kleshas are the origin of suffering."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024565" class="threadText">"Or there could be an 
              experience of some kind of affect that is not itself particularly a 
              klesha, such as delight or misery, happiness or depression, in which 
              case the thoughts pertain to the First Noble truth, the truth of 
              suffering.  So, in the midst of recognition, whatever thought arises in 
              one's mind, whether it is suffering or something that would normally 
              cause suffering, if the recognition is not lost, then one sees the 
              suchness, or the nature of these thoughts.  One sees that these thoughts
               have no nature other than the innate wisdom itself."<br><br>"In that 
              sense, whatever occurs in the mind, without any exception, is merely the
               uprising, or the expression of our own innate wisdom.  The only issue 
              here is the recognition of this, or the absence of recognition.  So 
              therefore, the next line in the root text says, "WHETHER YOU EXPERIENCE 
              AVERSION OR ATTACHMENT, WHETHER YOU ARE EXHILARATED OR DEPRESSED, MAKES 
              NO DIFFERENCE."<br>Since nothing other than resting in the recognition 
              of innate wisdom is an issue in this practice, the maintainance of the 
              recognition becomes the deciding factor.  In other words, even though 
              you may have recognized the view, recognized the innate wisdom, if you 
              cannot maintain this recognition in meditation, then while the nature of
               thoughts could never pass beyond being the uprising of that innate 
              wisdom, you will not recognize them as such because you are no longer 
              recognizing the innate wisdom."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024569" class="threadText">"Therefore, when you are
               distracted from this state of recognition, when you become lost in 
              ordinary delusion, bewilderment, or confusion, then thoughts become 
              independent.  "Independent" here means unrecognized.  At that point, it 
              appears to you as though thoughts have solidity, have independent 
              existence.  And once you are without this recognition of thoughts as 
              being merely the uprising of innate wisdom, then thoughts can bind you 
              in Samsara and actually become causes of suffering."<br><br>"Thus, in 
              the absence of recognition, your mind and Dharma have temporarily 
              separated and are no longer keeping company.  At that point, you are 
              really no different from anyone else, you have no advantage.  If you 
              fall from the recognition back into ordinary confusion, then you 
              accumulate karma just like everyone else.  At all times and in all 
              circumstances, a practitioner of Dzogchen must never depart from this 
              natural settling into recognition that we refer to as non-meditation.  
              So therefore, the next line in the root text says, "AT ALL TIMES AND IN 
              ALL SITUATIONS....."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024573" class="threadText">"In Dzogchen, we do not 
              resort to separate remedies for separate mental afflictions, because the
               only issue here is the presence of and absence of recognition.  And if 
              there is recognition, then the mental afflictions are seen as being the 
              expression of the nature, and therefore do not themselves pose a 
              problem.  Hence, this is called, the "application of one remedy which 
              liberates everything."<br><br>"This liberation is complete;  there is 
              nothing that could possibly arise within your mind that from this point 
              of view would require any special treatment.   In the maintenance  of 
              the view that has been identified, in the continuing recognition of the 
              innate wisdom, everything is taken care of.  So therefore, the next line
               in the root text says, "CONTINUALLY RECOGNIZE THE INNATE WISDOM, THE 
              DHARMAKAYA."<br><br>"You will notice that there are two things that we 
              are talking about here:<br>the innate wisdom itself which is always 
              present and has always been present, and the recognition of the innate 
              wisdom which is not always present.  This ever-present innate wisdom is 
              the true nature of the mind, and therefore the nature of whatever arises
               within the mind:  whatever thoughts and mental afflictions arise in the
               mind are not OTHER in nature than the innate wisdom.  They cannot pass 
              beyond that.  If something is the nature of everything in a certain 
              sphere, then anything that occurs within that sphere must partake of 
              that nature.  This innate wisdom, or naked awareness, that is the nature
               of all thoughts, is called the "ground clear light," or "ground 
              Dharmakaya."  It is also called the "mother clear light present as 
              ground."  Another rendition of the Tibetan term translated here as 
              "clear light," is "luminosity" or "luminous clarity."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024576" class="threadText">"As long as one does not
               lose the recollection of the clear light, this recognition of one's 
              innate wisdom, other than resting in this recognition, there is no issue
               with regard to meditation.  No matter what arises in your mind, it is 
              an expression of that innate wisdom.  No matter what mental affliction 
              or thought arises, there is no need whatsoever to attempt to alter or 
              control any of it.  There is no need to attempt to get rid of anything 
              that arises or to add anything.  As long as there is recognition, 
              nothing that arises is a problem in any way.  Also, there is no problem 
              with anything not arising; there is nothing missing, and therefore, 
              there is nothing that needs to be added."<br><br>"This is an extremely 
              significant point, and it bears repeating; other than maintaining 
              recognition, there is no need to attempt to reject anything that arises 
              in the mind, and there is nothing that could possibly arise that has any
               special status whatsoever, that deserves any special attention or is 
              considered in any way superior, or to be adopted as somehow special.  So
               therefore, the next line of the text says, "SIMPLY REST IN 
              INEXPRESSIBLE AWARENESS."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024582" class="threadText">"So therefore, it is 
              extremely important to maintain an unimpeded post-meditative awareness. 
               In other words, while meditation has to come first, it is not enough, 
              it has to be expanded into post-meditation.  Therefore, the text at this
               point says, "AT ALL TIMES AND IN ALL SITUATIONS...."<br><br>"So one 
              needs to maintain an unobstructed awareness at all times and in all 
              situations.  In the same way as in the meditation session, in 
              post-meditation there is nothing to be meditated upon.  You do not have 
              to look for anything to be aware of and recognize other than innate 
              awareness itself. The essence of the even placement of this meditation 
              is not being separate from the view of the Dharmakaya, the recognition 
              of innate wisdom.  All your actions, all of your experiences, all of 
              your thoughts, are naturally freed without fixation: literally, they 
              become unreckoned. Unreckoned here means that nothing unseats you, 
              nothing gets any special status that takes you away from awareness.  In 
              that even, undistracted recognition, whatever happens is of itself 
              evened out or relaxed; nothing has to be done to your experience.  
              Within that recognition you are not attempting to get rid of anything, 
              or to add anything.  You are not attempting to restrict your experience,
               nor are you attempting to introduce something new to it."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024588" class="threadText">"In the same way, if you
               do not resolve that there is nothing to pursue beyond this unfabricated
               and natural practice, if you still think there is something more still 
              to be gained from fabrication, then you become lost in a forest of 
              fabrication, attempting to contrive or create an enlightened state.  You
               will never become awakened until you give that up.  Therefore, it is 
              very important to resolve the utter primacy of unfabricated awareness.  
              Hence, the next line of the text says, " RESOLVE THAT THERE IS NOTHING 
              BEYOND THIS."<br><br>"In other words, whatever arises is nothing other 
              than the display of this fundamental nature.<br>Because that is the 
              case, it is extremely important to recognize the innate wisdom in what 
              arises, the wisdom that is the basis of liberation.  It is important 
              that you let the arising not sway you from this recognition, but rather 
              intensify it in such a situation.  Therefore, in the root text it says, 
              "IN THAT SITUATION (MEANING AT THE TIME OF PRACTICE) WHEN ATTACHMENT OR 
              AVERSION, DELIGHT OR MISERY ARISE...."<br><br>"This need for recognition
               is not limited only to the arising of strong afflictions such as strong
               attachment or aversion.  As long as you do not possess this essential 
              point of simultaneous arising and liberation in your meditation, as long
               as you do not recognize that whatever arises in the mind is the 
              expression of awareness, all the under-currents of thought that arises 
              in your mind, all of the thoughts that are flowing unnoticed beneath 
              your meditative stability, will accumulate samsaric karmas."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024593" class="threadText">"If you are resting in a
               state of meditation, and you do not experience thoughts, but there is 
              still an undercurrent of thought that is flowing through but does not 
              particularly bother you, you are still accumulating karma, that thought,
               those thoughts, are not being revealed and recognized.  All thoughts, 
              whether coarse or very subtle, a mere undercurrent, have to be 
              recognized and liberated as they arise, through this essential point of 
              experiencing them as the expression of awareness, even if they do not 
              plainly distract you from that recognition of awareness.  Therefore, the
               root text says at this point, "ALL SUDDEN THOUGHTS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, 
              MUST BE RECOGNIZED...."<br>The key point of recognition is that there is
               a liberation simultaneous with the arising of the thought, which means 
              it leaves no trace.  This is explained in the commentary as follows, 
              "Whatever thought arises, and especially the undercurrent of thought 
              that is constantly going on, that does not manifest into full 
              consciousness, that does not become loud enough to really disturb us, 
              has to be recognized and liberated."<br><br>"This undercurrent of 
              thought is like water that is flowing through high grass growing in a 
              field.  The water may be flowing around the bottom of the grass but you 
              will not see it:  if you go by the field, it will look like a dry field 
              of grass but actually it is full of water.  Something similar is 
              happening in your mind all the time, and as long as that is not exposed 
              and liberated, the undercurrent still constitutes a vague kind of 
              confusion that adulterates the meditation."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024596" class="threadText">"So that has to be 
              recognized, and recognition means that there has to be a liberation of 
              the thought as it arises.  As long as you are not distracted from this 
              recognition, whatever arises in the mind is directly seen, even at the 
              moment of its arising, as nothing other than the display of innate 
              awareness.  Therefore, even as it arises, thought is liberated.  
              Liberation upon arising means that thought leaves no trace.  It does not
               produce karma, it does not lead to any further thought, it does not 
              leave a trace in the mind."<br><br>"For this liberation to occur, there 
              has to be present what is called a "natural mindfulness."  If you have 
              recognized the innate wisdom and are resting in that recognition, then 
              there is a natural mindfulness present in the mind that will reveal and 
              recognize the nature of whatever arises in the mind, including the 
              undercurrent.  This is not a heavy handed, intentional mindfulness, as 
              though you were holding some kind of hook that you use to try to pull 
              thoughts up from the undercurrent into the field of easy recognition.  
              It is a mindfulness that is naturally present, based on your being 
              settled in the recognition of the nature of innate awareness."<br><br>"It
               is necessary to recognize whatever thought arises and not just to 
              recognize its arising but also to recognize its nature. What will happen
               then is that thoughts will be liberated upon arising; they will not 
              leave any trace.  The analogy for this in the text is "LIKE A DESIGN 
              DRAWN ON WATER."  Even as the design is being drawn, it already 
              vanishes; it does not persist, it does not in any way change the water, 
              or leave a trace in it.  That is what needs to happen with all thoughts,
               including the undercurrent.  Therefore, the root text says at this 
              point, "WITHIN RECOGNITION NO TRACE IS LEFT."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024608" class="threadText">"With regard to that 
              recognition of thought, to repeat, it means more than simply recognizing
               the arising of a thought (or smell, or tastes, or sound, or sight, or 
              feeling, or sensation) it means the self-liberation of the thought.  
              Merely to recognize the presence or arising of a thought (or sound, or 
              sight or....etc) does not sever the production of karma by that thought;
               however, the self-liberation of that thought does.  Self-liberation 
              means that at the very moment at which the thought is recognized, one 
              sees the face of one's own awareness.  Just as the arising of the 
              thought did not distract you from the recognition of the innate nature, 
              the recognition of the thought must also not distract you from the 
              recognition of the nature."<br><br>"Because there is a direct, totally 
              unfiltered recognition of awareness in the midst of the recognition of 
              the thought, you continue to recognize the innate wisdom that you have 
              been recognizing all along.  You remain in that state, resting in the 
              state of recognition, and therefore, thought vanishes without a trace.  
              In this case, recognition means that neither the thought nor the 
              awareness of the thought distracts you from the recognition of awareness
               itself.  And that, the text says, is a very important point about the 
              liberation of thought.</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024608" class="threadText"><br>‘To drive home this essential point, neither 
              the thought nor the recognition of the thought, and the recognition of 
              its nature, distracts you from recognition of the innate awareness, and 
              as a consequence, thought vanishes without a trace.  The mere 
              recognition of it will not do that.  Because of that, the text says at 
              this point, "RECOGNIZE THE DHARMAKAYA, WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF 
              LIBERATION."’</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024612" class="threadText">"Again, recognition of 
              thought here means recognizing the nature, not just recognizing the 
              presence of thought.  This causes the thought to vanish like a design 
              drawn on water; as the thought is arising, it already vanishes.  It is 
              experienced as having no duration and no aftereffect.  Just as for a 
              design drawn on water there is the simultaneous appearance and 
              dissolution of the design, so with thought there is a simultaneous 
              occurrence of arising and liberation."<br><br>"Self-liberation means 
              that just as thought arises of itself, it liberates by itself.  You do 
              not intentionally generate a thought, and you do not intentionally get 
              rid of it, it is self-arisen and self-liberated.  Because you are not 
              distracted from the recognition of the innate awareness, the thought is 
              self-liberated as it arises.  As long as you rest in the innate 
              awareness, this self-arising and self-liberating quality of thought is 
              unbroken and continuous.  Because of the fact that the arising and 
              self-liberation are simultaneous, the text says at this point, "FOR 
              EXAMPLE, IT IS LIKE A DESIGN DRAWN ON WATER."<br><br>"From this it also 
              follows that you in no way attempt to prevent thoughts from arising.  
              Whatever for the thought takes, whether it is normally what you would 
              consider a good thought or an unpleasant thought, makes no difference.  
              Because you never waver from the recognition of the innate nature, which
               includes the nature of thought, whatever thought arises is liberated by
               being recognized as an expression of this nature.  This must be held as
               a very important part of meditation practice.  So therefore, the text 
              at this point says, "THERE IS AN UNCEASING CONTINUITY OF SELF-ARISING 
              AND SELF-LIBERATION OF THOUGHT."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024615" class="threadText">"When one uses thoughts 
              in this way to train in the recognition of the Dharmakaya, of innate 
              awareness, whatever thought arises becomes an opportunity to train in 
              the recognition of this awareness.  When thoughts are self-liberated 
              like this, not only do they not pose a problem, they actually become an 
              opportunity for enhancement.  When the arising of a thought is seen as 
              an arising of awareness, when thought is recognized as being of the 
              fundamental nature of that innate awareness, then the coarser and more 
              outrageous a thought is, the more clarity and sharpness of awareness it 
              actually brings up."<br><br>"Since there has been no separation of 
              awareness and occurrence in the mind, no matter how intense a thought 
              is, the recognizing and liberating awareness that occurs simultaneous 
              with it will be equally intense.  Because of that, the root text says 
              next, "WHATEVER THOUGHT ARISES IN THE MIND IS FOOD FOR NAKED AWARENESS 
              AND EMPTINESS."<br><br>"This brings up a crucial point that 
              distinguishes Dzogchen meditation from other approaches.  In most 
              approaches to meditation, one is told either that one has to get 
              thoughts to stop altogether, or at least one has to ameliorate their 
              content.  Some thoughts are alright and other thoughts are not; one has 
              to try to clean them up a bit.  But in Dzogchen, we view thoughts as a 
              source of great help in our meditation practice.  Because as long as 
              there is sufficient stability of recognition, all that thoughts do is to
               bring out further clarity of awareness.  Even the most outrageous 
              thought, such as fierce anger or intense desire or pride, whatever 
              arises in the mind, is only fuel that will cause one's awareness to be 
              even clearer."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024623" class="threadText">"Because one maintains 
              this impartiality in the recognition of the nature of thought, all 
              thoughts are liberated as they arise.  Because of that, nothing that 
              arises in the mind is experienced as other than the expression of 
              Dharmakaya, of innate awareness.  So therefore, the root text says, 
              "WHATEVER OCCURS IN THE MIND IS THE DISPLAY OF THE ROYAL DHARMAKAYA."<br><br>"When
               thoughts are experienced in this way, then the conceptuality of mind, 
              which is nothing other than ignorance, and all of the various forms 
              which that ignorance can take, is purified into the expanse of wisdom 
              awareness of the Dharmakaya.  In being recognized as never having a 
              nature other than that, thoughts do not leave traces, and thus do not 
              manifest true impurity; therefore, they are purified.</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024623" class="threadText">As long as this
               recognition is maintained, this purification is unceasing.  It is not 
              better at some times and worse at other times, or present at some times 
              and absent at other times.  As long as the fundamental recognition of 
              innate awareness is maintained, whatever thought arises in the mind is 
              in its essence empty and is experienced as the expression of that 
              emptiness.  So therefore, the root text says, "THOUGHTS ARE PURIFIED BY 
              THEMSELVES AND LEAVE NO TRACE.  HOW WONDERFUL!"</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024633" class="threadText">"The word for "becoming 
              accustomed to something" in Tibetan is etymologically closely related to
               the word for meditation, and there is a saying in the Dzogchen 
              tradition, "There is nothing to meditate upon, but there is a process of
               getting used to it."  So when you become accustomed to this approach to
               thought, then thought itself arises as meditation, and you finally heal
               the split between stillness and occurrence in the mind."<br><br>"In 
              this practice, there is no preference with regard to whether the mind 
              has thoughts or does not have thoughts.  Even when thoughts arise, they 
              in no way  impede your stillness, the stillness of course being the 
              stillness of recognition.  The arising of thoughts in no way harms your 
              meditation anymore.  So therefore, the text says, <br>"THE WAY THOUGHTS 
              ARISE IS JUST AS BEFORE."<br><br>"When you are accustomed to this 
              practice, that does not mean that thoughts will not arise.  In fact, 
              apart from their being recognized as the display of innate awareness, 
              the variety of thoughts that arise, for example, as delight or 
              displeasure, hope or fear, is exactly like the way thoughts arise for 
              anyone else, for an untrained person.  The difference is explained in 
              the next line of the text: an ordinary person gets caught by thought, 
              clings to thought, reacts to thought with a heavy-handedness, a 
              solidification, that consists of trying to hold onto thoughts and states
               of mind that are perceived as pleasant and as creating security, and 
              attempting to get rid of, or being frightened by, thoughts and state of 
              mind that are perceived as unpleasant or as threatening."</span></p>
              <p><span id="textNode_26024642" class="threadText">"Because of this 
              reaction to thought, the ordinary person accumulates karma and comes 
              under the power of his or her attachment and aversion.  Of course, the 
              whole process of Samsara rests on that.  In this practice, thoughts 
              naturally arise, and the variety of thoughts that arise is the same, but
               since for the practitioner these thoughts are liberated simultaneously 
              with their arising, they do not accumulate karma.  Thus, the difference 
              between the practitioner and the untrained person in not in the arising 
              or non-arising of thoughts, but in whether thoughts are fixated on or 
              liberated."<br><br>These quotes are from a very large text.  There is a
