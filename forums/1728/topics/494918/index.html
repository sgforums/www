              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Wisdom Over Justice</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Thanissaro Bhikkhu| November 3, 2017 Lion’s Roar</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Justice is of course a noble goal. But, says monk-scholar
              Thanissaro Bhikkhu, the Buddha emphasized a different approach to the
              achievement of harmony in the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A few years ago, The Onion “reported” on a video released by
              a Buddhist fundamentalist sect that threatened to unleash waves of peace and
              harmony across the world, waves that no one could stop or resist. As with all
              good satire, the report makes you stop and think. Why are peace and harmony the
              worst “threats” that would come from the fundamentals of the Buddha’s
              teachings?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The answer, I think, lies in the fact that the Buddha never
              tried to impose his ideas of justice on the world at large. This was very wise
              and perceptive on his part. It’s easy enough to see how imposed standards of
              justice can be a menace to well-being when those standards are somebody else’s.
              It’s much harder to see the menace when the standards are your own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha did have clear standards for right and wrong, of
              skillful and unskillful ways of engaging in the world, but he hardly ever spoke
              of justice at all. Instead, he spoke of actions that would lead to harmony and
              true happiness in the world. And instead of explaining his ideas for harmony in
              the context of pursuing a just world, he presented them in the context of
              merit: actions that pursue a happiness blameless both in itself and in the way
              it’s pursued.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To be genuine, goodwill has to come voluntarily from the
              heart.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The concept of merit is widely misunderstood in the West.
              It’s often seen as the selfish quest for your own well-being. Actually, though,
              the actions that qualify as meritorious are the Buddha’s preliminary answer to
              the set of questions that he says lie at the basis of wisdom: “What is
              skillful? What is blameless? What, when I do it, will lead to long-term welfare
              and happiness?” If you search for happiness by means of the three types of
              meritorious action—generosity, virtue, and the development of universal
              goodwill—it’s hard to see how that happiness could be branded as selfish. These
              are the actions that, through their inherent goodness, make human society
              livable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And the Buddha never imposed even these actions on anyone as
              commands or obligations. When asked where a gift should be given, instead of
              saying, “To Buddhists,” he said, “Wherever the mind feels confidence” (SN
              3:24). Similarly with virtue: Dhamma teachers have frequently noted that the
              Buddha’s precepts are not commandments, but training rules that people can
              undertake voluntarily. As for the practice of universal goodwill, that’s
              private matter that can’t be forced on anyone at all. To be genuine, it has to
              come voluntarily from the heart. The only “should” lying behind the Buddha’s
              teachings on merit is a conditional one: If you want true happiness, this is
              what you should do. Not because the Buddha said so, but because this is how
              cause and effect work in the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After all, the Buddha didn’t claim to speak for a creator god
              or a protective deity. He wasn’t a universal lawgiver. The only laws and
              standards for fairness he formulated were the rules of conduct for those who
              chose to be ordained in the bhikkhu and bhikkhini sanghas, where those who
              carry out communal duties are enjoined to avoid any form of bias coming from
              desire, aversion, delusion, or fear. Apart from that, the Buddha spoke simply
              as an expert in how to put an end to suffering. His authority came not from a
              claim to power but from the honesty and efficacy of his own search for a
              deathless happiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This meant that he was in no position to impose his ideas on
              anyone who didn’t voluntarily accept them. And he didn’t seek to put himself in
              such a position. As the Pali Canon notes, the request for the Buddha to assume
              a position of sovereignty so that he could rule justly over others came, not
              from any of his followers, but from MÄ�ra (SN 4:20). There are several reasons
              for why he refused MÄ�ra’s request—and why he advised others to refuse such
              requests as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Dangers of Power</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Even if you tried to rule justly, there would always be
              people dissatisfied with your rule. As the Buddha commented to MÄ�ra, even two
              mountains of solid gold bullion wouldn’t be enough to satisfy the wants of any
              one person. No matter how well wealth and opportunities were distributed under
              your rule, there would always be those dissatisfied with their portions. As a
              result, there would always be those you’d have to fight in order to maintain
              your power. And, in trying to maintain power, you inevitably develop an
              attitude where the ends justify the means. Those means can involve violence and
              punishments, driving you further and further away from being able to admit the
              truth, or even wanting to know it (AN 3:70). Even the mere fact of being in a
              position of power means that you’re surrounded by sycophants and schemers,
              people determined to prevent you from knowing the truth about them (MN 90). As
              far as the Buddha was concerned, political power was so dangerous that he
              advised his monks to avoid, if possible, associating with a ruler, one of the
              dangers being that if the ruler formulated a disastrous policy, the policy
              would be blamed on the monk (Pc 83).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Another reason for the Buddha’s reluctance to try to impose
              his ideas of justice on others was his perception that the effort to seek
              justice as an absolute end would run counter to the main goal of his teachings:
              the ending of suffering and the attainment of a true and blameless happiness.
              He never tried to prevent rulers from imposing justice in their kingdoms, but
              he also never used the Dhamma to justify a theory of justice. And he never used
              the teaching on past kamma to justify the mistreatment of the weak or
              disadvantaged: Regardless of whatever their past kamma may have been, if you
              mistreat them, the kamma of mistreatment becomes yours. The fact that people
              are currently weak and poor doesn’t mean that their kamma requires them to stay
              weak and poor. There’s no way of knowing, from the outside, what other kammic
              potentials are waiting to sprout from their past.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At the same time, though, the Buddha never encouraged his
              followers to seek retribution, i.e., punishment for old wrongs. The conflict
              between retributive justice and true happiness is well illustrated by the
              famous story of Aá¹…gulimÄ�la (MN 86). Aá¹…gulimÄ�la was a bandit who had killed many
              people—the Canon counts at least 100; the Commentary, 999—and wore a garland
              (mÄ�la) made of their fingers (aá¹…guli). Yet after an encounter with the Buddha,
              he had such an extreme change of heart that he abandoned his violent ways,
              awakened a sense of compassion, and eventually became an arahant.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Most of us like to identify with Aá¹…gulimÄ�la: If a person with
              his history could gain awakening, there’s hope for us all. But in identifying
              with him, we forget the feelings of those he had terrorized and the relatives
              of those he had killed. After all, he had literally gotten away with murder.
              It’s easy to understand, then, as the story tells us, that when Aá¹…gulimÄ�la was
              going for alms after his awakening, people would throw stones at him, and he’d
              return from his almsround, “his head broken open and dripping with blood, his
              bowl broken, and his outer robe ripped to shreds.” As the Buddha reassured him,
              his wounds were nothing compared to the sufferings he would have undergone if
              he hadn’t reached awakening. And if the outraged people had fully satisfied
              their thirst for justice, meting out the suffering they thought he deserved, he
              wouldn’t have had the chance to reach awakening at all. So his was a case in
              which the end of suffering took precedence over justice in any strict sense of
              the word.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">An untrained mind is like a small cup of water; a
              well-trained mind, like the water in a large, clear river.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Aá¹…gulimÄ�la’s case illustrates a general principle stated in
              AN 3:101: If the workings of kamma required strict, tit-for-tat justice—with
              your having to experience the consequences of each act just as you inflicted it
              on others—there’s no way that anyone could reach the end of suffering. The
              reason we can reach awakening is because even though actions of a certain type
              give a corresponding type of result, the intensity of how that result is felt
              is determined, not only by the original action, but also—and more
              importantly—by our state of mind when the results ripen. If you’ve developed
              unlimited goodwill and equanimity, and have trained well in virtue,
              discernment, and the ability to be overcome neither by pleasure nor pain, then
              when the results of past bad actions ripen, you’ll hardly experience them at
              all. If you haven’t trained yourself in these ways, then even the results of a
              trifling bad act can consign you to hell.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha illustrates this principle with three similes. The
              first is the easiest to digest: The results of past bad actions are like a
              large salt crystal. An untrained mind is like a small cup of water; a
              well-trained mind, like the water in a large, clear river. If you put the salt
              into the water of the cup, you can’t drink it because it’s too salty. But if
              you put the salt into the river, you can still drink the water because there’s
              so much more of it and it’s so clean. All in all, an attractive image.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The other two similes, though, underscore the point that the
              principle they’re illustrating goes against some very basic ideas of fairness.
              In both of these similes, the untrained mind is like a poor person; the
              well-trained mind, like a rich person, a king, or a king’s minister. In one
              simile, the bad action is like the theft of money; in the other, like the theft
              of a goat. In both similes, the untrained mind is like a poor person who gets
              heavily punished for either of these two crimes, whereas the well-trained mind
              is like the rich person who doesn’t get punished for either theft at all. In
              these cases, the images are much less attractive, but they drive home the point
              that, for kamma to work in a way that rewards the training of the mind to put
              an end to suffering, it can’t work in such a way as to guarantee justice. If we
              insisted on a system of kamma that did guarantee justice, the path to freedom
              from suffering would be closed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“But isn’t justice a
              nobler goal than happiness?”</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This set of values, which gives preference to happiness over
              justice when there’s a conflict between the two, doesn’t sit very well with
              many Western Buddhists. “Isn’t justice a larger and nobler goal than
              happiness?” we think. The short answer to this question relates to the Buddha’s
              compassion: Seeing that we’ve all done wrong in the past, his compassion
              extended to wrong-doers as well as to those who’ve been wronged. For this
              reason, he taught the way to the end of suffering regardless of whether that
              suffering was “deserved” or not.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For the long answer, though, we have to turn and look at
              ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Many of us born and educated in the West, even if we’ve
              rejected the monotheism that underlies our civilization, tend to hold to the
              idea that there are objective standards of justice to which everyone should
              conform. When distressed over the unfair state of society, we often express our
              views for righting wrongs, not as suggestions of wise courses of action, but as
              objective standards as to how everyone is duty-bound to act. We tend to forget,
              though, that the very idea that those standards could be objective and
              universally binding makes sense only in the context of a monotheistic worldview:
              one in which the universe was created at a specific point in time—say, by the
              Hebrew God or by Aristotle’s Unmoved Mover—with a specific purpose.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For example, retributive justice—the justice that seeks to
              right old wrongs by punishing the first wrongdoer and/or those who responded
              excessively to the first wrong—demands a specific beginning point in time so
              that we can determine who threw the first stone and tally up the score of who
              did what after that first provocation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Restorative justice—the justice that seeks to return
              situations to their proper state before the first stone was thrown—requires not
              only a specific beginning point in time, but also that that beginning point be
              a good place to which to return.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Distributive justice—the justice that seeks to determine who
              should have what, and how things and opportunities should be redistributed from
              those who have them to those who should have them—requires a common source,
              above and beyond individuals, from which all things flow and that sets the
              purposes that those things should serve.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Only when these conditions are met can these forms of justice
              be objective and binding on all. In the Buddha’s worldview, though, none of
              these conditions hold. People have tried to import Western ideas of objective
              justice into the Buddha’s teachings—some have even suggested that this will be
              one of the great Western contributions to Buddhism, filling in a serious
              lack—but there is no way that those ideas can be forced on the Dhamma without
              doing serious damage to the Buddhist worldview. This fact, in and of itself,
              has prompted many people to advocate jettisoning the Buddhist worldview and
              replacing it with something closer to one of our own. But a careful look at
              that worldview, and the consequences that the Buddha drew from it, shows that
              the Buddha’s teachings on how to find social harmony without recourse to
              objective standards of justice has much to recommend it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha’s Three
              Knowledges</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha developed his worldview from the three knowledges
              he gained on the night of his awakening.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the first knowledge, he saw his own past lives, back for
              thousands and thousands of eons, repeatedly rising and falling through many
              levels of being and through the evolution and collapse of many universes. As he
              later said, the beginning point of the process—called saá¹�sÄ�ra, the
              “wandering-on”—was inconceivable. Not just unknowable, inconceivable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the second knowledge, he saw that the process of death and
              rebirth applied to all beings in the universe, and that—because it had gone on
              so long—it would be hard to find a person who had never been your mother,
              father, brother, sister, son, or daughter in the course of that long, long
              time. He also saw that the process was powered by all the many actions of all
              the many beings, and that it serves the designs of no one being in particular.
              As one Dhamma summary has it, “There is no one in charge” (MN 82). This means
              that the universe serves no clear or singular purpose. What’s more, it has the
              potential to continue without end. Unlike a monotheistic universe, with its
              creator passing final judgment, saá¹�sÄ�ra offers no prospect of a fair of just
              closure—or even, apart from nibbÄ�na, any closure at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the context of these knowledges, it’s hard to regard the
              pursuit of justice as an absolute good, for three main reasons.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To begin with, given the lesson of the salt crystal—that
              people suffer more from their mind-state in the present than they do from the
              results of past bad actions as they work out in the external world—no matter
              how much justice you try to bring into the world, people are still going to
              suffer and be dissatisfied as long as their minds are untrained in the
              qualities that make them impervious to suffering. This was why the Buddha, in
              rejecting MÄ�ra’s request, made the comment about the two mountains of solid
              gold. Not only do people suffer when their minds are untrained, the qualities
              of an untrained mind also lead them to destroy any system of justice that might
              be established in the world. As long as people’s minds are untrained, justice
              would not solve the problem of their suffering, nor would it be able to last.
              This fact holds regardless of whether you adopt the Buddha’s view of the world
              or a more modern view of a cosmos with vast dimensions of time and no end in
              sight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Second, as noted above, the idea of a just resolution of a
              conflict requires a story with a clear beginning point—and a clear end point.
              But in the long time frame of the Buddha’s universe, the stories have no clear
              beginning and—potentially—no end. There’s no way to determine who did what
              first, through all our many lifetimes, and there’s no way that a final tally
              would ever stay final. Everything is swept away, only to regroup, again and
              again. This means that justice cannot be viewed as an end, for in this universe
              there are no ends, aside from nibbÄ�na. You can’t use justice as an end to
              justify means, for it—like everything else in the universe—is nothing but
              means. Harmony can be found only by making sure that the means are clearly
              good.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Third, for people to agree on a standard of justice, they
              have to agree on the stories that justify the use of force to right wrongs. But
              in a universe where the boundaries of stories are impossible to establish,
              there’s no story that everyone will agree on. This means that the stories have
              to be imposed—a fact that holds even if you don’t accept the premises of kamma
              and rebirth. The result is that the stories, instead of uniting us, tend to
              divide us: Think of all the religious and political wars that have started over
              conflicting stories of who did what to whom and why. The arguments over whose
              stories to believe can lead to passions and conflict that, from the perspective
              of the Buddha’s awakening, keep us bound to the suffering in saá¹�sÄ�ra long into
              the future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">These are some of the reasons why, after gaining his first
              two knowledges on the night of awakening, the Buddha decided that the best use
              of what he had learned was to turn inward to find the causes of saá¹�sÄ�ra in his
              own heart and mind, and to escape from kamma entirely by training his mind.
              These are also the reasons why, when he taught others how to solve the problem
              of suffering, he focused primarily on the internal causes of suffering, and
              only secondarily on the external ones.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What would a Buddhist
              program of social change look like?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">All this doesn’t mean, though, that there’s no room in the
              Buddha’s teachings for efforts to address issues of social injustice. After
              all, the Buddha himself would, on occasion, describe the conditions for social
              peace and harmony, along with the rewards that come from helping the
              disadvantaged. However, he always subsumed his social teachings under the
              larger framework of his teachings on the wise pursuit of happiness. When noting
              that a wise king shares his wealth to ensure that all his people all have
              enough to make a living, he presented it not as an issue of justice, but as a
              wise form of generosity that promotes a stable society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">So if you want to promote a program of social change that
              would be true to Buddhist principles, it would be wise to heed the Buddha’s
              framework for understanding social well-being, beginning with his teachings on
              merit. In other words, the pursuit of justice, to be in line with the Dhamma,
              has to be regarded as part of a practice of generosity, virtue, and the
              development of universal goodwill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What would this entail? To begin with, it would require
              focusing primarily on the means by which change would be pursued. The choice of
              a goal, as long as you found it inspiring, would be entirely free, but it would
              have to be approached through meritorious means.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This would entail placing the same conditions on the pursuit
              of justice that the Buddha placed on the practice of merit:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">People should be encouraged to join in the effort only of
              their own free will. No demands, no attempts to impose social change as a duty,
              and no attempts to make them feel guilty for not joining your cause. Instead,
              social change should be presented as a joyous opportunity for expressing good
              qualities of the heart. To borrow an expression from the Canon, those qualities
              are best promoted by embodying them yourself, and by speaking in praise of how
              those practices will work for the long-term benefit for anyone else who adopts
              them, too.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Efforts for change should not involve harming yourself or
              harming others. “Not harming yourself,” in the context of generosity, means not
              over-extending yourself, and a similar principle would apply to not harming
              others: Don’t ask them to make sacrifices that would lead to their harm. “Not
              harming yourself” in the context of virtue would mean not breaking the
              precepts—e.g., no killing or lying under any circumstances—whereas not harming
              others would mean not getting them to break the precepts (AN 4:99). After all,
              an underlying principle of kamma is that people are agents who will receive
              results in line with the type of actions they perform. If you try to persuade
              them to break the precepts, you’re trying to increase their suffering down the
              line.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The goodwill motivating these efforts would have to be
              universal, with no exceptions. In the Buddha’s expression, you would have to
              protect your goodwill at all times, willing to risk your life for it, the same
              way a mother would risk her life for her only child (Sn 1:8). This means
              maintaining goodwill for everyone, regardless of whether they “deserve” it:
              goodwill for those who you see as guilty as much as for those you see as
              innocent, and for those who disapprove of your program and stand in your way,
              no matter how violent or unfair their resistance becomes. For your program to
              embody universal goodwill, you have to make sure that it works for the
              long-term benefit even of those who initially oppose it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are two main advantages to viewing the effort to bring
              about social justice under the framework of merit. The first is that, by
              encouraging generosity, virtue, and the development of universal goodwill,
              you’re addressing the internal states of mind that would lead to injustice no
              matter how well a society might be structured. Generosity helps to overcome the
              greed that leads people to take unfair advantage of one another. Virtue helps
              to prevent the lies, thefts, and other callous actions that drive people apart.
              And universal goodwill helps to overcome the various forms of tribalism that
              encourage favoritism and other forms of unfairness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Second, generosity, virtue, and universal goodwill are, in
              and of themselves, good activities. Even though you may be inspired by the
              story of the Buddha’s awakening to engage in them, they’re so clearly good that
              they need no story to justify them—and so they wouldn’t require the sort of
              stories that would serve simply to divide us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Regarding attempts at social change under the principle of
              kamma would also entail having to accept the principle that any forms of
              injustice that do not respond to the activities of merit have to be treated
              with equanimity. After all, the results of some past bad actions are so strong
              that nothing can be done to stop them. And if they could be alleviated now only
              by unskillful actions—such as lies, killing, theft, or violence—the trade-off
              in terms of long-term consequences wouldn’t be worth it. Any such attempts
              would not, in the Buddha’s analysis, be wise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In areas like this, we have to return to the Buddha’s main
              focus: the causes of suffering inside. And the good news here is that we don’t
              have to wait for a perfect society to find true happiness. It’s possible to put
              an end to our own sufferings—to stop “saá¹�sÄ�ra-ing”—no matter how bad the world
              is outside. And this should not be seen a selfish pursuit. It would actually be
              more selfish to make people ashamed of their desire to be free so that they
              will come back to help you and your friends establish your ideas of justice,
              but with no true end in sight. A final, established state of justice is an
              impossibility. An unconditioned happiness, available to all regardless of their
              karmic background, is not.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And the road to that happiness is far from selfish. It
              requires the activities of merit—generosity, virtue, and universal
              goodwill—which always spread long-term happiness in the world: a happiness that
              heals old divisions and creates no new ones in their place. In this way, those
              who attain this happiness are like the stars that are sucked out of space and
              time to enter black holes that are actually dense with brightness: As they
              leave, they unleash waves of dazzling light.</span></p>
