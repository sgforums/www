            <div class='col-md body'>This duality between the Matrix and the reality beyond it sets up the ultimate goal of the rebels, which is to free all minds from the Matrix and allow humans to live out their lives in the real world beyond. <strong>In making this point, the film-makers draw on both Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist ideas.</strong><br><br>Alluding to the Theravada ideal of the arhat, the film suggests that enlightenment is <strong>achieved through individual effort</strong>. As his initial guide, <span style="color: darkred;">Morpheus </span>makes it clear that <span style="color: darkred;">Neo</span> cannot depend upon him for enlightenment. <span style="color: darkred;">Morpheus</span> explains<span style="color: blue;">, <span style="font-style: italic;">"No one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself." </span></span><span style="color: darkred;">Morpheus</span> tells <span style="color: darkred;">Neo</span> <strong>he must make the final shift in perception entirely on his own</strong>. He says:<span style="color: blue;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">"IÂ’m trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. YouÂ’re the one that has to walk through it." </span></span><br><br><img src="http://sg.wrs.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9FJqhlRj6REgkMBYZ4u4gt./SIG=1204c08u4/EXP=1151721681/**http%3a//www.thyes.com/matrix/img/morpheus.jpg"><br><br>For <strong>Theravada Buddhists</strong>, <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"manÂ’s emancipation depends on his own realization of the Truth, and not on the benevolent grace of a god or any external power as a reward for his obedient good behavior." </span></span>The <strong>Dhammapada</strong> urges the one seeking enlightenment to <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">"Free thyself from the past, free thyself from the future, free thyself from the present. Crossing to the farther shore of existence, with mind released everywhere, no more shalt thou come to birth and decay." </span></span>As <span style="color: darkred;">Morpheus</span> says to <span style="color: darkred;">Neo</span>, <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> "ThereÂ’s a difference between knowing the path and walking the path."</span> </span>And as the <strong>Buddha</strong> taught his followers, <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> "You yourselves should make the effort; the Awakened Ones are only teachers." </span></span>As one already on the path to enlightenment, <span style="color: darkred;">Morpheus</span> is only a guide; ultimately <span style="color: darkred;">Neo</span> must recognize the truth for himself.<br><br>Yet <strong>The Matrix also embraces ideas found in Mahayana Buddhism</strong>, especially in its particular concern for liberation for all people through the guidance of those who remain in samsara and postpone their own final enlightenment in order to help others as bodhisattvas. The crew members of the Nebuchadnezzar epitomize this compassion. Rather than remain outside of the Matrix where they are safer, they choose to re-enter it repeatedly as ambassadors of knowledge with the ultimate goal of freeing the minds and eventually also the bodies of those who are trapped within the MatrixÂ’s digital web. <strong>The film attempts to blend the Theravada ideal of the arhat with the Mahayana ideal of the bodhisattva, presenting the crew as concerned for those still stuck in the Matrix and willing to re-enter the Matrix to help them, while simultaneously arguing that final realization is an individual process.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Problem of <strong>Samsara</strong>. Even the title of the film evokes the Buddhist worldview. The <strong>Matrix</strong> is described by <span style="color: darkred;">Morpheus</span> as <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"a prison for your mind." </span></span>It is a dependent <strong>"construct"</strong> made up of the interlocking digital projections of billions of human beings who are unaware of the illusory nature of the reality in which they live and are completely dependent on the hardware attached to their real bodies and the elaborate software programs created by AI. This <strong>"construct" resembles the Buddhist idea of samsara, which teaches that the world in which we live our daily lives is constructed only from the sensory projections formulated from our own desires.</strong><br><br>When <span style="color: darkred;">Morpheus</span> takes <span style="color: darkred;">Neo</span> into the "<strong>construct"</strong> to teach him about the Matrix, <span style="color: darkred;">Neo </span>learns that the way in which he had perceived himself in the Matrix was nothing more than "the mental projection of your digital self." The "real" world, which we associate with what we feel, smell, taste, and see, "is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain." The world, <span style="color: darkred;">Morpheus</span> explains, exists "now only as part of a neural interactive simulation that we call the Matrix." In <strong>Buddhist terms</strong>, we could say that <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"because it is empty of self or of what belongs to self, it is therefore said: Â‘The world is empty.Â’ And what is empty of self and what belongs to self? The eye, material shapes, visual consciousness, impression on the eye -- all these are empty of self and of what belongs to self."</span></span> According to <strong>Buddhism</strong> and according to The Matrix,<strong> the conviction of reality based upon sensory experience, ignorance, and desire keeps humans locked in illusion until they are able to recognize the false nature of reality and relinquish their mistaken sense of identity. </strong><br><br><img src="http://www.obskure.com/cover_albums/samsara_awakening.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Drawing upon the Buddhist doctrine of <strong><span class="large">Dependent Co-Origination</span></strong>, the film presents reality within the Matrix as a conglomerate of the illusions of all humans caught within its snare. Similarly, <strong>Buddhism teaches that the suffering of human beings is dependent upon a cycle of ignorance and desire which locks humans into a repetitive cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.</strong> The principle is stated in a short formula in the <strong>Samyutta-nikaya:</strong><br><br><span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: blue;">If this is that comes to be;<br><br>from the arising of this that arises;<br><br>if this is not that does not come to be;<br><br>from the stopping of this that is stopped.</span></strong></span></span><br><br><img src="http://martine.org/code_shot.jpg"><br><br>The idea of <strong>Dependent Co-Origination </strong>is illustrated in the context of the film through the illusion of the Matrix. The viability of the MatrixÂ’s illusion depends upon the belief by those enmeshed in it that the Matrix itself is reality. AIÂ’s software program is, in and of itself, no illusion at all. Only when humans interact with its programs do they become enmeshed in a corporately-created illusion, the Matrix, or samsara, which reinforces itself through the interactions of those beings involved within it. Thus the MatrixÂ’s reality only exists when actual human minds subjectively experience its programs.<br><br><strong>The problem, then, can be seen in Buddhist terms</strong>. Humans are trapped in a cycle of illusion, and their ignorance of this cycle keeps them locked in it, fully dependent upon their own interactions with the program and the illusions of sensory experience which these provide, and the sensory projections of others. These projections are strengthened by humansÂ’ enormous desire to believe that what they perceive to be real is in fact real. This desire is so strong that it overcomes <span style="color: darkred;">Cypher</span>, who can no longer tolerate the "desert of the real" and asks to be reinserted into the Matrix. As he sits with <span style="color: darkred;">Agent Smith </span>in an upscale restaurant smoking a cigar with a large glass of brandy, <span style="color: darkred;">Cypher </span>explains his motives:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"You know, I know this steak doesnÂ’t exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss."</span></span><br><br><img src="http://sg.wrs.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9ibyjwAm6RECRYBAhEu4gt./SIG=125i9gi94/EXP=1151724672/**http%3a//www.pei.auracom.com/gentlemanjim/steak.jpg"></div>

Demiurge came from the womb of the one true transcendant God's wife, Sophia (knowledge) as a result of her passion to truly know the transcendant God. When born, Demiurge was cast from the Pleroma (heaven and home of the transcendant God). He did not retain knowledge of the Pleroma or the transcendant God. Thus, he believed himself to be alone as the Almighty. He created for himself this universe from existing matter, in his own flawed image. In this universe he created for himself a home, known to us as heaven, followers known as Archons (angels), the earth, and life on earth, so as to amuse and worship him. In humanity exisits a divine spark, a trace of the transcendant God, which wishes to ultimatley return to the Pleroma. Knowing this, the Archons created the circumstances on earth, sin and the like to trap the divine spark (souls) on earth for eternity. Only through Gnosis can a soul attain the knowledge necessary to outwit the Archons following bodily death and return to the Pleroma. Gnosis is attained through the help of Aeons, deities that exist in the Pleroma and momentarily return to earth to help free the divine sparks. The biblical figures like Jesus are Aeons. It is here that the stage is set for the Matrix movies. One misconception is that the Matrix stories are told from the aspect of the human plight. This is incorrect. The actual struggle is within the machines.<br><br>The "Real" World: Pleroma<br><br>The Matrix: Earth<br><br>The Source (big building where the architect resides): Demiurge's Heaven.<br><br>Architect: Demiurge or flawed creator. He creates the Matrix to "mathematical perfection", except of course of the anomoly which he cannot get rid of. This exhibits his own imperfection as his model of perfection is imperfect.<br><br>Oracle: Barbelo, Demiurge's consort who was born as Demiurge's first thought. As the Demiurge creates his imperfect "perfect" world and is passive in its maintenance, except to "balance the equation" from time to time, Barbelo is his active, energetic, complement. She sees that the Demiurge is flawed and works within his system to break down the barriers that he has constructed to trap the divine sparks. In Reloaded, the Architect told Neo that it was the Oracle who helped him set up the system to control the anomoly to suit his purposes, ie., the role of the One to reboot the Matrix. In Revolutions, she herself stated to Neo that her job was to unbalance the Architect's equation. These two are the Ying and Yang of the universe, working for and against one another at the same time.<br><br>For the remainder of the characters, I will be switiching to traditional Christian Biblical names.<br><br>Merovigian: Adam, the first man. Merv was described as the "first exile", cast out from the Demiurge's heaven, when he sought and received "too much" knowledge. Gnostic teachings tell us that Sophia manifested herself as the serpent and brought the knowledge that the creator was untrue and that they themselves were of holy origin in Pleroma. Persephone described him as "once like Neo". But once, he had the knowledge, that the Matrix was a barren reality of pain, suffering, and "causation". Emotions such as love and the like are illusions to keep him trapped. He now wishes only to survive, to outlast the Architect. One misconception about this character is that he was an adversary to Neo. He was not. He actually helped Neo along the way (and had a bit of fun in the process).

Demiurge came from the womb of the one true transcendant God's wife, Sophia (knowledge) as a result of her passion to truly know the transcendant God. When born, Demiurge was cast from the Pleroma (heaven and home of the transcendant God). He did not retain knowledge of the Pleroma or the transcendant God. Thus, he believed himself to be alone as the Almighty. He created for himself this universe from existing matter, in his own flawed image. In this universe he created for himself a home, known to us as heaven, followers known as Archons (angels), the earth, and life on earth, so as to amuse and worship him. In humanity exisits a divine spark, a trace of the transcendant God, which wishes to ultimatley return to the Pleroma. Knowing this, the Archons created the circumstances on earth, sin and the like to trap the divine spark (souls) on earth for eternity. Only through Gnosis can a soul attain the knowledge necessary to outwit the Archons following bodily death and return to the Pleroma. Gnosis is attained through the help of Aeons, deities that exist in the Pleroma and momentarily return to earth to help free the divine sparks. The biblical figures like Jesus are Aeons. It is here that the stage is set for the Matrix movies. One misconception is that the Matrix stories are told from the aspect of the human plight. This is incorrect. The actual struggle is within the machines.<br><br>The "Real" World: Pleroma<br><br>The Matrix: Earth<br><br>The Source (big building where the architect resides): Demiurge's Heaven.<br><br>Architect: Demiurge or flawed creator. He creates the Matrix to "mathematical perfection", except of course of the anomoly which he cannot get rid of. This exhibits his own imperfection as his model of perfection is imperfect.<br><br>Oracle: Barbelo, Demiurge's consort who was born as Demiurge's first thought. As the Demiurge creates his imperfect "perfect" world and is passive in its maintenance, except to "balance the equation" from time to time, Barbelo is his active, energetic, complement. She sees that the Demiurge is flawed and works within his system to break down the barriers that he has constructed to trap the divine sparks. In Reloaded, the Architect told Neo that it was the Oracle who helped him set up the system to control the anomoly to suit his purposes, ie., the role of the One to reboot the Matrix. In Revolutions, she herself stated to Neo that her job was to unbalance the Architect's equation. These two are the Ying and Yang of the universe, working for and against one another at the same time.<br><br>For the remainder of the characters, I will be switiching to traditional Christian Biblical names.<br><br>Merovigian: Adam, the first man. Merv was described as the "first exile", cast out from the Demiurge's heaven, when he sought and received "too much" knowledge. Gnostic teachings tell us that Sophia manifested herself as the serpent and brought the knowledge that the creator was untrue and that they themselves were of holy origin in Pleroma. Persephone described him as "once like Neo". But once, he had the knowledge, that the Matrix was a barren reality of pain, suffering, and "causation". Emotions such as love and the like are illusions to keep him trapped. He now wishes only to survive, to outlast the Architect. One misconception about this character is that he was an adversary to Neo. He was not. He actually helped Neo along the way (and had a bit of fun in the process). THink about it; HE was holding the keymaker, who was being stalked for deletion by the system agents. HE trapped Neo in the train station, protecting him from Smith's growing power in the Matrix. HE made it possible for Sati's parents to bring her into the Matrix and allow her father to explain much to Neo. HE allowed Neo to be saved when the time was right. And, HE led Smith to the Oracle so as to end her meddling and facilitate the end.<br><br>Persephone: Eve, keeper of hidden secrets.<br><br>The One of the 5th Matrix (Morpheus' teacher): Seth, the descendants of which are the gnostic followers. His knowledge was passed down from his father Adam and mother Eve. The movies don't elude to a connection between Merv and the prior One, except that Merv "survived" him. However, it is clear that the origin of the human resistance was Morpheus' mentor, as he chose the 2nd door to rebuild Zion, reboot the Matrix, and begin freeing new minds.<br><br>Morpheus: Moses, liberator of the Hebrews.

Christ is viewed by the gnostics as an Aeon sent down from the Pleroma, who takes human form and teaches humanity the secrets of gnosis. He teaches, is crucifyed, and returns from the dead to lead his flock to salvation, do battle with the Satan, and usher in a time of unheralded peace.

Words create perceptions. The baby does not look at this room and see "chairs," "tables," "rugs," and "people." Those are ideas. Thought draws boundary lines and we <span style="font-style: italic;">learn</span> to see "a chair" and "a rug." To the infant, it may well be one undivided flowing whole, or it may be divided on a completely different basis, by colour instead of function, or whatever. Nations are thought-forms with no inherent reality, and yet we take them so seriously that we fight wars over them.<br><br>If we believe this is a hostile universe, that's what it is. If we believe it is a loving universe, that's what it is. If we believe we are powerless, then we are powerless. To an amazing extent, thought creates the reality we <span style="font-style: italic;">appear</span> to live in. What we pay attention to, and what we think and believe, is what we get. We attract what we focus on and expect to find. In a very real sense, that's what actually creates whatever appears. I'm not suggesting that disease, disability, poverty, addiction, and everything else in this world are caused only by thoughts, or certainly not by anyone's individual thoughts in the way that some New Age teaching has put forward. I'm only pointing to the power of thought and attention to create reality. Outside thought, what is there? This is a wonderful question to lie with and to consider. It has been said that the same glass can be seen as half empty or half full. Believe one view, and you are disappointed. Believe the other, and you are happy. Believe nothing at all, and where are you?<br><br>~ Joan Tollifson, "Awake in the Heartland"</div>
