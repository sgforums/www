              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According
                  to Buddhism. a normal person usually views existence as permanent,
                  satisfactory and having an essence. But reality is some thing quite
                  different and is somewhat counterintuitive.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;">Our senses
                  tell us that things are substantial and real but is this
                  “reality”.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;">Let us try a
                  thought experiment the way Einstein
                  did<span>  </span>with his theory of relativity.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;">Imagine that
                  we are viewing things and events happening on Earth from a distant
                  planet. We know that light takes time to travel and scientists have
                  informed us that some stars are only detected long after the
                  original stars have died out. If we are not aware of this fact, we
                  would think that those stars are still there. Suppose the same
                  thing happened to Earth.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;">So we see all
                  the events taking place on Earth, the wars, famines, births,
                  deaths, marriages, the World Cup, etc. Even the trees, mountains,
                  lakes etc <span> </span>appear real and substantial. But
                  the “reality” is <span> </span>all these things that we
                  know to be true from seeing and hearing are an illusion. The Earth
                  is gone but we remain convinced that this is not so. We see our
                  families and friends doing their things. We have moments of joy,
                  happiness, anger and sadness, getting involved in things. But
                  in reality they don’t even exist anymore!</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;">You
                  see. <strong>Our senses deceive us</strong> into
                  believing that the world<span>  </span>and everything in
                  it truly exist. We grab on to existence as though it is something
                  permanent and substantial whereas in truth everything is slipping
                  away and nothing is substantial. There is nothing we can hold on to
                  as real. All that we can perceive can only come through our senses.
                  There is a time lag between contact of our retina and form,
                  eardrums and vibrations and the actual process of seeing or
                  hearing. Everything that we see or hear no longer exist. There is
                  nothing that we can hold on to as permanent in such a world.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;">The world of
                  our senses is neither existent or nonexistent but is dependent on
                  the activity of our senses.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;">In this
                  experiment what is real becomes unreal. What we “know” to be
                  substantial and permanent is in fact a conjuror’s trick.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 14.4pt; font-family: arial;"><em><br></em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The actual process of seeing or
                  hearing takes place in microseconds between for example the light
                  travelling from an object to reach the retina and eventually
                  registering in the brain as visual consciousness. But the
                  underlying principle is similar.</span></p>

                  slipped away.</span></em></p>

                  this is so, we become disillusioned as our reality fades (viraga)
                  and finally disappears(nirodha). We know now that nothing
                  whatsoever is to be clung to. We begin to give up things that we
                  previously thought was important(patinisagga)</p>

              <p>Incidentally, I was just reading <a href="http://www.dharmaoverground.org/web/guest/dharma-wiki/-/wiki/Main/MCTB%20Impermanence?p_r_p_185834411_title=MCTB%20Impermanence">these paragraphs by Daniel Ingram :</a></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>We are typically quite sloppy about what are physical sensations and 
                  what are mental sensations (memories, mental images, and mental 
                  impressions of other sensations). These two kinds of sensations actually
                   oscillate back and forth, a back and forth interplay, one arising and 
                  passing and then the other arising and passing, in a somewhat quick but 
                  quite penetrable fashion. Being clear about exactly when the physical 
                  sensations are there will begin to clarify their slippery counterpart 
                  that helps create the illusion of continuity or solidity: flickering 
                  mental impressions. 
                  <br> <br>Coming directly after a physical sensation arises and passes is
                   a separate pulse of reality that is the mental knowing of that physical
                   sensation, here referred to as “consciousness” (as contrasted with 
                  “awareness” in Part III). By physical sensations I mean the five senses 
                  of touch, taste, hearing, seeing, and smelling. This is the way the mind
                   operates on phenomena that are no longer there, even thoughts, 
                  intentions and mental images.</p>

              <p>Hi Pegembara,</p>
              <p>Thanks for this very well written and insightful post.  There are several comments I want to make:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to Buddhism. a normal person usually views existence as permanent, satisfactory and having an essence. But reality is some thing quite different and is somewhat counterintuitive.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;">Our senses tell us that things are substantial and real but is this “reality”.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The 'cause' and 'conditions' that make a person views existence as permanent, unchanging and independent are equally important.  Without the clarity of the cause, we will not be able to practice the right way.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;">The world of our senses is neither existent or nonexistent but is dependent on the activity of our senses.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The "world of our senses" is neither existent nor nonexistent; hence neither created nor self-existing. </p>
              <p>The 'world' is an activity itself.  The senses, the mental factors, the forms do not alienate each other from before beginning. Therefore there is no 'the world' besides these ongoing activities.</p>
              <p>When seen in such a way, the 'dualistic and inherent view' of an 'observer observing the observed' collasped into sunyata.  Consequently 'dual' and 'substantial' is not 'valid' in such a 'view'.  This is what AEN (An Eternal Now) meant by implicity 'non-dual' in his earlier post.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="font-family: arial; margin: 0px;">This is the one meaning of impermanence(anicca). When we are convinced that this is so, we become disillusioned as our reality fades (viraga) and finally disappears(nirodha). We know now that nothing whatsoever is to be clung to. We begin to give up things that we previously thought was important(patinisagga)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Not so much of becoming disillusioned; rather with the maturing of this view, the mind releases itself from any forms of 'holding'. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>There are 2 additional points that I think are important:</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p>1.  Anatta is not Sunyata</p>
              <p>2.  Although whatever arises is empty of inherent essence, it must also be understood that it is vividly clear, present and luminous.  The passing scent, the taste, the scenery, the arising sound, the arising thought...these magical appearances are themselves primordially pure, they are the Dharmakaya.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Realization,</p>
              <p>It is our existing ‘view’ that we use to orientate ourselves.  The existing view assumes the existence of 'space, time and 'I from start as a truly established fact.  We think, analyze and understand within the logical structure of this ‘view’.</p>
              <p>Taking self enquiry for example, asking “who am I” already presumes the existence of “I” therefore even when we experience a non-dual, non-conceptual state, the mind is quick to reify a pure state of experience into an ultimate Self.  Similarly when we practice, we think in terms of disassociation from transience instead of total embracement.  We can’t ‘totally’ and ‘completely’ let go of anything when this ‘view’ runs deep in us.  Hence It is important to embrace fully the 'right view' of anatta and dependent origination when we practice.</p>

                      state of experience into an ultimate Self.  Similarly when we
                      practice, we think in terms of disassociation from transience
                      instead of total embracement.  We can’t ‘totally’ and
                      ‘completely’ let go of anything when this ‘view’ runs deep in
                      us.  Hence It is important to embrace fully the 'right view'
                      of anatta and dependent origination when we practice.</p>

              <p>Hi thanks for sharing your opinion, but I have to respectfully disagree with you. It is important and helpful to read up on what constitutes right view even if it may be confusing at times.</p>
              <p>After all right view/prajna/wisdom is the most important thing that separates Buddhism from all other religions. Before the Buddha achieved enlightenment, it is important to remember that the practice of Samadhi (right effort, concentration, mindfulness) was already well established in India, but without the proper guidance, some ascetics were led astray, being attached to <em>jhana </em>states and misuse of supernatural powers and thus were unable to discern the Dharma.</p>
              <p>Such details can be helpful in guiding us in our meditation practice. This way, we can make our meditation sessions more productive, i remember i have heard a fellow forumer saying that it was his experience that even though he was not as disciplined, more diligent meditators got "stuck" at certain stages he had already experienced because they did not have right view.</p>
              <p>It is important to share our experiences so we can see if our experience tallies up with the various stages to enlightenment, so we do not fall into the trap of being satisfied with what we have achieved or worse, delusion.</p>

              <p>Hi Lastime,</p>
              <p>Try not to think or practice this way. This too is my honest advice.  In all vehicles, be it Theravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana, there is no descrepency in starting with right view.   </p>
              <p>The path you described may be suitable for prayeka-buddha, but to penetrate on our own and give rise to right view is beyond ordinary practitioners. As I have said in my earlier post, ‘right view’ does not arise even in a non-dual, non-conceptual meditative state and ignorance (wrong view) runs far deeper than deep Samadhi.  I do not know what sort of merits are require to arise such a condition.</p>
              <p>Next with regards to ‘simplicity’ in practice, it is often wrongly understood. Simplicity is quite an advance stage and does not arise before we have sufficiently dissolved our ‘inherent and dualistic’ view. It only becomes ‘simple’ because practitioners so clearly see the nature of reality.</p>
              <p>Lastly, no worries about ‘offending anyone’. I believe your motive is sincere and thanks for sharing your opinion. :)</p>

              <p>Oversimplifying things make us fail to penetrate deeply into the essence, thinking we have understood.</p>
              <p>Here are some things said by Buddha to contemplate:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>"This doctrine is profound, hard to see, difficult
                to understand, calm, sublime, not within the sphere of logic, subtle, to be understood by
                the wise."</em> Majjhima Nikaya </span></p>
              <p>....................</p>
              <h4>Thus have I heard. Once the Lord was staying among the Kurus. There 
              is a market town there called Kammasa-dhamma. And the Venerable Ananda 
              came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said: ‘It is 
              wonderful, Lord, it is marvelous how profound this dependent origination
               is, and how profound it appears! And yet it appears to me as clear as 
              clear!’<br><br> ‘Do not say that Ananda, do not say that! This dependent origination is 
              profound and appears profound. It is through not understanding, not 
              penetrating this doctrine that this generation has become like a tangled
               ball of string, covered as with a blight, tangled like coarse grass, 
              unable to pass beyond states of woe, the ill destiny, ruin and the round
               of birth-and-death. (<em>Long Discourses of the Buddha</em>, p. 223 also see <em>Connected Discourses</em>, pp. 593-594)</h4>
              <p>....................</p>
              <p>Staying at Savatthi. "Monks, there once was a time when the Dasarahas
               had a large drum called 'Summoner.' Whenever Summoner was split, the 
              Dasarahas inserted another peg in it, until the time came when 
              Summoner's original wooden body had disappeared and only a 
              conglomeration of pegs remained. <a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn20/sn20.007.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a></p>
              <p>"In the same way, in the course of the future there will be monks who
               won't listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata — deep, 
              deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness — are 
              being recited. They won't lend ear, won't set their hearts on knowing 
              them, won't regard these teachings as worth grasping or mastering. But 
              they will listen when discourses that are literary works — the works of 
              poets, elegant in sound, elegant in rhetoric, the work of outsiders, 
              words of disciples — are recited. They will lend ear and set their 
              hearts on knowing them. They will regard these teachings as worth 
              grasping &amp; mastering.</p>
              <p>"In this way the disappearance of the discourses that are words of 
              the Tathagata — deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected 
              with emptiness — will come about.</p>
              <p>"Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will listen when discourses 
              that are words of the Tathagata — deep, deep in their meaning, 
              transcendent, connected with emptiness — are being recited. We will lend
               ear, will set our hearts on knowing them, will regard these teachings 
              as worth grasping &amp; mastering.' That's how you should train 
              yourselves."</p>

              <p>Hi too to Synasta,Thusness and AEN for all your replies to nicely explain your points :)</p>
              <p>Maybe before i should self intro myself abit before people think I start shooting off or being abit aggresive to share which is not my real purpose here because bringing others doesnt not interest me to the least bit,but i do hope people will think and look at the path in a different or perhaps a more realistic and achivevable view:)</p>
              <p>I am someone who is more into meditation myself first and sutta studies came later in my life.I have studied under afew master of the theravada sri lankan and thai forest tradition.(however im am still learning and learning....)</p>
              <p>Maybe i should reply all of you base on this stanza that AEN posted:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>"This doctrine
                                      is profound, hard to see, difficult to understand, calm, sublime,
                                      not within the sphere of logic, subtle, to be understood by the
                                      wise."</em> Majjhima Nikaya</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Dear Thusness,at the turning point of realisation do you think there will be a teacher beside you to tell you which stage of knowledge you are at ?</p>
              <p>please do not bring in the savaka or paceeka thing into here that is quite off tangent.If yiou can get a teacher who can guide someone within thought moments beside us do let me know because I wanted a teacher like this too :)</p>
              <p>non-dual and non conceptual samadhi is just a condition where by the mind merge into the object/mind itself at the point there is only the knowing condition.It is known in many tradition that such stage does not producue wisdom BUT without  strong samadhi how do one proceed on to the wisdom step?</p>
              <p>in terms of my simplicity "not within the sphere of logic" which im also trying to say its not by reading memorising or by fables or quotes or comparision that the true understanding is achieved.

              <p>To AEN,heres a trick question on dependent origination,It is well known that the buddha can see his past life and one mode of dependant orgination is done this way.However in modern times,for yogis with weak physic tendency but are training on dependent orgination since they cannot see DO in terms of past life how is it to be done? please do now seek out the suttas or talks or books for this answer:)</p>

              <p>Thank you for the reminder that practice is ever so important, after Right View has been understood. </p>
              <p>As for whether insights gained by fellow practitioners are "miragey" or not, that's for them to know really.  So far, I have understood from fellow forummers that when insight is arrived at, the sureness and knowingness is undeniable and inshakeable.  I thank them for sharing their travel guide with us; a travel guide that not only includes maps, but also snapshots of landmarks enroute to the destination.</p>
              <p>Sharing the finer points of how insight may be achieved is important, so that people don't get stuck at certain phases of insight.  Using analogies also helps most of us understand concepts that may otherwise be difficult to fathom.</p>
              <p>It is precisely because we may have weak psychic tendencies, that it is all the more important for more insightful practitioners to give pointers on how the nature of reality may be realised.  I mean it, as in truly realised, and not çº¸ä¸Šè°ˆå…µ as you say.  I'm sure that those who share their insights here are doing this in the interests of everyone.  </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>They have to study the teachings and contemplate on them carefully. You cannot arise insight without establishing the right view by understanding the Buddha's teachings and then further contemplate them. That is why the Buddha stressed that <em><strong>you should train yourselves: 'We will listen when
                                                  discourses that are words of the Tathagata — deep, deep in their
                                                  meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness — are being
                                                  recited. We will lend ear, will set our hearts on knowing them,
                                                  will regard these teachings as worth grasping &amp; mastering.' </strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>if right view forever stay on the text
                                          we will end up as book worms and not buddhist.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is very true of course. To understanding something conceptually and not do further contemplation will not result in direct experiential insight.</p>
              <p>That said, to practice without first having a good grasp of the teaching, of having the right view, will not result in fruition.</p>
