                  Kurdi washed up about 10 days ago.<br>  <br> And as if that wasn't enough, recently, there was more news of child deaths on
                  social media (as the Turkish media has long stopped covering the news) this
                  past week; this time in Turkey's Southeast.<br>  <br> In Cizre, a district of Turkey's ÅžÄ±rnak province, pro-Kurdistan Workers' Party
                  (PKK) youth were digging trenches around neighborhoods saying those areas had
                  now become self-governing units. The Turkish state's response was brutal: They
                  announced a 24-hour curfew and a shoot-on-sight order for anyone who defied it.<br>  <br> Several people died in the weeklong curfew.<br>  <br> They include a 35-day-old baby, who died because an ambulance that arrived to
                  take her to the hospital hadn't been allowed into the street where the baby's
                  family lived.<br>  <br> The mother of a toddler who dared to go out onto her apartment's balcony was
                  also shot dead, allegedly by Turkish Special Operations officers, although of
                  course state officials say all the civilians who died in Cizre last week were
                  killed by the PKK.<br>  <br> Another victim was 74-year-old Mehmet ErdoÄŸan, who, according to his neighbors,
                  was a “soft-hearted man.” He made a living (earning about TL 10 a day,
                  according to Hürriyet) reselling paper and metal scraps he collected from the
                  city's garbage containers. “He gave any food he found in the garbage to stray
                  animals,” the same neighbor said of him.<br>  <br> The elderly man was killed with a single bullet to his forehead, the “fine
                  work” of a sniper positioned cunningly to ensure that nobody defied the curfew.
                  (Or a PKK member, if we are to believe the state).<br>  <br> Another victim was 10-year-old Cemile, who was also shot by a stray bullet. Her
                  family had to keep her lifeless body inside a refrigerator because they
                  couldn't leave the house due to the curfew. And this -- that she couldn't be
                  buried for a long time -- found more place in the news than the fact that she
                  had been killed.<br>  <br> Amid all the macabre poignancy of this month's deaths, Elif Åžafak, a Turkish
                  writer, who had been silent about both the migrant and Cizre deaths on social
                  media, tweeted that it was unacceptable that the Turkish authorities had banned
                  Buddha statues from being displayed in yoga centers in Turkey.<br>  <br>Rightly, she came under fire from social media users because of sounding so
                  detached from the country's realities and so insensitive to the recent shared
                  grief of the world. Yes, it is a stupid move to ban statues of Buddha, a
                  central figure for the yoga-minded, and it really doesn't make sense, but it
                  beats me why someone who has stood silent in the face of attacks on secularism
                  that are far more offensive than this one would take issue with this.<br>  <br> Enough trolling here, though, on my part. The real reason why I am talking
                  about this is as a part-time Buddhist and the only blogger for Today's Zaman
                  who has talked or will ever talk about yoga, is I feel like I should be the one
                  to say something about the statue ban.<br>  <br> Some of our readers might know a famous koan (attributed to great Zen master
                  Linji), which says, “If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.” This might
                  mean different things to different Buddhists, depending on their spiritual
                  development (or even their current mood); but it is generally accepted that you
                  don't need to follow a “great leader” to develop as a Buddhist, because you
                  already are the Buddha. We all are. To know thyself, you have to kill the Buddha
                  instead of following him.<br>  <br> There are many other koans where Buddha statues are destroyed or used as (in
                  the case of wooden ones) fuel for the fire to help shivering monks in cold
                  temples on mountaintops warm up a little bit. Of course, these koans and
                  stories have deeper meanings, but their most practical quality is to show
                  non-Buddhists that Buddhism is not a religion of idol-worshipping. Really, the
                  Buddha statues don't mean much to many Buddhists (or yogi, or atheists who have
                  a spiritual appreciation for the Buddha).<br>  <br> Let me put it differently: When the Taliban destroyed the great Buddhas of
                  Bamiyan in 2001, it didn't hurt just one bit, compared to the hurt and
                  heartbreak the killings of Aylans, Cemiles and other children have caused, at
                  least in my case. And I am sure that many Buddhists would agree with me.<br>  <br> Buddha statues at Turkey's yoga centers are the least of our concerns. And
                  unfortunately, they will likely remain so for a long, long time. The outcome of
                  the November election is the only thing that can change, and I do hope that
                  more Justice and Development Party (AKP) voters will join us this time in
                  telling President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan and his AKP that they are no longer
                  wanted.</span></p>
