Monks and activists estimated the turnout was about 100,000, though an exact count was difficult.<br><br>The march, launched from the Shwedagon pagoda, the country's most sacred shrine, gathered participants as it winded its way through Yangon's streets. Some 20,000 monks took the lead, with onlookers joining in on what had been billed as a day of general protest.<br><br>The march covered at least 5 miles in its first few hours, passing by the old campus of Rangoon University, a hotbed of protest in past times. Students were seen joining Monday's march.<br><br>On Sunday, when a small crowd of about 400 people split off and headed for the house of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, security forces deployed in force to block them.<br><br>The march raised both expectations of possible political change and fear that the military might try to crush the demonstrations with violence, as it did in 1988 when thousands of pro-democracy protesters were killed nationwide.<br><br>On Saturday, more than 500 monks and sympathizers were allowed past barricades to walk to the house where Suu Kyi is detained. The Nobel Peace laureate greeted them from her gate in her first public appearance in more than four years -- a meeting that symbolically linked the current protests to her struggle for democracy.<br><br>But any optimism on the protesters' part was tempered when security forces thwarted the second march to Suu Kyi's house. The crowd peacefully abandoned their attempt after being turned back at two different approaches blocked by barbed wire barricades.<br><br>"In our country the monks are the highest moral authority. When the monks take the leading role, the people will follow," said Soe Aung, a spokesman for the National Council of the Union of Burma, a coalition of opposition groups based in neighboring Thailand.<br><br>Yet people have not forgotten the army's ferocity in crushing the 1988 pro-democracy uprising. Terror keeps many from considering rebelling again.<br><br>"The protests will continue to grow as more people gain the courage to join, but they have not yet reached the point where I will allow my family to march," said a 50-year-old taxi driver who would not give his name. "There is still too much uncertainty to do that."<br><br>The latest protests began on August 19 as a movement against economic hardship, after the government sharply raised fuel prices, increasing the overall cost of living. Arrests and intimidation saw the movement begin to falter until last week, when monks -- who have long served as the country's conscience -- became the protests' vanguard.<br>Don't Miss<br><br>* Rice: U.S. to raise Myanmar at UN<br>* U.N. envoy to Myanmar amid protests<br>* 1,500 monks march on Myanmar<br>* Monks lead violent Myanmar protests<br>* Myanmar seeks to crush dissent<br><br>The march of 20,000 people downtown was led by 10,000 monks who gathered at the famous golden hilltop Shwedagon Pagoda before marching downtown to Sule Pagoda and past the U.S. Embassy among other places, witnesses said. For the first time, at least 100 white-robed nuns joined the demonstration.<br><br>Some monks shouted support for Suu Kyi, while people in the crowd formed a human chain to protect the maroon-robed clerics.<br><br>While authorities did not intervene in Sunday's march, plainclothes police trailed the marchers. Some, armed with shotguns, were posted at street corners along the route.<br><br>A monk gave a speech Sunday calling for Suu Kyi's release and national reconciliation, the witnesses said, again positioning their cause with her long-running struggle for democracy.<br><br>The synergy could increase pressure on the junta to decide whether to crack down or compromise.<br><br>Suu Kyi, 62, is the leader of the National League for Democracy party, which won a 1990 general election but was not allowed to take power by the military. She has been under detention continuously since May 2003.<br><br>Other monks' demonstrations took place Sunday in the cities of Mandalay, Monywa, Kalay and the Kachin state capital of Myitkyina, said reports in Myanmar exile media.<br><br>"The monks are the majority and they are leading the movement right now," Soe Aung told The Associated Press in Bangkok.<br><br>But he expressed concern the military will not stand aside forever.<br><br>"Hopefully the international community will not keep quiet, and they will do something before terrible things take place in our country," he said.<br><br>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the Bush administration was watching the situation "very carefully."<br>advertisement<br><br>Speaking ahead of a meeting in New York with the foreign minister of China -- the junta's top diplomatic ally -- she said the people of Myanmar "deserve a life to be able to live in freedom, just as everyone does."<br><br>She said President Bush would discuss the military regime's "brutality" when he meets other leaders at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly. E-mail to a friend E-mail to a friend<br><br>Copyright 2007 The Associated Press.

If you see more and more, that is also natural bcos there are more and more human than say 2,500 years ago!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I think the monks in Myammar are indeed practising bodhisattvas. Despite the terror and fear for their government, however for the benefit of the people, they willing protested along with them, in hope that their voice would be heard and accedded.<br><br>How many people really dare to stand up to their belief till the end?<br><br>And the monks didn't start the violence mah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree, haiz. It's always easier said than done.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by soemt:</div><div class="quote_body">not everyone who claims to be buddhist really follows the buddha's teachings. And how many of us that try to follow, can do so mindfully momment to momment?

            <div class='col-md body'>Saw this in my friendster's forum:<br><br>"Dear friends,<br><br>Today, our petition to China and the UN Security Council to stop the brutal crackdown on peaceful Burmese protesters is being delivered to the world in a full page ad in the Financial Times worldwide -- but the ad was rejected by other newspapers like the South China Morning Post and the Singapore Straits Times. Our message is an invitation to China to do the right thing in Burma, not an attack -- yet even that seemed too much for media that fear Chinese reprisals.<br><br>We won't let our voice be silenced like this. We're taking our message to the streets, in an international day of action on Saturday -- details are on our petition page, and below. And we're redoubling our efforts to make our voice louder: our petition is approaching 600,000 signatures, closing fast on our 1 million goal.The petition link is below - send this email to all your friends and family and help us reach 1 million voices by Saturday!<br><br><a href="http://www.avaaz.org/en/stand_with_burma/w.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.avaaz.org/en/stand_with_burma/w.php</a>"</div>
