              <p>A face, said to resemble that of Lord Buddha, has 
              appeared on a limestone hill overlooking the Nam Thean Tong Temple in 
              Ipoh, capital city of Malaysian state of Perak, rousing great interest 
              among tourists and locals.</p>
              <p>Jade seller Chan Yew Ming, who runs a shop at the temple, said the face was first spotted by tourists recently.</p>
              <p>"I saw them pointing at the limestone hill above my shop and snapping
               photographs. I was curious and was surprised to see what looked like 
              Buddha's face there," the 53-year-old woman said.</p>
              <p>According to Chan, none of the temple workers or committee members 
              had noticed the "face" previously because of the trees and plants 
              surrounding it.</p>
              <p>She claimed that people had also seen other "manifestations" on the 
              hill, such as that of Buddha's palm and the face of Hindu deity Ganesha.</p>
              <p>"Just above Buddha's face, there is an elephant-like face, which many
               people believe is Ganesha while several dark spots on the rocky surface
               of the hill resemble Buddha's palm.</p>
              <p>Chan added that news of the manifestations had reached as far as 
              Thailand and Singapore with many visitors from the countries coming in 
              droves to see the amazing sights.</p>
              <p>Temple committee chairman Chan Kwai Hoong said heavy rainfall and 
              strong winds in recent times had caused tree branches to break, exposing
               the face.</p>
              <p>"We were surprised by it when tourists pointed it out to us," he said.</p>
              <p>Kwai Hoong, who has been with the committee for about 20 years, 
              stressed that it was impossible for people to climb up the hill to 
              sculpt the face. "The surface is too steep and nobody can climb up 
              there," he said.</p>
              <p>Nam Thean Tong, situated between the Ling Sen Tong and Sam Poh Tong 
              temples, is believed to be one of the oldest temples here, dating back 
              to 1867 when it was first discovered by a Chinese priest.</p>
