              <p>A lot of people misunderstood buddha's "viññÄ�á¹‡aá¹ƒ anidassanaá¹ƒ", mistaking it with eternalist ideas of an eternal substratum of consciousness in Advaita. In fact whenever eternalists talk about Pali scriptures, all they will talk about this viññÄ�á¹‡aá¹ƒ anidassanaá¹ƒ because that is the only thing in the canon (along with falsely misunderstood descriptions of 'deathless' which the Buddha describes clearly as the elimination of the three poisons), which apparently seems to have a correlation (due to their wrong understanding of the statement) to their idea of luminous Self.</p>
              <p>The issue is not so much about the luminosity of mind or consciousness (such a denial would make one a nihilist), but the false reification of consciousness into a transcendentally (existing beyond the All) existing source and substratum or a Self (such views belong to the eternalist). Nowhere does Buddha describe consciousness in such ways but he always taught the middle way of dependent origination which is free of extreme positions of existence and non-existence, free of all views of a Self.</p>
              <p><br><br>AEN<br>X, you misquoted the 
                                                        Buddha. Rigpa (knowledge) is beyond ma-rigpa but not beyond phenomena as pointed 
                                                        out to you. But you misquoted the Buddha to support your Advaita-like, 
                                                        Turiya-like understanding of consciousness. This is eternalistic. I shall repeat 
                                                        myself on that statement of Buddha despite it being seemingly out of place in 
                                                        this topic of discussion:<br><br>"I love Geoff/Nana/Jnana (another strong 
                                                        scholar-practitioner like Malcolm though his main practice is Mahamudra)'s 
                                                        explanation here on viññÄ�á¹‡aá¹ƒ anidassanaá¹ƒ:<br><br>"As for anidassana, in this 
                                                        context I'm liking the translation as "non-illustrative" or "non-indicative." 
                                                        "Non-illustrative" in the sense of the term as used in MN 21 KakacÅ«pama Sutta: 
                                                        Ä�kÄ�so arÅ«pÄ« anidassano, the sky is formless and non-illustrative. 
                                                        "Non-indicative" in the sense of the term as used in the Abhidhammapiá¹­aka, where 
                                                        the applications of mindfulness. etc., are said to be anidassana. The sense here 
                                                        being that they are not indicative of defilements, and so on.<br><br>Also cf. 
                                                        Ven. ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda, NibbÄ�na Sermon 07:<br>Now viññÄ�á¹‡aá¹ƒ anidassanaá¹ƒ is a reference to 
                                                        the nature of the released consciousness of an arahant. It does not reflect 
                                                        anything. To be more precise, it does not reflect a nÄ�ma-rÅ«pa, or name-and-form. 
                                                        An ordinary individual sees a nÄ�ma-rÅ«pa, when he reflects, which he calls 'I' 
                                                        and 'mine'. It is like the reflection of that dog, which sees its own delusive 
                                                        reflection in the water. A non-arahant, upon reflection, sees name-and-form, 
                                                        which however he mistakes to be his self. With the notion of 'I' and 'mine' he 
                                                        falls into delusion with regard to it. But the arahant's consciousness is an 
                                                        unestablished consciousness.<br><br>We have already mentioned in previous 
                                                        sermons about the established consciousness and the unestablished consciousness. 
                                                        A non-arahant's consciousness is established on name-and-form. The unestablished 
                                                        consciousness is that which is free from name-and-form and is unestablished on 
                                                        name-and-form. The established consciousness, upon reflection, reflects 
                                                        name-and-form, on which it is established, whereas the unestablished 
                                                        consciousness does not find a name-and-form as a reality. The arahant has no 
                                                        attachments or entanglements in regard to name-and-form. In short, it is a sort 
                                                        of penetration of name-and-form, without getting entangled in it. This is how we 
                                                        have to unravel the meaning of the expression anidassana viññÄ�á¹‡a.<br><br>All the

              <p>AEN<br>Consciousness not partaking (grasping to the themes of things) in the all 
                                                        does not equal to some eternalistic transcendent consciousness. It is the 
                                                        released consciousness of an arahant in its self-liberating state. Kalaka sutta 
                                                        describes the experience of Buddha's unestablished consciousness very well, this 
                                                        is also in accord with Bahiya Sutta and others. The pali suttas are super 
                                                        consistent (believe me because I have read hundreds of them) while you are 
                                                        cherry picking one poetic phrase out of all the suttas and misinterpreting 
                                                        completely (not only misinterpreting but completely misquoting) not knowing the 
                                                        context of it.<br><br>It is seen very clearly in anatta that all views and 
                                                        notions of consciousness/super-consciousness having some independent or 
                                                        unchanging true existence is not true, awareness is simply the quality of 
                                                        transient sensate world, it is intrinsically self-luminous or self-aware but 
                                                        does not exist as some independent unchanged substratum, background, source, 
                                                        etc. Of course, without awareness there is nothing made manifest. But it is not 
                                                        "awareness, therefore sensation". It is "awareness-sensation", 
                                                        "awareness-world". Prior and after (false construct of time) doesn't apply so 
                                                        the source-emanation analogy does not apply. The three kayas are a single 
                                                        co-arising. Source/awareness goes with transience like wetness goes with water. 
                                                        They are not even inseparable (no truly existing subject/awareness to be 
                                                        inseperable from transience). In seeing is just the seen. To speak of water is 
                                                        to speak of wetness, to speak of sensations is to speak of luminosity, just as 
                                                        to speak of wind is to speak of blowing. Both are words but just points to the 
                                                        single flow of empty-luminosity, as just this action, just this activity (but 
                                                        not some One Mind/source and substratum of phenomena).</p>
