              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">What if you
              thought about death multiple times a day, every day? In Western society you
              would probably be labeled as depressed, morbid, pessimistic, or neurotic, much
              like a character from a Woody Allen movie. But in the tiny Himalayan country of
              Bhutan, which has been named</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="https://www.oneworldeducation.org/bhutan-worlds-happiest-country"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">“the happiest country on Earth</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">,” people contemplate death five
              times a day as part of their Buddhist tradition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Clearly,
              thinking about death doesn’t prevent happiness and it seems, from the example
              of the Bhutanese people, that acceptance of death might actually be helpful in
              finding peace, meaning and joy in life. Indeed Tibetan Buddhist teacher Sogyal
              Rinpoche writes in “The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying” that regular
              contemplation of death can lead to a deep experience of joy as old attachments
              and negative habits are released.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But most of
              us in the West are terrified of death and avoid addressing it unless absolutely
              necessary. Furthermore as many as two thirds of Americans</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.theharrispoll.com/health-and-life/Are_You_Happy__It_May_Depend_on_Age__Race_Ethnicity_and_Other_Factors.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">report</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">that they are not very happy in their day-to-day lives. Clearly something
              is missing for most Americans and it is important to address this issue since
              studies have shown that happiness is a key factor for overall physical health.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/happiness-stress-heart-disease/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">Researcher Laura Kubzansky</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">has found that characteristics like
              resilience, positive outlook on life, and a sense of meaning and purpose all
              lead to increased happiness and therefore better health. Interestingly, these
              are some of the same traits that Sogyal Rinpoche teaches are enhanced by
              accepting the reality of death, along with a reduction in fear and stress.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">So is there
              enough reasonable evidence to try a practice of “death awareness” for greater
              happiness and better health? If so, here are some tips for beginning your own
              daily routine of thinking about death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>1. Establish a
              regular time of day for your practice.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><br> To maintain any new routine it helps to set aside the same time every day, like
              first thing in the morning or before going to bed at night. This regularity
              will help you remember to do the practice each day and will ingrain it as a
              habit more quickly than if you do it on a random, variable schedule.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>2. Stay relaxed.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><br> Take a few deep breaths before you begin to help you get into a state of
              relaxation. We know from neuroscience that what</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.curiousapes.com/the-science-of-happiness-why-complaining-is-literally-killing-you/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">“fires together, wires together”</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">so it is important to couple your
              thoughts of death with a sense of physical and emotional calmness rather than
              fear. Then in the future whenever you think about death your brain will recall
              this calm feeling at the same time. Deep breathing can help you achieve this
              because it triggers the relaxation response mentally, physically and
              emotionally.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>3. Make it a pleasant
              experience.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><br> During your routine include some enhancements for your five senses like peaceful
              music, a scented candle, flavorful tea, beautiful art, or a view of nature. In
              this way you will gradually train your brain to conjure up pleasant sensual
              memories along with a state of calmness when you think about death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>4. Avoid fearful
              images of death.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><br> One of the reasons many of us are terrified of death is because we have
              witnessed frightening scenes of dying in the past through news reports, movies,
              books, or our own life experiences. Start by visualizing the leaves of a tree
              in Autumn as they turn brown and fall to the ground. This peaceful
              representation of death can be expanded upon over time to include other images
              as you become more comfortable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>5. Focus on the “big
              picture.”</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><br> Rather than obsess about the details of your own death, which might create
              stress and anxiety in the beginning, contemplate the cycle of life and death
              that exists in nature and throughout the entire universe. Remember that even
              stars and planets die and that all deaths ultimately bring about new life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>6. Keep a journal.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><br> After your session of death contemplation it can be helpful to keep a few notes
              in a journal. You can process your thoughts and record your progress as you
              become more and more comfortable with the idea of death in general and your own
              mortality, in particular.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Since death
              is inevitable for each one of us, there is nothing to lose and much to gain
              from increased comfort with thoughts of mortality, including becoming more
              peaceful and less fearful of life. Imagine how free you would feel if you could
              rid yourself of your fear and live each moment to the fullest. That is one of
              the promises of a “death awareness” practice that is most enticing.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">If we can
              learn to enjoy our fleeting and brief lives just as they are perhaps we will
              become less materialistic and more focused on the deep values of life like love
              and joy. There is no denying that our world needs more love and less fear right
              now so let’s emulate the Bhutanese people and get comfortable with thoughts of
              death.</span></p>
