I'm John, and this is <span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span>.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;"> Hi! We're here to invite you to come kiss Hank's ass with us.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Pardon me?! What are you talking about? Who's Hank, and why would I want to kiss his ass?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">If you kiss Hank's ass, he'll give you a million dollars; and if you don't, he'll kick the shit out of you.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">What? Is this some sort of bizarre mob shake-down?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Hank is a billionaire philanthropist. Hank built this town. Hank owns this town. He can do whatever he wants and what he wants is to give you a million dollars, but he can't until you kiss his ass.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">That doesn't make any sense. Why...</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Who are you to question Hank's gift? Don't you want a million dollars? Isn't it worth a little kiss on the ass?</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Well maybe, if it's legit, but...</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Then come kiss Hank's ass with us.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Do you kiss Hank's ass often?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:Oh yes, all the time...<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:And has he given you a million dollars?<br><br><strong>John</strong>:Well no, you don't actually get the money until you leave town.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">So why don't you just leave town now?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:You can't leave until Hank tells you to, or you don't get the money, and he kicks the shit out of you.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Do you know anyone who kissed Hank's ass, left town, and got the million dollars?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:My mother kissed Hank's ass for years. She left town last year, and I'm sure she got the money.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Haven't you talked to her since then?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:Of course not, Hank doesn't allow it.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:So what makes you think he'll actually give you the money if you've never talked to anyone who got the money?<br><br><strong>John</strong>:Well, he gives you a little bit before you leave. Maybe you'll get a raise; maybe you'll win a small lotto; maybe you'll just find a twenty dollar bill on the street.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">What's that got to do with Hank?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:Hank has certain connections.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm sorry, but this sounds like some sort of bizarre con game.</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:But it's a million dollars! Can you really take the chance? And remember, if you don't kiss Hank's ass he'll kick the shit out of you.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe if I could see Hank, talk to him, get the details straight from him...</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span>: No one sees Hank, no one talks to Hank.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Then how do you kiss his ass?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:Sometimes we just blow him a kiss, and think of his ass. Other times we kiss Karl's ass, and he passes it on.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Who's Karl?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:A friend of ours. He's the one who taught us all about kissing Hank's ass. All we had to do was take him out to dinner a few times.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">And you just took his word for it when he said there was a Hank, that Hank wanted you to kiss his ass, and that Hank would reward you?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:Oh no! Karl's got a letter Hank sent him years ago explaining the whole thing. Here's a copy; see for yourself.<br><br>To Be Continue... ...[/b]</blockquote></div>

That's good enough for me!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe your friend Karl just made the whole thing up.</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">No way! Item 5 says 'Hank dictated this list himself.' Besides, item 2 says 'Use alcohol in moderation,' item 4 says 'Eat right,' and item 8 says 'Wash your hands after going to the bathroom.' Everyone knows those things are right, so the rest must be true, too.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">But #9 says 'Don't Drink,' which doesn't quite go with #2. And #6 says 'The moon is made of green cheese,' which is just plain wrong.</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">There's no contradiction between 9 and 2; 9 just clarifies 2. As to 6, you've never been to the moon, so you can't say for sure.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Scientists have pretty firmly established that the moon is made of rock...</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">But they don't know if the rock came from the Earth, or from outer space, so it could just as easily be green cheese.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm not really an expert, but I think the theory that the Moon came from the Earth has been discounted. Besides, not knowing where the rock came from doesn't make it cheese.</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Aha! You just admitted that scientists make mistakes, but we know Hank is always right!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">We do?</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Of course we do, Item 5 says so.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">You're saying Hank's always right because the list says so, the list is right because Hank dictated it, and we know that Hank dictated it because the list says so. <strong>That's circular logic, no different than saying 'Hank's right because he says he's right.</strong>'</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Now you're getting it! It's so rewarding to see someone come around to Hank's way of thinking.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">But...oh, never mind. What's the deal with wieners?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span> blushes.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wieners, in buns, no condiments. It's Hank's way. Anything else is wrong.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">What if I don't have a bun?</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">No bun, no wiener. A wiener without a bun is wrong.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">No relish? No mustard?</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">i:</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Mary looks positively stricken.</span><br><br><strong>John</strong> shouts: <span style="font-style: italic;">There's no need for such language! Condiments of any kind are wrong!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">So a big pile of sauerkraut with some wieners chopped up in it would be out of the question?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span> (sticking her fingers in her ears): I am not listening to this. La la la, la la, la la la.<br>That's disgusting. Only some sort of evil deviant would eat that...<br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">It's good! I eat it all the time.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span> faints.<br><br><strong>John</strong> (catching her): <span style="font-style: italic;">Well, if I'd known you were one of those, I wouldn't have wasted my time. When Hank kicks the shit out of you, I'll be there, counting my money and laughing. I'll kiss Hank's ass for you, you bunless cut-wienered kraut-eater.</span><br><br>With this, John dragged Mary to their waiting car, and sped off. [/b]</blockquote></div>
