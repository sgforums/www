But now a new self-funded temple is close to completion after help from volunteers. ALISON WHITE finds out more</span>.<br><br><strong>Gravesham, UK </strong>-- Gravesham's Buddhist community has seen its fair share of disappointment. Attempts to establish a permanent temple have been blighted by vandalism and deliberate fires.<br><br>Arsonists struck at a building Buddhists were trying to convert into a temple in Colyer Road, Northfleet, three times last year.<br><br>The building became a target for vandals who smashed windows, stripped wooden panelling from the outside of the cottage and threw stones at a Buddhist monk.<br>continued...<br><br>After two months of relentless arson and criminal damage the last straw came when the front wall of the building was ripped away.<br><br>Buddhists were keen to find a permanent home, as Kent does not have a temple, so devotees either met in temporary accommodation or travelled to Wimbledon.<br><br>But now the 250 devotees have a new temple after agreeing to rent the Rose Street Community Centre in Rose Street, Northfleet, for the next 10 years.<br><br>The temple will form a permanent home for a Buddhist monk from Thailand.<br><br>Buddhism focuses on personal spiritual development and gaining an insight into the nature of life. The faith does not follow a God.<br><br>Meditation is used by Buddhists to separate themselves from thoughts and feelings to become fully aware.<br><br>Chairman of the Buddhists in Gravesham, Harry Smith, believes the rocky ride to establishing a temple happened for a reason.<br><br>He said building a temple is a great honour for Buddhists as it is the best way of earning merit in their next life.<br><br>Many volunteers, both Buddhists and people from other faiths, have donated time and equipment to the temple, which was completely self-funded.<br><br>Among the donations made was Â£1,600 for carpet, Â£1,000 for three months' rent and an offer of free plumbing, said Mr Smith.<br><br>Inside the temple is the monk's accommodation, who will live behind an image of a Buddha. He will have a large space for prayer, offices and an area for meditation.<br><br>Mr Smith, who is currently mayor of Gravesham, says once the building is finished it will be open all the time operating a <strong>"open-door policy"</strong> to the community.<br><br>An official opening is planned with the Thailand ambassador and officials from the Thailand Embassy invited along.<br><br>Buddhists in Gravesham are hoping enough money can be raised to buy the temple as a permanent home. Lead nurse Mr Smith said: <span style="color: blue;">"Hopefully it will work very well.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">"We had our dreams smashed and we tried to start again and it looks like we have managed it. "It has happened for a purpose."</span><br><br>The 53-year-old says the key to religious harmony in Gravesham is people accepting other religions' differences. He said:<span style="color: blue;"> At the end of the day following a religion is the same for everybody.<br><br>"Buddhism really is a very peaceful philosophy."</span></div>
