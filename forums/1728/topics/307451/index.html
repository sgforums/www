              <p>This is a common question asked by both beginner Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Many answers have been given but do those who question really understand? I often wonder.</p>
              <p>As mentioned by AEN in writing, there is apparently two distinct ways to categorise and describe enlightment in writing. The rest in terms of discerning from behaviour and words of a truly enlightened person are way too deep for me to understand or mention here.</p>
              <p>In writing, it can be enlightened in small caps and Enlightened in initial caps.</p>
              <p>Let me quote real people that you are consider to be enlightened with both the small caps or initial caps.</p>
              <p>Master Chin Kung or the Dalai Lama for example.</p>
              <p>Without any psychic powers or divine eye like Buddhas and Arahant, we do not know how many Buddhist practitioners are there in this world, who can be considered enlightened.</p>
              <p>Some say many, some say little. If many, how many? If little, how little?</p>
              <p>When we say someone is enlightened, can we also safely conclude that this person has at least attained sainthood or Arahanthood?</p>
              <p>Why this standard of judging you say? Cos the basic goal/aim of any true Buddhist from his relentless cultivation efforts is to at least gain complete liberation from countless cycles of life and death. If not, you can believe and practise other religions or faiths which guarantees heavenly rebirth after what they consider to be only one lifetime.</p>
              <p>We know that all heavens are considered part of the samsaric cycle and Tusita Heaven, a resting place for most Buddhas-to-be, is not exempt from that, from my understanding. Tusita Heaven ï¼ˆå…œçŽ‡å¤©ï¼‰is also where Maitreya Bodhisattva, next Buddha after Sakayamuni Buddha, resides.</p>
              <p>However, it is only in the inner palace of Tusita Heaven that you can see the Bodhisattva and listen to his preaching of the Dharmma. For those who are born in the outer palace, sorry. You get to enjoy all heavenly pleasures but you will not get to listen to the Dharmma or see the Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>Those who gain entry into Tusita Heaven has practised mediation and vipassana diligently to a very high level and yet not all can gain entrance into the inner palace.</p>
              <p>They can be considered to have gain enlightment of some level, but are they truly free from samsaric existence?</p>
              <p>In my opinion, we need not worry whether we are enlightened or nor need to know whether anyone is enlightened. Cos hardly any of us can really tell or know whether our/their cultivation results will bring them complete samsaric liberation after this present lifetime.</p>
              <p>If you want a more easier, faster and more secure method, you would have to practise Amitabha Buddha's name recitation and make constant and strong vows to be reborn in Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss.</p>

              <p>As long as you reach the 1st level Bhumi of Bodhisattvahood, or the 1st level of Arhat path (Sotapanna), you're on your way and will surely be there in due time. They are already considered 'enlightened' but not 'Enlightenment' with the cap 'E' which is usually reserved for Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>For sotapanna, even if you never become Arhat in this life, you will be fully Arhat in a max of no more than 7 lifetimes. Once returners, non returners is either this or next life, etc.</p>
              <p>There are ways to guage a person's level of realisation, like what stage is he at... and at each stage the insight differs subtly. I will not discuss this in depth... but the thing is you can know which 'level' you are at... I know a few high bhumi bodhisattvas and arhats.. as well as anagamis, and so on. Well believe or not up to you... keke</p>

              <p>This is a wrong view of Fatalism. Buddhism teaches the Fatalism is a false view. Please do not confuse Karma with Fatalism.</p>
              <p>If you kill someone, you are definitely going to get the karma of killing (i.e. rebirth in hell). Whether it is the other party's karma to get killed is another matter, but the sure thing is you are going to fall to hell as a result of killing.</p>

              <p>This is not necessarily so. During Buddha's times, Buddha had many nagas and devas and brahmas as his dharma and personal protector. Even though Buddha and his Arhat disciples would have been powerful enough to protect themselves, they have better things to do and time to spend like helping sentient beings. The job of protection and guarding the community and teachings are then left to these dharma protectors.</p>
              <p>Also, arhats like Mogallana died a terrible death by being hurled with rocks. Please note, Mogallana is Buddha's foremost disciple in Supernatural Powers.</p>
              <p>Buddha himself has also bled and been hurt by Devadatta.</p>
              <p>This is because the past karma of Mogallana and Buddha, and supernatural powers cannot supercede karmic forces.</p>
              <p>And last time my Taiwanese teacher was in meditative state, a ghost wearing ancient warrior suit belong to Song dynasty (if I'm not wrong) came with a sword, and wanted to chop off his head. My Taiwanese teacher said at that time the spirit would definitely be no match at all with his own supernatural power, and that to defeat the spirit is just a tiny task. But he also know that it is the ripening of his karma for killing ppl in his past life, about 10 lifetimes ago as a warrior.</p>
              <p>So he let him chop off his head, and the spirit happily walked away, laughing and dragging the sword off. Because certain aspect of his consciousness (I think relating to the 7th consciousness) is dissolved, he did not die in the process. When he went out of meditative state however, there was a scar on his neck, and is a sign of his karmic ripening, so he accepted it.</p>

              <p>In Buddhism, there is no justice system, there is simply the law of karma which is simply causes, conditions, and effect due to our volition/action.</p>
              <p>Unwholesome karma leads to unwholesome effect, wholesome karma leads to wholesome effect. Both wholesome and unwholesome leads to both wholesome and unwholesome, and neither wholesome nor unwholesome (pure karma) leads to liberation.</p>

              <p>As long as you reach the 1st level Bhumi of Bodhisattvahood, or
                                          the 1st level of Arhat path (Sotapanna), you're on your way and
                                          will surely be there in due time. They are already considered
                                          'enlightened' but not 'Enlightenment' with the cap 'E' which is
                                          usually reserved for Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>For sotapanna, even if you never become Arhat in this life, you
                                          will be fully Arhat in a max of no more than 7 lifetimes. Once
                                          returners, non returners is either this or next life, etc.</p>
              <p>There are ways to guage a person's level of realisation, like
                                          what stage is he at... and at each stage the insight differs
                                          subtly. I will not discuss this in depth... but the thing is you
                                          can know which 'level' you are at... I know a few high bhumi
                                          bodhisattvas and arhats.. as well as anagamis, and so on. Well

              <p>I think we have some misunderstanding. I believe that you may
                                          personally know a few bodhisattvas and arhats.</p>
              <p>However, what I have been saying is this, it is impossible for
                                          all practitioners of Buddhism, diligent or not, to achieve
                                          liberation from samsaric existence in one's present lifetime
                                          using just the contemplative approaches like vipassana, meditation
                                          on your own or even with a teacher.</p>
              <p>Cos if that's the truth, I don't think there is a need for
                                          Bodhisattvas and arhats to be among us, since we are perfectly
                                          capable of following the Buddha's teachings to the letter and
                                          maintain what we have achieved. </p>
              <p>Seriously what Bodhisattvas and Arahants know cannot
                                          really be taught. We can follow, we can strive, but what they have
                                          achieved cannot be achieved by all in a single lifetime
                                          unless an individual's good karma and spiritual wisdom
                                          happens to ripen in this lifetime, then only can Bodhisattvas and
                                          Arhats help.</p>
              <p>And the 18 uncommon abilities of a Buddha is the ability to
                                          teach dharmma according to an individual's level of understanding
                                          and acceptance. Are these Bodhisattvas and Arhats that you speak of
                                          able to teach according to a person's karmic affinity with certain
                                          dharma doors and his past and present karma merits like what the
                                          Buddha did for all who come to him? I don't know. But I hope it's
                                          true though. I hope they will reach out to help people who
                                          are below average in spiritual cultivation and understanding
                                          like me.</p>
              <p>I don't know whether you have heard of this story:</p>
              <p>There was once a man who had achieved 1st or 2nd stage sainthood
                                          in his previous lifetime. However, since he had not achieved
                                          complete liberation like an Arahat, he was reborn as a human after
                                          his heavenly lifespan has added and he got married.</p>
              <p>This man had one unwholesome habit: He has high sexual desire.
                                          The desire is high enough for his wife to complain.</p>
              <p>One day, his wife met with a wise man and shared about her
                                          problems. The wise man taught her to say these words to her
                                          husband: You are already a saint, you still want to carry on with
                                          this?</p>
              <p>True enough, after saying this, her husband ceased all sexual
                                          activities with her and that strangely, caused her to become
                                          suspicious and she asked her husband for clarification.</p>
              <p>Her husband calmly replied: Although a vase may
                                          be very beautiful, but its insides are not. I understand this
                                          now as I have recollected my past life's achievement and I no
                                          longer have any attachment to sexual desires.</p>
              <p>Since you know the ways to gauge a person's realisation, why not
                                          share with us?</p>
              <p>I sincerely want to know and I think it would help the public or
                                          any Buddhist to discern whether their teacher or fellow Buddhists
                                          is indeed enlightened and not just a virtuous person like Confucius
                                          or Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

                                          factually state that he is indeed a fully-awakened being and hence
                                          worthy of the title 'Buddha'. Most real Bodhisattvas or Arhats in
                                          manifestations will not say such things unless in the presence of a

              <p>Where did you heard this from? This is certainly not a Buddhist teaching. What is sky window?</p>
              <p>Anyway, enlightenment does not depend on fate at all. First of all we do not believe in fate or predestination, and we do not believe that there is any higher power that can control someone's karma. We also do not believe in a creator God.</p>
              <p>And anyone who practices surely can gain enlightenment. Every single person's Buddha Nature is already complete, waiting to be realised. Everyone will eventually attain Buddhahood, being only a matter of time.</p>

              <p>I can't see your logic. Why is the ability to gain enlightenment got to do with whether Bodhisattvas and Arhats among us?</p>
              <p>I
                                        would say -- almost everyone definitely have the ability to pass the O
                                        Levels if they study hard. But does that mean they don't need teachers
                                        or no need to go to school? Even if they do self study they usually
                                        have tutors or go to private school. You mean just because people have
                                        the intellectual ability to pass O levels means they can do away with
                                        teachers?</p>
              <p>Similarly, just because all of us can gain
                                        enlightenment doesn't mean we do not need teachers to point it out to
                                        us. Please remember that only Buddhas and Pratyekabuddhas do not need
                                        teachers to point out the dharma to them. All other practitioners
                                        attained enlightenment through learning and guidance from other
                                        enlightened teachers.</p>

                                        also told me what I needed to practice right now in order to progress.
                                        Of course I have little wisdom so sometimes my posts may not be very
                                        relevant and I can't always 'sense the conditions'.</p>
              <p>Also.. may not be directly related, as you may have known Longchen also wrote about some of his past lives before (he told me more when I met him), and he said last year regarding tracing karma and past lives: <em>Hello People,<br><br> I think karma really exist.<br><br> Being able to trace the events into past lives, allows me to see

                                          I can see who my wife is in a previous life and why she is
                                          associated with me in this life. I also know certain people that i

                                        previous lifetime. However, since he had not achieved complete
                                        liberation like an Arahat, he was reborn as a human after his heavenly
                                        lifespan has added and he got married.</p>
              <p>This man had one unwholesome habit: He has high sexual desire. The desire is high enough for his wife to complain.</p>
              <p>One
                                        day, his wife met with a wise man and shared about her problems. The
                                        wise man taught her to say these words to her husband: You are already
                                        a saint, you still want to carry on with this?</p>
              <p>True enough,
                                        after saying this, her husband ceased all sexual activities with her
                                        and that strangely, caused her to become suspicious and she asked her
                                        husband for clarification.</p>
              <p>Her husband calmly replied:

                                        confirm it with others who are more experienced like Thusness.</p>
              <p>There
                                        are subtle differences in terms of insights in lets say, the 4 paths
                                        leading to Arhatship, and here is an article by Dharma Dan on this:
                                        http://web.mac.com/danielmingram/iWeb/Daniel%20Ingram%27s%20Dharma%20Blog/The%20Blook/51EE7943-0A69-488A-B5B0-3C8F2EF7C5E8.html</p>
              <p>But roughly speaking, if his teachings are always in line with the dharma seals, and he is in no way confused about his experience and insights, and is able to answer you in any way with regards to dharma and reality, there is a high chance this guy is enlightened somewhat.</p>

              <p><br>it's a misconception. fyi, i was taught that not all enlightened people have relics/shariras.  those reborn in heavenly realms, can also produce shariras when cremated. i think it <em>may</em> be to due to people doing great amount of good deeds etc.</p>
              <p>so one cannot use relics as a full proof that one is enlightened or not.</p>
