              <p>I think it might be possible that sariras may not be an indication of enlightenment, as there could be 'false sariras' --</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After one of the retreats in Europe, Zen Master Seung Sahn told two stories that
              further illuminate the dangers of attaching to samadhi:</p>
              <p>"A long time ago in China, during the time of Zen Master Lin Chi, there was a monk who was very famous for his samadhi
              practicing. 'Ibis monk never wore any clothes and was known as the 'naked monk.'
              He had mastered many kinds of samadhi, had lots of energy, and didn't need to
              wear clothes even in winter.</p>
              <p>"One day Lin Chi decided to test this monk. He called a student of his,
              gave him a set of beautiful clothes, and asked him to present them to the monk.
              The student went to the monk and said, 'Ah, you are wonderful. Your practicing
              is very strong. So my teacher wants to give you these beautiful clothes as a
              present.' The monk kicked away the clothes and said, 'I don't need these
              clothes. I have original clothes, from my parents! Your clothes can only be kept
              a short time, then they will wear out. But my original clothes are never broken.
              Also, if they become dirty, I just take a shower and they are clean again. I
              don't need your clothes!'</p>
              <p>"The student went to Lin Chi and told him what happened. Lin Chi said, 'You
              must go to this monk once more and ask him a certain question.' So the student
              went to the monk and said, 'Great monk! I have one question for you. You said
              you got your original clothes from your parents.' 'Of course!' said the monk.
              'Then I ask you, before you got these original clothes from your parents, what
              kind of clothes did you have?' Upon hearing this, the naked monk went deep into
              samadhi, then into nirvana (he died).</p>
              <p>"Everyone was very surprised and sad. But when the monk's body was
              cremated, many sarira  appeared, so everyone thought, 'Ah,
              this was a great monk.' Sitting on the high rostrum, Lin Chi hit the stand with
              his Zen stick and said, 'Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.' He hit it again,
              'No form, no emptiness.' He hit it a third time, 'Form is form, emptiness is
              emptiness. Which one is correct?' Nobody understood. Then the Zen Master shouted
              'KATZ!' and said, 'The sky is blue, the tree is green.' If you cannot answer in
              one word the question about your original clothes, then, although you can get
              samadhi and nirvana, you cannot get freedom from life and death.</p>
              <p>"Then the Zen Master stared at the sarira -- poof! -- they turned to water.
              This is magic! They all turned to water and disappeared. Everyone was surprised.
              The meaning of this is: if you do samadhi practice deeply, then when you die
              many sarira will appear. But, these sarira will not last long because they
              represent ,one mind,' not 'clear mind' which is our original nature. Our
              original nature has no life, no death, no coming or going. When the true dharma
              appears, which means form is form, emptiness is emptiness or sky is blue, tree
              is green- that energy -BOOM! - will appear, all the sarira will turn to water
              and disappear. Our teaching is substance, truth, and correct life. Our Zen
              practicing means attain your true self, find the correct way, truth, and life.
              Any style of practice is OK -- even using a mantra. But, don't be attached to
              samadhi -- you must 'pass' samadhi. Zen means 'everyday mind,' not special
              states of mind. Moment to moment keeping a clear mind is what's important.</p>
              <p>"Here is another example. Once one of my students decided to practice with
              an Indian guru. This guru taught samadhi practice. So my student got a mantra,
              tried it all the time when he wasn't working, and went deeply into samadhi. All
              the time he was having a very good feeling. Then one day while doing this
              mantra, he was crossing the street. The next thing he knew, a car screeched to a
              halt, almost hitting him, and loudly sounded its horn. The driver shouted at
              him, 'Keep clear mind!' Then my student was very afraid. The next day he came to
              me and said, 'Dae Soen Sa Nim, I have a problem. Last night I almost died. I was
              practicing samadhi, didn't pay attention and was almost hit by a car. Please
              teach me my mistake.'</p>
              <p>"So I explained to him, samadhi practicing takes away your consciousness.
              But Zen means moment to moment keeping clear mind. What are you doing now? When
              you are doing something, just do it. Then this kind of accident cannot happen.
              So don't make samadhi. Don't make anything! Just do it, O.K.?"</p>

              <p>Though of course, lots of great masters themselves do have shariras, and is not a rare phenomenon.</p>
              <p>For example one of the more recent masters, Ven Hsuan Hua --</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"About 4,000 to 10,000 of Master Hua's sharira seeds were found after
              his ashes were scattered, among them included teeth sharira. The many
              sharira that were found consisted of many colors of white, light
              yellow, green, blue, sky blue, light blue, black, pink, silver, and
              other colors. Some of the sharira which were formed on the bones even
              gleamed like green jade.</p>
              <p>One of Master Hua's disciples, moved by the sight of the Master's
              teeth sharira said, "In his life, the Venerable Master lectured on the
              Sutras and spoke Dharma in several tens of thousands of assemblies. No
              wonder his cremation yielded teeth relics!"</p>

              <p>You can usually make a good guess if you are familiar with the maps of enlightenment, however there are not many clear maps out there and the effective ones is the ones that base their maps on the sort of insights/realisations that occur at each level, such as the one by Dharma Dan I shown you earlier. Because I am sort of familiar with the maps, sometimes I can make a good guess what sort of realisations/enlightenment the person has.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you may have to check with someone who is familiar with the maps, or someone who is enlightened himself and familiar with the maps.</p>
              <p>That is the only way I know that you can really tell whether he is enlightened -- that is strictly by his wisdom and insights and yogic state (for example in Bodhisattva bhumi models those who are enlightened reaches the yogic state of Simplicity, then One Taste, then Non-meditation). Hence you cannot really tell by him 'appearing to be enlightened', because appearance is a poor indication.</p>
              <p>Unlike what many people might think, you cannot tell if he is enlightened by his behaviors alone, such as if he is calm or not. Or compassionate or selfless. Because many unenlightened people are compassionate, selfless, calm, even wise. Many of these features are also related to practices such as metta and samatha, but not necessarily insight.</p>
              <p>Of course, usually if he is a lineaged master/teacher, he would have to
                  be enlightened to certain degrees. Because lineage isn't passed
                  down easily unless that practitioner is already highly enlightened.</p>
              <p>If a person is very very clear about Insight and Enlightenment and his true nature and ultimate reality and the dharma thoroughly (not just by knowledge and memory but is able to tell you by his own words and experience), and be able to answer you any way you ask him about them, there is high chance he is enlightened.</p>

              <p>If a person is very very clear about Insight and Enlightenment and his true nature and ultimate reality and the dharma thoroughly (not just by knowledge and memory but is able to tell you by his own words and experience), and be able to answer you any way you ask him about them, there is high chance he is enlightened.</p>

              <p>I feel the above paragraph best summarises how an enlightened person would behave or answer when asking him/her questions about true nature and ultimate reality.</p>
              <p>But it implies that your knowledge must be near him/her, at least for the theoretical part, or else he/she can be talking about anything that sounds very reasonable and profound, but it may be not the Truth as expounded by the Buddha.</p>

              <p>Agree with one point here though: That if spending money will allow the giver to accumulate the proper and sufficient merits for liberation, then Buddha would surely have wasted his time explaining the Truth about reality and Buddha nature to us.</p>

              <p>Personally, even if I encounter any educated elderly or young, I will not ask them to read entire å¤§è—�ç»�. It will scare them away the same way it would for the uneducated. Though the effect might be more pronounced for the latter.</p>
              <p>Other than recommending them to chant, I will also try to let them know how to handle practical aspects of life as a believer.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, bodhicitta and emptiness is not for every Buddhist. We can introduce them to such concepts, but we should not expect any one of them to understand completely, even though we might have exhausted all efforts to do so.</p>

              <p>I agree that not everyone is able to practice bodhisattva path and emptiness. But for one who vow to born in amitabha pureland, he must have bodhicitta. Even if one don't have bodhicitta, if he manage to convince or help sentient being to develop bodhicitta, this will create a huge merit for himself.</p>

              <p>Actually, those without bodhicitta can be reborn in pure land. But they can at most be born in the medium grade (i.e. those who practice hinayana). Those Mahayana bodhisattvas can be reborn in the highest grade.</p>

              <p>Thanks a lot, AEN, for clarifying this matter about whether those without bodhicitta can be reborn in pure land.</p>
              <p>I hope this not only serves as knowledge for buddhists, but also as a firm encouragement, affirmation of faith in practice for those who wish to choose the Amitabha Buddha Pureland Dharma Door.</p>

              <p>this is a bit <strong>controversy</strong> whether purelanders need to generate bodhicitta or not. Pureland school is part mahayana school, and mahayana schools are to generate bodhicitta. vow 19 said they do need.</p>
              <dl><dt>Vow 19  </dt></dl>
              <p>Provided I become a Buddha, if the beings of ten quarters who have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">directed their thoughts towards the Bodhi</span> and cultivated their stock of various merits with a fervent craving for re-birth in that country of mine, if at the moment of death, should I not appear with an assembly of retinue before them, then may I not attain the enlightenment.</p>

              <p>moreover Bodhicitta got Relative and Absolute.</p>

              <p>Those "uneducated" Ah gong ah ma who have deep faith to reborn in Pureland, even though they have no idea of bodhicitta, are able to reborn there when they practice nianfo, is because in essence <strong>Deep Faith is in itself a form of Bodhicitta</strong> said old master. å�‘è�©æ��å¿ƒ ä¸€å�‘è½¬å¿µ. Bodhicitta is the mind of awakening, instead of the common impression of "compassion" to save all beings. ä¸€å�‘è½¬å¿µ and å�‘è�©æ��å¿ƒ go together.</p>
              <p>So for hinayana, actually they can't be reborn in PL <strong>Unless</strong> they å›žå°�å�‘å¤§, that mean turn from small path to big path. really aspire to cultivate like bodhisattvas/Buddhas and generate bodhicitta.</p>
              <p>it would be wrong to go to purealnd to enjoy and treat it as a escape route. these kind of thinking wouldn't get one to be reborn in PL though said master. but å‡ºç¦»å¿ƒ is another meaning.</p>

              <p><span>1. The Meditation Sutra mentions nine kinds of people
              who attain birth in the Pure Land. First, three grades are distinguished:
              higher, middle and lower; and each is further divided into three classes:
              higher, middle and lower. According to Shan-tao's interpretation, the higher
              grade of people are Mahayana-oriented aspirants of the Pure Land, the middle
              grade are Hinayana-oriented and the lower grade are evil-doers who are
              led to aspire to the Pure Land on their death-bed.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was just reading http://www.fodian.net/English/Contemplation_Sutra.htm</p>
              <p>Seems like Highest grade is for Mahayanist, Medium grade is for Hinayanist and moralists. And Lowest grade is for evildoers.</p>
              <p>So all must aspire for birth in pure land, but they do not need to aspire for Buddhahood (Bodhicitta) or have Bodhisattva aspirations in order to be reborn in pure land. But if they do not, they cannot be born in the highest grade.</p>

                              on a seven-jewelled pond. After a day and night, the lotus-flower [345b] opens 
                              and, within seven days, the aspirant beholds the Buddha. Although he sees the

                              marks clearly. But after three weeks he sees them distinctly, and also hears all 
                              the sounds and voices proclaiming the wonderful Dharma. Then he can travel in 
                              all the ten quarters to make offerings to the Buddhas and hear their profound 
                              teachings. After three smaller kalpas he acquires clear understanding of the one

                              contemplation. To practice in this way is called the correct contemplation, 
                              and to practice otherwise is incorrect."<br><br></h3>
