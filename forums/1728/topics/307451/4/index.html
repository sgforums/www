              <p>i'm quite sure there's a saying in PL school that Hinayana cannot be reborn in PL(let me look up in Infinity Life Sutra), unless they å›žå°�å�‘å¤§, meaning "last minute" believe and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">vow</span> to be reborn in pure land. no vow and faith, then cannot born there. i'm thinking, not all Hinayana believe in PL, let along vow to reborn there.</p>

              <p>The part where you mention not all Hinayana believe in PL is true in my opinion and from what I have read so far. However, Arahants would find it easier to  å›žå°�å�‘å¤§ upon any Buddha's advice than any of us. Remember, an Arahant has no ego, no dogmatic or false views. His wisdom cannot be understood by most of us, who have not even attained the 1st stage of sainthood.</p>
              <p>If any Theravada practitioner believes in just the existence of Amitabha Buddha's Pureland and the inconceivable power of the Buddha's vows to deliver all sentient beings, regardless of level of understanding and practice, he/she cannot be considered as Thervada anymore. He/she definitely had heard/practised the Mahayana teachings for many lifetimes but something happened along the way and caused him/her to give up (Refer to Sariputra's previous life 'trial').</p>

              <p>Yup, obviously a person who wants to be reborn in Pureland cannot continue with one's unwholesome thoughts and deeds and thinks he/she can escape from the consequences of his accumulated evil by just reciting and wanting to go to the Pureland.</p>
              <p>However, take note that, it is not easy for everyone to even want to fake reciting Amitabha Buddha's name and wanting to be reborn in Pureland.</p>
              <p>Faking or escaping, whatever it is the mindset of corrupted sentient beings, implies some kind of implicit trust in the existence of Amitabha Buddha's ability to save all sentient beings and the real existence of his Pureland.</p>
              <p>This is one angle of looking at the whole issue that I feel personally, we should not easily brush away, neglect, or condemn.</p>

              <p>Totally agree, the desire to repent has to be absolutely from the heart. And combining that with the belief that Amitabha Buddha and his Pureland does exist and hence become very willing and sincere in wanting to be reborn there, will definitely guarantee one's successful rebirth in the Pureland.</p>

              <p>I will stop asking this question from now on, which is how we know whether someone is enlightened. I have come to a conclusion based on what the moderators and the rest have said that it is better to continue to do what we can to change our bad habits and thoughts than to try to understand or judge whether someone is enlightened.</p>
              <p>No one here will give you an answer that you can understand or accept.</p>
              <p>Why? There are two factors mainly: One, your level of wisdom. Two, the speaker's level of wisdom and practice of Buddhist teachings.</p>
              <p>Only the Buddha can really tell for sure whether someone is enlightened. Other than that, it is better for all of us to refrain from asking this question or insisting on others telling you the 'formula' or guidelines to tell whether the person in front of you is enlightened.</p>

              <p>I agree with SW that we need words to describe Buddhist concepts as words are indeed a form of skillful means per se, but nirvana is not something that can be pointed or something tangible like the moon, it is however, 'realised' by following the direction (Dharma) to which the finger(Buddha) points.</p>

              <p>I totally agree with you that Reciting amitabha encompasses æˆ’å®šæ…§. We should not give up. We will find that it complements or contains every basic teaching of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Well, if your mom is illiterate or that she's thoroughly English-educated, then seriously at her age, reciting Amitabha Buddha's name in English or Mandarin will help her to attain peace of mind and body.</p>
              <p>There is still a need to introduce her to what Amitabha Pureland's like, but in a more simplied way, not directly quoting the sutra's verses and leaving her to understand on her own. One also has to be patient and observant in knowing how to introduce Pureland at the right moment, in the right way so that she finds it easy to remember and practise.</p>
              <p>I'm trying to cultivate patience, non-attachment and compassion. I have not succeeded yet at the moment. I try to be as simple as possible when talking about Pureland to my 85 year-old grandma. She's not illiterate but she is totally schooled in folk and taoist beliefs and is only comfortable with dialects and Mandarin.</p>
              <p>"Escapist" in my opinion, need not be a derogative or demeaning term all the time. It depends, really on the intention or motives of the person concerned.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself: if you are an 'escapist', why not 'escape' to heaven? Why not 'escape' to Maitreya Bodhisattva's abode at Tusita Heaven? How about Medicine Buddha's Pureland? There are so many choices and yet you choose to escape to Amitabha Buddha's Pureland?</p>
              <p>You definitely have affinity with Amitabha Buddha and so does your mother. So I don't particularly need to worry for the both of you, for eventually I know I will see both of you in Amitabha Buddha's Pureland.</p>
              <p>Take good care of your mom and learn more ways to introduce Pureland to her in easy to understand format.</p>
              <p>You will succeed some day if you don't give up. ^_^</p>

              <p>What I would like to say is that Heaven, Pure Land, the 6 realms are all real. (though it should be noted that Heaven is still a realm in Samsara and is not the real goal of Buddhists. but PL is different) But if you cannot accept pure land, practice other dharma door that is suitable for you. If you become a real Bodhisattva in the future you will be able to know what is true and you can even visit those places. There are people who visited pure land and returned.</p>
              <p>Here's someting by my Master who visited PL, and there are other similar cases and observations too --<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Disciple: Master, how do we
                                              witness Sukhavathi?<br> <br> Master Shen Kai: That's easy. But Sukhavathi is very far away. How
                                              far? It's passing through hundreds of thousands of millions of
                                              Buddhalands. In between this hundreds of thousands of millions of
                                              Buddhalands are not Buddhalands but Hui Tu. Buddhalands are pure
                                              where Buddhas dwell. Sukhavathi is hence very very far away. Far
                                              does not mean we don't believe.<br> <br> In the sutras, Buddha used to explain that it's very very near. So
                                              near that nobody believe it's true. There's no choice as sentient
                                              beings are too greedy, hence say it's very very far away and not
                                              easy to go or reach. So He expound the Amitabha Sutra, where Buddha
                                              spoke without people asking. If a person is not greedy, then
                                              Dharmakaya is very near as it encompass everything.<br> Since it's entire existence, it's so near to reach like space
                                              everywhere exist Dharmakaya. Without Dharmakaya, Earth cannot be in
                                              the space. Cars cannot works. Every thing is benefited by
                                              Dharmakaya.<br> <br> When people do business, they need an initial funding, now Buddha
                                              say you don't need that initial funding, you believe in Amitabha
                                              and recite His name.<br> When one see people wearing a gold necklace, but it's just a piece
                                              of metal chain like the one you see in jail to chain prisioners.
                                              Then Buddha told sentient beings not to be obsess with gold, you
                                              just need to recite Amitabha and don't need any initial funding and
                                              you can reborn in a place where gold is use for building
                                              constructions.<br> So does Sukhavathi really exist? Yes. Don't think Buddha is lying.
                                              You can GO NOW and witness yourself and come back to tell people.
                                              Master tell you I been there before, you all might disbelieve. So I
                                              will describe it to you.<br> Sentient beings on Earth are very small, Bodhisattvas of Sukhavathi
                                              are really Big and tall. A person standing next to Amitabha only
                                              reach the height of Amitabha's toe! When I reached Sukhavathi, only
                                              wish to pay homage to Amitabha, and adore Amitabha.<br> Amitabha Buddha reply: What do you seek here in Sukhavathi?<br> Shen Kai: Honored One, i came to seek Dharma.<br> Amitabha Buddha ask: What kind of Dharma?<br> Shen Kai: i'm not sure. Seeing Amitabha's forehead is adorned with
                                              a curled hair. i wisk to seek that Dharma, Honorable One.<br> (Back to reality.) That's how I cultivate and got my curled hair,
                                              but this Dharma method cannot anyhow expound to people. It's is
                                              because you people have doubt in Sukhavathi. Thinking it doesn't
                                              exist. Hence I tell you my experience. Due to the busy schedule,
                                              the white hair is curled. When it grew longer to 3 inch, it will
                                              extend when i'm washing the face. That's the proof.<br> <br> How did Ocean of suffering (ku hai wu bian) come about? Because
                                              beings of samsara cannot sever emotion, love and greed. Sentinet
                                              beings cry a lot. Separation from friend, family, love ones, people
                                              cry. Son is leaving, mother crys, so does the son. Mother is dying,
                                              sons also crys. When people want's to eat, the mouth starts to
                                              water. This is greed. People need to work, they swear. In a life
                                              them, people generate so many water. One person, say one bucket of
                                              water, 100 pax, 100 bucket form a pool of water. If millions of
                                              millions of people cannot sever emotion, love and greed, form an
                                              Ocean of water.<br> <br> In our world there's male and female. Those who goes to jail, 99%
                                              are involve with female. But in Sukhavathi, there's not male nor
                                              female form.<br> <br> (translated by Sinweiy)</span></p>

              <p>I will stop asking this question from now on, which is how we
                              know whether someone is enlightened. I have come to a conclusion
                              based on what the moderators and the rest have said that it is
                              better to continue to do what we can to change our bad habits and
                              thoughts than to try to understand or judge whether someone is
                              enlightened.</p>
              <p>No one here will give you an answer that you can understand or
                              accept.</p>
              <p>Why? There are two factors mainly: One, your level of wisdom.
                              Two, the speaker's level of wisdom and practice of Buddhist
                              teachings.</p>
              <p>Only the Buddha can really tell for sure whether someone is
                              enlightened. Other than that, it is better for all of us to refrain
                              from asking this question or insisting on others telling you the
                              'formula' or guidelines to tell whether the person in front of you
                              is enlightened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Actually, we can know whether someone is enlightened. Definitely not only Buddhas can tell. In fact you can even tell what stage is he at. As I said earlier, the criteria is that you have to be familiar with the Good maps of enlightenment. Of course, if you are enlightened yourself, you should be able to tell who is enlightened and who is not. Or if you are enlightened + familiar with the maps of enlightenment, that is even better. But if you are not, at least you must be familiar with what enlightenment is really about and the maps of enlightenment, then you can distinguish whether someone is enlightened and to what degree. As I said earlier because I am familiar with the maps I can sometimes tell whether one is enlightened or even to what degrees, though not all the time. Of course the greater benefit (of familiarity with the maps) is that one is able to tell where one is when we develope certain experiences.</p>
              <p>But not all maps of enlightenment are good. Some are inaccurate, some are dogmatic and some are entirely based on assumptions and also the action and emotional models, such as what behaviors he wld or wld not do. Then again if you look into history, there are lots of crazy wisdom teachers both in the Vajrayana and Zen tradition that continue to drink and seemingly womanize after their realisation, but they have a reason and I shall not go into that too deeply. But just to let you know that enlightened people does not mean they cannot do certain things.</p>
              <p>There are other models of enlightenment that says that certain emotions disappear after each stage of enlightenment, which is somewhat true (but is actually more like how enlightened people were able to see the true nature of their emotions that arise so as to better manage them, then the emotions not really arising) but then again, normal people may also lack certain emotions (such as anger) if they are generally calm people or have good anger management or are strong in shamatha and metta. And also there are enlightened people who are seemingly angry, whether they are really angry you don't know. Maybe they are simply showing the wrathful form of Avalokitesvara. So again, the emotional and action models fail at this point. They cannot really show you whether a person is enlightened or not. Unlike what people think, enlightened people do not *necessarily* need to appear calm and peaceful.</p>
              <p>The only way to really know is, like I said, by the criteria of their insights. Here comes the 'good maps of enlightenment' that strictly based on stages of realisation in terms of insights into ultimate reality, or stages of yogic insights. What are the good maps of enlightenment? Those that speaks of the 'non-dual' models -- models that talk about stages of increased perception/insights of non-duality, luminous-emptiness, etc. I have said previously, Dharma Dan's stages of the 4 paths is one of them. Others may include the 10 bhumis as presented in terms of nondual experience in Lankavatara Sutra, the Tibetan presentation of the 10 bhumis in terms of yogic experience, the 5 ranks of Tozan, Thusness's six stages of experience, (you can find some of them in my blog <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/</a>) and many more that are used in different traditions that actually are very similar and related to each other. And in fact if you are a lineaged teacher in the various traditions, that means you are already enlightened. They don't let you be a real lineaged teacher until you are enlightened. That is why they often say, seek a teacher from proper lineages.</p>
              <p>An example of the Tibetan presentation of the 10 bhumis in terms of 4 stages of yogic experience (see <a href="http://www.khandro.net/Buddhism_maha_stages.htm">http://www.khandro.net/Buddhism_maha_stages.htm</a>) and in this context of the Mahamudra system where the last 3 stages are stages of an Arya (enlightened being):</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Bookman Old Style;">
              </span></p><p>Per Gampopa</p>
              <span style="font-family: Bookman Old Style;">
              <p>A lucid, unceasing awareness of the moment is the one-pointed stage of yoga.</p>
              <p>Understanding the essential state of the awareness
                              as non-arising, transcending all conceptual modes, is the
                              free-from-elaboration stage of yoga.</p>
              <p>Understanding the diverse appearances as being one from the standpoint of their intrinsic nature is the one flavor yoga.</p>
              <p>An unceasing realization of the union of appearance
                              and their intrinsic emptiness is the great equipoise of the
                              non-meditation yoga.</p>
              </span><p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So anyway, knowing the various stages one will be able to tell if someone else is enlightened by his dharma expression. Usually his words and teachings wld reflect his experience, and if he is truly enlightened then his understand will be in line with Buddha's and with the nature of reality. What he say will one way or another be similar essentially to the truly enlightened sages. If he is still not that realised then his expression would be different based on his current insight.</p>
              <p>By the way, you may like to listen to this MP3 by Daniel Ingram (Dharma Dan), <a href="http://www.trumix.com/podshows/2100538">http://www.trumix.com/podshows/2100538</a></p>
              <p>It is called 'Enlightened Teachers'.</p>
              <p><em><strong> In our latest podcast with Theravada teacher Daniel Ingram he breaches
                              the taboo of enlightenment by discussing the enlightenment of other
                              teachers. Not only that but he argues for a more transparent approach
                              to enlightenment within certain teaching circles, in hopes that
                              enlightenment can become more attainable. Listen and see why he thinks
                              this will help.</strong></em></p>

              <p>Actually, we can know whether someone is enlightened. Definitely not only Buddhas can tell. In fact you can even tell what stage is he at. As I said earlier, the criteria is that you have to be familiar with the Good maps of enlightenment. Of course, if you are enlightened yourself, you should be able to tell who is enlightened and who is not. Or if you are enlightened + familiar with the maps of enlightenment, that is even better. But if you are not, at least you must be familiar with what enlightenment is really about and the maps of enlightenment, then you can distinguish whether someone is enlightened and to what degree. As I said earlier because I am familiar with the maps I can sometimes tell whether one is enlightened or even to what degrees, though not all the time. Of course the greater benefit (of familiarity with the maps) is that one is able to tell where one is when we develope certain experiences.</p>
              <p>But not all maps of enlightenment are good. Some are inaccurate, some are dogmatic and some are entirely based on assumptions and also the action and emotional models, such as what behaviors he wld or wld not do. Then again if you look into history, there are lots of crazy wisdom teachers both in the Vajrayana and Zen tradition that continue to drink and seemingly womanize after their realisation, but they have a reason and I shall not go into that too deeply. But just to let you know that enlightened people does not mean they cannot do certain things.</p>
              <p>There are other models of enlightenment that says that certain emotions disappear after each stage of enlightenment, which is somewhat true (but is actually more like how enlightened people were able to see the true nature of their emotions that arise so as to better manage them, then the emotions not really arising) but then again, normal people may also lack certain emotions (such as anger) if they are generally calm people or have good anger management or are strong in shamatha and metta. And also there are enlightened people who are seemingly angry, whether they are really angry you don't know. Maybe they are simply showing the wrathful form of Avalokitesvara. So again, the emotional and action models fail at this point. They cannot really show you whether a person is enlightened or not. Unlike what people think, enlightened people do not *necessarily* need to appear calm and peaceful.</p>
              <p>The only way to really know is, like I said, by the criteria of their insights. Here comes the 'good maps of enlightenment' that strictly based on stages of realisation in terms of insights into ultimate reality, or stages of yogic insights. What are the good maps of enlightenment? Those that speaks of the 'non-dual' models -- models that talk about stages of increased perception/insights of non-duality, luminous-emptiness, etc. I have said previously, Dharma Dan's stages of the 4 paths is one of them. Others may include the 10 bhumis as presented in terms of nondual experience in Lankavatara Sutra, the Tibetan presentation of the 10 bhumis in terms of yogic experience, the 5 ranks of Tozan, Thusness's six stages of experience, (you can find some of them in my blog <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/</a>) and many more that are used in different traditions that actually are very similar and related to each other. And in fact if you are a lineaged teacher in the various traditions, that means you are already enlightened. They don't let you be a real lineaged teacher until you are enlightened. That is why they often say, seek a teacher from proper lineages...</p>

              <p>I mentioned that only Buddhas can tell, cos I was hoping to convey the message that one should not be too concerned or hung up about how to tell whether a person is enlightened.</p>
              <p>If one fulfills the criteria to be taught the good maps to discern the various stages of enlightment, then I do not see any problem at all.</p>
              <p>However, my opinion is that generally, there would a number of people (maybe most) who cannot fulfil those strict spiritual progress criteria in their entire lives to have the maps revealed and taught to them. Therefore I wish to caution that it would only bring harm to those who insist on people telling them no matter what.</p>

              <p>I agree that it can refer to any Buddhists suddenly deciding to turn to Mahayana, having reached or not yet reached stream entry.</p>
              <p>But I wish to emphasise a confirmed and stable stage of liberation from rebirths, and one who has attained the first stream entry would only need to be reborn 7 times in the Saha world before he/she gains liberation from further rebirths.</p>

              <p>however to be more specific the word Pure land is only for Buddhas. the pureland of Bodhisattvas cannot be call pureland, if strickly speaking.</p>
              <p>As the PL of bodhisattvas are formulated by karmic forceæœ‰æ¼�ä¸šåŠ›, while the Pureland of Buddha (Amitabha) is manifested from the Dharmakaya.  PL of bodhisattvas is known as åº„ä¸¥å‡€åœŸã€‚Buddha's PL is purely call æˆ�å°±å‡€åœŸ. PL of Maitreya, ie inner court of Tusita heaven, is in fact known as ç§½åœŸä¸­çš„å‡€åœŸ. But it's call "pureland" because Maitreya is there, so the disciples dare not go astray.</p>
              <p>Normally, in Amitabha Pureland, even when disciples are not with Amitabha or go into the "forest", the surround will still make them think of Buddha, Sangha and Dharma. but when one is reborn in Tusita heaven, and when one see the form(goddess or gold) and hear the pretty sound, they may still generate desire/lust.</p>
              <p>So Amitabha Pureland is different in the sense that it's based on Fruition æžœæŠ¥ä½“ of Dharmakaya. and a Pureland cannot be form by karmic force, it must be totally Pure.  and Only the Buddha's Dharmakaya is Purest. as the saying goes ä¸‰è´¤å��åœ£ä½�æžœæŠ¥ï¼Œå”¯ä½›ä¸€äººå±…å‡€åœŸã€‚</p>

              <p>I do think that anyone can reach to pureland of Amitabha with the right conditions, even though they have done some unwholesome acitivites in their current life. Though i don't really understand what is the right conditions that occur for one to reach pureland of Amitabha, one of the possible reasons could be their past life merits and the right mentality on their deathbed ?</p>
              <p>And the other condition is the vows of Amitabha. </p>
              <p>It is not easy for anyone to reach to any pureland. Amitabha pureland is perhaps one of the most easiest for anyone to reach to.</p>
              <p>However, i could like to ask what up with the western and eastern direction for pureland ?</p>
              <p>So does it means that it really locates at the western direction of our compass here ?</p>
              <p>thanks</p>

              <p>i think when we are really in the situation of deathbed, direction, doesn't really matter anymore. you just close the eyes and recite the Name.</p>
              <p><br>i used to think it's real in the beginning, then as i practice further i also think that it's real and unreal at the same time (ie emptiness/non-dual). People will say that the form of pureland is the skillful mean. but now i'm having this feeling that emptiness IS the skillful mean, while Pure Land is the Absolute. <br>Just like Normal people unknowingly see mountain as mountain. But when they start practicing, mountain is not mountain. And when enlightened, mountain is still mountain. But this time, it's a luminosity of the mountain.</p>
              <p>why to you think in Amitabha Sutra, Shakyamuni Buddha asked Buddha's of the six directions to witness what He said was true that Amitabha Pureland is <em>From here, passing through hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands to the West there is a world called Utmost Happiness. In this land a Buddha called Amitabha right now teaches the Dharma.</em><br>....Because it is! People who thinks that Pureland is emptiness, would not be reborn "there", as the mind is dwelling in emptiness instead of form. (now i know how Grand Master Yin Guang felt).</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>ordinary people generally think that if the Pure Land is Mind-Only, then it does not exist. This is the understanding of demons and externalists. Such a deluded view, which appears correct but is in reality wrong, affects more than half of all people and causes practitioners to forfeit true benefits.--Grand Master Yin Guang</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>the essence of Amitabha Sutra is in this very paragraph:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <div class="quotetop"><em>At that time, the Buddha told the elder Shariputra:<br>"Passing from here through hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddha-lands to the West, there is a land called Ultimate Bliss. In this land, at this moment, a Buddha named Amitabha teaches the Dharma.</em></div>
              <p>--Amitabha Sutra</p>

              <p><br>When Buddha say something like this, Buddha do not say this for any Additional meaning nor Subtract any meaning from it. <br>It Just Simply mean <span style="color: blue;">Passing from here through hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddha-lands to the West, there is a land called Ultimate Bliss.
