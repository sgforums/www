              <p>this is a bit <strong>controversy</strong> whether purelanders need to generate bodhicitta or not. Pureland school is part mahayana school, and mahayana schools are to generate bodhicitta. vow 19 said they do need.</p>
              <dl><dt>Vow 19 </dt></dl>
              <p>Provided I become a Buddha, if the beings of ten quarters who have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">directed their thoughts towards the Bodhi</span> and cultivated their stock of various merits with a fervent craving for re-birth in that country of mine, if at the moment of death, should I not appear with an assembly of retinue before them, then may I not attain the enlightenment.</p>

              <p>Those "uneducated" Ah gong ah ma who have deep faith to reborn in Pureland, even though they have no idea of bodhicitta, are able to reborn there when they practice nianfo, is because in essence <strong>Deep Faith is in itself a form of Bodhicitta</strong> said old master. å�‘è�©æ��å¿ƒ ä¸€å�‘è½¬å¿µ. Bodhicitta is the mind of awakening, instead of the common impression of "compassion" to save all beings. ä¸€å�‘è½¬å¿µ and å�‘è�©æ��å¿ƒ go together.</p>
              <p>So for hinayana, actually they can't be reborn in PL <strong>Unless</strong> they å›žå°�å�‘å¤§, that mean turn from small path to big path. really aspire to cultivate like bodhisattvas/Buddhas and generate bodhicitta.</p>
              <p>it would be wrong to go to purealnd to enjoy and treat it as a escape route. these kind of thinking wouldn't get one to be reborn in PL though said master. but å‡ºç¦»å¿ƒ is another meaning.</p>

              <p>It may be wrong to adopt a mindset which treats the Pureland dharma door as an escape route.</p>
              <p>However, I wish to point out this: escaping requires effort too, you know. You can't just think, but your legs don't run, can you?</p>
              <p>If I were to one day be asked to speak on the Pureland dharma door to the public, I would rather tell them to carry on reciting or practising the dharma door with or without bodhicitta, or using it as an escape route or not.</p>
              <p>Why? Cos they will all eventually make it to Amitabha Pureland as a result of willing to recite or practise the dharma door in any way. This can be considered as “ç»“æ³•ç¼˜”with Amitabha Buddha.</p>
              <p>The basis of my views are from Master Ou Yi and Master Yin Kuang. You will find that it's more compassionate and practical to advise people to carry reciting or practise the dharma door than to tell them not to just because they merely treat it as an escape route.</p>
              <p>Let me paint a scenario:</p>
              <p>You are chased by many monsters. You come across an intersection point of 3 different paths.</p>
              <p>1 path is labelled: Non-self and emptiness</p>
              <p>2 path is labelled: Pureland with Bodhicitta and utmost diligence</p>
              <p>3 path is labelled: Pureland for escapists and lazy people.</p>
              <p>Which one would you choose? And whichever you choose, do you actually know you are taking a risk too in a way, trusting that this path is indeed what it is, a place for you to escape from being devoured?</p>
              <p>Another scenario:</p>
              <p>You are shipwrecked and left floating in the boundless ocean for many days. It is nightime now.</p>
              <p>You can't see a thing. Something hard floats your way and brushes against your body. You are very happy and grabs onto it for support to help you float with less effort against the currents.</p>
              <p>The next morning, what do you find you are clinging onto?</p>
              <p>Surprise! It's a rather huge piece of sturdy log and but yet has bird shit on it.</p>
              <p>You didn't mind, cos you think to yourself: Wow, glad that I'm finally safe. I don't know when a ship will come or when I will be drifted to a nearby island for rest, and i don't know when I will tire myself out due to dehydration and hunger, but I'm glad I don't have to tire out myself now when any sea storm comes.</p>
              <p>Whichever way you think, the route you choose for escaping to involves 'trust' and 'mental preparedness'.</p>
              <p>If I were the Buddha, I would want to help escapists too. :)</p>

              <p>I am not sure what you meant by escapists.<br>Anyway, this reminds me of a question that why evil peope cannot be born in pureland.<br>It is not that buddha has no compassion to them, but they have done so much bad thing when they are alive, so it is impossible (terms &amp; conditions applied) for them to reborn in the pureland. We are responsible for our own action,  as the word saying ç¥žé€šä¸�æ•Œä¸šåŠ›.</p>
              <p>But by having bodhicitta, we will clear off a lot of karma, at the same time accumulate a lot of good karma and merit.<br>If we follow the pure land dharma door, this merit and good karma will be used as cause and conditions for us to reborn in pureland. If we are doing some good deeds for our own benefit only, never do any vow or dedication of merit, then we are only entitled to heaven or a better life in human realm.</p>
              <p>To add on, what is the difference between pure land and heaven. In case anyone don't know, when one go to heaven, it is only a temporary release from suffering, like a prisoner having a 1 day off to go back home. But if one go to pureland, he is considered liberate from samsara. A permanent release from suffering and a much higher level of enjoyment (enjoyment may not be the right word but this is the closest word I can think of). By the time, when one leave pure land and return to samsara, he is already a buddha or enlightened bodhisattva. :)</p>

              <p><span>1. The Meditation Sutra mentions nine kinds of people who attain birth in the Pure Land. First, three grades are distinguished: higher, middle and lower; and each is further divided into three classes: higher, middle and lower. According to Shan-tao's interpretation, the higher grade of people are Mahayana-oriented aspirants of the Pure Land, the middle grade are Hinayana-oriented and the lower grade are evil-doers who are led to aspire to the Pure Land on their death-bed.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was just reading http://www.fodian.net/English/Contemplation_Sutra.htm</p>
              <p>Seems like Highest grade is for Mahayanist, Medium grade is for Hinayanist and moralists. And Lowest grade is for evildoers.</p>
              <p>So all must aspire for birth in pure land, but they do not need to aspire for Buddhahood (Bodhicitta) or have Bodhisattva aspirations in order to be reborn in pure land. But if they do not, they cannot be born in the highest grade.</p>

                                          fundamental morals. The Second Condition consists of three
                                          practices based on cultivating the Self. The Third Condition
                                          consists of four practices based on the practices of the
                                          Bodhisattvas. For more details, see the text on this page and the
                                          pages that follow, and also the page titled "</p>

              <p>Yea, so as I was saying earlier they must have the wish to be reborn in pure land. It is a form of 'awakening'. Even to seek arhat liberation is also a form of 'awakening' mah. But that doesn't mean he will aspire for full Buddhahood right? Pure Land have normal practitioners (prior to realising unborn), as well as Arhats (Hinayana), as well as Bodhisattvas and Buddhas (Mahayana).</p>
              <p>I heard before that there are Hinayana people going to Pure Land, but will end up self cultivation and attaining Arhatship, but not cultivating as Bodhisattva. Actually, it's the same as the sutra said (i.e. those of medium grade attaining Arhatship). Whether Amitabha will encourage in due time those Arhats to 'hui xiao xiang da', I'm not sure, might be possible.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless I think the 3 conditions are very important and they build up those conditions for birth in pure land. But I think not everyone can perfectly fulfill the 3 conditions, and hence there are 9 grades of birth in pure land. Those who fulfill all of them to a very high or perfect level will probably be born in the highest grade.</p>

              <p>I see... well perhaps. But I was thinking then why are there people attaining Arhatship in pure land? Maybe those who become Arhat in pure land is because their thinking is too skewed towards personal liberation... last minute vow can't change his path. But of course even Hinayana is also One Buddha Vehicle ultimately so eventually they will turn towards Buddhahood.</p>

              <p>I am not sure what you meant by escapists.<br>Anyway, this reminds me of a question that why evil peope cannot be born in pureland.<br>It is not that buddha has no compassion to them, but they have done so much bad thing when they are alive, so it is impossible (terms &amp; conditions applied) for them to reborn in the pureland. We are responsible for our own action,  as the word saying ç¥žé€šä¸�æ•Œä¸šåŠ›.</p>

              <p>it's not impossible. there are evil doers who at their last moment of death really deeply truely repent, and are able to go to PL. so i presume the "terms &amp; conditions applied “ is true repenting.</p>
              <p>note to people, this is not a good example to follow in the sense, that we can go all out and do bad things and wait for last minute to repent. if your repent is not true, also cannot.</p>

              <p>It may be wrong to adopt a mindset which treats the Pureland dharma door as an escape route.</p>
              <p>However, I wish to point out this: escaping requires effort too, you know. You can't just think, but your legs don't run, can you?</p>
              <p>If I were to one day be asked to speak on the Pureland dharma door to the public, I would rather tell them to carry on reciting or practising the dharma door with or without bodhicitta, or using it as an escape route or not.</p>
              <p>Why? Cos they will all eventually make it to Amitabha Pureland as a result of willing to recite or practise the dharma door in any way. This can be considered as “ç»“æ³•ç¼˜”with Amitabha Buddha.</p>
              <p>The basis of my views are from Master Ou Yi and Master Yin Kuang. You will find that it's more compassionate and practical to advise people to carry reciting or practise the dharma door than to tell them not to just because they merely treat it as an escape route.</p>
              <p>Let me paint a scenario:</p>
              <p>You are chased by many monsters. You come across an intersection point of 3 different paths.</p>
              <p>1 path is labelled: Non-self and emptiness</p>
              <p>2 path is labelled: Pureland with Bodhicitta and utmost diligence</p>
              <p>3 path is labelled: Pureland for escapists and lazy people.</p>
              <p>Which one would you choose? And whichever you choose, do you actually know you are taking a risk too in a way, trusting that this path is indeed what it is, a place for you to escape from being devoured?</p>
              <p>Another scenario:</p>
              <p>You are shipwrecked and left floating in the boundless ocean for many days. It is nightime now.</p>
              <p>You can't see a thing. Something hard floats your way and brushes against your body. You are very happy and grabs onto it for support to help you float with less effort against the currents.</p>
              <p>The next morning, what do you find you are clinging onto?</p>
              <p>Surprise! It's a rather huge piece of sturdy log and but yet has bird shit on it.</p>
              <p>You didn't mind, cos you think to yourself: Wow, glad that I'm finally safe. I don't know when a ship will come or when I will be drifted to a nearby island for rest, and i don't know when I will tire myself out due to dehydration and hunger, but I'm glad I don't have to tire out myself now when any sea storm comes.</p>
              <p>Whichever way you think, the route you choose for escaping to involves 'trust' and 'mental preparedness'.</p>
              <p>If I were the Buddha, I would want to help escapists too. :)</p>

              <p>yes, that's å‡ºç¦»å¿ƒ like that of <em>Lady Vaidehi in Comtemplation Sutra</em>. Her husband was killed by her own son. bad family problem. very sadden. so she went to Buddha for help to see if there's a kind of practice to 'escape' from SUFFERING. "Escape" from suffering, affliction; samsara are all a good thing. <em>Lady Vaidehi</em> did practice very well<em>.</em></p>
              <p>å‡ºç¦»å¿ƒ is beginning path that slowly lead to Bodhicitta è�©æ��å¿ƒ. <strong>å‡ºç¦»å¿ƒ</strong>æ˜¯å…¥äºŽå°�ä¹˜ä¹‹é—¨å�Ž,<strong>è�©æ��å¿ƒ</strong>åˆ™æ˜¯å…¥äºŽå¤§ä¹˜çš„é—¨å�Žã€‚</p>

              <p><br>yeah. i'm also thinking like <em>Culapanthaka</em>,  we may not know 'they' , after their realisation, (ie open their wisdom already), know "bodhicitta" more than we do.</p>
              <p>like we are the ones reading about the theory of swimming. while they are the ones practicing swimming itself. we think they don't know, but in fact they know throught their daily practice of nianfo.</p>
