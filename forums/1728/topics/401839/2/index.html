              <p>By watching the video clip above, the tomb is considered a holy site so I don't think the local people will allow that. I find the footprints that the man claimed that there are marks and scars of crucification, may be the expert should examine them. I think someone has already examined the footprints and they came up with this video clip analysing the footprints. I find this video clip interesting.</p>

              <p><span class="bodycopy"><strong>Holger Kersten:</strong><em> "It is simply of vital importance to find again the path to the sources, to the eternal and central truths of Christ's message, which has been shaken almost beyond recognition by the profane ambitions of more or less secular institutions arrogating to themselves a religious authority. This is an attempt to open a way to a new future, firmly founded in the true spiritual and religious sources of the past". </em></span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy"></span>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">Thus begins Holger Kersten's book "Jesus Lived in India". This German book is a thorough, methodical and authoritative examination of the evidence of Christ's life beyond the Middle East before the Crucifixion and in India and elsewhere after it. </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">This article is a summary of Kersten's exhaustive research into Christ's travels after the Crucifixion, his arrival in India with the Mother Mary and finally his death and entombment in Kashmir. Kersten notes the many parallels of Christ's teachings with other religious and cultural traditions and suggests that at least some of these figures may have been one and the same personality. It is not possible, Kersten asserts, to disprove that Christ went to India. The current information documenting Christ's life is restricted to the gospels and the work of Church theologians. One can hardly trust these sources to be objective considering their obvious interest in maintaining the authority of their Church and its grip on the masses. </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The Russian scholar, Nicolai Notovich, was the first to suggest that Christ may have gone to India. In 1887, Notovich, a Russian scholar and Orientalist, arrived in Kashmir during one of several journeys to the Orient. At the Zoji-la pass Notovich was a guest in a Buddhist monastery, where a monk told him of the bhodisattva saint called "Issa". Notovich was stunned by the remarkable parallels of Issa's teachings and martyrdom with that of Christ's life, teachings and crucifixion.</p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">For about sixteen years, Christ travelled through Turkey, Persia, Western Europe and possibly England. He finally arrived with Mary to a place near Kashmir, where she died. After many years in Kashmir, teaching to an appreciative population, who venerated him as a great prophet, reformer and saint, he died and was buried in a tomb in Kashmir itself. </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">The first step in Christ's trail after the Crucifixion is found in the Persian scholar F. Mohammed's historical work "Jami-ut-tuwarik" which tells of Christ's arrival in the kingdom of Nisibis, by royal invitation. (Nisibis is today known as Nusaybin in Turkey) . This is reiterated in the Imam Abu Jafar Muhammed's "Tafsi-Ibn-i-Jamir at-tubri." Kersten found that in both Turkey and Persia there are ancient stories of a saint called "Yuz Asaf" ("Leader of the Healed"), whose behaviour, miracles and teachings are remarkably similar to that of Christ. </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">The many Islamic and Hindu historical works recording local history and legends of kings, noblemen and saints of the areas thought to be travelled by Jesus also give evidence of a Christ like man; the Koran, for example, refers to Christ as "Issar". Further east, the Kurdish tribes of Eastern Anatolia have several stories describing Christ's stay in Eastern Turkey after his resurrection. These traditional legends have been ignored by the theological community. </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">Kersten also suggests that prior to Christ's mission in the Middle East, he may have been exposed to Buddhist teachings in Egypt. After his birth in Bethlehem, his family fled to Egypt to avoid Herod's persecution. Surprisingly some scholars now acknowledge that Buddhist schools probably existed in Alexandria long before the Christian era. </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">More clues are drawn from the Apocrypha. These are texts said to have been written by the Apostles but which are not officially accepted by the Church. Indeed, the Church regards them as heresy since a substantial amount of the Apocrypha directly contradicts Church dogma and theology. The Apocryphal 'Acts of Thomas', for example, tell how Christ met Thomas several times after the Crucifixion. In fact they tell us how Christ sent Thomas to teach his spirituality in India. This is corroborated by evidence found in the form of stone inscriptions at Fatehpur Sikri, near the Taj Mahal, in Northern India. They include "Agrapha", which are sayings of Christ that don't exist in the mainstream Bible. Their grammatical form is most similar to that of the Apocryphal gospel of Thomas. This is but one example giving credibility to the idea that texts not recognised by the Church hold important clues about Christ's true life and his teachings. </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">In tracing Christ's movements to India and beyond, Kersten also discovered that many of his teachings, which have been gradually edited out of the modern Bible were originally Eastern in nature. Principles such as karma and re-incarnation, for example, were common knowledge then, and seem to have been reaffirmed by Christ. Imagine the implications that this discovery holds for Western Christianity and its churches, who have kept Christ in their doctrinal top pockets and have constrained the entire Western culture within the narrow teachings of blind faith, organised religion and original sin! </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">Further clues are cited from The Apocryphal Acts of Thomas, and the Gospel of Thomas which are of Syrian origin and have been dated to the 4th Century AD, or possibly earlier. They are Gnostic Scriptures and despite the evidence indicating their authenticity, they are not given credence by mainstream theologians. In these texts Thomas tells of Christ's appearance in Andrapolis, Paphlagonia (today known as in the extreme north of Anatolia) as a guest of the King of Andrappa. There he met with Thomas who had arrived separately. It is at Andrapolis that Christ entreated Thomas to go to India to begin spreading his teachings. It seems that Christ and Mary then moved along the West coast of Turkey, proof of this could be an old stopping place for travellers called the "Home of Mary", found along the ancient silk route. From here Christ could easily have entered Europe via France. He may have even travelled as far as the British Isles, for in England there is an ancient oak tree called the "Hallowed Tree" which (says local legend) was planted by Christ himself. </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">In his travels through Persia (today's Iran) Christ became known as Yuz Asaf (leader of the Healed). We know this because a Kashmiri historical document confirms that Isa (the Koranic name for Christ) was in fact also known as Yuz Asaf. The Jami - uf - Tamarik, Volume II, tells that Yuz Asaf visited Masslige, where he attended the grave of Shem, Noah's son. There are various other accounts such as Agha Mustafa's "Awhali Shahaii-i-paras" that tell of Yuz Asaf's travels and teachings all over Persia. It seems that Yuz Asaf blessed Afghanistan and Pakistan with his presence also. There are for example two plains in Eastern Afghanistan near Gazni and Galalabad, bearing the name of the prophet Yuz Asaf. Again in the Apocryphal Acts of Thomas, Thomas says that he and Christ attended the Court of King Gundafor of Taxila (now Pakistan), in about 47AD, and that eventually both the King and his brother accepted Christ's teachings. Kersten claims that there are more than twenty one historical documents that bear witness to the existence of Jesus in Kashmir, where he was known also as Yuz Asaf and Issa. For example the Bhavishyat Mahapurana (volume 9 verses 17-32) contains an account of Issa-Masih (Jesus the Messiah). It describes Christ's arrival in the Kashmir region of India and his encounter with King Shalivahana, who ruled the Kushan area (39-50AD), and who entertained Christ as a guest for some time. </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">{Christ's life in India, after the crucifixion, challenges current Church teachings at their very foundation. The theology of Saint Paul, the major influence on modern Christianity, is empty fanaticism in the light of this discovery.| </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">The historian Mullah Nadini (1413) also recounts a story of Yuz Asaf who was a contemporary to King Gopadatta, and confirms that he also used the name Issar, ie. Jesus. There is also much historical truth in the towns and villages of Northern India to prove that Jesus and his mother Mary spent time in the area. For instance, at the border of a small town called Mari, there is nearby a mountain called Pindi Point, upon which is an old tomb called Mai Mari da Asthan or "The final resting place of Mary". The tomb is said to be very old and local Muslims venerate it as the grave of Issa's (ie Christ's) Mother. The tomb itself is oriented East-West consistent with the Jewish tradition, despite the fact it is within a Muslim area. Assuming its antiquity, such a tomb could not be Hindu either since the Hindus contemporary to Christ cremated their dead and scattered their ashes as do Hindus today. </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">Following Christ's trail into Kashmir, 40km south of Srinagar, between the villages of Naugam and Nilmge is a meadow called Yuz-Marg (the meadow of Yuz Asaf, ie. Jesus). Then there is the sacred building called Aish Muqam, 60km south east of Srinagar and 12km from Bij Bihara. "Aish" says Kersten is derived from "Issa" and "Muqam" place of rest or repose. Within the Aish Muqam is a sacred relic called the 'Moses Rod' or the 'Jesus Rod', which local legend says, belonged to Moses himself. Christ is said to also have held it, perhaps to confirm his Mosaic heritage. Above the town of Srinagar is a temple known as "The Throne of Solomon", which dates back to at least 1000BC, which King Gopadatta had restored at about the same time as Christ's advent. The restoration was done by a Persian architect who personally left four inscriptions on the side steps of the temple. The third and fourth inscription read: "At this time Yuz Asaf announced his prophetic calling in Year 50 and 4" and "He is Jesus -- Prophet of the Sons of Israel"! Herein lies a powerful confirmation of Kersten's theory. Kersten suggests that Christ may have travelled to the South of India also, finally returning to Kashmir to die at the age of approximately 80 years. Christ's tomb, says Kersten, lies in Srinagar's old town in a building called Rozabal. "Rozabal" is an abbreviation of Rauza Bal, meaning "tomb of a prophet". At the entrance there is an inscription explaining that Yuz Asaf is buried along with another Moslem saint. Both have gravestones which are oriented in North-South direction, according to Moslem tradition. However, through a small opening the true burial chamber can be seen, in which there is the Sarcophagus of Yuz Asaf in East-West (Jewish) orientation! </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">According to Professor Hassnain, who has studied this tomb, there are carved footprints on the grave stones and when closely examined, carved images of a crucifix and a rosary. The footprints of Yuz Asaf have what appear to be scars represented on both feet, if one assumes that they are crucifixion scars, then their position is consistent with the scars shown in the Turin Shroud (left foot nailed over right). Crucifixion was not practised in Asia, so it is quite possible that they were inflicted elsewhere, such as the Middle East. The tomb is called by some as "Hazrat Issa Sahib" or "Tomb of the Lord Master Jesus". Ancient records acknowledge the existence of the tomb as long ago as 112AD. The Grand Mufti, a prominent Muslim Cleric, himself has confirmed that Hazrat Isa Sahib is indeed the tomb of Yuz Asaf! </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">Thus Kersten deduces that the tomb of Jesus Christ Himself is in Kashmir! </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodycopy">The implications of Kersten's discovery are monumental. Christ's life in India, after the crucifixion, challenges current Church teachings at their very foundation. The theology of Saint Paul, the major influence on modern Christianity, is empty fanaticism in the light of this discovery. Threatened also are the doctrines of obedience to the Church, original sin, salvation through blind faith and the non-existence of reincarnation, etc. Yet these ideas underlie the morality and ethics, (or lack of them), that govern the entire Western social structure, from the legal system to medical health care schemes. It is no wonder that the modern Churches and their secular interests refuse to consider such a proposition as Kersten's! </span></p>

              <p>The <strong>lost years of Jesus</strong> concerns the undocumented timespan between <a title="Jesus" href="/wiki/Jesus"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Jesus</span></a>'s childhood and the beginning of his ministry as recorded in the <a title="New Testament" href="/wiki/New_Testament"><span style="color: #0645ad;">New Testament</span></a>.</p>
              <p>The <a class="mw-redirect" title="Gospels" href="/wiki/Gospels"><span style="color: #0645ad;">gospels</span></a> have accounts of event surrounding Jesus's birth, and the subsequent flight into Egypt to escape the wrath of <a title="Herod the Great" href="/wiki/Herod_the_Great"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Herod</span></a> (Matthew 2:13-23). There is a general reference to the settlement of Joseph and Mary, along with the young Jesus, at <a title="Nazareth" href="/wiki/Nazareth"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Nazareth</span></a> (Matthew 2:23; Lk. 2:39-40). There also is that isolated account of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus's visit to the city of Jerusalem to celebrate the <a title="Passover" href="/wiki/Passover"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Passover</span></a>, when Jesus was twelve years old (Luke 2:41-50).</p>
              <p>Following that episode, there is a blank space in the record that covers eighteen years in the life of Christ (from age 12 to 30). Other than the generic allusion that Jesus advanced in wisdom, stature, and in favor with God and man (Luke 2:52), nothing is known of this time span. The normal assumption is that Jesus simply lived in Nazareth during that period, but there are various theories, that present other scenarios, typically including travels to India. The <strong>Jesus in India</strong> idea appears to originate with <a title="Louis Jacolliot" href="/wiki/Louis_Jacolliot"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Louis Jacolliot</span></a> (1869) and has been repeated by numerous authors since, among them <a title="Nicolas Notovitch" href="/wiki/Nicolas_Notovitch"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Nicolas Notovitch</span></a> (1894), the religious leader <a title="Mirza Ghulam Ahmad" href="/wiki/Mirza_Ghulam_Ahmad"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Mirza Ghulam Ahmad</span></a> (1899), <a title="Levi H. Dowling" href="/wiki/Levi_H._Dowling"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Levi H. Dowling</span></a> (1908), <a title="Mathilde Ludendorff" href="/wiki/Mathilde_Ludendorff"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Mathilde Ludendorff</span></a> (1930) and more recently by <strong>Holger Kersten</strong> (1981, 1994), who argued that Jesus travelled to Kashmir not as a young man, but after his resurrection. Most of these theories are informed by the identification of Kashmiri saint <a title="Yuz Asaf" href="/wiki/Yuz_Asaf"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Yuz Asaf</span></a> with Jesus by the <a title="Ahmadiyya" href="/wiki/Ahmadiyya"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Ahmadiyya</span></a> sect (founded 1889).</p>
              <p><span id="Jesus_and_Buddhism" class="mw-headline">Jesus and Buddhism</span></p>
              <p>Gruber and Kersten (1995) claim that Buddhism had a substantial influence on the life and teachings of Jesus.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></a></sup> They claim that Jesus was influenced by the teachings and practices of <a title="Therapeutae" href="/wiki/Therapeutae"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Therapeutae</span></a>, described by the authors as teachers of the Buddhist <a title="Theravada" href="/wiki/Theravada"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Theravada</span></a> school then living in Judaea. They assert that Jesus lived the life of a Buddhist and taught Buddhist ideals to his disciples; their work follows in the footsteps of the Oxford New Testament scholar' Barnett Hillman Streeter, who established as early as the 1930s that the moral teaching of the <a title="Gautama Buddha" href="/wiki/Gautama_Buddha"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Buddha</span></a> has four remarkable resemblances to the Sermon on the Mount."<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Some scholars believe that Jesus may have been inspired by the Buddhist religion and that the <a title="Gospel of Thomas" href="/wiki/Gospel_of_Thomas"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Gospel of Thomas</span></a> and many <a title="Nag Hammadi library" href="/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Nag Hammadi</span></a> texts reflect this possible influence. Books such as <em>The Gnostic Gospels</em> and <em>Beyond Belief: the Secret Gospel of Thomas</em> by <a title="Elaine Pagels" href="/wiki/Elaine_Pagels"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Elaine Pagels</span></a> and <em>The Original Jesus</em> by Gruber and Kersten discuss these theories.</p>
              <p>In 1887 a Russian war correspondent, <a title="Nicolas Notovitch" href="/wiki/Nicolas_Notovitch"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Nicolas Notovitch</span></a>, visited India and Tibet. He claimed that, at the <a title="Hemis Monastery" href="/wiki/Hemis_Monastery"><span style="color: #0645ad;">lamasery or monastery of Hemis</span></a> in <a title="Ladakh" href="/wiki/Ladakh"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Ladakh</span></a>, he learned of the "Life of Saint Issa, Best of the Sons of Men." Issa is the Arabic name of Jesus. His story, with a translated text of the "Life of Saint Issa," was published in French in 1894 as <em>La vie inconnue de Jesus Christ</em>. It was subsequently translated into English, German, Spanish, and Italian.</p>
              <p>The "Life of Saint Issa, Best of the Sons of Men" purportedly recounts the travels of one known in the East as Saint Issa, whom Notovitch identified as Jesus. After initially doubting Notovitch, a disciple of Sri <a title="Ramakrishna" href="/wiki/Ramakrishna"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Ramakrishna</span></a>, <a title="Swami Abhedananda" href="/wiki/Swami_Abhedananda"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Swami Abhedananda</span></a>, journeyed to Tibet, investigated his claim, helped translate part of the document, and later championed his views.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Swami Satyasangananda conjectures that Jesus spent these eighteen years "growing in wisdom and stature" at <a title="Nalanda" href="/wiki/Nalanda"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Nalanda</span></a>, the ancient Indian university.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Notovitch's writings were immediately controversial. The German orientalist <a class="mw-redirect" title="Max Mueller" href="/wiki/Max_Mueller"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Max Mueller</span></a>, who'd never been to India himself, published a letter he'd received from a British colonial officer, which stated that the presence of Notovich in Ladakh was "not documented." <a class="mw-redirect" title="J.Archibald Douglas" href="/wiki/J.Archibald_Douglas"><span style="color: #0645ad;">J.Archibald Douglas</span></a>, then a teacher at the Government College in Agra also visited Hemis monastery in 1895, but claimed that he did not find any evidence that Notovich had even been there. The diary of Dr. Karl Rudolph Marx of the Ladane Charitable Dispensary, a missionary of the Order of the Moravian Brothers, and director of the hospital in Leh, clearly states that he treated Nicolas Novotich for a severe toothache in November 1887. However, Edgar J. Goodspeed in his book "Famous Biblical Hoaxes" claims that the head abbott of the Hemis community signed a document that denounced Notovitch as an outright liar; this claim has not been independently verified.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Despite this contradictory evidence, a number of authors have taken this information and have incorporated it into their own works. For example, in her book "The Lost Years of Jesus: Documentary Evidence of Jesus's 17-Year Journey to the East", <a title="Elizabeth Clare Prophet" href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Clare_Prophet"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Elizabeth Clare Prophet</span></a> asserts that Buddhist manuscripts provide evidence that Jesus traveled to India, Nepal, Ladakh and Tibet.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>According to Kersten, the Hindu <a title="Bhavishya Purana" href="/wiki/Bhavishya_Purana"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Bhavishyat Maha Purana</span></a>, in the Pratisargaarvan (19.17-32), a 19th century redaction of a text purporting to tell future events, describes the arrival of Jesus thus:</p>
              <dl><dd>"One day, Shalivahana, the chief of the Shakas, came to a snowy mountain (assumed to be in the Indian Himalayas). There, in the Land of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Huna (people)" href="/wiki/Huna_(people)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Hun</span></a> (= Ladakh, a part of the Kushan empire), the powerful king saw a handsome man sitting on a mountain, who seemed to promise auspiciousness. His skin was like copper and he wore white garments. The king asked the holy man who he was. The other replied: 'I am called Isaputra (son of God), born of a virgin, minister of the non-believers, relentlessly in search of the truth.' </dd></dl><dl><dd>O king, lend your ear to the religion that I brought unto the non-believers ... Through justice, truth, meditation, and unity of spirit, man will find his way to Isa (God, in Sanskrit) who dwells in the centre of Light, who remains as constant as the sun, and who dissolves all transient things forever. The blissful image of Isa, the giver of happiness, was revealed in the heart; and I was called Isa-Masih (Jesus the Messiah).'"<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></a></sup> </dd></dl>

              <p>Many people including Christians do not know that early Christianity taught reincarnation. Just search for "early Christianity and reincarnation", there will be many websites which tell you early Christianity taught reincarnation and why it is not stated in the bible at the later stage.

              <p>IMO, Jesus is the manifestation of God who shared His enlightenment insight of loving kindness. And in Buddhism, universal benevolence and wisdom of its emptiness is the manifestation of Buddha nature in all sentient beings. In this awareness, Jesus is Buddhism, whereas the pure nature of all living beings is God.</p>
