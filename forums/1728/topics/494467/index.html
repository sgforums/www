              souls </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pete Pattisson 15 August 2017 theguardian</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Critics allege that it is not just caste discrimination
              leading many Dalits in Nepal to turn away from Hindu beliefs and become
              Christians</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ram Maya Sunar had two miscarriages. Then she had a daughter,
              who died of pneumonia when she was one. “My second child died from tuberculosis
              at just six months. I’m still haunted by it,” Sunar says, sitting outside her
              concrete block hut in the village of Thakaldanda, in southern Nepal’s Makwanpur
              district.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When she became pregnant again, Sunar sought out an unlikely
              remedy. Rather than call the local shamans, as she had done before, she joined
              a church.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The 35-year-old, a Hindu, converted to Christianity and gave
              birth to a healthy daughter, and later a son. “They are my gifts from God,” she
              says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is a story repeated across Thakaldanda, a village of about
              50 households. “There’s a church here, and another church there, and another
              over there,” says Kajiman BK, who converted to Christianity after surviving an
              unknown disease.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ram Maya Sunar became a Christian after her two children died </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is not just survival stories that Sunar and Kajiman have
              in common. They are also Dalits (formerly “untouchables”), members of the
              lowest Hindu caste, who continue to suffer discrimination and abuse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is Dalits, and other marginalised groups, who are leading
              a surge in the growth of Christianity in Nepal. More than a million people in
              Nepal identify as Christians, and the country has one of the fastest growing
              Christian populations in the world. The Federation of National Christian Nepal
              says 65% of Christians are Dalits.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Nepal, formerly the only Hindu state in the world, became a
              secular republic following the 10-year civil war, and the fall of the monarchy
              in 2008. Hinduism remains the country’s dominant religion, but the transition
              to secularism opened up space for other religions, even though proselytising is
              outlawed in the constitution.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The growth of Christianity is driven by motivations that
              appear to have more to do with health, discrimination and poverty than pure
              belief. And behind the conversions, critics say, is the presence of well-funded
              foreign missionaries.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Off the main road of Manahari, a town in Makwanpur, dozens of
              small churches have sprung up. Local Christian pastors estimate the town has
              two mosques, five Buddhist gompas, 10 temples and 35 churches.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Many of the churches are led by Chepangs, one of Nepal’s most
              disadvantaged indigenous groups.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“After the earthquakes, Christian missions in Chepang areas
              became more and more active and the number of churches is dramatically
              increasing,” says Diana Riboli, an Italian anthropologist who has spent years
              researching Chepang shamanism in the area around Manahari. “Missionaries
              emphasise the healing aspect of Christianity, trying to put an end to the
              traditional rituals and charismatic power of shamans.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Riboli says conversions are “creating an alarming situation”
              in Chepang communities, where internal conflicts are becoming more frequent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Purna Bahadur Praja, a Chepang shaman, says many Chepangs are
              turning to Christianity just for the money. “They are greedy … after the
              earthquake, they got Bibles, rice, clothes, blankets, money to build churches.
              Pastors were getting motorbikes … They spend the whole time emailing foreigners
              to ask for money,” he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mahibal Praja, a Chepang pastor, vehemently denies this. In a
              small shop off the main road from where he runs a cable TV business, dusty
              monitors, coils of wire and soldering irons lie scattered across the shop.
              “Look at this. If I was making lots of money would I be working here?” he asks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">His church is a small building made of concrete blocks and
              corrugated iron. On Saturday morning, when Christians worship in Nepal, it is
              packed with more than 50 worshippers, sweating in the humid air.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mahibal gives an energetic sermon that seems to confirm Purna
              Bahadur’s accusation that there is some profiteering. “Many people are making
              money from Christianity, but they are not real Christians,” he shouts into the
              microphone, before closing the service in prayer. “This church needs a new
              building. God, please provide a nice building.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the nearby village of Ramantar, Dalit Christians already
              have that prayer answered; they worship in an airy two-storey building
              constructed with the support of American missionaries. The pastor, Jit Bahadur
              Sunar, says there are three other churches in the village. “Ten years ago there
              were just four or five Christian families here, but every day the number is
              increasing,” he says. “Virtually all the Dalits here are Christian.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Caste discrimination is the main reason Dalits are turning to
              Christianity, he says. “The higher castes in the village used to treat dogs
              better than us … and generally they still do. [Upper caste] priests refuse to
              do marriage or death rituals for Dalits, but among Christians there is no
              discrimination … we are all equal.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Hari Gopal Rimal, a local Hindu priest, accepts this.
              “Untouchability is a weakness in Hinduism … these things need to be changed,”
              he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But in the battle for souls, Rimal feels Hinduism is losing
              out to a more powerful force. “Different foreign organisations are providing
              funds when Christians are ill. And after the earthquake they provided help only
              to Christians. Bibles came in sacks of rice. Bibles came with everything … They
              are using money to promote Christianity and we have to compete with them.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Purna Bahadur Praja agrees. “I’m unhappy because they are
              forgetting their culture and rituals in the name of money, which they are
              getting from outside.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“If it continues like this, there will be no more Hindus in
              this town.”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I have read an article before where missionaries and
                      volunteer workers from resource rich churches outside of Nepal manage to
                      convert quite a lot of Tibetans soon after the last earthquake struck Nepal.
                      All that is needed is to provide them with a few goats or a buffalo and the
                      deal is done. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">I believe they know how to move very fast as is also the case
                      in Cambodia soon after the collapse of the Khmer Rouge regime and in Sri Lanka
                      after the tsunami struck Aceh in 2004. Very enterprising and certainly a very cheap
                      way of increasing your followings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And now we have the Pope looking at Myanmar and
                      Bangladesh this coming November.</span></p>
