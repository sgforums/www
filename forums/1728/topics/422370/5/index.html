              <p><strong>How A Dragon Girl Attained 'Instant'
              Buddhahood</strong></p>
              <p>In the Lotus Sutra, there is a section where Wisdom Accumulation
              Bodhisattva asks Manjushri Bodhisattva if there is anyone who
              could, through diligent vigour, swiftly cultivate the teachings in
              the same profound sutra to quickly attain
              Buddhahood. Manjushri Bodhisattva replied
              that <span style="color: #0000ff;">there is a Dragon King’s
              daughter, who is only eight years of age, who is able to practise
              all the teachings taught by the Buddha, who is able to, in an
              instant, aspire to Bodhicitta and attain irreversibility of
              spiritual progress</span>. Being compassionately mindful of all
              beings as if they were her children, her eloquence in teaching the
              Dharma is wondrous and her merits complete. Wisdom Accumulation
              Bodhisattva remarked that he had seen Shakyamuni Buddha practising
              the Dharma for the sake of limitless beings
              throughout immeasurable space and time without rest
              to attain Buddhahood, which makes it hard to believe that the girl
              could do likewise so soon. Just then, the girl appeared, bowed
              before them, and praised the magnificent form of the Buddha, which
              is complete with the thirty-two marks and
              eighty secondary characteristics of a great being, which
              shines in all directions and is honoured by all.<br> <br> Shariputra too exclaimed of the difficulty in believing the claim
              of her quick attainment of Buddhahood, as one with
              a female form cannot become a Brahma heaven king, Shakra
              (king of Trayastrimsa Heaven), a Mara king (of the Parinirmita
              Vasavartin Heaven), a Wheel-turning Sage king (who rules the world
              with the Dharma), and much less a Buddha (a Dharma King) – unless
              one has passed theough many eons to perfect the paramitas
              (perfections). <span style="color: #0000ff;">The Dragon Girl
              then offered a precious gem to the Buddha, asking if her offering
              was swift, to which Wisdom Accumulation and Shariputra agreed that
              it was. Next, she asked them to watch her become a Buddha in an
              even swifter manner.</span> At that moment, the entire
              assembly saw her suddenly transform into a man, perfect the
              Bodhisattva conduct, instantly going to a southern world,
              sitting upon a jewelled lotus and attaining Buddhahood, embodying
              the thirty-two marks and eighty secondary characteristics.
              There, she proclaimed the wonderful Dharma for many
              beings, who rejoiced and paid their respects. Hearing the
              Dharma, many aspired to Bodhicitta, attained irreversibility
              and received predictions of Buddhahood.<br> <br> This short teaching speaks against, at the same time, ageism,
              sexism, casteism, racism and speciesism. Despite being young,
              female, a non-brahmin (priests revered in ancient India as the
              ‘select few’ with higher spirituality), and a dragon (naga),
              the Dragon Girl was able to attain Buddhahood swiftly, by adhering
              to the great universal teachings of the Lotus Sutra. She
              herself attests to this very teaching against unjustified forms
              of discrimination by example. Even if there are
              relatively few like the Dragon Girl among us, it is true,
              nevertheless, that <span style="color: #0000ff;">anyone of any
              age, gender, social background, race or even kind, can attain
              Buddhahood. It all depends on how diligently one had been
              practising and realising the Dharma both in this life and in
              previous lives</span>. While it is true that Buddhas
              naturally arise from male forms, it is possible to
              instantaneously evolve to a male form within this life,
              also through diligence, as in the case of the Dragon Girl. Being
              born in Pure Land is also a fast way to relinquish gender
              limitations. This incident also subtly reminds us not to
              discriminate anyone, as anyone might be on the brink of
              Buddhahood, or even be the skilful manifestation of a
              Buddha!</p>

              <p>The reason was most of the societies then were patrilineal and agarian, where women are discriminated against. Women has always bore the brunt of raising the family, usually multitasking, in and out the household, leaving them little leisurely time.Things may have been different if it Buddhism were preached in a matrineal society.</p>

              <p>archive:<br>i watched <span style="font-style: italic;">a korean movie called "Little Monk". The little monk have been living in the monastery from very young, and the Abbot have to enforce the 5 precepts on the little monk. Little monk recite the sutras everyday. And since he still do not understand what's the use of keeping precepts and do not know the real meaning (ie unenlighten yet)... few occasions, the little monk broke the precepts such as hunting rabbits and lying to the Abbot. The Abbot keep scoding and even punish the little monk, but he still don't get it. Until the end of the story (bad ending), the little monk cannot tolerate the attitude of the Abbot and left the monastrey to seek for his mother, which he long for, when seeing other kids have a mother.<br><br>Now, it's the little monk wrong, due to his ignorance/habits/unenlightened nature?<br><br>we even as adults praxis are like the little monk, even though we recite /study the sutras and all, yet sometimes we still commit wrong, ...why? because we still are not enlightened. If we are enlightened, we would not be doing it.<br><br>In other word , are an unenlightened person wrong, because they are unenlighten?  no. <br>From this i no longer see that there's wrong in others even if they commit wrong, as they are not enlighten as yet, just like the little monk in the story.<br><br>Was touch by this realisation.</span><br><br>ps: now that's newer realisation regarding "If we are enlightened, we would not be doing it."

              </span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><strong><strong>(Part One) 1. Queen Maha Maya's Dream</strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">More than 2,500 years ago, there was a king called Suddhodana. He married a beautiful Koliyan princess named Maha Maya. The couple ruled over the Sakyas, a warrior tribe living next to the Koliya tribe, in the north of India, in what is now known as Nepal. The capital of the Sakya country was laid out across the foothills of the Himalayas and called Kapilavatthu.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Queen Maha Maya was the daughter of King Anjana of the Koliyas. Such was her beauty that the name Maya, meaning "vision" was given to her. But it was Maya's virtues and talents that were her most wonderful qualities, for she was endowed with the highest gifts of intelligence and piety. King Suddhodana was indeed worthy of his lovely wife. He himself was called "King of the Law" because he ruled according to the law. There was no other man among the Sakyas more honored and respected. The king was admired by his nobles and courtiers, as well as by the householders and merchants. Such was the noble family from which the Buddha was to arise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One full moon night, sleeping in the palace, the queen had a vivid dream. She felt herself being carried away by four devas (spirits) to Lake Anotatta in the Himalayas. After bathing her in the lake, the devas clothed her in heavenly cloths, anointed her with perfumes, and bedecked her with divine flowers. Soon after a white elephant, holding a white lotus flower in its trunk, appeared and went round her three times, entering her womb through her right side. Finally the elephant disappeared and the queen awoke, knowing she had been delivered an important message, as the elephant is a symbol of greatness in Nepal. The next day, early in the morning, the queen told the king about the dream. The king was puzzled and sent for some wise men to discover the meaning of the dream.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The wise men said, "Your Majesty, you are very lucky. The devas have chosen our queen as the mother of the Purest-One and the child will become a very great being." The king and queen were very happy when they heard this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">They were so pleased that they invited many of the noblemen in the country to the palace to a feast to tell them the good news. Even the needy were not forgotten. Food and clothes were given to the poor people in celebration. The whole kingdom waited eagerly for the birth of the new prince, and Queen Maya enjoyed a happy and healthy pregnancy, living a pure life for herself and her unborn child</span></p>

              </div>
              <p>Long ago, there lived a rich man in a city named Shravasti in the country of India. Because the rich man loved the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, he built a fine temple for the Buddha and his monks.  When the temple was finished, he invited them to come to live in the new temple. </p>
              <p>The Buddha and thousands of his monks began traveling toward the new temple in Shravasti.  The young monks went quickly and were soon ahead of the Buddha. </p>
              <p>The Buddha went slowly and peacefully, teaching and helping people along the way.  The senior monks Shariputra and Moggallana, who were also important Dharma teachers, traveled slowly beside the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Night came and the only place to sleep along the road was a small town.  All of the hundreds of young monks arrived there first.  They prepared a nice room for the Buddha, then settled down in all of the extra rooms and beds in the town and went to sleep.</p>
              </div>
              <p>When the senior monks arrived, all the rooms and beds in the town were already filled with younger monks.  There was no sleeping space inside for the senior monks, so they had to sleep outside under the trees.  Even Shariputra, who was the highest of all the senior monks, had to sleep outside.</p>
              <p>The Buddha saw that this was not right.  The next morning he called all of the monks together and asked them, “Which monks deserve to get the best rooms, the best food and the best water?” </p>
              <p>Some monks answered, “Those monks who came from a high class family should get the best things.”  Others said, “Those monks who have the most money.”  Others said “Those monks who are more educated.”  Others said, “Those monks who have done the most meditation.”  Others said, “Whoever gets there first.”</p>
              <p>The Buddha replied, “Oh Monks and everyone who follows my teachings: listen. Seniors should always go first.”  It is not good that last night Shariputra, who is the highest among the senior monks, and also the great Moggallana had to sleep outside while young monks slept inside on a bed.” </p>
              <p>The Buddha explained, “Even animals learned long ago that by showing respect to their seniors, their daily lives would be orderly and happy.  And because of the good deed of showing respect, after they die they will have a happy and higher next life. </p>
              <p>The monks said to the Buddha, “Please tell us more about the animals,” and the Buddha told this true story of long, long ago.</p>
              <p>Once upon a time, three animal friends lived by a large banyan tree: a bird, a monkey, and an elephant.  After a while, they stopped respecting each other and began to argue a lot.  “I’m first;” “No, me first;”  “You got the best one;” “I want that one.”  Thus it continued day and night.   </p>
              <p>The three friends knew that this wasn’t good and tried to figure out how to solve their problem.  They thought that if they knew who is the oldest, they could each show respect to the older ones.  But because animals don’t know their birthdays, they didn’t know who of the three was older.</p>
              <p> Then the animals had an idea.  They said to each other, “Oh friends, let’s measure our age by the size of this great banyan tree. How big was this tree when you remember it first?” </p>
              <p>The elephant said, “I remember this tree when it was only as big as a bush.  When I was a baby, I walked over it and it tickled my stomach.” </p>
              <p>The monkey said, “I remember when the tree was even smaller.  I remember when I was a baby monkey, I sat down and the leaves on the top just touched my nose.  I ate the little leaves on the tiny treetop.”</p>
              <p>The bird said, “Friends, long ago there was a great banyan tree not far from here.  I ate the seeds from it, and pooped a white speck at this very spot.  The seeds in that speck sprouted and grew and became a tiny tree, which has now grown into this large banyan tree.  So because I knew this tree before it was born, I am older than both of you.”</p>
              <p>The monkey and the elephant said, “Oh bird friend, now we know that you are the oldest.  From now on, we will respect you, so you should go first.  As you are older and wiser, please give us advice, and we will listen to you.”    </p>
              <p>Then the elephant said to the monkey, “Oh monkey friend, as you are older than I, you should go before me and I because I am the youngest I will go last.</p>
              <p>Then because he was senior, the bird gave good advice to the monkey and the elephant.  He advised them to do good things and not to do any bad things.  The bird also did his best to follow his own advice. </p>
              <p>After the three animal friends began to respect each other in this way, their daily life became peaceful and happy.  They lived harmoniously together for many years.  After they died, they were born again as humans in a better life.</p>
              <p>After the story was finished, the Buddha said to the monks, “Long ago these three animal friends learned how to live together happily by respecting those who were older.  From now on, you should respect those who are senior to you.  Speak politely to them, listen to their advice and always give them the best rooms, best food and best water.  By doing this, you will follow my teachings.”  Then the Buddha said:</p>

They came from different cultivation schools and had their<br>own methods of cultivation. Among them, there were two people who<br>followed the same master but, because of the difference in their<br>understandings, they each had a different way of cultivation. They kept<br>their cultivation to themselves and didn't interfere with the other.<br>The older disciple concentrated on cultivating blessings and did not<br>pay much attention to cultivating wisdom, and the younger disciple only<br>emphasized the cultivation of wisdom while not paying attention to the<br>cultivation of blessings. Because the older disciple only pursued<br>cultivation of blessings but not wisdom, he remained muddle-headed and<br>unable to distinguish the good from bad throughout his whole life. As a<br>result, he didn't even reach the beginning fruit status of Xu Tuo Heng<br>Guo and stayed ignorant.<br><br><br><br>On the other hand, the younger disciple only recognized the importance<br>of wisdom and thought that wisdom was like a person's eyes; if he lost<br>them, he would be blind and surely be in danger. Therefore, he<br>wholeheartedly cultivated for wisdom, yet neglected the importance of<br>accumulating virtue. Later on, he cultivated diligently and reached the<br>fruit status of Arhat. <br><br><br><br>By that time, the older disciple had already passed away due to his old<br>age. The younger disciple went to the city. He wanted to spread the Fa<br>to more beings in the city. But because he hadn't accumulated any<br>blessings in life, not even one person was willing to offer him alms.<br>Although he told people that he had enlightened at the level of Arhat,<br>there was still no one who bothered to pay attention to him. Because he<br>did not pay attention to cultivation of blessings, how could he receive<br>any offerings and respect from people? <br><br><br><br>So, he came to the royal palace. In front of its magnificent entrance,<br>he suddenly saw a white elephant that wore many beautiful pearls, jades<br>and colorful jewels. It leisurely walked around the palace and looked<br>proud. Upon entering tranquility and observing, the younger disciple<br>found that the white elephant was originally the elder disciple who had<br>cultivated solely for blessings. <br><br><br><br>The younger disciple became quite moved and sighed, "My fellow disciple<br>cultivated solely for blessings. He ended up becoming an elephant<br>covered in jewels. On the other hand, I have cultivated only wisdom and<br>not blessings, and end up finding it so difficult to survive. It shows<br>that a cultivator should cultivate both wisdom and blessings." <br><br><br><br>Translated from: <a style="color: #16387c; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.zhengjian.org/zj/articles/2006/7/14/38352.html">http://www.zhengjian.org/zj/articles/2006/7/14/38352.html</a></p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The paratrooper got so scared that he forgot to pull his rip cord. So he said, "Buddha oh Buddha," and a hand came out and saved him.</p>

The car hit and killed the dog. The monk looked around and seeing a temple, went to knock on the door. A monk opened the door.

She was riding with another woman friend in a rickshaw-like carriage, when they were attacked by a man on the street. In the end, the attacker only succeeded in frightening the women, but the Buddhist woman was quite upset by the event and told her teacher so. She asked him what she should have done - what would have been the appropriate, Buddhist response.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The teacher said very simply, "You should have very mindfully and with great compassion whacked the attacker over the head with your umbrella."</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Three monks decided to practise meditation together. they sat by the side of a lake and closed their eyes in concentration. Then suddenly, the first one stood up and said, "I forgot my mat." He steeped miraculously onto the water in front of him and walked across the lake to their hut on the other side.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">When he returned, the second monk stood up and said, "I forgot to put my the other underwear to dry." He too walked calmly across the water and returned the same way. The third monk watched the first two carefully in what he decided must be the test of his own abilities. "Is your learning so superior to mine? I too can match any feat you two can perform," he declared loudly and rushed to the water's edge to walk across it. He promptly fell into the deep water.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Undeterred, the yogi climbed out of the water and tried again, only to sink into the water. Yet again he climbed out and yet again he tried, each time sinking into the water. This went on for some time as the other two monks watched.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">After a while, the second monk turned to the first and said, "Do you think we should tell him where the stones are?"</p>

On our 1 1/2 hour journey home, I spoke to him about the importance of moderation.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">After thinking for sometime, Ian said, "Dad, I have a story that I just made up."</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">"There were these two Buddhist monks who had about 13 beers each. One had to walk home quite some distance.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">'Will you be all right to walk home?', the one asked</p>

Staring hopelessly at the great obstacle in front of him , he pondered for hours on just how to cross such a wide barrier. Just as he was about to give up his pursuit to continue his journey he saw a great teacher on the other side of the river. The young Buddhist yells over to the teacher "Oh wise one , can you tell me how to get to the other side of this river"?</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The teacher ponders for a moment  looks up and down the river and yells back "My son, you are on the other side" .</p>

              <p>In a time long past, there was an old monk who, through diligent practice, had attained a certain degree of spiritual penetration.</p>
              <p>"He had a young novice who was about eight years old. One day the monk looked at the boy's face and saw there that he would die within the next few months. Saddened by this, he told the boy to take a long holiday and go and visit his parents. 'Take your time,' said the monk. 'Don't hurry back.' For he felt the boy should be with his family when he died. Three months later, to his astonishment, the monk saw the boy walking back up the mountain. When he arrived he looked intently at his face and saw that they boy would now live to a ripe old age. 'Tell me everything that happened while you were away,' said the monk. So the boy started to tell of his journey down from the mountain. He told of villages and towns he passed through, of rivers forded and mountains climbed. Then he told how one day he came upon a stream in flood. He noticed, as he tried to pick his way across the flowing stream, that a colony of ants had become trapped on a small island formed by the flooding stream. Moved by compassion for these poor creatures, he took a branch of a tree and laid it across one flow of the stream until it touched the little island. As the ants made their way across, the boy held the branch steady, until he was sure all the ants had escaped to dry land. Then he went on his way. 'So,' thought the old monk to himself, 'that is why the gods have lengthened his days.'</p>

lectured on the Dharma in Balrampur, all<br>people in the city became noble, polite and wise.  They respected<br>and helped each other.  Balrampur was almost like paradise.<br><br><br><br>A non-Buddhist heard about this.  He traveled a long way to<br>Balrampur to visit Shakyamuni to ask for guidance.  However, on<br>his journey he came across something he couldn't understand.<br><br><br><br>Balrampur was in the tropical area.  There were many poisonous<br>snakes.   When he was outside of the city of Balrampur, he<br>saw a father and a son working in the field.  Suddenly a poisonous<br>snake came out from the grass and bit the son.  The son died<br>shortly afterwards.  The father was still working as usual. <br>He didn't seem to be affected by the death of his son.<br><br><br><br>The non-Buddhist was surprised.  He asked the old man:  "Who is this young man?" <br><br><br><br>"My son."  <br><br><br><br>"Your son just died.  Why you are not sad at all?  You still work as normal.  Is he not your son by blood?"<br><br><br><br>"What for?  Death is an element in life.  The prosperity and<br>withering of things has its own clock.  Now that the person is<br>dead, if he is kind, there will be kind arrangements for him.  If<br>bad elements in his life have matured, he will experience retribution<br>right away.  What good can I do to the dead person if I<br>cry?"  The old man looked at the stunned non-Buddhist and asked<br>him:  "Are you going into the city?  Can I ask you a favor?"<br><br><br><br>The non-Buddhist said OK.  The old man continued:  "When you<br>pass by the second house on the right after you enter the city, please<br>tell my family that I only need one lunch and that my son is dead after<br>being bitten by a poisonous snake."<br><br><br><br>The non-Buddhist felt very surprised.  How come the old man is so<br>cruel?  His son died.  He wasn't sad at all.  Moreover,<br>he didn't forget his lunch.  How come a father can be so cold?<br><br><br><br>The non-Buddhist found the old man's house.  He told the old<br>woman: "Your son has been bitten to death by a snake.  The father<br>asked me to pass the message to you that he only needed one<br>lunch."  The old woman thanked the non-Buddhist but didn't show<br>any sorrow.  The non-Buddhist asked, "Aren't you sad about your<br>son's death?"<br><br><br><br>The old woman said, "This son came to my family out of his own<br>will.  I didn't ask him to come.  Now he is gone.  I<br>cannot keep him.  We are like travelers spending the night at the<br>same inn.  The next day, all of us leave for our own paths. <br>No one can keep anyone else.  In fact, there's no need to keep any<br>one.  It is the same between my son and me.  I cannot direct<br>my son's coming and going.  It follows his karmic predestined<br>relationship."  The non-Buddhist heard this and thought that the<br>couple was truly cold-blooded.<br><br><br><br>At this moment, the sister came out from the house.  The<br>non-Buddhist asked her, "Your younger brother is dead.  Are you<br>sad?"<br><br><br><br>"He's already dead.  Why should I be sad?  We are like logs<br>tied into a raft.  We are sailing together in the water. <br>When a big storm comes, the raft falls apart.  Each log follows<br>its own way with the current.  The logs cannot be combined<br>together any more.  We have become sister and brother due to<br>random reasons and have come to the same family.  However, life is<br>different for everyone.  There isn't a set time for life and<br>death.  He has left before I do.  What can I do as a sister?"<br><br><br><br>When the sister has just finished talking, another woman in the house said, "Oh, my husband is dead."<br><br><br><br>The non-Buddhist was even confused.  He asked the woman: <br>"your husband is dead.  How can you act like nothing has<br>happened?  Are you truly indifferent in your heart?"<br><br><br><br>The wife said calmly:  "Our marriage is like flying birds in the<br>sky.  They rest together at night.  They go out their own<br>ways to find food at the next dawn.  Every one has each one's<br>destiny.  It is his fortune that he doesn't have to come back once<br>he flies.  I cannot replace him.  I cannot bear his karma for<br>him.  We are like people who get to know each other on our<br>journey.  We have to go our own ways sooner or later."<br><br><br><br>Upon hearing this, the non-Buddhist was very angry.  He even<br>regretted that he had traveled a long way there.  He thought he<br>would be able to find the truth because he heard people in Balrampur<br>were most loyal to their family members.  He didn't anticipate<br>that they were so cold-blooded.<br><br><br><br>Even so, he wanted to meet with Shakyamuni.  After all, it would<br>be rather pitiful to go back without meeting the Buddha.  After he<br>met with Shakyamuni, he didn't ask any questions.  However,<br>Shakyamuni read his mind and asked, "What has made you so sad?"<br><br><br><br>The non-Buddhist said, "Because my hope didn't turn out to be<br>true.  Things I encountered are against my will.  Therefore<br>I'm sad."<br><br><br><br>"Sadness doesn't solve problems.  You can simply tell me what you<br>are sad about."  Shakyamuni said to him compassionately.<br><br><br><br>"I came from a faraway place because I learned that people in Balrampur<br>have heard your Dharma and are kind.  However, once I arrived, I<br>came across this ridiculous thing..."  The non-Buddhist told the<br>story of the farmer family to Shakyamuni.  He thought that the<br>farmer family didn't have any love not to mention compassion.  He<br>didn't think this kind of things should happen in a Buddhist country.<br><br><br><br>Shakyamuni smiled and said to him, "It's not necessarily so.  What<br>you wanted to hear and see was things within the principle of the human<br>world.  However, sometimes the Dharma doesn't have to follow the<br>human nature.  Cultivation is purifying the human nature and<br>corresponding to the truth.  The family you met wasn't wrong on<br>the principle.  They knew that they couldn't forever keep their<br>human flesh.  When a person dies, everyone cries loudly for<br>him.  What good does it do to the dead person?  Moreover,<br>life has birth and death.  Happiness at birth and sadness at death<br>are signs of the confusion that the secular world has towards life and<br>death.  The circle of life and death never stops."<br><br><br><br>After hearing the guidance from the Buddha, the non-Buddhist suddenly<br>understood.  From then on, he converted to Buddhism and became a<br>diligent monk.<br><br><br><br>Translated from:  <br><br><a style="color: #16387c; font-weight: normal; text-decoration:

              <p>ANIMALS GO TO HEAVEN<br><br>The Buddha teaching is unique amongst the world religions: it is not only for humans and gods; it is also for animals. There are numerous stories that relate how animals who associate with good humans or are well treated, go to heaven after they die.<br><br>The first example is that of the Bodhisattva’s HORSE Kanthaka. The Introduction to the Jataka Commentary (which is one of the earliest records we have of the Buddha’s early life) tells us how when the Bodhisattva Siddhattha renounces the world, his horse Kanthaka is so deeply saddened that he dies broken-hearted, but obviously with a wholesome last thought-moment. He is reborn as the deva Kanthaka in the heaven of the Thirty-three Gods (Sakra’s heaven).<br><br>The next famous animal story is found in the story of the Buddha’s solitary retreat in the Parileyya. The Vinaya (V 1:337-357) records how in the 10th year of the ministry, when a dispute arises amongst the monks of Kosambi who even tell the Buddha off when he tries to counsel them. After trying hard to reconcile them and failing, he quietly leaves for a solitary retreat in the Parileyya forest where he is attended by a like-minded ELEPHANT (he leaves his own tribe for the joy of solitude). Watching how the Buddha prepares warm water every morning the elephant Parileyyaka himself prepares it for the Buddha. He also offers the Buddha wild fruits and takes care of his robe and bowl.<br><br>A MONKEY, watching the elephant, offers the Buddha a honeycomb. Later, however, in his excitement, the monkey falls on a sharp stump, immediately dies and is reborn in the heaven of the Thirty-three Gods. So too the elephant, who becomes the deva Parileyyaka. This full story is given in the Dhammapada Commentary (see “Buddhist Legends,” book 1 story 5).<br><br>Then there is the well known story of the FROG deva in the Vimana Vatthu (Vv 852-88). It is said that once a frog sits listening to the Buddha teaching. Although not knowing human language, it is captivated by the Buddha’s soothing voice. As he listens entranced, a farmer, leaning on his pole, immediately pierces him to death. The frog is reborn in the heaven of the Thirty-three as Manduka Deva (the frog deity). He appears before the Buddha in all his glory to sing his praises. (The full story is given in the Vimana Vatthu Commentary: see “The Minor Anthologies” vol 4 pages 102 f.)<br><br>One of the longest stories in world literature, that is, the Udena cycle, found in the Dhammapada Commentary (book 2 story 1). It is actually a cycle of nested stories spanning many lives leading to the Buddha’s time. In one of the stories, during a plague, a poor luckless wandering man named Kotuhalaka reaches a herdsman house and is given some food. The herdsman feeds his DOG with the same food. Kotuhalaka looks with envy at the dog. That night, Kotuhalaka dies from over-eating, and his thinking about the dog leads him to be reborn as the bitch’s puppy.<br><br>Now, a pratyeka Buddha (a solitary fully self-awakened Buddha who does not establish his teaching) regularly comes to the house for alms, and the dog (Kotuhalaka) takes a liking to him. When the pratyeka-buddha finally leaves, the dog is saddened and dies. The commentators remarks that dogs, unlike humans, are straightforward and lack deceit. So upon dying, he is reborn in the heaven of the Thirty-three as a deva.<br><br>One of the most famous animal stories is that of the Abhidhamma bats. The Dhammapada story (book 14 story 2) tells us in an interesting aside, that 500 youths, witnessing the Buddha perform the twin wonder (a miracle of fire and water radiating from his body), decide to go forth under Sâriputta. It is said that in Kassapa Buddha’s time, they were BATS living in a cave where two monks were reciting the Abhidhamma. So enthralled were they by their sound, although not knowing its meaning, they pass away into the heavens, and are reborn in Sâvatthî. (See “Buddhist Legends” 3:51 f)</p>

But, because in a previous existence in the time of Kassapa Buddha <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a> had made fun of a Bhikkhu who was very <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dull</span></strong>, he was born a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>dullard</strong></span> in the present existence. He could not even memorize one verse in four months. <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/maha/mahapanthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Mahapanthaka</span></span></a> was very disappointed with his younger brother and even told him that he was not worthy of the Order.<br><br>About that time, Jivaka came to the monastery to invite the <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/b/buddha.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Buddha</span></span></a> and the resident Bhikkhus to his house for a meal. <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/maha/mahapanthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Mahapanthaka</span></span></a>, who was then in charge of assigning the Bhikkhus to meal invitations, left out <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a> from the list.

Knowing his intention, the <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/b/buddha.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Buddha</span></span></a> took him along and made him sit in front of the Gandhakuti hall. He then gave a clean piece of cloth to <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a> and told him to sit there facing east and rub the piece of cloth. At the same time he was to repeat the word "Rajoharanam", which means "taking on impurity." The <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/b/buddha.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Buddha</span></span></a> then went to the residence of Jivaka, accompanied by the Bhikkhus.<br><br>Meanwhile, <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a> went on rubbing the piece of cloth, all the time muttering the word "Rajoharanam". Very soon, the cloth became soiled. Seeing this change in the condition of the cloth, <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a> came to realize the impermanent nature of all conditioned things. From the house of Jivaka, the <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/b/buddha.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Buddha</span></span></a> through super normal power learnt about the progress of <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a>. He sent forth his radiance so that (to <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a>) the <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/b/buddha.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Buddha</span></span></a> appeared to be sitting in front of him, saying:<br><br>"It is not the piece of cloth alone that is made dirty by the dust; within oneself also there exist the dust of passion (raga), the dust of ill will (dosa), and the dust of ignorance (moha), i.e., the ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. Only by removing these could one achieve one's goal and attain Arahatship". <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a> got the message and kept on meditating and in a short while attained Arahatship, together with Analytical <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/wtb/u_v/vipassanaa.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Insight</span></span></a>. Thus, <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a> ceased to be a dullard.<br><br>At the house of Jivaka, they were about to pour libation water as a mark of donation; but the<br>Buddha covered the bowl with his hand and asked if there were any Bhikkhus left at the<br>monastery. On being answered that there were none, the <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/b/buddha.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Buddha</span></span></a> replied that there was one and directed them to fetch <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a> from the monastery. When the messenger from the house of Jivaka arrived at the monastery he found not only one Bhikkhu, but a thousand identical Bhikkhus.<br>They all have been created by <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a>, who by now possessed supernormal powers The messenger was baffled and he turned back and reported the matter to Jivaka. The messenger was sent to the monastery for the second time and was instructed to say that the Buddha summoned the Bhikkhu by the name of <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a>. But when he delivered the message, a thousand voices responded, "I am <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a>." Again baffled, he turned back for the second time. Then he was sent to the monastery, for the third time. This time, he was instructed to get hold of the Bhikkhu who first said that he was <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a>. As soon as he got hold of that Bhikkhu all the rest disappeared, and <a href="http://what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Culapanthaka</span></span></a> accompanied the messenger to the house of Jivaka.

              <p style="font-family: Verdana; color: #999999; font-size: 11px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Ahimsaka was a bright and obedient student, well loved by his teacher. His classmates soon became jealous of him and started a rumor that he was having an affair with their teacher’s wife. At first the teacher refused to listen to any of the gossip, but slowly became convinced that, indeed, his favorite student was deceiving him behind his back.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana; color: #999999; font-size: 11px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">He became so angry that he wanted to kill Ahimsaka, but a teacher killing a student was really out of the question. He then devised a plan that he hoped would not only bring harm to Ahimsaka but satisfy his vengeance as well.<br><br>The teacher went and told Ahimsaka that he had some special knowledge which he wanted to impart to him. First, however, he was to go out and kill a thousand people, and to prove that he had really done so, he was to bring back the right index finger of each one of his victims.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana; color: #999999; font-size: 11px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Ahimsaka was very unwilling to kill anyone, but because he badly wanted to have his teacher’s special knowledge, and because he trusted his teacher so much, he decided to set out and do as his teacher required. Soon Ahimsaka had so many index fingers that he did not know just how many he actually had, so he started to keep them strung around his neck in order not to lose count.  Because of this morbid habit, he became known as Angulimala, which meant “garland of fingers.”<br><br>When Angulimala’s notoriety reached the courts of the palace, the king immediately sent out a warrant for his capture. Angulimala’s mother, in the meantime, went out into the forest to look for him and warn him about the warrant. When the Buddha got wind of this, he realized what might happen to her should she find her son first, for Angulimala was already wearing 999 fingers around his neck and was eager to get the last and final one to complete his garland.  <br><br>To prevent Angulimala from killing his own mother, the Buddha went and appeared before him. When Angulimala saw the Buddha, he was delighted, thinking that he had at last found his last and final finger. With dagger drawn high, he ran in haste after the Buddha. To his consternation, however, he discovered that no matter how fast he ran, he was not able to catch up with the Buddha.<br><br>He yelled for the Buddha to stop but the Buddha replied, “Angulimala, I’ve already stopped. It is you who have not stopped.” <br><br>Angulimala did not understand what the Buddha meant. The Buddha then told him, “I have stopped because I have stopped killing all living beings and have established myself in universal love. But, you, you have yet to do so.” Realizing that it was the Buddha himself who was addressing him, he threw away his dagger and asked to be admitted into the Order.<br><br>When the king and his men found Angulimala in the monastery of the Buddha, they decided to leave him alone, for they saw that he had given up his old evil ways. Angulimala then continued to live under the Buddha’s guidance and eventually became a saint. When he finally passed away, he realized Parinibbana.<br><br>The other monks asked the Buddha how a man who had murdered so many people could realize Parinibbana. The Buddha replied that Angulimala had previously done much evil because he lacked good friends. Later, however, because he found good friends who helped him and advised him rightly, he was able to become steadfast and mindful in his practice of the Dhamma and finally attain enlightenment. Therefore his evil deeds had been overwhelmed with good.<br><br><em>He who overwhelms with good the evil that he has done lights up this world as does the moon freed from the clouds.</em></span></p>

              <p>"Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty went to meditate with Ch'an Master Foyin at Golden Mountain Temple. After Su Dongpo had experienced a total relaxation of body and mind, he asked Ch'an Master Foyin, "Master, what do you think of my sitting posture?"</p>
              <p>"Very magnificent. Like a Buddha!"</p>
              <p>Su Dongpo was very delighted to hear that. Master Foyin then asked him, "Scholar, what do you think of my sitting posture then?"</p>
              <p>Su Dongpo, never giving up any chance to tease and jeer at Master Foyin, immediately replied, "Like a pile of bullsh**." Master Foyin was very delighted to hear the answer and did not utter another word.</p>
              <p>Su Dongpo thought he had beaten Master Foyin because the Master was wordless while being compared to a pile of bullsh**. He was so proud of himself that he told everyone he met, "Today I won."</p>
              <p>This news soon reached Su's sister Su Xiaomei. She asked him, "Brother, how was it that you beat Master today?" Su repeated the whole story vividly to his sister. Su Xiaomei, talented and smart as she was, told Su Dongpo straight to his face, "Brother, you actually lost. It is because Master's mind is actually that of a Buddha that he could see you as a Buddha. <strong>As your mind is like a pile of bullsh**, you, of course, saw him as a pile of bullsh**."</strong> Su Dongpo, realizing his Chan practice was far inferior to Master Foyin's, was speechless.<br><br>Moral: Ch'an does not depend on knowledge but upon the capacity to awake. Ch'an is not about eloquent debate but intuitive wisdom. Don't think all Ch'an masters handle encounters with sharp words. Sometimes, when they are silent and don't communicate via words and language, they can still utter the same deafening Dharma sounds."</p>

              THE RECORD OF THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF WU-MING
              
              Compiled by Master Tung-Wang
              Abbott of Han-hsin monastery in the
              Thirteenth year of the Earth Dragon period (898)
              
              My dear friend, the most reverend master Tung-Wang,
              
              Old and ill, I lay here knowing that writing this note will be my last act upon this earth and that by the time you read it I will be gone from this life.
              
              Though we have not seen each other in the many years since we studied together under our most venerable Master, I have often thought of you, his most worthy successor. Monks from throughout China say that you are a true lion of the Buddha Dharma; one whose eye is a shooting star, whose hands snatch lightning, and whose voice booms like thunder. It is said that your every action shakes heaven and earth and causes the elephants and dragons of delusion to scatter helplessly. I am told that your monastery is unrivaled in severity, and that under your exacting guidance hundreds of monks pursue their training with utmost zeal and vigor. I've also heard that in the enlightened successor department your luck has not been so good. Which brings me to the point of this letter.
              
              I ask that you now draw your attention to the young man to whom this note is attached. As he stands before you, no doubt smiling stupidly as he stuffs himself with pickled cucumbers, you may be wondering if he is as complete a fool as he appears, and if so, what prompted me to send him to you. In answer to the first question, I assure you that Wu-Ming's foolishness is far more complete than mere appearance would lead you to believe. As for the second question, I can only say that despite so benumbed a condition, or perhaps because of it, still more likely, despite of and because of it, Wu-Ming seems to unwittingly and accidentally serve the function of a great Bodhisattva. Perhaps he can be of service to you.
              
              Allow him sixteen hours of sleep daily and provide him with lots of pickled cucumbers and Wu-Ming will always be happy. Expect nothing of him and you will be happy.
              
              Respectfully, Chin-Mang
              
              After Chin-mang's funeral, the supporters of his temple arranged for Wu-Ming's journey to Han-hsin monastery, where I resided, then, as now, as Abbott. A monk found Wu-ming at the monastery gate and seeing a note bearing my name pinned to his robe, led him to my quarters.
              
              Customarily, when first presenting himself to the Abbott, a newly arrived monk will prostrate himself three times and ask respectfully to be accepted as a student. And so I was taken somewhat by surprise when Wu-ming walked into the room, took a pickled cucumber from the jar under his arm, stuffed it whole into his mouth, and happily munching away, broke into the toothless imbecilic grin that would one day become legendary. Taking a casual glance around the room, he smacked his lips loudly and said, "What's for lunch?"
              
              After reading dear old Chin Mang's note, I called in the head monk and asked that he show my new student to the monk's quarters. When they had gone I reflected on chin-mang's words. Han-hsin was indeed a most severe place of training: winters were bitterly cold and in summer the sun blazed. The monks slept no more than three hours each night and ate one simple meal each day. For the remainder of the day they worked hard around the monastery and practiced hard in the meditation hall. But, alas, Chin-mang had heard correctly, Among all my disciples there was none whom I felt confident to be a worthy vessel to receive the untransmittable transmitted Dharma. I was beginning to despair that I would one day, bereft of even one successor, fail to fulfill my obligation of seeing my teacher's Dharma-linage continued.
              
              The monks could hardly be faulted for complacency or indolence. Their sincere aspiration and disciplined effort were admirable indeed, and many had attained great clarity of wisdom. But they were preoccupied with their capacity for harsh discipline and proud of their insight. They squabbled with one another for positions of prestige and power and vied amongst themselves for recognition. Jealousy, rivalry and ambition seemed to hang like a dark cloud over Han-shin monastery, sucking even the most wise and sincere into its obscuring haze. Holding Chin-mang's note before me, I hoped and prayed that this Wu-ming, this "accidental Bodhisattva" might be the yeast my recipe seemed so much in need of.
              
              To my astonished pleasure, Wu-ming took to life at Han-shin like a duck to water. At my request, he was assigned a job in the kitchen pickling vegetables. This he pursued tirelessly, and with a cheerful earnestness he gathered and mixed ingredients, lifted heavy barrels, drew and carried water, and, of course, freely sampled his workmanship. He was delighted!
              
              When the monks assembled in the meditation hall, they would invariably find Wu-ming seated in utter stillness, apparently in deep and profound samadhi. No one even guessed that the only thing profound about Wu-ming's meditation was the profound unlikelihood that he might find the meditation posture, legs folded into the lotus position, back erect and centered, to be so wonderfully conducive to the long hours of sleep he so enjoyed.
              
              Day after day and month after month, as the monks struggled to meet the physical and spiritual demands of monastery life, Wu-ming, with a grin and a whistle, sailed through it all effortlessly. Even though, if the truth be told, Wu-ming's Zen practice was without the slightest merit, by way of outward appearance he was judged by all to be a monk of great accomplishment and perfect discipline. Of course . I could have dispelled this misconception easily enough, but I sensed that Wu-ming's unique brand of magic was taking effect and I was not about to throw away this most absurdly skillful of means.
              
              By turns the monks were jealous, perplexed, hostile, humbled and inspired by what they presumed to be Wu-ming's great attainment. Of course it never occurred to Wu-ming that his or anyone else's behavior required such judgments, for they are the workings of a far more sophisticated nature than his own mind was capable. Indeed, everything about him was so obvious and simple that others thought him unfathomably subtle.
              
              Wu-ming's inscrutable presence had a tremendously unsettling effect on the lives of the monks, and undercut the web of rationalizations that so often accompanies such upset. His utter obviousness rendered him unintelligible and immune to the social pretensions of others. Attempts of flattery and invectives alike were met with the same uncomprehending grin, a grin the monks felt to be the very cutting edge of the sword of Perfect Wisdom. Finding no relief or diversion in such interchange, they were forced to seek out the source and resolution of their anguish each within his own mind. More importantly, and absurdly, Wu-ming caused to arise in the monks the unconquerable determination to fully penetrate the teaching "The Great Way is without difficulty" which they felt he embodied.
              
              Though in the course of my lifetime I have encountered many of the most venerable progenitors of the Tathagata's teaching, never have I met one so skilled at awakening others to their intrinsic Buddhahood as this wonderful fool Wu-ming. His spiritual non-sequiturs were as sparks, lighting the flame of illuminating wisdom in the minds of many who engaged him in dialogue.
              
              Once a monk approached Wu-ming and asked in all earnestness, "In the whole universe, what is it that is most wonderful?" Without hesitation Wu-ming stuck a cucumber before the monks face and exclaimed, "There is nothing more wonderful than this!" At that the monk crashed through the dualism of subject and object, "The whole universe is pickled cucumber; a pickled cucumber is the whole universe!" Wu-ming simply chuckled and said, "Stop talking nonsense. A cucumber is a cucumber; the whole universe is the whole universe. What could be more obvious?" The monk, penetrating the perfect phenomenal manifestation of Absolute Truth, clapped his hands and laughed, saying, "Throughout infinite space, everything is deliciously sour!"
              
              On another occasion a monk asked Wu-ming, "The Third Patriarch said, "The Great Way is without difficulty, just cease having preferences." How can you then delight in eating cucumbers, yet refuse to even take one bit of a carrot?" Wu-ming said, "I love cucumbers; I hate carrots!" The monk lurched back as though struck by a thunderbolt. Then laughing and sobbing and dancing about he exclaimed, "Liking cucumbers and hating carrots is without difficulty, just cease preferring the Great Way!"
              
              Within three years of his arrival, the stories of the "Great Bodhisattva of Han-hsin monastery" had made their way throughout the provinces of China. Knowing of Wu-ming's fame I was not entirely surprised when a messenger from the Emperor appeared summoning Wu-ming to the Imperial Palace immediately.
              
              From throughout the Empire exponents of the Three Teachings of Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism were being called to the Capitol, there the Emperor would proclaim one to be the true religion to be practiced and preached in all lands under his rule. The idea of such competition for Imperial favor is not to my approval and the likelihood that a religious persecution might follow troubled me greatly. But an order from the Emperor is not to be ignored, so Wu-ming and I set out the next day.
              
              Inside the Great Hall were gathered the more than one hundred priests and scholars who were to debate one another. They were surrounded by the most powerful lords in all China, along with innumerable advisors, of the Son of Heaven. All at once trumpets blared, cymbals crashed, and clouds of incense billowed up everywhere. The Emperor, borne on by a retinue of guards, was carried to the throne. After due formalities were observed the Emperor signaled for the debate to begin.
              
              Several hours passed as one after another priests and scholars came forward presenting their doctrines and responding to questions. Through it all Wu-ming sat obliviously content as he stuffed himself with his favorite food. When his supply was finished, he happily crossed his legs, straightened his back and closed his eyes. But the noise and commotion were too great and, unable to sleep, he grew more restless and irritable by the minute. As I clasped him firmly by the back of the neck in an effort to restrain him, the Emperor gestured to Wu-ming to approach the Throne.
              
              When Wu-ming had come before him, the Emperor said, "Throughout the land you are praised as a Bodhisattva whose mind is like the Great Void itself, yet you have not had a word to offer this assembly. Therefore I say to you now, teach me the True Way that all under heaven must follow." Wu-ming said nothing. After a few moments the Emperor, with a note of impatience, spoke again, "Perhaps you do not hear well so I shall repeat myself! Teach me the True Way that all under heaven must follow!" Still Wu-ming said nothing, and silence rippled through the crowd as all strained forward to witness this monk who dared behave so bold a fashion in the Emperor's presence.
              
              Wu-ming heard nothing the Emperor said, nor did he notice the tension that vibrated through the hall. All that concerned him was his wish to find a nice quiet place where he could sleep undisturbed. The Emperor spoke again, his voice shaking with fury, his face flushed with anger: "You have been summoned to this council to speak on behalf of the Buddhist teaching. Your disrespect will not be tolerated much longer. I shall ask one more time, and should you fail to answer, I assure you the consequence shall be most grave. Teach me the True Way that all under heaven must follow!" Without a word Wu-ming turned and, as all looked on in dumbfounded silence, he made his way down the aisle and out the door. There was a hush of stunned disbelief before the crowd erupted into an uproar of confusion. Some were applauding Wu-ming's brilliant demonstration of religious insight, while others rushed about in an indignant rage, hurling threats and abuses at the doorway he had just passed through. Not knowing whether to praise Wu-ming or to have him beheaded, the Emperor turned to his advisors, but they were none the wiser. Finally, looking out at the frantic anarchy to which his grand debate had been reduced, the Emperor must surely have realized that no matter what Wu-ming's intentions might have been, there was now only one way to avoid the debate becoming a most serious embarrassment.
              
              "The great sage of Han-hsin monastery has skillfully demonstrated that the great Tao cannot be confined by doctrines, but is best expounded through harmonious action. Let us profit by the wisdom he has so compassionately shared, and each endeavor to make our every step one that unites heaven and earth in accord with the profound and subtle Tao."
              
              Having thus spoken the Son of Heaven concluded the Great Debate.
              
              I immediately ran out to find Wu-ming, but he had disappeared in the crowded streets of the capitol.
              
              Ten years have since passed, and I have seen nothing of him. However, on occasion a wandering monk will stop at Han-hsin with some bit of news. I am told that Wu-ming has been wandering about the countryside this past decade, trying unsuccessfully to find his way home. Because of his fame he is greeted and cared for in all quarters with generous kindness; however, those wishing to help him on his journey usually find that they have been helped on their own.
              
              One young monk told of an encounter in which Wu-ming asked him, "Can you tell me where my home is?" Confused as to the spirit of the question. The monk replied, "Is the home you speak of to be found in the relative world of time and place, or do you mean the Original Home of all pervading Buddha nature?"
              
              After pausing a moment to consider the question, Wu-ming looked up and, grinning as only he is capable, said, "Yes."

              Introduction
              The Parable of the Mustard Seed is, perhaps, one of the most famous stories from the Pali Canon. This is my interpretation of the Sutta, to be clear. I understand very little Pali and less Sanscrit, so this is not a translation, and I am not trying to convince anyone otherwise.
              
              This is an interpretation of a Sutta, and that means my opinions on the original parable are undoubtedly present. I encourage everyone to read a translation of the original Sutta.
              
              When the Suttas first came into existence, mankind did not have paper, let alone the internet. Thus, stories like this one were told and memorized orally. The natural consequence of this was that Suttas are very, very repetitive. The modern reader is often turned off by the style of a Buddhist Sutta, and this is my attempt to make the world of Buddhism a little more accessable.
              
              In case you're new to Buddhism altogether, a Sutta is a Tale of the Buddha. They were often very poetic and repetitive, as I mentioned, and they always, always had some sort of moral. The moral is the blood and bones of a Sutta, and ultimately, the morals of these stories are WHY Buddhism still exists today. The stories--Suttas--are the preservation of the religion itself, and that makes this project all the more exciting.
              
              Without further ado, the Parable of the Mustard Seed
              Kisa Gotami and the Mustard Seed
              Have you time, friend? I've a story I'd like to share.
              
              There was once a woman from the city of Savatthi by the name of Kisa Gotami, known for her wisdom and kindness. Her many uncountable merits earned her, as a husband, the son of a nobleman, and she bore him a single child. In the dark of a storm, in a flash of lightning, with animals baying just outside her window, Kisa Gotami realized that her baby was not crying. Death had claimed the child in his sleep.
              
              Kisa Gotami pleaded with God and the spirits, and with every devil by name, but none of them would answer her prayers. Thus, her dead babe in arm, she went out into the morning marketplace to find a medicine that could cure death.
              
              "Please," she would plead to the merchants. "My son needs medicine. He's ill."
              
              "Kisa, your son is dead."
              
              But she would not hear their words. Thus she wandered the market, asking everyone if they knew a medicine for death. The woman the whole city once looked to for advice was now the center of everyone's pity.
              
              "Gone mad, she has," some said. "She'll come to her wits," said others. "It may be kinder to kill her," said others still. Every single body in the city was moved by Kisa Gotami's sorrow.
              
              She arrived with her dead baby to a certain apothecary and, once again, begged for a medicine with which to cure death. The apothecary, having been given warning of Kisa Gotami's coming, pretended to consider her question long and hard. Finally, he told her, "No. No, I don't have anything to cure death. But if anyone does, it would be the ascetic Gautama. He was a brilliant doctor before he retired, you know."
              
              "Where can I find this man?" Gotami screamed, clutching her dead child.
              
              "He is staying in the Jeta Grove, where they're building the monastery."
              
              Gotami fled the medicine shop without another word. That same day, she rushed into the Jeta Grove, where the Buddha was lecturing a large assembly, many of whom knew of Kisa Gotami's plight.
              
              Crying, reeking of death, and stained by the city, Gotami threw herself at the Buddha's feet, disturbing the lecture and laying her dead son flat on his back.
              
              "Remove her," someone grumbled.
              
              "Stay your tongue," came a reply. "That is Kisa Gotami. She can't be held accountable for what she does."
              
              "Please," Kisa Gotami said, ignoring the murmurs about her. "I've been told that you once practiced medicine, and that you knew a cure for death. I beg you, sir, bring my son back to life. Please! My husband is amongst the city's wealthiest-I can pay you any fee."
              
              A silence of pity spread through the crowd, and the Buddha looked on the distraught mother in silence.
              
              "Please!" She cried.
              
              Still the Buddha was silent.
              
              "Do you know the cure or not? I beg you!"
              
              "Yes," the Buddha said. "I know the cure for death."
              
              A collective gasp went through the crowd, and the Buddha's closest disciples gave him a suspicious look.
              
              "Any price," Gotami said, weeping. "Anything!"
              
              "Very well," the Buddha said. "I require but a mustard seed-the other reagents I have. But it cannot be any common mustard seed. It must come from a family that has never known death. If you bring me such a seed, I will be able to prepare your cure."
              
              "Oh, most generous doctor! Enlightened sage! Thank you! Thank you!"
              
              "Ah-Leave the child," the Buddha said, as Gotami stood. "I can prepare the rest of the cure while you search."
              
              For the first time in two days, Kisa Gotami traveled without the presence of her son's corpse.
              
              When she was finally out of sight, the Buddha cast his gaze at the child's body, rotted, riddled with maggots and broken.
              
              "Come, Ananda. We must cremate Kisa Gotami's son."
              
              #
              
              Kisa Gotami searched Savatthi with impeccable order, going from home to home, and asking everyone the same question. "Can you spare a mustard seed?"
              
              "I don't see why not."
              
              "Thank you! But-has your family ever known death?"
              
              "Yes, Gotami. Only four months ago, my father passed. You were there, remember?"
              
              #
              
              "Yes, Gotami. My parents and their parents, and the brothers of them all are all dead and gone. I am alone in the world."
              
              #
              
              "Yes, Gotami. My son was slain in battle."
              
              #
              
              "...killed by wolves."
              
              "...executed..."
              
              "...drowned herself..."
              
              "...fell from a partition..."
              
              "...died from a cold..."
              
              "I am the only one left of my family, Kisa Gotami." Kisa Gotami, battered and coated in filth, knelt in the mud of a long-due rainstorm and said to herself, "My son is dead."
              
              Pellets of water battered her forehead and streaked the dirt down her face.
              
              "My son is dead."
              
              #
              
              Kisa Gotami returned to the Jeta Grove and found the Buddha, sweeping wood-dust from the construction site.
              
              "Kisa Gotami," the Buddha said in greeting.
              
              "Blessed Sage," Kisa replied.
              
              She was smeared over with the grime of the road, and old tears had carved paths through the dirt on her cheek. Despite this, the Buddha said, "Your wandering has done you well."
              
              "Oh, Gautama, how selfish was my grief. I went from family to family, and pretended for two long days that there might exist some clan of immortals. Those wives alive in Savatthi who haven't already lost a son are bound to lose one someday. And if they never lose a son, then a son is bound to lose a mother. And how many parents lay buried beneath our feet!"
              
              "Your observation is accurate in every way, Kisa Gotami. Neither those wise nor those foolish are immune to death. However great a father roars, he can never waken a dead daughter. However much a mother begs the gods, a dead son will never cry again. One by one, Gotami, we each die. This is but a greater disappointment among a thousand lesser ones, and just as a Sage does not mourn a broken pot, a Sage does not mourn death.
              
              "Your tears painted trails down your face, once, Gotami, but those trails did not lead you to peace of mind. For four days, you suffered the elements as if you wandered a jungle instead of the heart of a great city. But your sorrow accomplished nothing for your son. Be prepared, Gotami, for you will suffer many other deaths in your time, and some day, your own. Destroy the attachment that causes your grief, and you will lead a better life."
              
              Thus Kisa Gotami took her first step down the path of wisdom. And the Buddha finished sweeping the floor.

              <blockquote>
              <p>In former lives, Kaundinya had killed the Buddha, slandered the Buddha, beaten the Buddha, cut off his arms, cut off his legs, and cut off his ears and nose. But, when Kaundinya cut the Buddha's limbs off, the Buddha made a vow, "When I become a Buddha, I will save you first." So, in this life, when he became a Buddha, he went straight to the Deer Park to save five Bhikshus, the first of whom, was Kaundinya. Ajnatakaundinya means "understanding the original limit," or "the first to understand." He understood his original face and was the first to become enlightened. He, too, was an elder among the twelve hundred fifty Bhikshus, one of the first to leave home under the Buddha.</p>

              <blockquote><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Story of Khantivadi Ascetic</span></strong>
              <p>Once upon a time the Bodhisattva, leading the life of an ascetic, was meditating at the foot of a tree in the king’s royal park. He was living there at the invitation of the king’s general. One day the king went to the park with the ladies of the court. In a drunken state he slept with his head on the lap of a favourite lady. As he was asleep the others went up to the ascetic to listen to his teaching.</p>
              <p>On waking he found the ladies missing. Hearing that they had gone to the ascetic and questioned him in a harsh tone: ‘What do you preach, you ascetic?’ ‘I preach on patience, your majesty,’ replied the ascetic calmly. ‘What is patience?’ ‘Patience is not getting angry when you are abused or beaten.’ ‘Well, I will then test your patience,’ said the king and summoning the executioner ordered him to throw the ascetic on the ground and beat him with a thorny whip. The innocent ascetic was whipped mercilessly. The ascetic’s skin burst. The whole body was smeared with blood. But the ascetic true to his teaching endured his pain patiently. ‘Do you still practise patience, ascetic?’ ‘Yes, still I do, your majesty!’ The king then order that his hands and feet be cut off and questioned him again. The same calm reply issued from his lips. Full of wrath the king ordered his nose and ears to be cut off.</p>
              <p>Mercilessly the executioner chopped off his nose and ears . With mutilated limbs as the good ascetic lay on a pool of blood, the king asked him again – ‘Do you still practise patience, ascetic?’ ‘You majesty, please do not think that my patience lies in my skin, or in my hands and feet, or in my nose and ears. My patience lies within my heart. With your superior strength you can overpower my weak body. But, your majesty, my mind can never be changed,’ coolly replied the ascetic. He harboured no ill will towards the king. Not did he look at him with any anger.</p>
              <p>The king’s anger knew no bounds. Deeply enraged he raised his foot and stamped on the chest of the ascetic with his heel. Immediately blood gushed out of his mouth. The general who had invited him heard of his pitiful state, and hurried to his presence. Quickly he applied some ointment and begged him not to curse the kingdom. The merciful ascetic, instead of cursing the king blessed him, saying, ‘He who caused my hands and feet, nose and ears, to be cut off, may that king live long! Men like us never get angry,’ After his Enlightenment, the Buddha said, ‘Though hacked by a sharp axe as if I was inanimate, I did not get angry with King Kasi. This is my <strong>Perfection of Patience (Khanti Parami).</strong>’ – Adapted from Khantivadi Jakata</p>

              THE HOLY MAN AND THE ANIMALS
              
              Far off in the Himalayan Mountains there lived a holy man who wanted desperately to have a deeper understanding of life and its meaning. One summer it got so hot that all the nearby streams dried up and the holy man was forced to dig his own well.
              
              During the course of his difficult labor, the holy man noticed that many animals were also suffering from lack of water and slowly, many of them were beginning to die. Feeling sincere compassion and empathy for these creatures he decided to build them their own trough.
              
              The holy man spent hours and hours in the sweltering heat working on this trough for the animals. First he had to cut down a large tree and then scrape out the wood to make a basin. As soon as this was finished he began bringing buckets of water from his well to fill the trough. This effort took all of his time.
              
              Slowly, the animals in the area became aware of the water and word spread quickly through the region. Birds, rabbits, mice, deer and even a tiger all came to share from the same trough made by this very generous man. As the animals spent more and more time at the through, they noticed that the holy man was losing weight and beginning to look ill. They also noticed he was weakening and that in his generosity towards them had greatly neglected his own needs and had not properly stocked food for the fast approaching winter.
              
              The animals spoke among themselves and decided to repay his kindness by foraging for him and collecting all kinds of things for him to eat. All together the animals presented their gift to the holy man, who was so touched by the animalsâ€™ compassion towards him that he continued to fill their trough until the drought finally came to an end.
              
              Although the drought did come to an end and the streams did refill, the holy man and the animals continued to remain friends.

              Zen Stories
              
              Love
              
              A student confided in Suzuki Roshi that she had tremendous feelings of love for him, and that it confused her. 
              "Don't worry," he said. "You can let yourself have all the feelings you have for your teacher. That's good. I have enough discipline for both of us."
              
              Teacups
              
              A student asked Suzuki Roshi why the Japanese make their teacups so thin and delicate that they break easily. "It's not that they're too delicate," he answered, "but that you don't know how to handle them. You must adjust yourself to the environment, and not vice versa."
              
              From: "To Shine One Corner of the World: Moments with Shunryu Suzuki: Stories of a Zen Teacher Told by His Students" (Edited by David Chadwick): http://cuke.com
              
              Preparation
              
              On a visit to the East Coast, Suzuki Roshi arrived at the meeting place of the Cambridge Buddhist Society to find everyone scrubbing down the interior in anticipation of his visit. They were surprised to see him, because he had written that he would arrive on the following day. He tied back the sleeves of his robe and insisted on joining the preparations "for the grand day of my arrival."
              "To Shine One Corner of the World: Moments with Shunryu Suzuki: Stories of a Zen Teacher Told by His Students"
              
              Letting go
              
              Two monks were returning to the monastery in the evening. It had rained and there were puddles of water on the road sides. At one place a beautiful young woman was standing unable to walk accross because of a puddle of water. The elder of the two monks went up to a her lifted her in his alms and left her on the other side of the road, and continued his way to the monastery. 
              In the evening the younger monk came to the elder monk and said, "Sir, as monks, we cannot touch a woman ?" 
              The elder monk answered "yes, brother". 
              Then the younger monk asks again, " but then Sir, how is that you lifted that woman on the roadside ?" 
              The elder monk smiled at him and told him " I left her on the other side of the road, but you are still carrying her "
              
              The Gates of Paradise
              
              A soldier named Nobushige came to Hakuin and asked: "Is there really a paradise and a hell?" 
              "Who are you?" inquired Hakuin. 
              "I am a samurai", the warrior replied. 
              "You, a soldier!" sneered Hakuin, "What kind of ruler would have you as his guard? You look like a beggar". 
              Nobushige became so angry that he began to draw his sword.
              Hakuin continued: "So you have a sword! Your weapon is probably to dull to cut off my head." 
              Nobushige drew his sword.
              Hakuin remarked: "Here open the gates of hell!" 
              At these words the samurai, perceiving the master's discipline, put away his sword and bowed. 
              "Here open the gates of paradise", said Hakuin.
              From 'Zen flesh, Zen bones'
              
              Self-control
              
              One day there was an earthquake that shook the entire Zen temple. Parts of it even collapsed. Many of the monks were terrified. When the earthquake stopped the teacher said, "Now you have had the opportunity to see how a Zen man behaves in a crisis situation. You may have noticed that I did not panic. I was quite aware of what was happening and what to do. I led you all to the kitchen, the strongest part of the temple. It was a good decision, because you see we have all survived without any injuries. However, despite my self-control and composure, I did feel a little bit tense - which you may have deduced from the fact that I drank a large glass of water, something I never do under ordinary circumstances."
              
              One of the monks smiled, but didn't say anything.
              
              "What are you laughing at?" asked the teacher.
              
              "That wasn't water," the monk replied, "it was a large glass of soy sauce."
              
              More self-control
              
              During the civil wars in feudal Japan, an invading army would quickly sweep into a town and take control. In one particular village, everyone fled just before the army arrived - everyone except the Zen master.
              
              Curious about this old fellow, the general went to the temple to see for himself what kind of man this master was. When he wasn't treated with the deference and submissiveness to which he was accustomed, the general burst into anger. 
              "You fool," he shouted as he reached for his sword, "don't you realize you are standing before a man who could run you through without blinking an eye!"
              
              But despite the threat, the master seemed unmoved. 
              "And do you realize," the master replied calmly, "that you are standing before a man who can be run through without blinking an eye?"
              
              Obedience
              
              The master Bankei's talks were attended not only by Zen students but by persons of all ranks and sects. He never quoted sutras nor indulged in scholastic dissertations. Instead, his words were spoken directly from his heart to the hearts of his listeners. 
              His large audience angered a priest of the Nichiren sect because the adherents had left to hear about Zen. The self-centered Nichiren priest came to the temple, determined to have a debate with Bankei.
              
              "Hey, Zen teacher!" he called out. "Wait a minute. Whoever respects you will obey what you say, but a man like myself does not respect you. Can you make me obey you?"
              "Come up beside me and I will show you," said Bankei.
              Proudly the priest pushed his way through the crowd to the teacher.
              Bankei smiled. "Come over to my left side."
              The priest obeyed.
              "No," said Bankei, "we may talk better if you are on the right side. Step over here."
              The priest proudly stepped over to the right. 
              "You see," observed Bankei, "you are obeying me and I think you are a very gentle person. Now sit down and listen."

              Just for Fun
              
              Two Zen monks were walking down the road. 
              First monk says: "These pine trees are magnificent."
              The second monk slaps him across the face.
              First monk: "Why did you do that?"
              "I'm a Zen monk so I can get away with all kinds of weird stuff like that."

              <p><strong>A Lesson From The Forest</strong></p>
              <p>In the Rukkhadhamma Jataka, a quarrel had arisen regarding water rights. In response, the Buddha told a tale of his past life as the spirit of a sal tree in the Himalayas. During the reign of King Vessava, the trees, shrubs, bushes, and plants were all invited to choose a new abode. The future Buddha advised all his kinsfolk to ‘shun trees that stood alone in the open and to take up their abodes’ in the forest.</p>
              <p>The wise vegetative spirits followed his advice, but the proud and foolish ones instead chose to dwell outside the villages and towns, to reap the benefits offered by townspeople who worship such trees.  They left the forest and came to inhabit ‘giant trees which grow in an open space.’ One day,  a mighty storm swept over the countryside. The solitary trees, despite their years of growth deep into the rich farmland, suffered greatly: their branches snapped, their trunks collapsed, and they were uprooted, ‘flung to the earth by the tempest.’</p>
              <p>But when the storm hit the sal forest of interlacing trees where the future Buddha dwelt, ‘its fury was in vain… not a tree could it overthrow.’.. The future Buddha responded with the verse, ‘United forest-like, should kinsfolk stand; the storm o’erthrows the solitary tree.’ This was later repeated by the Buddha when he addressed the villagers during a dispute over water, reminding them to work in unity toward a common goal. This story could be interpreted as a call to heed the lessons of the forest, to acknowledge the strength of the interconnectedness of life.</p>
