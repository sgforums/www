              <h2>Why Tell a Zen Story?</h2>
              <hr style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><br></span></p>
              <blockquote style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>Once there was an old man who lived at the top of a very high and dangerous precipice. Every morning he would sit at the edge of the cliff and view the surrounding mountains and forest. One day, after he set himself down for his usual meditation, he noticed something shiny at the very bottom of the precipice. Now even though it was very far below him, the old man had keen eyes and could just barely make out what it was. It looked like a rather large, black chest with gold trimmings - just sitting there atop a rock. "Where did it come from? What could be inside it?" the old man thought to himself...</strong></blockquote>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong><br><img src="http://users.rider.edu/~suler/zenstory/graphics/discussion.gif" alt="" align="right">Nothing captures our attention quite like a good story. Long before there was television, movies, radio, and even books, people told stories as a way to entertain and educate. Storytelling was as important to prehistoric cave-dwellers eating antelope around a fire as it is to corporate executives doing lunch. It's in our human blood. We love the development of plot and character, the climax, the resolution, the vicarious thrill of living and learning through tales of others sufferings and triumphs. All of literature and media is but an extension of the more basic urge to tell a good story. The advantage of storytelling, though, is that you do it in person - right there, right in front of people, so you get to see, hear, and feel their reactions. Unlike books and television, storytelling is much more interactive and personal. You don't do it alone, unless you're quite psychotic.... but that's another story.</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>This web site is a collection of stories from the Orient, mostly Zen and Taoist tales. Why am I suggesting that you tell these stories to your neighbors? Is it because these are among the oldest stories in human history and have withstood the test of time? Is it because Zen and Taoism are ancient religions offering profound insights into human nature, the cosmos, and spirituality?... Maybe. Or maybe it's just because they are fun to tell. Without a doubt, these stories capture all sorts of truths about life and death. But they are also witty, entertaining, humorous, and at times puzzling, even mind-bending. And they are not just the secret lessons of monks sequestered away in mountain monasteries. The ancient teachers intended these stories to be used by everyone, everywhere. On the train to work, during dinner at a restaurant, leaning over the backyard fence as you talk to your neighbor - all of these situations and more lend themselves to these stories. Once you read and learn a few of them, you will see opportunities to tell them popping up everywhere with your family, friends, and coworkers. Think of these tales as conversation pieces, as handy tools that you can lift out of your pocket to help you and others talk, think, and laugh about the wondrous and mysterious details of this thing we call Life.</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>To help you with your storytelling, I've done a little bit of background work for you. I've collected many people's reactions to these stories. These people include students from the psychology classes I teach, my friends and relatives, and cybernauts who have visited this site. As you will see, people interpret each story in very different ways. That's what makes them so interesting. You may have heard some of these tales before and believe you know what they "mean." But if you read these people's reactions - or tell the stories to your neighbors and hear their reactions - I think you'll be amazed at how these tales strike a different chord in everyone. The stories have many meanings.Talking about those meanings with your friends and family can be a truly educational experience.</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>So read on. Pick out the stories that sound interesting. Read this hypertext book from "cover" to "cover," or at random, or use the links at the bottom of each story to connect to other stories with similar themes. There's no right or wrong way to do this. Pick the method that works best for you. And perhaps, like the old man at the top of the precipice, you will see something surprising.</strong></p>

              <h2>Banishing a Ghost</h2>
              <hr style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><br></span><img style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;" src="http://users.rider.edu/~suler/zenstory/graphics/ghost.gif" alt="" align="left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>The wife of a man became very sick. On her deathbed, she said to him, "I love you so much! I don't want to leave you, and I don't want you to betray me. Promise that you will not see any other women once I die, or I will come back to haunt you."<br><br>For several months after her death, the husband did avoid other women, but then he met someone and fell in love. On the night that they were engaged to be married, the ghost of his former wife appeared to him. She blamed him for not keeping the promise, and every night thereafter she returned to taunt him. The ghost would remind him of everything that transpired between him and his fiancee that day, even to the point of repeating, word for word, their conversations. It upset him so badly that he couldn't sleep at all.<br><br>Desperate, he sought the advice of a Zen master who lived near the village. "This is a very clever ghost," the master said upon hearing the man's story. "It is!" replied the man. "She remembers every detail of what I say and do. It knows everything!" The master smiled, "You should admire such a ghost, but I will tell you what to do the next time you see it."<br><br>That night the ghost returned. The man responded just as the master had advised. "You are such a wise ghost," the man said, "You know that I can hide nothing from you. If you can answer me one question, I will break off the engagement and remain single for the rest of my life." "Ask your question," the ghost replied. The man scooped up a handful of beans from a large bag on the floor, "Tell me exactly how many beans there are in my hand."<br><br>At that moment the ghost disappeared and never returned.<br><br><br>

              <div class="KonaBody">The abbot of a once famous Buddhist monastery that had fallen into decline was deeply troubled.

He traveled far to a sage and recounted his tale of woe, of how much he desired to transform his monastery to the flourishing haven it had been in days of yore.<br><br>The sage looked him in the eye and said, "The reason your monastery has languished is that the Buddha is living among you in disguise, and you have not honored Him." The abbot hurried back, his mind in turmoil<br><br>The Selfless One was at his monastery! Who could He be? Brother Hua?...No, he was full of sloth. Brother Po?...No, he was too dull. But then the Tathagata was in disguise. What better disguise than sloth or dull- wittedness? He called his monks to him and revealed the sage's words. They, too, were taken aback and looked at each other with suspicion and awe.<br><br>Which one of them was the Chosen One?<br><br>The disguise was perfect. Not knowing who He was they took to treating everyone with the respect due to a Buddha. Their faces started shining with an inner radiance that attracted novices and then lay supporters.<br><br>In no time at all the monastery far surpassed its previous glory</div>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>"A young widower, who loved his five year old son very much, was away on business when bandits came who burned down the whole village and took his son away. When the man returned, he saw the ruins and panicked. The took the burnt corpse of an infant to be his son and cried uncontrollably. He organised a cremation ceremony, collected the ashes and put them in a beautiful little bag which he always kept with him.Â <br>Soon afterwards, his real son escaped from the bandits and found his way home. He arrived at his father's new cottage at midnight and knocked at the door. The father, still grieving asked: "Who is it?" The child answered, it is me papa, open the door!" But in his agitated state of mind, convinced his son was dead, the father thought that some young boy was making fun of him. He shouted: "Go away" and continued to cry. After some time, the child left.Â <br>Father and son never saw each other again."Â Â <br>After this story, the Buddha said: "Sometime, somewhere, you take something to be the truth. If you cling to it so much, even when the truth comes in person and knocks on your door, you will not open it.</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Long ago and far away, their was a king who ruled in Benares, in northern India. One of his ministers was called the Royal Price Maker, and he was a very honest man. His job was to set a fair price for anything the king wanted to buy or sell.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">On some occasions, the king did not like his price making. He did not get as big a profit as he wanted. He did not want to pay so much when he bought, or sell for what he thought was not enough. So he decided to change the price maker.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One day he saw a nice looking young man and he thought, "This fellow will be good for my price making position." So he dismissed his former honest price maker, and appointed this man to be the new one. The man thought, "I must make the king happy by buying at very low prices and selling at very high prices." So he made the prices ridiculous, without caring at all what anything was worth. This gained the greedy king a lot of money, and made him very happy. Meanwhile, all the others who dealt with the new price maker, including the king's other ministers and ordinary people, became very unhappy.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Then one day a horse merchant arrived in Benares with 500 horses to sell. There were stallions, mares and colts. The king invited the merchant to the palace, and called upon his Royal Price Maker to set a price for all 500 horses. Thinking only of pleasing the king, he said, "The entire herd of horses is worth one cup of rice." So the king ordered that one cup of rice be paid to the horse dealer, and all the horses were taken to the royal stables.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em;">ONCE on a time three fishes lived in a far-away river. They were named Thoughtful, Very-Thoughtful, and Thoughtless.</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">One day they left the wild country where no men lived, and came down the river to live near a town.</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">Very-Thoughtful said to the other two: "There is danger all about us here. Fishermen come to the river here to catch fish with all sorts of nets and lines. Let us go back again to the wild country where we used to live."</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">But the other two fishes were so lazy by now that they kept putting off their going from day to day.</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">But one day Thoughtful and Thoughtless went swimming on ahead of Very-Thoughtful and they did not see the fisherman's net and rushed into it. Very-Thoughtful saw them rush into the net.</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">"I must save them," said Very-Thoughtful.</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">So swimming around the net, he splashed in the water in front of it, like a fish that had broken through the net and gone up the river. Then he swam back of the net and splashed about there like a fish that had broken through and gone down the river.</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">The fisherman saw the splashing water and thought the fishes had broken through the net and that one had gone up the river, the other down, so he pulled in the net by one corner. That let the two fishes out of the net, and away they went to find Very-Thoughtful.</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">"You saved our lives, Very-Thoughtful," they said, "and now we are willing to go back to the wild country."</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">So back they all went to their old home where they lived safely ever after.</p>

              <p class="style7">A story by Ven Master Hsing Yun, from Merit Times:</p>
              <p class="style11">Su Dongpo (a famous Buddhist poet) of the Song Dynasty was assigned to an official post at Guazhuo, which was situated at the northern shore of the Yangtze River. Across the river, on its southern shore, was Jinshan (Golden Mountain) Temple where Chan Master Foyin presided. One day, Su Dongpo, feeling quite advanced in his practice, wrote a poem and asked his attendant to send it to Chan Master Foyin for verification. The poem went as following:</p>
              <p class="style11">"Bowing with my highest respect<br>To the deva of devas, <br>Whose fine light illuminates the whole universe, <br>The eight winds cannot move me, <br>For I am sitting upright on the golden purple lotus blossom."</p>
              <p class="style11">("The deva of devas" here figuratively refers to "the Buddha", who is actually not a god, but surpasses all the gods and is "Teacher of men and gods." The "eight winds" are the eight worldly conditions - gain and loss, fame and defame, praise and blame, pleasure and pain. "The golden purple lotus blossom" is a symbol of purity and a "throne" of spiritual attainment.)</p>
              <p class="style11">After receiving the poem from the attendant and reading it, Chan Master Foyin picked up the brush and wrote down one word as his comment. When the attendant came back with the poem, Su Dongpo, expecting words of praise from the Chan Master, quickly opened it to read the comment. However, on that page, nothing was written except the word "Fart!" ("Pi" in Chinese, which means "utter nonsense") Upon seeing such an insult, Su Dongpo was ablaze with the fire of anger. Immediately, he boarded a boat and crossed the Yangtze River to argue with Chan Master Foyin.</p>
              <p class="style11">Before the boat even pulled onto the shore, Chan Master Foyin was already standing there waiting for Su Dongpo. Upon seeing Foyin, Su Dongpo said, "Chan Master, we are such intimate Dharma friends! It is fine that you do not compliment my practice or my poem. But how can you insult me like this?"</p>
              <p class="style11">Innocently, as if nothing had happened, the Chan Master asked, "How have I insulted you?" Without saying another word, Su Dongpo simply showed the word "Fart" to Chan Master Foyin.</p>
              <p><span class="style11"><strong><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: x-small;">Laughing wholeheartedly, the Chan Master said, "Oh! Didn't you say that the eight winds cannot move you? How come you are sent across the river with just a fart?" Hearing what Foyin said, Su Dongpo was extremely embarrassed." </span></strong></span></p>

              <h4>ZEN (CH'AN) STORY - LIKE A PILE 
                            OF BULLSH**<em><br> By Ven Master Hsing Yun, from <a href="http://www.hsilai.org/english/merittimes/col_detail.asp?index=14097&amp;code=S">Merit 
                            Times</a>.</em></h4>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>"Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty went to meditate 
                              with Ch'an Master Foyin at Golden Mountain Temple. After Su Dongpo 
                              had experienced a total relaxation of body and mind, he asked 
                              Ch'an Master Foyin, "Master, what do you think of my 
                              sitting posture?"</p>
              <p>"Very magnificent. Like a Buddha!"</p>
              <p>Su Dongpo was very delighted to hear that.  
                              Master Foyin then asked him, "Scholar, what do you think 
                              of my sitting posture then?"</p>
              <p>Su Dongpo, never giving up any chance to tease and jeer at  
                              Master Foyin, immediately replied, "Like a pile of bullsh**." 
                              Master Foyin was very delighted to hear the answer and did 
                             not utter another word.</p>
              <p>Su Dongpo thought he had beaten  Master Foyin 
                              because the  Master was wordless while being compared to a 
                              pile of bullsh**. He was so proud of himself that he told everyone 
                              he met, "Today I won."</p>
              <p>This news soon reached Su's sister Su Xiaomei. 
                              She asked him, "Brother, how was it that you beat  Master 
                              today?" Su repeated the whole story vividly to his sister. 
                              Su Xiaomei, talented and smart as she was, told Su Dongpo straight 
                              to his face, "Brother, you actually lost. It is because  
                              Master's mind is actually that of a Buddha that he could see you 
                              as a Buddha. As your mind is like a pile of bullsh**, you, of 
                              course, saw him as a pile of bullsh**." Su Dongpo, realizing 
                              his Chan practice was far inferior to  Master Foyin's, was 
                              speechless. <br> <br> Moral: Ch'an does not depend on knowledge but upon the capacity 
                              to awake. Ch'an is not about eloquent debate but intuitive wisdom. 
                              Don't think all Ch'an masters handle encounters with sharp words. 
                              Sometimes, when they are silent and don't communicate via words 
                              and language, they can still utter the same deafening Dharma sounds."</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Once upon a time, the King of Benares went on a picnic in the forest. The beautiful flowers and trees and fruits made him very happy. As he was enjoying their beauty, he slowly went deeper and deeper into the forest. Before long, he became separated from his companions and realized that he was all alone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Then he heard the sweet voice of a young woman. She was singing as she collected firewood. To keep from being afraid of being alone in the forest, the king followed the sound of the lovely voice. When he finally came upon the singer of the songs, he saw that she was a beautiful fair young woman, and immediately fell in love with her. They became very friendly, and the king became the father of the firewood woman's child.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Later, he explained how he had gotten lost in the forest, and convinced her that he was indeed the King of Benares. She gave him directions for getting back to his palace. The king gave her his valuable signet ring, and said, "If you give birth to a baby girl, sell this ring and use the money to bring her up well. If our child turns out to be a baby boy, bring him to me along with this ring for recognition." So saying, he departed for Benares.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the fullness of time, the firewood woman gave birth to a cute little baby boy. Being a simple shy woman, she was afraid to take him to the fancy court in Benares, but she saved the king's signet ring.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In a few years, the baby grew into a little boy. When he played with the other children in the village, they teased him and mistreated him, and even started fights with him. It was because his mother was not married that the other children picked on him. They yelled at him, "No-father! No-father! Your name should be No-father!"</span></p>

              <p><br>recalling,</p>
              <p>in one of the Ven Hai Tao Story, thereÂ was this monk who withstanded all sort of accusation and insult and yet, he's able to bear them all.</p>
              <p>there was this wife who had an affair and got pregnant. then her husband found out about the scandal, so she told him that the father of baby is the monk living next door. then the scandal was spread all over the town, saying this monk is a disgrace and shame to buddhism. however he never fight back, he just took the child and start to rise him up. over the years, the mother's guilt were unbearable and she confessed. her husband and everyoneÂ then know that he had wrong the monk.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>there was this quite similar story of Buddha's past life, when he was accuse of flirting with the king's maidens. and the king had his arms and leg cutted off, but the <em>Buddha</em> not only didn't blame the king,Â he vowed to liberate him when he become enlightened. later the king was reborn as Buddha's first disciple.</p>

              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">In the middle of the river there was a beautiful island covered with mango, jackfruit and other fruit trees. There happened to be a rock sticking out of the water halfway between the bank and the island. Although it looked impossible, Mr. Monkey was used to jumping from the riverbank to the rock, and from the rock to the island. He would eat fruits all day and then return home by the same route each evening.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">A high-class couple was living next to the same river â Sir Crocodile and Lady Crocodile. They were expecting their first brood of baby crocks. Because she was pregnant Lady Crocodile sometimes wished for strange things to eat. So she made unusual demands on her faithful husband.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">Lady Crocodile had been amazed, just like the other animals, by the way Mr. Monkey jumped back and forth to the island. One day she developed a sudden craving to eat the heart of Mr. Monkey! She told Sir Crocodile about her desire. To please her, he promised to get Mr. Monkey's heart for her in time for dinner.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">Sir Crocodile went and laid himself down on the rock between the riverbank and the island. He waited for Mr. Monkey to return that evening, planning to catch him.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">As usual, Mr. Monkey spent the rest of the day on the island. When it was time to return to his home on the riverbank, he noticed that the rock seemed to have grown. It was higher above water than he remembered it. He investigated and saw that the river level was the same as in the morning, yet the rock was definitely higher. Immediately he suspected the cunning Sir Crocodile.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">To find out for sure, he called out in the direction of the rock,</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">

              <blockquote style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">"You used to answer me when I spoke to you. But today you say nothing. What's wrong with you, Mr. Rock?"</p>

I can't wait any longer for this dumb rock to speak! I will just have to speak for the rock, and trick the monkey."</p>

When Mr. Monkey saw this, he immediately jumped onto the top of Sir Crocodile's head, and then instantly to the riverbank.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">When Sir Crocodile realised he'd been outsmarted, he admired Mr.Monkey's victory. Like a good sport in a contest, he praised the winner. He said,</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">

              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"No, bhikkhus," replied the Buddha. "No good ever comes from taking life, not even when it is for the purpose of providing a Feast for the Dead." Then he told this story of the past.</p>
              <div class="excerpt" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em; margin-left: 2em; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Long, long ago, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi, a brahman decided to offer a Feast for the Dead and bought a goat to sacrifice. "My boys," he said to his students, "take this goat down to the river, bathe it, brush it, hang a garland around its neck, give it some grain to eat, and bring it back."
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Yes, sir," they replied and led the goat to the river.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">While they were grooming it, the goat started to laugh with a sound like a pot smashing. Then, just as strangely, it started to weep loudly.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The young students were amazed at this behavior. "Why did you suddenly laugh," they asked the goat, "and why do you now cry so loudly?"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Repeat your question when we get back to your teacher," the goat answered.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The students hurriedly took the goat back to their master and told him what had happened at the river. Hearing the story, the master himself asked the goat why it had laughed and why it had wept.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"In times past, brahman," the goat began, "I was a brahman who taught the Vedas like you. I, too, sacrificed a goat as an offering for a Feast for the Dead. Because of killing that single goat, I have had my head cut off 499 times. I laughed aloud when I realized that this is my last birth as an animal to be sacrificed. Today I will be freed from my misery. On the other hand, I cried when I realized that, because of killing me, you, too, may be doomed to lose your head five hundred times. It was out of pity for you that I cried."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Well, goat," said the brahman, "in that case, I am not going to kill you."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Brahman!" exclaimed the goat. "Whether or not you kill me, I cannot escape death today."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Don't worry," the brahman assured the goat. "I will guard you."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"You don't understand," the goat told him. "Your protection is weak. The force of my evil deed is very strong."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The brahman untied the goat and said to his students, "Don't allow anyone to harm this goat." They obediently followed the animal to protect it.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">After the goat was freed, it began to graze. It stretched out its neck to reach the leaves on a bush growing near the top of a large rock. At that very instant a lightning bolt hit the rock, breaking off a sharp piece of stone which flew through the air and neatly cut off the goat's head. A crowd of people gathered around the dead goat and began to talk excitedly about the amazing accident.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">A tree deva<a id="fnt-5" class="noteTag" style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 9pt; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; color: #1e3478; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" name="fnt-5" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kawasaki/bl135.html#fn-5">[5]</a>Â had observed everything from the goat's purchase to its dramatic death, and drawing a lesson from the incident, admonished the crowd: "If people only knew that the penalty would be rebirth into sorrow, they would cease from taking life. A horrible doom awaits one who slays." With this explanation of the law of kamma the deva instilled in his listeners the fear of hell. The people were so frightened that they completely gave up the practice of animal sacrifices. The deva further instructed the people in the Precepts and urged them to do good.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Eventually, that deva passed away to fare according to his deserts. For several generations after that, people remained faithful to the Precepts and spent their lives in charity and meritorious works, so that many were reborn in the heavens.</p>

              <tr>
              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;">Once upon a time, in Benares in northern India, the Enlightenment Being was born into the royal family. When he became king he was called Goodness the Great. He had earned this title by trying to do good all the time, even when the results might not benefit him. For example, he spent much of the royal treasury on the building and running of six houses of charity. In these houses good and aid were given freely to all the poor and needy who came along, even to unknown travellers. Soon king Goodness the Great became famous for his patience, loving-kindness and compassion. It was said that he loved all beings just like a father loves his young children.
              <p>Of course king Goodness observed the holy days by not eating. And naturally he practiced the âFive Training Stepsâ, giving up the five unwholesome actions. These are: destroying life, taking what is not given, doing wrong in sexual ways, speaking falsely, and losing oneâs mind from alcohol. So his gentle kindness became more and more pure.</p>
              <p>Since he wished to harm no one, King Goodness the Great even refused to imprison or injure wrongdoers. Knowing this, one of his highest ministers tried to take advantage of him. He cooked up a scheme to cheat some of the women in the royal harem. Afterwards it became known by all and was reported to the king.</p>
              <p>He called the bad minister before him and said, âI have investigated and found that you have done a criminal act. Word of it has spread and you have dishonoured yourself here in Benares. So it would be better for you to go and live somewhere else. You may take all your wealth and your family. Go wherever you like and live happily there. Learn from this lesson.â</p>
              <p>Then the minister took his family and al his belongings to the city of Kosala. Since he was very clever indeed, he worked his way up and became a minister of the king. In time he became the most trusted adviser to the King of Kosala. One day he said, âMy lord, I came here from Benares. The city of Benares is like a beehive where the bees hive no stingers! The ruling king is very tender and weak. With only a very small army you can easily conquer the city and make it yours.â</p>
              <p>The king doubted this, so he said, "You are my minister, but you talk like a spy who is leading me into a trap!â He replied "No m lord. If you donât believe me, send your best spies to examine what I say. I am not lying. When robbers are brought to the King of Benders, he gives them money, advises them not to take what is not given, and then lets them go free,"</p>
              <p>The king decided to find out if this was true. So he sent some robbers to raid a remote border village belonging to Benares. The villagers caught the looters and brought them to King Goodness the Great. He asked them, "Why do you want to do this type of crime?"</p>
              <p>The robbers answered, "Your worship, we are poor people. The robbers answered, "Your worship, we are poor people. There is no way to live without money. As your kingdom has plenty of workers, there is no work for us to do. So we had to loot the country in order to survive." Hearing this, the king gave them gifts of money, advised them to change their ways, and let them go free.</p>
              <p>When the King of Kosala was told of this, he sent another gang of bandits to the streets of Benares itself. They too looted the shops and even killed some of the people. When they were captured and brought to king Goodness, he treated them just the same as the first robbers.</p>
              <p>Learning of this, the King of Kosala began marching his troops and elephants towards Benares.</p>
              <p>In those days the King of Benders had a mighty army which included very brave elephants. There were many ordinary soldiers, and also some that were as big as giants. It was known that they were capable of conquering all India.</p>
              <p>The giant soldiers told King Goodness about the small invading army from Kosala. They asked permission to attack and kill them all.</p>
              <p>But King Goodness the Great would not send them into battle. He said, "My children, do not fight just so I may remain king. If we destroy the lives of others we also destroy our own peace of mind. Why should we kill others? Let them have the kingdom if they want it so badly. I do not wish to fight."</p>
              <p>The royal ministers said, "Our Lord, we will fight them ourselves. Donât worry yourself. Only give us the order." But again he prevented them.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile the King of Kosala sent him a warning, telling him to give up the kingdom or fight. King Goodness the Great sent this reply: "I do not want you to fight with me, and you do not want me to fight with you. If you want the country, you can have it. Why should we kill people just to decide the name of the king? What does it matter even the name of the country itself?"</p>
              <p>Hearing this, the ministers came forward and pleaded, "Our Lord, let us go out with our mighty army. We will beat them with our weapons and capture them all. We are much stronger than they are. We would not have to kill any of them. And besides, if we surrender the city, the enemy army would surely kill us all!"</p>
              <p>But King Goodness would not be moved. He refused to cause harm to anyone. He replied, "Even if you do not wish to kill, by fighting many will be injured. By accident some may die. No one knows the future - whether our attackers will kill us or not. But we do know whether our present actions are right or wrong. Therefore I will not harm, or cause others to harm, any living being!"</p>
              <p>Then King Goodness ordered the city gates be opened up for the invaders. He took his ministers to the top floor of the palace and advised them, "Say nothing and try to remain calm."</p>
              <p>The King of Kosala entered the city of Benares and saw that no one was against him. So he and his soldiers entered and went up to the top floor. They capture the innocent King Goodness the Great. The soldiers tied the hands of the defeated king and all of his ministers.</p>
              <p>Then they were taken to the cemetery outside the city. They were buried up to their necks, standing straight up, with only their heads above ground. But even while the dirt was being trampled down around his neck, the Great Being remained without anger in his mind and said nothing.</p>
              <p>Their discipline and obedience to King Goodness were so great that not a single minister spoke a word against anyone. But the King of Kosala had no mercy. He said roughly, "Come night time, let the jackals do as they please!"</p>
              <p>And so it came to pass that, at midnight, a large band of jackals wandered into the cemetery. They could smell a feast of human flesh waiting for them.</p>
              <p>Seeing them coming, King Goodness and his ministers shouted all at once and scared the jackals away. Twice more this happened. Then the clever jackals realised, "These men must have been put here for us to kill and eat." No longer afraid, they ignored the shouts. The jackal king walked right up to the face of King Goodness.</p>
              <p>The king offered his throat to the beast. But before he could bite into him, the king grabbed the jackalâs chin with his teeth. No harming him, King Goodness gripped him tightly so the jackal king howled in fear. This frightened his followers and they all ran away.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile the jackal king thrashed back and forth, trying madly to free himself from the might jaws of the human king. In so doing, he loosened the dirt packed around the kingâs neck and shoulders. Then King Goodness released the screaming jackal. He was able to wiggle himself free from the loosened earth and pull himself up onto the ground. Then he freed all his frightened ministers.</p>
              <p>Nearby there was a dead body. It just so happened that it was lying on the border of the territories claimed by two rival demons. They were arguing over the division of the body, insulting each other in ways that only demons can.</p>
              <p>Then one demon said to the other, "Why should we continue quarrelling instead of eating? Right over there is King Goodness the Great of Benares. H is famous in all worlds for his righteousness. He will divide the dead body for us.</p>
              <p>They dragged the body to the king and asked him to divide it between them fairly. He said, âMy friends, I would be glad to divide this for you. But I am filthy and dirty. I must clean myself first."</p>
              <p>The two demons used their magic powers to bring scented water, perfume, clothing, ornaments and flowers from the kingâs own palace in Benares. He bathed, perfumed himself, dressed, and covered himself with ornaments and flower garlands.</p>
              <p>The demons asked King Goodness if there was anything else they could do. He replied that he was hungry. So, again by their magic powers, the demons brought the most delicious flavoured rice in a golden bowl and perfumed drinking water in a golden cup - also from the royal palace in Benders.</p>
              <p>When he was satisfied, king Goodness asked them to bring him the sword of state from the pillow of the King of Kosala, who was sleeping in the palace in Benares. With magic that too was easily done. Then the king used the sword to cut the dead boy into two halves, right down the spine. He washed the sword of state and strapped it to his side.</p>
              <p>The hungry demons happily gobbled up the fairly divided dead body. Then they gratefully said to King Goodness, "Now that our bellies are full, is there anything else we can do to please you?"</p>
              <p>He replied, "By your magic, set me in my own bedroom in the palace next to the King of Koala. In addition, put all these my ministers back in their homes." Without a word, the demons did exactly as the king had asked.</p>
              <p>At that moment the King of Koala was fast asleep in the royal bedchamber. King Goodness the Great gently touched the belly of the sleeping king with the sword of state. The king awoke in great surprise. In the dim lamplight he was frightened to see King Goodness leaning over him with sword in hand. He had to rub his eyes to make sure he was not having a nightmare!"</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Once upon a time, the King of Benares went on a picnic in the forest. The beautiful flowers and trees and fruits made him very happy. As he was enjoying their beauty, he slowly went deeper and deeper into the forest. Before long, he became separated from his companions and realized that he was all alone.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Then he heard the sweet voice of a young woman. She was singing as she collected firewood. To keep from being afraid of being alone in the forest, the king followed the sound of the lovely voice. When he finally came upon the singer of the songs, he saw that she was a beautiful fair young woman, and immediately fell in love with her. They became very friendly, and the king became the father of the firewood woman's child.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Later, he explained how he had gotten lost in the forest, and convinced her that he was indeed the King of Benares. She gave him directions for getting back to his palace. The king gave her his valuable signet ring, and said, "If you give birth to a baby girl, sell this ring and use the money to bring her up well. If our child turns out to be a baby boy, bring him to me along with this ring for recognition." So saying, he departed for Benares.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the fullness of time, the firewood woman gave birth to a cute little baby boy. Being a simple shy woman, she was afraid to take him to the fancy court in Benares, but she saved the king's signet ring.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In a few years, the baby grew into a little boy. When he played with the other children in the village, they teased him and mistreated him, and even started fights with him. It was because his mother was not married that the other children picked on him. They yelled at him, "No-father! No-father! Your name should be No-father!"</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Of course this made the little boy feel ashamed and hurt and sad. He often ran home crying to his mother. One day, he told her how the other children called him, "No-father! No-father! Your name should be No-father!" Then his mother said, "Don't be ashamed, my son. You are not just an ordinary little boy. Your father is the King of Benares!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The little boy was very surprised. He asked his mother, "Do you have any proof of this?" So she told him about his father giving her the signet ring, and that if the baby was a boy she should bring him to Benares, along with the ring as proof. The little boy said, "Let's go then." Because of what happened, she agreed, and the next day they set out for Benares.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When they arrived at the king's palace, the gate keeper told the king the firewood woman and her little son wanted to see him. They went into the royal assembly hall, which was filled with the king's ministers and advisers. The woman reminded the king of their time together in the forest. Finally she said, "Your majesty, here is your son."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The king was ashamed in front of all the ladies and gentlemen of his court. So, even though he knew the woman spoke the truth, he said, "He is not my son!" Then the lovely young mother showed the signet ring as proof.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Again the king was ashamed and denied the truth, saying, "It is not my ring!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Then the poor woman thought to herself, "I have no witness and no evidence to prove what I say. I have only my faith in the power of truth." So she said to the king, "If I throw this little boy up into the air, if he truly is your son, may he remain in the air without falling. If he is not your son, may he fall to the floor and die!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Suddenly, she grabbed the boy by his foot and threw him up into the air. Lo and behold, the boy sat in the cross-legged position, suspended in mid-air, without falling. Everyone was astonished, to say the least! Remaining in the air, the little boy spoke to the mighty king. "My lord, I am indeed a son born to you. You take care of many people who are not related to you. You even maintain countless elephants, horses and other animals. And yet, you do not think of looking after and raising me, your own son. Please do take care of me and my mother."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Hearing this, the king's pride was overcome. He was humbled by the truth of the little boy's powerful words. He held out his arms and said, "Come to me my son, and I will take good care of you."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Amazed by such a wonder, all the others in the court put out their arms. They too asked the floating little boy to come to them. But he went directly from mid-air into his father's arms. With his son seated on his lap, the king announced that he would be the crown prince, and his mother would be the number one queen.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In this way, the king and all his court learned the power of truth. Benares became known as a place of honest justice. In time the king died. The grown up crown prince wanted to show the people that all deserve respect, regardless of birth. So he had himself crowned under the official name, "King No-father!" He went on to rule the kingdom in a generous and righteous way.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>The moral is: The truth is always stronger than a lie.</strong></span></p>

              <p>One day a young Buddhist on his journey home, came to the banks of a wide river. Staring hopelessly at the great obstacle in front of him, he pondered for hours on just how to cross such a wide barrier. Just as he was about to give up his pursuit to continue his journey he saw a great teacher on the other side of the river. The young Buddhist yells over to the teacher, "Oh wise one, can you tell me how to get to the other side of this river"?Â <br>The teacher ponders for a moment looks up and down the river and yells back, "My son, you are on the other side".</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Once upon a time, there was a king who had one- hundred sons. The youngest, the one-hundredth, was Prince Gamani. He was very energetic, patient and kind.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">All the princes were sent to be taught by teachers. Prince Gamani, even though he was the one-hundredth in line to the throne, was lucky enough to have the best teacher. He had the most learning and was the wisest of them of all. He was like a father to Prince Gamani, who liked, respected and obeyed him.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In those days, it was the custom to send each educated prince to a different province. There he was to develop the country and help the people. When Prince Gamani was old enough for this assignment, he went to his teacher and asked which province he should request. He said, "Do not select any province. Instead, tell your father the king that if he sends you, his one-hundredth son, out to a province, there will be no son remaining to serve him in his home city." Prince Gamani obeyed his teacher, and pleased his father with his kindness and loyalty.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Then the prince went again to his teacher and asked, "How best can I serve my father and the people, here in the capital city?" The wise teacher replied, "Ask the king to let you be the one to collect fees and taxes, and distribute benefits to the people. If he agrees, then carry out your duties honestly and fairly, with energy and kindness."</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Again the prince followed his teacher's advice. Trusting his one-hundredth son, the king was glad to assign these functions to him. When he went out to perform the difficult task of collecting fees and taxes, the young prince was always gentle, fair and lawful. When he distributed food to the hungry, and other necessary things to the needy, he was always generous, kind and sympathetic. Before long, the one-hundredth prince gained the respect and affection of all.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Eventually, the king came to be on his deathbed. His ministers asked him who should be the next king. He said that all his one-hundred sons had a right to succeed him. It should be left up to the citizens.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">After he died, all the citizens agreed to make the one-hundredth prince their next ruler. Because of his goodness, they crowned him King Gamani the Righteous.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When the ninety-nine older brothers heard what had happened, they thought they had been insulted. Filled with envy and rage, they prepared for war. They sent a message to King Gamani, which said, "We are all your elders. Neighbour countries will laugh at us if we are ruled by the one-hundredth prince. Either you give up the kingdom or we will take it by war!"</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">After he received this message, King Gamani took it with him to his wise old teacher, and asked his advice.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It just so happened that this honorable gentle teacher was the reborn Enlightenment Being. He said, "Tell them you refuse to wage war against your brothers. Tell them you will not help them kill innocent people you have come to know and love. Tell them that, instead, you are dividing the king's wealth among all one-hundred princes. Then send each one his portion." Again the king obeyed his teacher.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Meanwhile the ninety-nine older princes had brought their ninety-nine small armies to surround the royal capital. When they received the king's message and their small portions of the royal treasure, they held a meeting. They decided that each portion was so small it was almost meaningless. Therefore, they would not accept them.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But then they realized that, in the same way, if they fought with King Gamani and then with each other, the kingdom itself would be divided into small worthless portions. Each small piece of the once-great kingdom would be weak in the face of any unfriendly country. So they sent back their portions of the royal treasure as offerings of peace, and accepted the rule of King Gamani.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><img src="http://www.buddhanet.net/images/volOne11a.gif" border="0" alt="" width="404" height="400"></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The king was pleased, and invited his brothers to the palace to celebrate the peace and unity of the kingdom. He entertained them in the most perfect ways - with generosity, pleasant conversation, providing instruction for their benefit, and treating all with even-handed courtesy.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In this way the king and the ninety-nine princes became closer as friends than they had been as brothers. They were strong in their support of each other. This was known in all the surrounding countries, so no one threatened the kingdom or its people. After a few months, the ninety-nine brothers returned to their provinces.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">King Gamani the Righteous invited his wise old teacher to live in the palace. He honored him with great wealth and many gifts. He held a celebration for his respected teacher, saying to the full court, "I, who was the one-hundredth prince, among one-hundred worthy princes, owe all my success to the wise advice of my generous and understanding teacher. Likewise, all who follow their wise teachers' advice will earn prosperity and happiness. Even the unity and strength of the kingdom, we owe to my beloved teacher."</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The kingdom prospered under the remainder of the generous and just rule of King Gamani the Righteous.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>The moral is: One is rewarded a hundred-fold for following the advice of a wise teacher.</strong></span></p>

"My boys," he said to his students, "take this goat down to the river, bathe it, brush it, hang a garland around its neck, give it some grain to eat, and bring it back."
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Yes, sir," they replied and led the goat to the river.</p>

Then, just as strangely, it started to weep loudly.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The young students were amazed at this behavior. "Why did you suddenly laugh," they asked the goat, "and why do you now cry so loudly?"</p>

I, too, sacrificed a goat as an offering for a Feast for the Dead. Because of killing that single goat, I have had my head cut off 499 times. I laughed aloud when I realized that this is my last birth as an animal to be sacrificed. Today I will be freed from my misery. On the other hand, I cried when I realized that, because of killing me, you, too, may be doomed to lose your head five hundred times. It was out of pity for you that I cried."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Well, goat," said the brahman, "in that case, I am not going to kill you."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Brahman!" exclaimed the goat. "Whether or not you kill me, I cannot escape death today."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Don't worry," the brahman assured the goat. "I will guard you."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"You don't understand," the goat told him. "Your protection is weak. The force of my evil deed is very strong."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The brahman untied the goat and said to his students, "Don't allow anyone to harm this goat." They obediently followed the animal to protect it.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">After the goat was freed, it began to graze. It stretched out its neck to reach the leaves on a bush growing near the top of a large rock. At that very instant a lightning bolt hit the rock, breaking off a sharp piece of stone which flew through the air and neatly cut off the goat's head. A crowd of people gathered around the dead goat and began to talk excitedly about the amazing accident.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">A tree deva<a id="fnt-5" class="noteTag" style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 9pt; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; color: #1e3478; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" name="fnt-5" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kawasaki/bl135.html#fn-5">[5]</a>Â had observed everything from the goat's purchase to its dramatic death, and drawing a lesson from the incident, admonished the crowd: "If people only knew that the penalty would be rebirth into sorrow, they would cease from taking life. A horrible doom awaits one who slays." With this explanation of the law of kamma the deva instilled in his listeners the fear of hell. The people were so frightened that they completely gave up the practice of animal sacrifices. The deva further instructed the people in the Precepts and urged them to do good.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Eventually, that deva passed away to fare according to his deserts. For several generations after that, people remained faithful to the Precepts and spent their lives in charity and meritorious works, so that many were reborn in the heavens.</p>
