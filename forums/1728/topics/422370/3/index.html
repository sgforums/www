              </p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE EAGLE AND THE DOVE</span></strong> - <em>a story from the Buddhist Sutra</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">In a previous life, Siddhartha Gautama was a King in a small country that was located somewhere in present day Tibet. And he was very well known among the ancient civilization for his love and compassion towards other sentient beings. So one day, Sakra Devendra, the King of Gods (<em>Note: 1</em>), decided to test him to see if he was indeed the future Buddha.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Sakra turned himself into a dove and one of his gods into an eagle. The eagle was in a hunting mood and chased the frightened dove who flied right into the King's palace. The dove cried out: "Your majesty, please save my life, because I am going to be eaten by a hungry eagle."</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">On hearing this, the compassionate King tried to chase the eagle away. But the eagle also cried out: "Your Majesty, please save my life and let me eat the dove, otherwise I will be starved to death."</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">"Why don't you eat something else rather than a dove?", asked the King.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">"Look, your Majesty", replied the eagle, "God created me so that I have to eat meet. I had no other choice."</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The King now faced a dilemma: how could he save both animals? Without hesitation, he ordered his soldiers: "Cut some flesh from my body and feed it to the eagle". Of course his soldiers were horrified to hear this. But they did obey the order and cut some flesh from the King's own body to feed the eagle. Miraculously, when the soldiers carried out the order, the King did not feel any pain at all, nor were there any blood spilling out. (Some Buddhist texts give a slight differently story. It was said that the eagle asked for some flesh equal to the weight of the dove. The soldiers put the dove on one side of a scale and the King's flesh on the other side. They continued cut out the King's flesh to feed the eagle until the scales were balanced. Then the King fainted).</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The Heavenly Emperor was convinced that the King was indeed the future Buddha. He and his god immediately reappeared as themselves and restored the King to his original health.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note 1: </span></em><em>Sakra is the leader of Trayastrimsa Heavens (33 Heavens), where all the gods live. In many Asian cultures, he is also known by other titles such as Emperor Sakra, Heavenly Emperor, Emperor on High, etc., and sometimes Taoists say that he is also Jade Emperor.</em></p>

              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">One day, a fire brokes out in the house of a wealthy man who had many children. The wealthy man shouts at his children inside the burning house to flee. But, the children are absorbed in their games and cannot understand his warning, though the house is being consumed by flames.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">Then, the wealthy man devises a practical way to lure the children from the burning house. Knowing that the children are fond of interesting playthings, he calls out to them, “Listen! Outside the gate are the carts that you have always wanted: carts pulled by goats, carts pulled by deer, and carts pulled by oxen. Why dont you come out and play with them?" <br>The wealthy man knows that these things will be irresistible to his children.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">The children immediately race out to get into the carts. In this way, the wealthy man is able to get his children safely away from the burning house.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">Once outside, the children demand the carts they have been promised. Instead, the wealthy man gives them a much finer and larger cart — one that runs as swiftly as the wind — adorned with many jewels and drawn by a great white ox. This cart is called the Great White Ox Cart.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;"><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">The wealthy man can be compared to the Buddha, and the children to the people. The burning house indicates the real world where sufferings abound. The goat, deer, and ox carts represent the early teachings of Buddhism. In those previous teachings the goal was to attain the levels of Learning, Realization, or Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; margin: 0px;">Once those levels were reached, the Buddha"s followers were then ready to hear about the highest teaching, the Lotus Sutra. The Great White Ox Cart is compared to the teaching of the Lotus Sutra, which opens the direct way to Buddhahood.</p>

              </p><p><strong>GOLD FINGER</strong> - <em>a Zen Buddhism Koan</em> <br></p>
              <p>One day, one of the eight immortals <em>(Note 1)</em>, Lu Dongbin, came down to the Saha World <em>(Note 2)</em> to help people out who were in great difficulties. While he was on the way, he met a youth sitting by the road side crying heavily. He approached the youth and asked him, "Mister, why are you crying? Do you have any difficulties?" <br></p>
              <p>"My mother is very sick and my father had passed away. I do not have any money to hire a doctor to see her. I want to go to work but nobody will take care of my mother while I am away?" <br></p>
              <p>The immortal was very touched by the fidelity of this youth and therefore he decided to help him out by performing a miracle. He pointed his finger at a piece of stone by the road side and turned it into gold immediately. Then he gave the piece of gold to the youth. To his surprise the youth refused to accept it. <br></p>
              <p>The immortal was even touched, because the youth must be a devout Buddhist, renouncing wealth. "Why don't you accept the piece of gold. It should keep your family going for a long time." <br></p>
              <p>The youth replied, "If I accept it, sooner or later I will spend it all. Therefore, I do not want the piece of gold. I want your finger, because I can use it to turn everything into gold and I will be the richest man on earth." <br></p>
              <p>Upon hearing this, the immortal gave a sigh at the greediness of human beings, restored the piece of gold back to stone, and returned to heaven.</p>

              <p><em>Note 1: Eight immortals: In Chinese folk religion, the eight immortals are human beings who became deities or fairies through the rites of Taoism. An immortal is different from a god in that the immortal seldom got involved in earthly matters. A god (such as the Thunderer) is responsible for certain aspects of life on earth.</em></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>King Banyan Deer</strong><br>[Chapter 1. Compassion]</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Once upon a time, an unusual and beautiful deer was born in the forests near Benares, in northern India. Although he was as big as a young colt, it was easy for his mother to give birth to him. When he opened his eyes, they were as bright as sparkling jewels. His mouth was as red as the reddest forest berries. His hoofs were as black as polished coal. His little horns glistened like silver. And his color was golden, like a perfect summer's dawn. As he grew up, a herd of 500 deer gathered around him, and he became known as King Banyan Deer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Meanwhile, not far away, another beautiful buck deer was born, just as splendidly golden in color. In time, a separate herd of 500 deer came to follow him, and he was known as Branch Deer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The King of Benares, at that time, was very fond of eating venison. So he regularly hunted and killed deer. Each time he hunted, he went to a different village and ordered the people to serve him. They had to stop what they were doing, whether plowing or harvesting or whatever, and work in the king's hunting party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The people's lives were upset by these interruptions. They grew less crops, and other businesses also had less income. So they came together and decided to build a large deer park for the king, at Benares. There he could hunt by himself, with no need to command the services of the villagers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">So the people built a deer park. They made ponds where the deer could drink, and added trees and grasses for them to eat from. When it was ready, they opened the gate and went out into the nearby forests. They surrounded the entire herds of Banyan and Branch deer. Then, with sticks and weapons and noise makers, they drove them all into the deer park trap, and locked the gate behind them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">After the deer had settled down, the people went to the king and said, "Our crops and income have suffered because of your hunting requirements. Now we have made you a pleasant safe deer park, where you can hunt by yourself as you like. With no need of our aid, you can enjoy both the hunting and the eating of deer."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The king went to the new deer park. There he was pleased to see the vast herds. While watching them, his eye was caught by the two magnificent golden deer, with large fully grown antlers. Because he admired their unusual beauty, the king granted immunity to these two alone. He ordered that they should be completely safe. No one could harm or kill them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Once a day the king would come and kill a deer for his dinner table. Sometimes, when he was too busy, the royal cook would do this. The body would then be brought to the chopping block to be butchered for the oven.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Whenever the deer saw the bow and arrows, they went into a panic, trembling for their lives. They ran around wildly, some being injured and some wounded, many suffering great pain.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One day, King Banyan Deer's herd gathered around him. He called Branch Deer, and the two herds joined for a meeting. King Banyan Deer addressed them. "Although in the end, there is no escape from death, this needless suffering due to injuries and wounds can be prevented. Since the king only wishes the meat of one deer per day, let one be chosen by us each day to submit himself to the chopping block. One day from my herd, and the next day from Branch Deer's herd, the victim's lot will fall to one deer at a time."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Branch Deer agreed. From then on, the one whose turn it was, meekly surrendered himself and laid his neck on the block. The cook came each day, simply killed the waiting victim, and prepared the king's venison.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One day, the turn fell by chance to a pregnant doe in Branch Deer's herd. Caring for the others as well as herself and the unborn one, she went to Branch Deer and said, "My lord, I am pregnant. Grant that I may live until I have delivered my fawn. Then we will fill two turns rather than just one. This will save a turn, and thereby a single life for one long day."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Branch Deer replied, "No, no, I cannot change the rules in midstream and put your turn upon another. The pregnancy is yours, the babe is your responsibility. Now leave me."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Having failed with Branch Deer, the poor mother doe went to King Banyan Deer and explained her plight. He replied gently, "Go in peace. I will change the rules in midstream and put your turn upon another."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">And the deer king went to the executioner's block, and laid down his own golden neck upon it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A silence fell in the deer park. And some who tell this story even say that silence also fell in other worlds not seen from here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Soon the royal cook came to kill the willing victim on the block. But when he saw it was one of the two golden deer the king had ordered spared, he was afraid to kill him. So he went and told the King of Benares.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The king was surprised, so he went to the park. He said to the golden deer, still lying on the block, "Oh king of deer, did I not promise to spare your life? What is the reason you come here like the others?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">King Banyan Deer replied, "Oh king of men, this time a pregnant doe was unlucky enough to be the one to die. She pleaded for me to spare her, for the sake of others as well as her unborn baby and herself. I could not help but feel myself in her place, and feel her suffering. I could not help but weep, to think the little one would never see the dawn, would never taste the dew. And yet, I could not force the pain of death on another, relieved to think it was not his turn today. So, mighty king, I offer my life for the sake of the doe and her unborn fawn. Be assured there is no other reason."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The King of Benares was overwhelmed. Powerful as he was, a tear rolled down his cheek. Then he said, "Oh great lord, the golden king of deer, even among human beings, I have not seen any such as you! Such great compassion, to share in the suffering of others! Such great generosity, to give your life for others! Such great kindness and tender love for all your fellow deer! Arise."</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.buddhanet.net/images/volOne14a.gif" border="0" alt="" width="404" height="300"></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"I decree that you will never be killed by me or anyone else in my kingdom. And, so too, the doe and her babe."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Without yet raising his head, the golden one said, "Are only we to be saved? What of the other deer in the park, our friends and kin?" The king said, "My lord, I cannot refuse you, I grant safety and freedom to all the deer in the park." "And what of the deer outside the park, will they be killed?" asked Banyan. "No my lord, I spare all the deer in my whole kingdom."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Still the golden deer did not raise up his head. He pleaded, "So the deer will be safe, but what will the other four-footed animals do?" "My lord, from now on they too are safe in my land." "And what of the birds? They too want to live." "Yes, my lord, the birds too will be safe from death at the hands of men." "And what of the fish, who live in the water?" "Even the fish will be free to live, my lord." So saying, the King of Benares granted immunity from hunting and killing to all the animals in his land.</span></p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Out of compassion and gratitude, King Banyan Deer the Enlightenment Being, taught the King of Benares. He advised him to climb the five steps of training, in order to purify his mind. He described them by saying, "It will benefit you, if you give up the five unwholesome actions. These are:</span></p>
              <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">destroying life, for this is not compassion;</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">taking what is not given, for this is not generosity;</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">doing wrong in sexual ways, for this is not loving-kindness;</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">speaking falsely, for this is not Truth;</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">losing your mind from alcohol, for this leads to falling down the first four steps."</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">He further advised him to do wholesome actions, that would bring happiness in this life and beyond. Then King Banyan Deer, and both herds, returned to the forest.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the fullness of time, the pregnant doe, who had stayed with Banyan's herd, gave birth to a fawn. He was as beautiful as a lotus blossom given as an offering to the gods.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When the fawn had grown into a young buck deer, he began playing with Branch Deer's herd. Seeing this, his mother said to him, "Better to die after a short life with the great compassionate one, than to live a long life with an ordinary one." Afterwards, her son lived happily in the herd of King Banyan Deer.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The only ones left unhappy were the farmers and villagers of the kingdom. For, given total immunity by the king, the deer began to fearlessly eat the people's crops. They even grazed in the vegetable gardens inside the villages and the city of Benares itself!</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">So the people complained to the king, and asked permission to kill at least some of the deer as a warning. But the king said, "I myself promised complete immunity to King Banyan Deer. I would give up the kingship before I would break my word to him. No one may harm a deer!"</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When King Banyan Deer heard of this, he said to all the deer, "You should not eat the crops that belong to others." And he sent a message to the people. Instead of making fences, he asked them to tie up bunches of leaves as boundaries around their fields. This began the Indian custom of marking fields with tied up leaves, which have protected them from deer to this very day.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Both King Banyan Deer and the King of Benares lived out their lives in peace, died, and were reborn as they deserved.</span></p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>The moral is: Wherever it is found, compassion is a sign of greatness.</strong></span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em;">There was once a pond far from the highway, and in it lived three fish in peace and happiness. Now one of these fish always used his wits; the second used his sometimes, but the third never used his at all. One day two fishermen chanced on this pond, and saw the three fish, which were large and fat.</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">"Quick, let us return home and bring our nets," they cried. "Here is a fine catch!"</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">When the three fish heard these words, they lay still in terror. Then the fish who always made use of his wits resolved at once what he would do. Without stopping to consult his brothers, he swam quickly to the outlet of the pond and was soon out of harm's way.</p>
              <p class="i" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; text-indent: 1em;">Soon after this, the fishermen returned and missed one of the fish. They at once looked about for an outlet, and when they had discovered it, stopped it up. There now seemed no escape for the other two. In desperation, the fish who sometimes used his wits began to float on his back on the top of the water. The fishermen picked him up, and so well did he play his part that they threw him back into the pond, supposing he was dead. Meanwhile the fish who never used his wits sank to the bottom, where he was easily caught, and was served that very day on the king's table.</p>

              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">Once upon a time in China there lived a certain king who had three daughters. The fairest and best of these was Kwan-yin, the youngest. The old king was justly proud of this daughter, for of all the women who had ever lived in the palace she was by far the most attractive. It did not take him long, therefore, to decide that she should be the heir to his throne, and her husband ruler of his kingdom. But, strange to say, Kwan-yin was not pleased at this good fortune. She cared little for the pomp and splendor of court life. She foresaw no pleasure for herself in ruling as a queen, but even feared that in so high a station she might feel out of place and unhappy.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">Every day she went to her room to read and study. As a result of this daily labor she soon went far beyond her sisters along the paths of knowledge, and her name was known in the farthest corner of the kingdom as "Kwan-yin, the wise princess." Besides being very fond of books, Kwan-yin was thoughtful of her friends. She was careful about her behavior both in public and in private. Her warm heart was open at all times to the cries of those in trouble. She was kind to the poor and suffering. She won the love of the lower classes, and was to them a sort of goddess to whom they could appeal whenever they were hungry and in need. Some people even believed that she was a fairy who had come to earth from her home within the Western Heaven, while others said that once, long years before, she had lived in the world as a prince instead of a princess. However this may be, one thing is certain - Kwan-yin was pure and good, and well deserved the praises that were showered upon her.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">One day the king called this favorite daughter to the royal bedside, for he felt that the hour of death was drawing near. Kwan-yin kowtowed before her royal father, kneeling and touching her forehead on the floor in sign of deepest reverence. The old man bade her rise and come closer. Taking her hand tenderly in his own, he said, "Daughter, you know well how I love you. Your modesty and virtue, your talent and your love of knowledge, have made you first in my heart. As you know already, I chose you as heir to my kingdom long ago. I promised that your husband should be made ruler in my stead. The time is almost ripe for me to ascend upon the dragon and become a guest on high. It is necessary that you be given at once in marriage."</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"But, most exalted father," faltered the princess, "I am not ready to be married."</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"Not ready, child! Why, are you not eighteen? Are not the daughters of our nation often wedded long before they reach that age? Because of your desire for learning I have spared you thus far from any thought of a husband, but now we can wait no longer."</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"Royal father, hear your child, and do not compel her to give up her dearest pleasures. Let her go into a quiet convent where she may lead a life of study!"</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">The king sighed deeply at hearing these words. He loved his daughter and did not wish to wound her. "Kwan-yin," he continued, "do you wish to pass by the green spring of youth, to give up this mighty kingdom? Do you wish to enter the doors of a convent where women say farewell to life and all its pleasures? No! your father will not permit this. It grieves me sorely to disappoint you, but one month from this very day you shall be married. I have chosen for your royal partner a man of many noble parts. You know him by name already, although you have not seen him. Remember that, of the hundred virtues filial conduct is the chief, and that you owe more to me than to all else on earth."</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">Kwan-yin turned pale. Trembling, she would have sunk to the floor, but her mother and sisters supported her, and by their tender care brought her back to consciousness.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">Every day of the month that followed, Kwan-yin's relatives begged her to give up what they called her foolish notion. Her sisters had long since given up hope of becoming queen. They were amazed at her stupidity. The very thought of any one's choosing a convent instead of a throne was to them a sure sign of madness. Over and over again they asked her reason for making so strange a choice. To every question, she shook her head, replying, "A voice from the heavens speaks to me, and I must obey it."</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">On the eve of the wedding day Kwan-yin slipped out of the palace, and, after a weary journey, arrived at a convent called, "The Cloister of the White Sparrow." She was dressed as a poor maiden. She said she wished to become a nun. The abbess, not knowing who she was, did not receive her kindly. Indeed, she told Kwan-yin that they could not receive her into the sisterhood, that the building was full. Finally, after Kwan-yin had shed many tears, the abbess let her enter, but only as a sort of servant, who might be cast out for the slightest fault.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">Now that Kwan-yin found herself in the life which she had long dreamt of leading, she tried to be satisfied. But the nuns seemed to wish to make her stay among them most miserable. They gave her the hardest tasks to do, and it was seldom that she had a minute to rest. All day long she was busy, carrying water from a well at the foot of the convent hill or gathering wood from a neighboring forest. At night when her back was almost breaking, she was given many extra tasks, enough to have crushed the spirit of any other woman than this brave daughter of a king. Forgetting her grief, and trying to hide the lines of pain that sometimes wrinkled her fair forehead, she tried to make these hard-hearted women love her. In return for their rough words, she spoke to them kindly, and never did she give way to anger.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">One day while poor Kwan-yin was picking up brushwood in the forest she heard a tiger making his way through the bushes. Having no means of defending herself, she breathed a silent prayer to the gods for help, and calmly awaited the coming of the great beast. To her surprise, when the bloodthirsty animal appeared, instead of bounding up to tear her in pieces, he began to make a soft purring noise. He did not try to hurt Kwan-yin, but rubbed against her in a friendly manner, and let her pat him on the head.</p>

              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">The next day the princess went back to the same spot. There she found no fewer than a dozen savage beasts working under the command of the friendly tiger, gathering wood for her. In a short time enough brush and firewood had been piled up to last the convent for six months. Thus, even the wild animals of the forest were better able to judge of her goodness than the women of the sisterhood.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">At another time when Kwan-yin was toiling up the hill for the twentieth time, carrying two great pails of water on a pole, an enormous dragon faced her in the road. Now, in China, the dragon is sacred, and Kwan-yin was not at all frightened, for she knew that she had done no wrong.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">The animal looked at her for a moment, switched its horrid tail, and shot out fire from its nostrils. Then, dashing the burden from the startled maiden's shoulder, it vanished. Full of fear, Kwan-yin hurried up the hill to the nunnery. As she drew near the inner court, she was amazed to see in the center of the open space a new building of solid stone. It had sprung up by magic since her last journey down the hill. On going forward, she saw that there were four arched doorways to the fairy house. Above the door facing west was a tablet with these words written on it: "In honor of Kwan-yin, the faithful princess." Inside was a well of the purest water, while, for drawing this water, there a strange machine, the like of which neither Kwan-yin nor the nuns had ever seen.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">The sisters knew that this magic well was a monument to Kwan-yin's goodness. For a few days they treated her much better. "Since the gods have dug a well at our very gate," they said, "this girl will no longer need to bear water from the foot of the hill. For what strange reason, however, did the gods write this beggar's name on the stone?"</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">Kwan-yin heard their unkind remarks in silence. She could have explained the meaning of the dragon's gift, but she chose to let her companions remain in ignorance. At last the selfish nuns began to grow careless again, and treated her even worse than before. They could not bear to see the poor girl enjoy a moment's idleness.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"This is a place for work," they told her. "All of us have labored hard to win our present station. You must do likewise." So they robbed her of every chance for study and prayer, and gave her no credit for the magic well.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">One night the sisters were awakened from their sleep by strange noises, and soon they heard outside the walls of the compound the blare of a trumpet. A great army had been sent by Kwan-yin's father to attack the convent, for his spies had at last been able to trace the runaway princess to this holy retreat.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"Oh, who has brought this woe upon us?" exclaimed all the women, looking at each other in great fear. "Who has done this great evil? There is one among us who has sinned most terribly, and now the gods are about to destroy us." They gazed at one another, but no one thought of Kwan-yin, for they did not believe her of enough importance to attract the anger of heaven, even though she might have done the most shocking of deeds. Then, too, she had been so meek and lowly while in their holy order that they did not once dream of charging her with any crime.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">The threatening sounds outside grew louder and louder. All at once a fearful cry arose among the women: "They are about to burn our sacred dwelling." Smoke was rising just beyond the enclosure where the soldiers were kindling a great fire, the heat of which would soon be great enough to make the convent walls crumble into dust.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">Suddenly a voice was heard above the tumult of the weeping sisters: "Alas! I am the cause of all this trouble."</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">The nuns, turning in amazement, saw that it was Kwan-yin who was speaking. "You?" they exclaimed, astounded.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"Yes, I, for I am indeed the daughter of a king. My father did not wish me to take the vows of this holy order. I fled from the palace. He has sent his army here to burn these buildings and to drag me back a prisoner."</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"Then, see what you have brought upon us, miserable girl!" exclaimed the abbess. "See how you have repaid our kindness! Our buildings will be burned above our heads! How wretched you have made us! May heaven's curses rest upon you!"</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"No, no!" exclaimed Kwan-yin, springing up, and trying to keep the abbess from speaking these frightful words. "You have no right to say that, for I am innocent of evil. But, wait! You shall soon see whose prayers the gods will answer, yours or mine!" So saying, she pressed her forehead to the floor, praying the almighty powers to save the convent and the sisters.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">Outside the crackling of the greedy flames could already be heard. The fire king would soon destroy every building on that hill-top. Mad with terror, the sisters prepared to leave the compound and give up all their belongings to the cruel flames and still more cruel soldiers. Kwan-yin alone remained in the room, praying earnestly for help.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">Suddenly a soft breeze sprang up from the neighboring forest, dark clouds gathered overhead, and, although it was the dry season a drenching shower descended on the flames. Within five minutes the fire was put out and the convent was saved. Just as the shivering nuns were thanking Kwan-yin for the divine help she had brought them, two soldiers who had scaled the outer wall of the compound came in and roughly asked for the princess.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">The trembling girl, knowing that these men were obeying her father's orders, poured out a prayer to the gods, and straightway made herself known. They dragged her from the presence of the nuns who had just begun to love her. Thus disgraced before her father's army, she was taken to the capital.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">On the morrow, she was led before the old king. The father gazed sadly at his daughter, and then the stern look of a judge hardened his face as he beckoned the guards to bring her forward.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">From a neighboring room came the sounds of sweet music. A feast was being served there amid great splendor. The loud laughter of the guests reached the ears of the young girl as she bowed in disgrace before her father's throne. She knew that this feast had been prepared for her, and that her father was willing to give her one more chance.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"Girl," said the king, at last regaining his voice, "in leaving the royal palace on the eve of your wedding day, not only did you insult your father, but your king. For this act you deserve to die. However, because of the excellent record you had made for yourself before you ran away, I have decided to give you one more chance to redeem yourself. Refuse me, and the penalty is death: obey me, and all may yet be well - the kingdom that you spurned is still yours for the asking. All that I require is your marriage to the man whom I have chosen."</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"And when, most august King, would you have me decide?" asked Kwan-yin earnestly.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"This very day, this very hour, this very moment," he answered sternly. "What! would you hesitate between love upon a throne and death? Speak, my daughter, tell me that you love me and will do my bidding!"</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">It was now all that Kwan-yin could do to keep from throwing herself at her father's feet and yielding to his wishes, not because he offered her a kingdom, but because she loved him and would gladly have made him happy. But her strong will kept her from relenting. No power on earth could have stayed her from doing what she thought her duty.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"Beloved father," she answered sadly, and her voice was full of tenderness, "it is not a question of my love for you - of that there is no question, for all my life I have shown it in every action. Believe me, if I were free to do your bidding, gladly would I make you happy, but a voice from the gods has spoken, has commanded that I remain a virgin, that I devote my life to deeds of mercy. When heaven itself has commanded, what can even a princess do but listen to that power which rules the earth?"</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">The old king was far from satisfied with Kwan-yin's answer. He grew furious, his thin wrinkled skin turned purple as the hot blood rose to his head. "Then you refuse to do my bidding! Take her, men! Give to her the death that is due to a traitor to the king!" As they bore Kwan-yin away from his presence the white-haired monarch fell, swooning, from his chair.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">That night, when Kwan-yin was put to death, she descended into the lower world of torture. No sooner had she set foot in that dark country of the dead than the vast region of endless punishment suddenly blossomed forth and became like the gardens of Paradise. Pure white lilies sprang up on every side, and the odor of a million flowers filled all the rooms and corridors. King Yama, ruler of the dominion, rushed forth to learn the cause of this wonderful change. No sooner did his eyes rest upon the fair young face of Kwan-yin than he saw in her the emblem of a purity which deserved no home but heaven.</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">"Beautiful virgin, doer of many mercies," he began, after addressing her by her title, "I beg you in the name of justice to depart from this bloody kingdom. It is not right that the fairest flower of heaven should enter and shed her fragrance in these halls. Guilt must suffer here, and sin find no reward. Depart thou, then, from my dominion. The peach of immortal life shall be bestowed upon you, and heaven alone shall be your dwelling place."</p>
              <p class="printables" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #000066;">Thus Kwan-yin became the Goddess of Mercy; thus she entered into that glad abode, surpassing all earthly kings and queens. And ever since that time, on account of her exceeding goodness, thousands of poor people breathe out to her each year their prayers for mercy. There is no fear in their gaze as they look at her beautiful image, for their eyes are filled with tears of love.</p>

              </p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">        At the time of Buddha, there lived an old beggar woman called "Relying on Joy". She used to watch the kings, princes, and people making offerings to Buddha and his disciples, and there was nothing she would have liked more than to be able to do the same. So she went out begging, but at the end of a whole day all she had was one small coin. She took it to the oil-merchant to try to buy some oil. He told her that she could not possibly buy anything with so little. But when he heard that she wanted it to make an offering to Buddha, he took pity on her and gave her the oil she wanted. She took it to the monastery, where she lit a lamp. She placed it before Buddha, and made this wish:"I have nothing to offer but this tiny lamp. But through this offering, in the future may I be blessed with the lamp of wisdom. May I free all beings from their darkness. May I purify all their obstructions, and lead them to enlightenment." <br>        That night the oil in all the other lamps went out. But the beggar woman's lamp was still burning at dawn, when Buddha's disciple Maudgalyayana came to collect all the lamps. When he saw that one was still alight, full of oil and with a new wick, he thought,"There's no reason why this lamp should still be burning in the day time," and he tried to blow it out. But it kept on burning. He tried to snuff it out with his fingers, but it stayed alight. He tried to smother it with his robe, but still it burned on. The Buddha had been watching all along, and said,"Maudgalyayana, do you want to put out that lamp? You cannot. You cannot even move it, let alone put it out. If you were to pour the water from all ocean over this lamp, it still wouldn't go out. The water in all the rivers and the lakes of the world could not extinguish it. Why not? Because this lamp was offered with devotion and with purity of heart and mind. And that motivation has made it of tremendous benefit." When Buddha had said this, the beggar woman approached him, and he made a prophesy that in the future she would become a perfect buddha, call "Light of the Lamp." <br>        So it is our motivation, good or bad, that determines the fruit of our actions.</p>

One of his ministers was called the Royal Price Maker, and he was a very honest man. His job was to set a fair price for anything the king wanted to buy or sell.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">On some occasions, the king did not like his price making. He did not get as big a profit as he wanted. He did not want to pay so much when he bought, or sell for what he thought was not enough. So he decided to change the price maker.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">One day he saw a nice looking young man and he thought, "This fellow will be good for my price making position." So he dismissed his former honest price maker, and appointed this man to be the new one. The man thought, "I must make the king happy by buying at very low prices and selling at very high prices." So he made the prices ridiculous, without caring at all what anything was worth. This gained the greedy king a lot of money, and made him very happy. Meanwhile, all the others who dealt with the new price maker, including the king's other ministers and ordinary people, became very unhappy.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">Then one day a horse merchant arrived in Benares with 500 horses to sell. There were stallions, mares and colts. The king invited the merchant to the palace, and called upon his Royal Price Maker to set a price for all 500 horses. Thinking only of pleasing the king, he said,</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">"The entire herd of horses is worth one cup of rice."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">So the king ordered that one cup of rice be paid to the horse dealer, and all the horses were taken to the royal stables.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">Of course the merchant was very upset, but he could do nothing at the moment. Later he heard about the former price maker, who had a reputation for being very fair and honest. So he approached him and told him what had happened. He wanted to hear his opinion, in order to get a proper price from the king. The former price maker said,</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">"If you do as I say, the king will be convinced of the true value of the horses. Go back to the price maker and satisfy him with a valuable gift. Ask him to tell the value of one cup of rice, in the presence of the king. If he agrees, come and tell me. I will go with you to the king."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">Following this advice, the merchant went to the price maker and gave him a valuable gift. The gift made him very happy, so that he saw the value of pleasing the horse dealer. Then the merchant said to him,</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">"I was very happy with your previous evaluation. Can you please convince the king of the value of one cup of rice?"</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">The foolish price maker said, 'Why not? I will explain the worth of one cup of rice, even in the presence of the king."</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">So the price maker thought the horse dealer was satisfied with his cup of rice. He arranged for another meeting with the king, as the merchant was departing for his own country. The merchant reported back to the old price maker, and they went together to see the king.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">All the king's ministers and his full court were in the royal meeting hall. The horse merchant said to the king,</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">"My lord, I understand that in this your country, my whole herd of 500 horses is worth one cup of rice. Before I leave for home, I want to know the value of one cup of rice in your country."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">The king turned to his loyal price maker and said,</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">"What is the value of one cup of rice?"</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">The foolish price maker, in order to please the king, had previously priced the herd of horses at one cup of rice. Now, after receiving a bribe from the horse dealer, he wanted to please him too. So he replied to the king, in his most dignified manner,</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">"Your worship, one cup of rice is worth the city of Benares, including even your own harem, as well as all the suburbs of the city. In other words, it is worth the whole kingdom of Benares!"</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">On hearing this, the royal ministers and wise men in the assembly hall started to roar with laughter, slapping their sides with their hands. When they calmed down a little, they said,</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">"Earlier we heard that the kingdom was priceless. Now we hear that all Benares, with its palaces and mansions, is worth only a cup of rice! The decision of the Royal Price Maker is so strange! Where did your highness find such a man? He is good only for pleasing a king such as you, not for making fair prices for a merchant who sells his horses from country to country."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;">Hearing the laughter of his whole court, and the words of his ministers and advisers, the king was ashamed. So he brought back his former price maker to his official position. He agreed to a new fair price for the herd of horses, as set by the honest price maker. Having learned a lesson, the king and his kingdom lived justly and prospered.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; letter-spacing: 0.02em; font-family: 'Times new Roman'; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;"><em>The moral is: A fool in high office can bring shame even to a king.</em></p>

              </p><p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: x-small;"><strong>A COLLECTION OF STORIES IN BUDDHISM</strong></span></p>
              <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: x-small;">
              <p>This is a Collection of Stories from Buddhism including Sutra, Koans, Folk Legends and other fun Stuff. Most people are aware of the stories from the Christian Bible, such as Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, Samson and Delilah, etc., thanks to the aggressive propaganda machines of Christianity. But not many people know any stories from the Buddhist Sutra, especially Westerners who seldom encountered the Dharma. Thus it is my purpose here to collect some interesting stories from Buddhism.</p>
              </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: x-small;">I am trying to tell each story in simple English. (NOTE, <strong>new feature:</strong> <em>Some</em> stories are available in modern Chinese writing style, in Big_5 code traditional characters). I dramatize it a little bit to make it interesting, but for each story, I will try to keep the main theme. Most Buddhist stories are parables concerned with the philosophy of life, rather than with the devotion to a Supreme God. I will however, leave the interpretation to you.</span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHO IS THE BODHISATTVA OF COMPASSION?</span></strong> - <em>A Zen Buddhism Koan</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">A Buddhist was a very devout follower of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (of Compassion, also known as Guan Yin in Chinese). One day, the village in which he lived was flooded by a overflowing river, and the water was rising rapidly. He escaped to the roof top of his house and prayed to the Bodhisattva for help, because according to the Lotus Sutra, when the Bodhisattva of Compassion hears the cries of the world, she will come down to help anybody in despair.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">As he was praying to the Bodhisattva, a native Indian rowed a canoe along the flooded river and cried out, "Hi. Fellow, do you need a ride in my canoe?" He did not like natives because most of them are not Buddhist and so he replied, " No. I do not need your help. The Bodhisattva will come and help me out." And he continued to pray to the Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">After a while, an Anglo Saxon American arrived in a speed boat and cried out, "Hi! Do you need help? If you do, just come and ride in my speed boat." But he did not like white people either because most of them are Christians. So he refused his help also.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Next, a helicopter flied above the house and the pilot shouted to him, "Do you want to come fly with me?" But he thought that Buddhist should live a simple life, free from high technology. So he replied, "No thank you. I am sure the Bodhisattva will safe my life, if I pray to her." The pilot left.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Finally, the house gave way to the flood, and he was drowned. After his death he went before King Yama (the God of Hell) and filed a complaint, "According to the Lotus Sutra, the Bodhisattva of Compassion promises to come and save my life whenever I pray to her. Why did she break her promise?"</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">King Yama replied, "the Bodhisattva did appear to help you out three times. First, she appeared as a Native, then as a Anglo Saxon, then as a pilot. But you did not recognize her and refused her help. Therefore I have to dismiss your complaint. However, since you have read the Lotus Sutra, you do not have to stay here. I will arrange your rebirth as soon as possible. You may go now." </p>

              <p>Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868-1912), received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.</p>
              <p>Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept on pouring.</p>
              <p>The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself. "It is overfull. No more will go in!"</p>
              <p>"Like this cup," Nan-in said, "you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?"</p>

As the Exalted One saw men punished and persecuted under the rule of these wicked kings, he was moved to compassion. And he considered thus within himself, "Is it not possible to exercise sovereignty without killing or causing to kill, without conquering or causing to conquer, without sorrow or causing sorrow, with justice and righteousness?" Now Mara the Evil One perceived within himself the thought that was passing through the mind of the Exalted One, and he reflected thus, "The monk Gotama is considering within himself, 'Is it not possible to exercise sovereignty?' It must be that he now desires to exercise sovereignty. And this thing which is called sovereignty is an occasion of heedlessness. If he does exercise sovereignty, I may be able to catch him off his guard. I will therefore go and arouse his ambition."<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 9pt; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; color: #1e3478; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/burlingame/wheel324.html#fn-1">[1]</a></p>

Said the Teacher to Mara, "Evil One, what do you see in me that makes you speak thus to me?" Said Mara to the Teacher, "Reverend sir, the Exalted One has developed to the full the four bases of spiritual power. For should the Exalted One resolve, 'Let the Himalaya, king of mountains, be turned to gold,' that mountain would turn to gold. I, too, will do with this wealth all those things which can be done with wealth. Thus you shall rule justly and righteously." Then said the Teacher:</p>

              Happiness is it to serve one's mother here,

The children decided to<br>pick on them. One of them stood in the middle of the road to block<br>their passage and asked, "When will it turn cold?" <br><br><br><br>The cultivator in the front answered with smile, "It doesn't matter<br>whether it's spring, summer, fall, or winter, when there are wind and<br>rain, it will turn chilly." These naughty children then let them pass.<br>But these children soon ran after them and blocked the second<br>cultivator from passing by. A child asked the second cultivator: "When<br>will it turn cold?" "Winter is the cold season and because of the<br>revolution of constellation. When earth is further away from the sun<br>during winder, it turns cold. Only an imbecile doesn't know that."<br><br>    <br><br>Upon hearing this, children threw stones at the second cultivator who<br>was trailing behind. Shelifu was the one in front and Mujianlian was<br>the one trailing behind.<br><br><br><br>Among the sixteen disciples of Sakyamuni who had superb achievements,<br>Shelifu and Mujianlian were the most outstanding ones, especially when<br>it came to their supernormal abilities. <br><br><br><br>Mujianlian possessed incredible supernormal abilities. When he pressed<br>his toe on the palace of the Celestial Ruler, he could shake the<br>palace, or even make it collapse. Why didn't he apply his supernormal<br>abilities to deal with those naughty children?<br><br><br><br>Mujianlian and Shelifu were frequently in each other's company. They<br>traveled together to heaven, on earth, the hell, and the animal<br>kingdom. They used their supernormal abilities and wisdom to save<br>suffering people and enlighten ignorant sentient beings. <br><br><br><br>Once, they traveled to the Deepest Inferno of Hell. It was super hot<br>inside. Hot flames from frying pans filled the air in hell. The poor<br>creatures who were receiving this physical punishment were wailing and<br>howling in pain. Shelifu and Mujianlian sprayed fresh and cool<br>beneficent rain on them to mitigate their pain for a short while.<br><br><br><br>At that moment, they saw a terrible sinner with a thick body and a<br>large and long tongue. Five hundred iron plows were placed on the top<br>of his tongue. He was using the plows on his tongue to plow a piece of<br>desolate land. Fresh blood droplets were dripping from the tongue. As<br>soon as the sinner saw Shelifu and Mujianlian, he hurried over to them<br>and cried out, "Honorable Monks, My name is Bulinu. I was a preacher of<br>paganism. I used to promote witchcraft and slander Buddhism when I was<br>alive. As a result, I am suffering from this kind of retribution in<br>hell. If you pass by the Nanzhanbu, please be sure to tell my disciples<br>not to worship the thing I put in the wooden pagoda anymore. It will<br>only increase my suffering. Also tell them not to slander Buddhism and<br>cheat people any more so they don't follow my footsteps and fall into<br>such a state. I beg you." <br><br><br><br>When the two cultivators returned to Wangshe City, they met a group of<br>non-Buddhists. All of them carried walking sticks and big sticks and<br>used the sticks as weapons to intercept and attack passer-by monks.<br>Shelifu was the one walking in the front. When those non-Buddhists<br>wielded their weapons to attack the two, Shelifu spoke them with a mild<br>manner. They stopped and let Shelifu pass by. But when Mujianlian<br>approached them, they again raised their weapons.<br><br>    <br><br> "Wait!" Mujianlinan raised his hands to stop them and said, "Both<br>of us just returned from the Deepest Inferno of Hell. We saw your<br>master Bulinu in there suffering great retribution. He is using iron<br>plows placed on top of his tongue to plow land. Fresh blood is oozing<br>from his tongue. He is suffering a great deal. He told me to pass on<br>the message to you to stop slandering Buddhism and stop spreading<br>paganism so that you do not follow his footsteps. In the mean time, you<br>also need to stop worshiping the thing in the wooden pagoda to reduce<br>his suffering." Mujianlian passed on the message hoping that they would<br>repent and dispel mutual animosity between the two groups. But as soon<br>as he finished his words, they attacked him with beastlike ferocity.<br><br><br><br>"Beat him up! He slandered our master. Beat him up. Beat this monk!"<br><br><br><br>Wooden bats and hand sticks fell on Mujianlian like raindrops. His whole body was beaten black and blue.<br><br><br><br>Many people saw what happened to Mujianlian and started to have doubts about his supernormal abilities.<br><br><br><br>Buddha Sakyamuni said, "Mujianlian's supernormal ability is not a sham.<br>He can go to heaven and go under the earth. He can bypass any<br>obstruction. He has unbelievable abilities. His supernormal abilities<br>haven't disappeared. In facing his own karma, he knows he must pay back<br>his karmic debt. No one can violate the rule of karma. When karma<br>comes, one needs to endure it. Complying with preordained fate conforms<br>to the rules of the Fa. Everyone needs to understand that when one's<br>karma comes, don't try to escape or hold grudges. One needs to clearly<br>understand how scary creating karma is, cultivate diligently, and be<br>cautious about one's conduct.  <br><br><br><br>Mujianlian had a vast amount of supernormal power. But he didn't use it<br>to shield his own faults and avoid retribution of his karma. He<br>established a good example for us.<br><br><br><br>Translated from: <br><br><a style="color: #16387c; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.zhengjian.org/zj/articles/2006/7/4/38334.html">http://www.zhengjian.org/zj/articles/2006/7/4/38334.html</a></p>
