              War</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">AMAR DIWAKAR March 23, 2018 New Republic</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The U.S. tried to foment an anti-communist Buddhist bloc in
              Southeast Asia—with deadly consequences for the region’s politics today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Of the world’s major faiths, Buddhism is often characterized
              as being a religion of peace, tolerance, and compassion. The Western encounter
              with Buddhism has largely been distilled through yoga, the beatniks, Hollywood,
              and Dalai Lama quotes shared on Facebook. But even a cursory glance at the news
              that emanates from the Buddhist world reveals a more sanguinary state of
              affairs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In Myanmar, ultra-nationalist monks have fueled a genocidal
              crusade against the country’s Rohingya Muslim population. In Thailand, the
              government has responded to a long-running Malay Muslim insurgency in its
              southern provinces by fostering a Buddhist militarism, encouraging monks in
              local temples to ally with the armed forces. And in Sri Lanka, the
              Buddhist-majority Sinhalese were engaged in a bitter civil war against the
              Hindu-minority Tamils for decades. More recently, Buddhist nationalists there
              have stoked anti-Muslim riots.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Still, Buddhism continues to have an alien aura, as if it
              were an “entirely otherworldly religion with a gnostic distaste for the worldly
              order,” as the scholar Ian Harris has written. There is a tendency to frame the
              rise of Buddhist nationalism as an anomalous phenomenon. In fact, as the
              historian Eugene Ford shows in his book Cold War Monks: Buddhism and America’s
              Secret Strategy in Southeast Asia, the Buddhist world was a laboratory of
              competing visions and ideologies in the Cold War—an experiment that helped
              politicize Buddhism into the often violent, reactionary force we see in
              Southeast Asia today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism and statecraft have long been joined at the hip. The
              religion supplied the symbols of kingship in courts, capitals, and urban
              centers from Burma (now Myanmar) to Siam (Thailand) to Laos, as monastic orders
              and ruling elites forged intimate ties. Following the seventeenth century,
              European imperialism disrupted the symbiosis of religion and state in places where
              colonial regimes were installed. By the early half of the twentieth century,
              anti-colonial movements saw monks participate in dissent, laying the
              foundations for the clergy to enter secular affairs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The exception was Thailand, the only country in the region to
              avoid formal colonization. It was a distinction that shaped its nationalist
              narrative, which glorified the monarchy while sheltering its monks from the
              activism of their counterparts in neighboring countries. However, during World
              War II, imperial Japan’s occupation of Bangkok offered a harbinger of the
              outside pressures that would be released upon Buddhism in the postwar era.
              Tsusho Byoto, an obscure Japanese scholar-monk, advocated a militarized
              conception of Zen in an attempt to recruit the guarded Thai monastic order to
              the fascist cause. While he ultimately failed, Byoto’s “vision of an
              internationalized Thai monkhood would in many ways prove prophetic,” Ford
              writes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The immediate postwar
              aftermath saw revolutionary</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> nationalist movements proliferate from Indonesia to Vietnam, guided by
              an anti-colonial ethos informed by Marxism. Colonial powers waged costly and
              ultimately doomed counterrevolutionary wars to reestablish control, which then
              dovetailed with the U.S.’s anti-communist efforts as Europe withdrew from the
              scene.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A military-strategic alliance with the U.S. became the
              central pillar of Thailand’s foreign relations after 1947, drawing the rest of
              Southeast Asia into a turbulent geopolitical orbit. The partnership early on
              faced two challenges: Thailand had to keep up the appearance that the
              conservative monkhood was segregated from the political realm, while adherence
              to the First Amendment prevented any direct U.S. involvement in Thailand’s
              religious affairs. All this did was compel Washington to operate clandestinely,
              as it began to shape a pliable Buddhist bloc that would act as its proxy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The gravitational forces of the Cold War would cause the
              Buddhist clergy to become more politicized and more internationalized than ever
              before. In 1953, during the Eisenhower administration, Vice President Richard
              Nixon undertook a formative trip across Asia. In Vietnam, Nixon visited the
              front lines of the Indochina Wars to witness a French offensive against Viet
              Minh insurgents. He was frustrated by France’s patronizing attitude toward its
              Vietnamese allies, and disturbed by a failure to establish a legitimate cause
              to counter the stirring appeal of their anti-colonial adversaries.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 then made
              it clear that military action itself was insufficient to combat communism in
              the region. Hearts and minds—or, pagodas and temples—were going to be just as
              essential. Religion, Ford says, “was a lever the United States could use to
              wield influence of a nonmilitary or psychological nature, not least by
              emphasizing to local populations the supposed communist threat to their
              religious institutions.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Coinciding with Washington’s strategy at the time was the
              emergence of a pan-Buddhist consciousness. Advancements in communication and
              transportation had accelerated religious and cultural exchange and deepened
              interconnectivity within the milieu of Theravada Buddhism, the predominant
              strain of Buddhism in Southeast Asia. The 2,500th anniversary of the Buddha’s
              death inspired the launch of the first international Buddhist organization in
              1950: the World Fellowship of Buddhists. Coupled with the 1954 staging of the
              Great Buddhist Synod in Burma, there were signs that the consolidation of a
              Buddhist bloc was ripe for engagement.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The earliest of U.S. efforts began in Burma between 1951 and
              1952. Burma’s Prime Minister U Nu had been battling a domestic communist
              insurgency since 1948 and looked to incorporate “Burmese Buddhism” into an
              anti-communist program. This was well received by Washington, as conveyed by a
              1951 State Department memo to its embassy in Rangoon. The memo highlighted the
              rules of engagement as it applied to U.S. funding of religious activities,
              which had to be undertaken through private channels to obscure any official
              links.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The CIA deepened such activity across the region. As early as
              1948, it harvested intelligence on Bangkok’s Vietnamese monasteries to monitor
              for potential communist links. At the invitation of the U Nu government, the
              Committee for a Free Asia—which was renamed the Asia Foundation in 1954—became
              active in Burma in 1952, bankrolled by the CIA through the National Committee
              for a Free Europe. (Much of Ford’s archival sources come from the Asia
              Foundation.) The Asia Foundation had extensive behind-the-scenes involvement in
              the Great Buddhist Synod. By 1962, Ford notes, it had contributed over $300,000
              in the form of original printing equipment and technical advice to make
              “Burma’s Buddha Sasana Press the world’s largest and best equipped Buddhist publishing
              house.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Asia Foundation would then expand its operations into
              neighboring Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos. Harnessing the foundation’s platform
              and networks in the region, Washington provided grants to Buddhist educational
              and civic groups, and distributed anti-communist propaganda. It also made sure
              to send (unofficial) delegations to Buddhist conferences while sponsoring trips
              for senior members of the Buddhist community to the U.S.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By 1957, White House policy-makers had produced a general
              policy framework geared towards the manipulation of Buddhist institutions and
              monks. The draft was circulated within U.S. embassies across Southeast Asia,
              and even a special “Buddhist Committee” was formed in the State Department to
              assist its implementation. By emphasizing community activism, Ford writes that
              the Asia Foundation’s “aim had been to preserve the monkhood’s traditional
              abstention from politics by providing alternative forms of civic engagement.”
              Much like Byoto, the Asia Foundation resembled a foreign agent determined on
              restructuring Thailand’s cloistered Buddhist institutions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As turmoil enveloped
              Southeast Asia, however, the strategy</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> began to unravel, as forces that were activated failed to
              align as intended.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A coup d’état deposed Burma’s U Nu in 1962, and the military
              junta engaged in a protracted campaign against a local communist insurgency.
              The repression of Buddhists under the U.S.-supported Catholic leader Ngo Dinh
              Diem in Vietnam during the “Buddhist Crisis,” and the self-immolation of the
              monk Quang Duc in 1963, hastened a political crisis that culminated in a
              military coup, Diem’s assassination, and the further spiraling of South Vietnam
              into chaos. In 1967, the Asia Foundation’s CIA patronage was exposed in the
              antiwar journal Ramparts. Eventually, despite U.S. military aid and religious
              sponsorship, communists took power in Laos and Cambodia in 1975. That same
              year, Saigon fell to the Viet Cong.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With the specter of communism at its doorstep, the Thai
              conservative establishment curbed the postwar experiment of civilian democratic
              rule in its quest for stability. It achieved this by soliciting the services of
              a notorious right-wing monk named Kittivudho, who to Ford represented “both the
              activation and the internationalization of Thai Buddhist conservatism.” By
              incentivizing the assassination of leftists with accumulation of religious
              merit, Kittivudho fused Buddhist doctrine with a virulent anti-communism. He
              lent institutional support to right-wing paramilitary organizations and
              vigilante groups, as the Thai government (with implicit support from
              Washington) carried out a brutal crackdown on students, labor activists, and
              farmers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Cold War Monks</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> alerts readers to the ways in which
              the volatile currents of the Cold War swept up Southeast Asian Buddhism. What
              was an ultimately unsuccessful effort to draw the monkhood out of its political
              quietism swiftly mutated into an anti-progressive force, and continued to
              endure as a dark cloud over the region’s politics in subsequent decades.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This bloody legacy echoes in the present. It can be detected
              in the violent response of Thai monks to the Malay Muslim insurgency in the
              south, a campaign that has many similarities with Myanmar’s clerical-led
              anti-Muslim 969 movement. Under the pressures exerted by globalization,
              Buddhism continues to provide a source of legitimacy for nation-states across
              the region. Its followers are susceptible to battle cries to preserve the faith
              under the banner of a muscular Buddhist nationalism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The termination of the Cold War did not erase the imprint of
              a more bellicose Buddhism. Only instead of a godless communism, now it is a
              transnational militant Islam that is envisioned as a threat to Buddhist
              identity and tradition. This ideological shift just so happens to coincide with
              the U.S.’s “war on terror,” which has been operationalized to justify the
              bloody reprisals in Thailand and the pogroms in Myanmar. And the monks are
              front and center of it all.</span></p>
