            <div class='col-md body'>Western interest in Eastern religions, especially Buddhism, historically coincided with the rise of modern science and the corresponding perceived decline of religious orthodoxy in the West. Put simply: Modern science initiated a deep spiritual crisis that led to an unfortunate split between faith and reasonÂ—a split yet to be reconciled. Buddhism was seen as an "alternative altar," a bridge that could reunite the estranged worlds of matter and spirit. <strong>Thus, to a large extent Buddhism's flowering in the West during the last century came about to satisfy post-Darwinian needs to have religious beliefs grounded in new scientific truth. </strong><br><br><strong>~ Dr. Martin J.

Meditation can be done with a control group as well. You can experiment meditation in different way and record your findings. Anyway if you're studying some meditators on the effects effects of meditation you will also need control grp.<br><br>So, what exactly in your opinion, giving some examples, are the cases in Buddhism that control groups should be used?<br><br><blockquote>Spiritual realm and reality are two different areas thus cannot be compared or composited.</blockquote>Spiritual realms (i.e causal, nondual) which isn't a 'realm' exactly, is a reality. They have correlates in four quadrants too. But in another way -- spiritual mysticism are even higher and all encompassing than lower holons i.e atoms, etc. And when you are talking about non-dual reality, nothing is not of non-dual nature. It is the ground reality, condition of all conditions. Just like nothing is not of the nature of impermanence, conditioned arisnig.</div>
