            <div class='col-md body'>there was once i experienced a great so real fear while meditating. that was when i just started out. i sat in front of the images of buddha &amp; bodhisattvas and before the practice, i seek guidance 1st....<br><br>now when typing i'm still hesitating to describe what i went through. this one i really genuinely experienced and it was so bare and realistic and vivid that it taught me a great deal of lesson. from that moment onwards i realised i am the real master of myself and anything else are illusions and many things (more to discover) do exist and are naturally part of this world like u and me. and slowly as i move on, practice and read &amp; learn &amp; practice, i realised slowly revealing how true buddha words are. this i really have to encourage one to realise by experiencing personally with proper guidances and teachings. glad i did on my own but if u look at it, i am actually not so quite alone. (still searching for my teacher, waiting.....)<br><br>thus, i don't practice daily meditation actually cos i know i don't have proper guidance yet but nonetheless i still will brave through it alone to discover something or plainly just wanting to practice focus, mindfulness, concentration &amp; to receive and maintain some inner peace clarity &amp; balance.<br><br>i realised each time after i finish meditating, i see myself radiant &amp; fresh in the mirror even with only 2 or 3 hours sleep a day at times.<br><br></div>

Otherwise, it will become hindrance to your meditation.<br><br>A scary one that I heard is got this person meditating, then suddendly some ghosts one by one appear around her flying around screaming laughing. She scared but still can remain calmness. She told the ghosts "please don't disturb me doing meditation, I promise one day if I am enlightened, I will go and save all of you". When she finished this sentence, all of them disappear. I think a lot of bad karma are being washed away by this moment.<br><br>No matter, don't let hatred or greed to affect yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>after sharing a topic like this, i went to bed last night. and.... i had a long night of struggling  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>before i close my eyes i was very "present" in the moment and could hear so much sound in the dark of the night all so clearly even the insect from the field downstairs amidst the engine of the bus pass by downstairs. then i just relax close my eyes..... hear knocking sounds on the shelf ( i know i not anyhow thinking) just find it weird why got knocking sound on the shelf in my room!? i ignored. then i felt my lower part of my body shaken and thought maybe hubby was pulling the blanket. i open my eyes n saw him snoring away. then i ignored continue to sleep.<br><br>i felt my back thought my hubby coming closer to me and can feel him almost touching me but felt abit strange i woke up. i saw him sleeping so soundly so far away from me. i ignored again.....<br><br>i close my eyes trying to sleep again. then i feel my body senses all become helpless and uncontrollable like something wants to take control n feel again the bed shaking like especially only on my part. frankly i was scared lah but i continue to remind myself to be calm and united.<br><br>don't know how many times i encountered these and i wake up n go back n sleep last night. but eventually i also fell asleep.<br><br>all these were really what i felt even in the conscious moment. sometimes i contemplate.... they are illusions &amp; delusions of our minds being scattered or it could be really some other unexplainable things we havent realised n discovered yet. or they could be our karma energies from the past (past lives?)......</div>

(why him, cos i find him unique and not many talk about and when i asked people about him, they only say he's in charge of hell. but i know its more than that so i researched on him). i just only started in november05 to go into buddhism reading the sutras and practiced meditation.<br><br>am really grateful to all the people here for all your great patience kindness for guiding me advicing me without criticising me or ignoring my queries.<br><br>whatever it was, it is, will be...<br>i still have no regrets....!<br><br>even if i have to be a striptease to speak the dharma to another striptease i will still do it. even if i have to be in an unfavorable condition to speak the dharma to them, i will still speak the dharma to them in their way for them to "understand".<br></div>
