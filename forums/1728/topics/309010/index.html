              <p>Pureland Zen takes the essence of Buddha recitation with Great Reflections on the Chan Aspect to help Buddhist practitioner enter the Samadhi of Buddha Recitation</p>
              <p>Which is a good practice</p>
              <p>Since the fall of Sung dynasty in China , many Patriach of Pureland emphasize this practice as they saw several of the Chan practitioner encountered problems in their practice</p>
              <p>Pureland Chan address this many aspect of with a look at all addressing the "letting go of all pheonomenon " and Buddha recitation with a focus on the Self-nature Amitabha .</p>
              <p>So its not the west one seek on deathbed ,but the self -nature one reborn in one Western Paradise upon deathbed</p>

              <p>Master Yongming Yanshou seems to be 1st to practise both Zen and PL:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Master <em>Yongmíng Yánshòu</em> (æ°¸æ˜Žå»¶å£½ Japanese; <em>YÅ�mei Enju</em>, 904-975 or 76) was the third patriarch in the line of Fa-yen(885-958). He compiled the highly influential 100 fasc.,<em>Record of the Mirror of Orthodoxy</em> [py] ZÅ�ngjìng lù (å®—é�¡éŒ„ Japanese; <em>SÅ«gyÅ� roku</em>). Another work is this three fascicle, <em>Ten Thousand Deeds Merging into One</em>,</p>
              <pre> (ä¸‡å–„å�Œæ­¸é›† Ch; <em>WÃ nshÃ n tÃ³ngguÄ« jÃ­</em>Â : Jp; <em>Manzen dÅ�ki shÅ«</em> [T 2017.48.957b-993c.]). 
              </pre>
              <p>In this work he (unlike other Ch’an masters at that time), did not reject the view that the Pure Land is in the West outside one’s mind. He himself aspired to be born there and urged others to do so. He “fully explains” the theoretical basis for his view in the ä¸‡å–„å�Œæ­¸é›†. [source; Inagaki, Hisao, The Three Pure Land Sutras, page.131] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He also advocated the joint practice of Ch’an meditation and nien-fo recitation. </span></p>

              <p>My Master advocates both self-power and other-power depending on one's capacity.</p>
              <p>My Master, Ven Shen Kai, has two masters. His Master in China (ven Xue Song <a href="http://xuesong.org/">http://xuesong.org/</a> ) practice Pure Land, his other Master when he went to Taiwan, Ven Dong Chu, was a Ch'an teacher.
                  My Master is also the holder of the lineage from Linji Ch'an.<br> <br> Ven Dong Chu is also the master of Ven Sheng Yen, who is my Master's dharma brother.
                  <br> <br> My Master initially taught Pure Land Buddhism when he first started
                  preaching, but after that he taught Ren Cheng because he sees the need
                  to teach Ren Cheng to the west.
                  <br> <br> Whether it is Ch'an or Pure Land, he said Ren Cheng is 
                  <br> <br> 'fei chan fei jing' (neither zen nor pure land), 
                  <br> 'ji chan ji jing' (yet both zen and pure land), 
                  <br> 'xian mi shuang xiu' (practices both silent/esoteric and exoteric, but the 'esoteric' here doesn't mean vajrayana), 
                  <br> 'xing jie xiang yin' (practice and understanding converges).</p>
              <p>We also advocate realising the Pure Land in the Mind, and the Self-Nature Amitabha. (wei xin jing tu, zi xing mi tuo)</p>

                        infinity of all that is good. Generally, people only know that Teacher of 
                        the Western Pure Land (or Western Paradise) is Amitabha Buddha. But they 
                        do not know that they also have within themselves a Pure Land and Amitabha. 
                        This is known as the 'Pure Land of the Mind' and the 'Own-Nature Amitabha'.

                        the abuse, in contrast the infinite brightness that illumines with the recital

                        I see a student studying, I shall say "Amitabha Buddha". It is 
                        also acceptable if you say that he is very hardworking or very clever. However, 
                        sometimes an intelligent person may be fooled by his own intelligence. There 
                        is no guarantee that a student who does well in his studies now will definitely 
                        grow up to be good. But, when we use the name "Amitabha Buddha" 
                        to compliment him, then we evoke the brightness to illumine in him. Not 
                        only will he do well in his studies and his career, he will also be a Bodhisattva 
                        when he grows up, or even become Buddha someday.<br> <br> <em><strong>v.</strong></em> If we happen to pass by an abattoir, a place where pigs, 
                        cows or other animals are slaughtered, and since we understand that the 
                        effect of the karma of killing is rebirth in the realm of hell, and we make 
                        a verbal comment to that effect, is it appropriate? While we do not know 
                        whether the person who is committing the killing will be reborn in hell, 
                        but when we speak of hell, we immediately strike a resonance with hell. 
                        Because suffering and darkness prevail in hell, at the mention of the word, 
                        we have already struck an accord with suffering and darkness. If we say 
                        "Amitabha Buddha" instead, then brightness spontaneously illumines 
                        in our mind and the image of the abattoir will not take root in our mind.<br> <br> <em><strong>vi.</strong></em> If we come across two parties bickering, quarrelling or 
                        fighting with each other, we do not join in. By our participation, we plant 
                        the cause to be reborn in the realm of the Asura, which is not a desirable 
                        thing. We only need to have Amitabha Buddha in our mind and say "Amitabha 
                        Buddha" just once, and then in future we will not be in spiritual union 
                        with the beings of the Asura realm.<br> <br> <em><strong>vii.</strong></em> If we chance on seeing some traders in the market cheating 
                        on the scales, we immediately say "Amitabha Buddha". Because cheating 
                        arises from greed which resonates with the realm of the ghosts, it is a 
                        cause for rebirth in such a realm in future. By saying "Amitabha Buddha" 
                        just once, then not only do we not resonate with the realm of ghosts but 
                        also we are in spiritual union with Amitabha Buddha and we become illumined 
                        with infinite brightness.<br> <br> </span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong><em>viii.</em></strong> People in general have a curious nature. If we stumble upon someone else's 
                        secrets, we are driven by our curiosity to peek into it to find out more. 
                        If this person is committing a crime, this may spell trouble: our life may 
                        be in danger. By saying "Amitabha Buddha" in our mind and we quickly 
                        distance from it, then we are in union with all that are virtuous and bright. 
                        We do not resonate with darkness.<br> <br> <em><strong>ix.</strong></em> If we come across a drowning man, of course, we save him 
                        if we have the ability. However, if we could not be of help and in the meantime 
                        someone else is saving him, we say "Amitabha Buddha". By calling 
                        out "Amitabha Buddha" just once, it strikes resonance with the 
                        drowning person and he immediately attain the brightness and accomplishment 
                        of Amitabha Buddha. Then, our mind is also in spiritual union Amitabha Buddha.<br> <br> </span>

                        person tells you tales about someone else, those tales are not your business. 
                        The Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch states, "I see someone engaging in 
                        gossip-mongering, I do not participate. If I participate in the gossiping, 
                        then I have done wrong." That the person is wrong is his own business. 
                        Your participation means that you have also done wrong. If this person speaks 
                        a lot of ills about another person and in the end you say just once "Amitabha 
                        Buddha", that is good enough. If you participate in the gossiping, 
                        this person may go around speaking ill of you too. But, when you say "Amitabha 
                        Buddha", then you are in resonance with brightness and that person 
                        would not be able to invent gossips and speak ill of you. Therefore, "Amitabha 
                        Buddha" is indeed really very useful. Regardless of whether the situation 
                        is good, bad or neither good nor bad, when we say "Amitabha Buddha", 
                        our mind will be at ease and we attain brightness, and in this way we resonate 
                        with brightness. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #003399;">3. 
                        How do we cultivate this habit of chanting or reciting "Amitabha Buddha"?<br> <br> </span></strong>It is not easy to acquire the habit of chanting or reciting "Amitabha 
                        Buddha". If you say "Amitabha Buddha" but Amitabha Buddha 
                        is not in your heart and mind, then that would not do. We should have brightness 
                        in our mind all the time so that we are in spiritual union with Amitabha 
                        Buddha. In that way, when you say "Amitabha Buddha" and your actions, 
                        speech and mind are in spiritual union with Amitabha Buddha, then that is 
                        good enough. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> <br> </span>

                        How do we cultivate to have brightness in our mind?<br> <br> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Actually, 
                        it is quite easy to cultivate brightness in our mind. We must carry out 
                        the principle behind "The mind of the past cannot be grasped; the mind 
                        of the present cannot be grasped; the mind of the future cannot be grasped." 
                        (The Three Minds; Vol 6, Issue no. 4) The past is already gone and you cannot 
                        bring it back; the future is not here yet, and there is no way you can bring 
                        it here at this moment; and, whatever you have in your mind at this moment 
                        will not stay because as soon as the next thought arises in your mind, the 
                        previous thought ceases.<br> <br> Therefore, we have to cultivate non-ego-form (i.e. not self-centred; not 
                        having the notion of "I" or "mine"). The ego gives rise 
                        to the notion of possession, for example, my wife, my husband, my houses 
                        and assets, my children, etc. And, we are not even clear about where actually 
                        is this "I". <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><br> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #003399; font-size: small;"><strong>5. 
                        What is "I"? Is it real?<br> <br> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Can anybody 
                        find the "I" in you? It is not an easy task. If you say "I 
                        can see you", who is this "I" that you are referring to? 
                        You may reply that the "I" is in fact your eyes. If you say, "I 
                        can hear you speaking of the Dharma", it is your ears not the "I" 
                        that heard me. Not only are the eyes and ears not the "I", even 
                        if they are, what about the nose, mouth, tongue, limbs, body, head or hair? 
                        They are not the "I" too. Since we cannot locate it, it does not 
                        seem meaningful to attach to this ego. Therefore, a Buddhism practitioner 
                        should comprehend this non-ego-form and maintain non-ego at all times. One 
                        will then realise that all forms are false (an illusion), including the 
                        ego-form. The "I" is false.<br> <br> </span>

              <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><br> The "human-form" refers to the notion of a relative opposite when 
                        we encounter another person. Since we cannot find the ego-form or "I-form", 
                        how then can we find the human-form? We cannot. This is because the ego-form 
                        of the person whom we encounter is also not real; it is empty. The ego-form 
                        is empty, therefore, and naturally the human-form is also empty. Since the 
                        ego-form and the human-from are empty, it follows that the "sentient 
                        being-form" is also empty.<br> <br> Thus, the sense of time, or the time-form is also empty. A Buddhism practitioner 
                        should cultivate to be detached from the 'Three Minds'[1] and the 'Four 
                        Forms'[2]: not grasping the mind of the past, the present and the future, 
                        and not attached to the notion of the ego-form, the human-form, the sentient 
                        being-form and the time-form. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> <em>Notes:<br> [1] The Three Minds: (i) the past is gone and cannot be grasped. (ii) After

                        Within this emptiness there is infinite brightness. When you realise this

                        "I" is false, we can still make use of it to cultivate merits 
                        [3] by performing all deeds that are meritorious. In this way we attain 
                        infinite merits.<br> <br> When we perform meritorious deeds, it does not mean that we do them only 
                        for today. We did them in the past, we do them presently and we will do 
                        them in the future. We have ethics and our code of ethics must prevail in 
                        the past, present and future. Since we have infinite brightness and infinite 
                        merits - in the past … present … future … past … present 
                        … future … past … present … future …. This is the 
                        meaning of "infinite life".<br> <br> In this way, we have manifested our "Own-nature Amitabha". At

                        of space, i.e. the eight points of the compass and the nadir and zenith) 
                        is called Pure Land. Where does a Pure Land come from? It comes from a pure 
                        mind; first and foremost, the mind must be purified, only then will there 
                        be Pure Land. Our mind is like the great earth because like the great earth, 
                        many things can grow from the mind. The mind is often likened to a planting 
                        field or land. Therefore, when a person is kind-hearted, he is said to have 
                        a "virtuous mind-land", "virtuous mind-field" or "bright 
                        mind-land". Our every decision and idea are all born of the mind. Therefore, 
                        whether it is heaven or hell, they are solely created by the mind. When 
                        the thoughts of the mind are virtuous, then they lead to virtuous actions. 
                        In this way, people ascend to heaven. If on the other hand, the mind thinks 
                        of evil, makes evil decisions and evil deeds are committed, then one descends 
                        to hell. Thus, heaven and hell are created by the mind.<br> <br> </span>

                        attach to the thoughts of good or evil and in this way is purified, then 
                        "a pure mind begets a pure land". If each and every person's mind 
                        is pure, then the land of our country will also be pure.<br> <br> Thus, it does not mean that people who seek to be reborn in the Western 
                        Pure Land in their next life can do so by virtue of their karma. It depends 
                        on the kind of karma. If it is virtuous, then rebirth takes place in a good 
                        realm, a higher realm. If it is evil, then it takes place in an evil realm, 
                        a lower realm. It is only when the karma is pure that rebirth can take place 
                        in the Western Pure Land.<br> <br> Karma refers to whatever that we do - the actions of our body, what we say 
                        and what goes on in our mind. It is only when the actions, speech and thoughts 
                        are pure, that people can be reborn in the Western Pure Land. It is possible 
                        for us to be pure in the three karma's (actions, speech and thoughts) by 
                        reciting "Amitabha Buddha". It only takes one person's mind to 
                        be pure for it to bring about a positive effect on one's surroundings. When 
                        all the members of the family have purified their minds, all members of 
                        the society have purified their minds, the entire human race across the 
                        world has purified its mind, then a Pure Land on earth is achieved. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><br> <br>

                        Buddha", but in addition should also cultivate merits. It is stated 
                        in the Amitabha Sutra that rebirth in the Western Pure Land is not possible 
                        via conditions that are lacking in virtuous roots, blessings and merits. 
                        For instance, when we have practised and perfected the Six Parameters (1. 
                        Observing the Precepts, 2. Endurance, 3. Giving, 4. Zeal and Progress, 5. 
                        Meditation, and 6. Wisdom), then to be reborn in the Western Pure Land is 
                        a simple matter. If you have accomplished a mind that is as pure as the 
                        Amitabha Buddha's, then there is no necessity for Amitabha Buddha to come 
                        and guide you to the Western Pure Land. At that time you are already a great 
                        Bodhisattva. Not only can a great Bodhisattva go the Western Pure Land; 
                        he can go to any pure land as he pleases.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #003399; font-size: small;"><strong> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"> </span></td>

              <p>Collection of Passages Revealing</p>
              <h2>The True Shinjin of the Pure Land Way</h2>
              <p class="subtitle">Compiled by Gutoku Shinran,<br>Disciple of Sakyamuni</p>
              <p class="subtitle"><a name="preface"></a>[Preface]</p>
              <p>As I reflect, I find that our attainment of shinjin arises from the heart and mind with which Amida Tathagata selected the Vow, and that the clarification of true mind has been taught for us through the skillful works of compassion of the Great Sage, Sakyamuni. But the monks and laity of this latter age and the religious teachers of these times are floundering in concepts of "self-nature" and "mind-only," and they disparage the true realization of enlightenment in the Pure Land Way. Or lost in the self-power attitude of meditative and non-meditative practices, they are ignorant of true shinjin, which is diamondlike.</p>
              <p>Here I, Gutoku Shinran, disciple of Sakyamuni, reverently embrace the true teaching of the Buddhas and Tathagatas and look to the essential meaning of the treatises and commentaries of the masters. Fully guided by the beneficent light of the three sutras, I seek in particular to clarify the luminous passage on the "mind that is single." I will pose questions concerning it and then present clear testimony in which explanation is found.</p>
              <p>Mindful solely of the depth and vastness of the Buddha's benevolence, I am unconcerned about being personally abused. Let companions who aspire for the Pure Land and all who abhor this defiled world accept or discard what they will of this work, but let them not ridicule the teaching.</p>

              <p>I think he's refering to those who preach Amitabha is Mind-only. This is a false view, as Amitabha has vowed and as skillful means to deliver all sentient beings to Sukhavati which resides in the west.</p>
              <p>Actually it IS true that Amitabha is Mind-only, inseparable from One Mind/Self-nature, though we also cannot say that there is no Amitabha or pure land or sukhavati in the west. Just like although we say all Buddhas' ultimate nature is Dharmakaya, we can't say there is no Sambhogakaya or Nirmanakaya.</p>
              <p>Of course, one should never disparage other-power or Amitabha's vows whatever one practices.</p>

              <p>I agree with the above observation. Not all Zen Masters can accept the Amitabha Buddha Dharma Door. This is also mentioned by Pureland practitioner, Master Chin Kung.</p>
              <p>If even Zen masters can't accept Pureland, much less others who practise other forms of Buddhism.

              <p>But not all will or have disparaged the Pureland Dharma Door though. Since it is mentioned by Sakayamuni Buddha that he will use his Buddha's powers to help safeguard the expounding and spread of the Pureland Dharma Door in our Dharma-ending age for the benefit of all, no one will find easy to totally eradicate the traces leading to this Dharma Door, no matter how respected he/she is in the Buddhist community.</p>

              <p>An article on the 3 streams of Chinese Pure Land:</p>
                  <p><strong><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Honen's Establishment of a Chinese Lineage</span></strong></p>
                  <blockquote>
                  <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">A common method of legitimation which East Asian Buddhist sects have used is establishing a lineage of the transmission from Shakyamuni Buddha himself down to their particular founder, and from thence to the present age. This is always established in order to invest the teachings with authority. It was during the Sung Dynasty (960-1297) that the establishment of official lineages for the various schools of Buddhism became common. The Ch'an school lineage was established at this time through Tao-yuan's <em>Ching-te-chuan-teng-lu</em>. Yuan-chao (1048-1116) established the nine patriarchs of the Four Part Vinaya school in his <em>Nan-shan-lu-tsung tsu-ch'eng-t'u-lu</em>, and Chih-p'an (circa late thirteenth century) established the T'ien-t'ai lineage in his <em>Fo-tsu-t'ung-chi</em>. Pure Land Buddhism was in turn influenced by these earlier examples, and Tsung-hsio (1151-1214) established the Pure Land lineage in his <em>Le-pang-wen-lei</em> (T. 1469, vol. 47). This lineage is as follows: Hui-yuan of Lu-shan, Shan-tao, Fa-chao, Shao-k'ang, Sheng-ch'ang, and Tsung-tse. Honen's lineage, however, differs fundamentally in that he neither recognized Hui-yuan as Shan-tao's teacher nor as a patriarch at all.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">In Honen's <em>Commentary on the Jodosanbukyo</em> <em>(Sanbukyo shaku)</em>, in reference to the <em>Amida Sutra</em>, he says:</span></p>
                  <p><span style="color: #000000;">In the Pure Land school of Shan-tao, no one studied directly under him, and no one praises him. But I, through his writings, have inherited his intention and so have founded the Pure Land sect. Therefore, in the Pure Land school there is nothing one can call a lineage, nor is there any proof of the oral transmission of its teachings. Nevertheless, on the basis of the teaching of the sutras and commentaries, and on my personal experience, I have established the Pure Land sect. (SHZ. 145) </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Honen's Pure Land sect differed in this regard from the Buddhism of the Nara and Heian periods in that it made no claim to have been transmitted through a continuous master-disciple lineage. Although inspired by Shan-tao's works, it was in fact based on Honen's personal religious experience.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="color: #000000;">This very lack of transmission provided grounds for harsh criticism, from the established Tendai and Shingon sects and the temples of Nara. Honen attempted to respond to such criticism in the <em>Gyakushu seppo</em>, when he named his own five patriarchs of Chinese Pure Land Buddhism (<em>jodogoso</em>) [T'an-luan, Tao-ch'o, Shan-tao, Huai-kan and Shao-k'ang] as constituting the Pure Land lineage.(SHZ. 264)</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Chinese lineage established by Tsung-hsiao was not made on the basis of a direct master-disciple relationship or on the common thought of Pure Land masters, but rather on the respective careers of each in propagating Pure Land teachings and on chronological order. By the time Tsung-hsiao wrote the <em>Le-pang-wen-lei</em> in 1200, it had already been two years since Honen had dictated the <em>Senchakushu</em> in which he classified three different Pure Land lineages and insisted on the veracity of his five patriarch lineage. Honen designated the three lineages as those of Hui-yuan of Lu-shan, T'zu-min, and Tao-ch'o and Shan-tao.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The first one of Hui-yuan was centered around the practice of the nembutsu with visualization. This form of nembutsu practice is advocated in the <em>Pratyutpanna Sutra (Pan-chou-san-mei ching)</em>, one of the first sutras dealing with Amida Buddha, and stresses the nembutsu as a practical means or upaya for reaching ultimate wisdom and the samadhi of emptiness. Hui-yuan lived during a period in which he could have seen the <em>Amida Sutra</em> as translated by Kumarajiva and the <em>P'ing-teng-chueh ching</em> and <em>Ta-ami-t'o ching</em> (both earlier versions of the <em>Sutra of Immeasurable Life (Wu-liang-shou ching</em>). His nembutsu teaching, however, is mostly based on the <em>Pratyutpanna Sutra</em> and not on the sutras associated with the <em>Sutra of Immeasurable Life</em>, which expounds Amida Buddha's power of the original vow (<em>hongan</em>). This teaching succeeded onwards to the T'ien-t'ai master Chih-i (538-97) and the Hua-yen master Ch'eng-kuan (738-839). To Honen, who insisted on the recited nembutsu as the true practice, Hui-yuan's visualized nembutsu ought to be rejected. Thus, we can see why Honen differentiated Hui-yuan from Tao-ch'o and Shan-tao and established another lineage.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The second lineage of T'zu-min is based around his syncretic teaching of the Ch'an, Pure Land and Vinaya schools in which he combined meditation, nembutsu practice, and observance of the precepts. Especially after the T'ang Dynasty (618-907), not only Pure Land but also other schools tended towards this syncretic mixing of teachings. Fa-chao of the middle T'ang, Wan-chao of the Sung, and Ch'u-hung (1532-1612) and Chih-hsu (1599-1655) of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) are examples of typical masters who brought other teachings into their own schools. T'zu-min's teachings also revolved around the visualization practices of the <em>Pratyutpanna Sutra (Pan-chou-san-mei ching)</em>. Further, his syncretic approach contradicted Honen's principle of the selection of the exclusive practice of the nembutsu (<em>senju-nembutsu</em>), Honen clearly differentiated it from the Tao-ch'o and Shan-tao lineage which was firmly centered in the <em>Sutra of Immeasurable Life (Wu-liang-shou ching)</em>, the <em>Meditation Sutra (Kuan wu-liang-shou ching)</em>, and the <em>Amida Sutra (A-mi-t'o ching)</em>.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Finally, the third lineage of Tao-ch'o and Shan-tao is the very one which became the lineage of the Pure Land denomination (Jodo Shu) in Japan. In the <em>Senchakushu</em>, Honen lists the five patriarchs as follows: T'an-luan, Tao-ch'o, Shan-tao, Hui-kuan and Shao-k'ang. There are, however, two separate opinions on its Dharma transmission. The first begins with Bodhiruci and follows to Hui-ch'ung, Tao-chang, T'an Luan, Ta-hai, and Fa-shang. The second begins with Bodhiruci and follows to T'an Luan, Tao-ch'o, Shan-tao, Huai-kan, and Shao-k'ang (<em>Senchakushu</em> Chapt.1). In the <em>Senchakushu</em>, Honen does not distinguish which lineage is correct, but in his other works, he only uses the second transmission. He cites the <em>T'ang Kao-seng-chuan (Bibliography of Eminent Masters Complied in the T'ang Dynasty)</em>[T.50,425-707]1 and the <em>Sung Kao-seng-chuan (Bibliography of Masters Compiled in the Sung Dynasty)</em>[T.50,709-900]2 as sources for this transmission, although in actuality these works do not contain such a transmission (<em>Ruiju Jodo Goso Den</em>, SHZ. 843-57). The key master in this lineage is clearly Shan-tao. From his standpoint, Tao-ch'o, his teacher, is designated the Second Patriarch, and Hui-kuan, his direct disciple, is designated the Fourth Patriarch. The First and Fifth Patriarchs, T'an-luan and Shao-k'ang, are designated not on the basis of the master-disciple relationship but rather on the connection of commonness of thought. T'an-luan had a great influence on the thought of both Tao-ch'o and Shan-tao and was thus designated the First Patriarch. Shao-k'ang in turn was greatly influenced by Shan-tao, eventually becoming known as a latter day Shan-tao, and was thus designated the Fifth Patriarch. Honen's five patriarch lineage based on the master-disciple relationship and commonness of thought, therefore, clearly contrasts that of Tsung-hsiao's.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">If we reflect on Honen's classification of the three lineages of Pure Land Buddhism, we can easily see how he rejected Hui-yuan's lineage based on the nembutsu with visualization and T'zu-min's based on syncretic teachings and selected the one of Tao-ch'o and Shan-tao based on his unprecedented teaching of the exclusive recited nembutsu. However, this lineage was not one of direct transmission from one patriarch to the next. Historically speaking, although Shan-tao and Huai-kan were clearly related as master and disciple, this "lineage" of five Chinese patriarchs was Honen's own original concept. Thus his Pure Land sect continued to receive criticism as lacking any clear line of direct transmission.</span></p>

              <p>From my understanding, most or all *modern* Chinese Ch'an/Zen masters do not teach Zen to the exclusion of PL/Amitabha dharma door. Even Chinese Zen/Ch'an masters do teach the pure land method nowadays because the Ch'an methods may not suit everyone. Though of course there is a difference emphasis when compared to the Pure Land school.</p>
              <p>In Japan, it is a different case. If I remember correctly Sanath has mentioned to me before, Zen in Japan is purely Zen and do not mix with Pure Land practices, with the exception of a small school called Obaku (I think).</p>
              <p>In the past, there is a lot of sectarianism between not only Zen and Pure land but all sorts of sects and schools. Not only in China but especially in Japan, where the sectarian situation is very competitive. Sometimes each sect would disparage or even slander each other or say nasty things about each other, as you may have heard before if you read the history. Glad we have generally evolved out of it and this isn't a v big problem now.</p>

              <p>Yes, Obaku-shu (é»ƒæª—å®—) came in to Japan from China around the end of the Ming Dynasty, introduced by a Chinese monk Ingen (Yin Yuan éš±å…ƒ) who was the Abbot of the é»ƒæª—è�¬ç¦�å¯º in Fuzhou (this temple still exists, but heard it's quite ulu so difficult to go to) who was invited by Rinzai monks in Japan to teach. By that time PL-Zen had become the mainstream in China, but not in Japan.

              <p>Yes, Obaku-shu (é»ƒæª—å®—) came in to Japan from China around the end
              of the Ming Dynasty, introduced by a Chinese monk Ingen (Yin Yuan
              éš±å…ƒ) who was the Abbot of the é»ƒæª—è�¬ç¦�å¯º in Fuzhou (this temple still
              exists, but heard it's quite ulu so difficult to go to) who was
              invited by Rinzai monks in Japan to teach. By that time PL-Zen
              had become the mainstream in China, but not in Japan. Even till
              today, Zen and Pure Land teachings in Japan are not mixed.</p>
