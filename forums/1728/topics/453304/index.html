But this latest startling report tells of 4,700 Buddhist monks who accepted Christ as their Savior.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;   "><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Years of Oppression</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This miracle came about amid a backdrop of more than a decade of political cruelty toward certain Burmese ethnic minorities. Over the years, 3000 villages in eastern Burma have been destroyed and the people were either killed or driven into remote mountainous areas. Some were able to escape to neighboring countries, although they were not particularly welcomed there. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Of the total population of 57 million people, 51 million are Buddhists – and one percent of this population are monks. There is a monastery in most villages. Children are often educated in monasteries, so even if they do not actually become monks themselves, they have been thoroughly indoctrinated with Buddhist beliefs and practices. The monks have always had a very strong influence in Burmese politics and government. They led the way in kicking out the British in 1948. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;   "><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Rebellion</span></span></strong></p>

It came as a surprise to the rest of the world then, when Buddhist monks led peaceful demonstrations against the government protesting rising costs, as well as the repressive government. </span></span></p>

Despite the dangers involved, missionaries went to several monasteries, and visited each one several times. The majority of these monks are from the dominant Bama people, normally very resistant to the gospel. One of the ministries supported by Christian Aid sent this report: Over the past three years "...4,700 Buddhist monks were led to Christ through our ministry. It appears that the Holy Spirit had urged these monks and nuns to call our evangelists to come and share the gospel of hope and love. After several intense discussions, close to 80% of the monks present in each of the monasteries raised their hands to accept Christ, and then received Christ as their Lord and Savior. Baptisms are being done discreetly – no more than three at a time for the sake of the safety of the converts as well as our workers." </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.

Please continue your vigilance for 1) the indigenous missionaries who are doing follow-up with these new believers and 2) for these monks who trusted Christ – that they will grow in grace and be used by the Lord to reap a new harvest for His kingdom.</span></span></p>

Now imagine if some of those muslims started proselytizing their religious crap, "take allah into your life and we'll give you food and water!" I wonder what the Yanks would have done; they probably would have murdered them.<br><br>If Yanks wouldn't like that, then just imagine how the hindus, buddhists, and muslims around the Indian Ocean felt when the christianazis came to blackmail them. Many US-based filth groups - oops, faith - openly said the disaster was an "opportunity" to sell their hate literature; they didn't see them as human beings who needed to be helped.

              <p>Their commitment is there, but should be put in educating people on their teachings. Not force people to convert. Directing efforts wrongly.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>There may be a mistaken notion that lives are better in the west, religion must also be better from the west! These monks may probably be ordained by tradition of their culture, thus may be too restless to really sit and cultivate themselves. They would rather affect a change externally than a change from within! These monks may be expressing a dissatisfaction at the society and the non adversarial stance from buddhist clergy. Christian evangelism are very adversarial despite professing turning the other cheek!  Which sits well with those impatient  for change!Also, active proponents of human rights and democracy also hail from the west!</div>
