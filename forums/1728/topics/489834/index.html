              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">DHARAMSHALA, August 25: The
                  Tibetan spiritual leader His Holiness the Dalai Lama has reiterated his
                  position of being “totally retired” from politics. In a brief interview
                  published August 21, 2015 with Religion and Ethics Newsweekly, an affiliate
                  of PBS network at his residence here, the Tibetan leader who turned 80 in
                  July said, “You see, in 2011 I totally retired. Now no connection with political
                  responsibility.”<br> <br> While the Tibetan leader rarely makes any political statements during his
                  visits within India or abroad he continues to be an outspoken aura
                  divulging fluent and precise one liners on a range of topics from his
                  reincarnation to his commitment to his message of secular and genuine
                  practice of compassion.<br> <br> Asked if his reincarnation is as big an issue as it is being discussed the
                  world over, he simply noted, “Many people showing interest about the
                  institution of Dalai Lama. For me, not much interest.”<br> <br> He added that he had made it clear as early as 1969 that the Tibetan people
                  would have the final say as to whether the institution of Dalai Lama should
                  continue or not. <br> <br> His Holiness has expressed on several occasions in the past that his
                  reincarnation would be purely subject to the need and validity of the
                  situation then, saying that he would consult other prominent lamas and the
                  Tibetan people when he reaches 90 years old to arrive at a decision. He
                  hasn’t ruled out the possibility of a non Tibetan or even a female Dalai
                  Lama in the future. “Inner values and world peace and happy world, this is
                  our common responsibility. About next life is individual business. Our
                  concept of God, concept of nirvana, concept of next life is private business.”<br> <br> Emphasizing the need for religious harmony which he has taken up as one of
                  his three commitments, he said, “All major religions teach the practice of
                  compassion, love, forgiveness, and tolerance. If people who really,
                  seriously, sincerely follow their own tradition, then brings inner peace.
                  Through that way, genuine peace.”<br> <br> While pointing out that the Communist leaders in China who are supposed to
                  stand by the principle of Marxism have failed to uphold the genuine Marxist
                  ideals, His Holiness highlighted the shift in position of Chinese leaders
                  including President Xi Jinping who recently acknowledged a role for its
                  religious traditions, including Buddhism.<br> <br> “It’s unthinkable, a Communist, atheist leader of that express publicly
                  importance of Buddhism is something quite unique. So this, I think the
                  reality now shows [that] just material development alone will not get
                  satisfaction to the public, to the people”.<br> <br> Responding to a question about China’s allegation against him being a
                  ‘splittist’, His Holiness said, “We seeking genuine autonomy, not seeking
                  independence”.</span></p>
