The mere mention of the name of this forum could possibly amount to misrepresenting the forum. However AEN had made clear that this project is your sole effort. If you truly want to do it out of your personal effort, I suggest you start off a new thread and not carry on in this as misunderstanding might still happen.</span><br><br><strong>Whether you want to donate or not , its totally a personal affairs</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Now you post it in the forum, any forummer has the right to enquire the details of <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">your</span></strong> project.</span><br><br><strong>I dun see any need to tell the forummers , its among well-wisher and those who hope to help others .</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">If you want people to contribute, be it article or monetary or any other means, you are <strong>obliged</strong> to relate all details to everyone. Why don't you see a need? You have hidden agenda?</span><br><br><strong>there isnt a notice to ask for donation for something</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">I didn't say there is in the first place. And I don't think it will be lawful to solicit fund in the forum.</span><br><br><strong>and I helping a printing company from collapsing ,<br>if you will take a moment to think about Bodhisattva practice ,you will<br>feel that you will abide by the Nation's law in carrying out such thing<br>am I wrong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">So now it's shedding light that you want to help salvage the fate of a collasping printing company, so it suggests that it may not be just a genuine and simple intention of printing Dhamma books, I see that it is an effort in helping someone, not necessary wrong but I hope that you will be more upfront about it. Whether one does Bodhisattva practice or not, one should abide the law! The fundamental reason for the existence of law in any country is to maintain order and justice. Irregardless of your beliefs.</span><br><br><strong>To a person who embodies compassion in all aspect , there isnt any need to worry .I will write in the book the amount used and the remaining in the witness of all well-wisher donated to temple organisation if there is any excesses</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Prevention is better than cure, that is why both Compassion and Wisdom should be practiced rather than relying solely on Compassion which may allow abuse to be taken place. Personally, if I want to make a monetary donation to publish books, then all of that amount should go to that and not due to excess and donate to any temple organisation. The intentions of the donars and the assurance to follow-through that intention is important.</span><br><br><strong>Kindly hold the lotus on your heart ,Yamizi </strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Please open your heart and present your proposal in full in a new thread so that to stop any possibility of people mistake this as a project from this forum.<br><br>Thank you.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> [/b]</blockquote></div>
