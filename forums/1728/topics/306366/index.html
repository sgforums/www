              <p>Hi I notice that you have quite a lot of questions, like me, lol. Luckily most of the Buddhists here are quite patient and did not come down hard on me when I ask questions that sound as if I'm challenging Buddhist concepts.</p>
              <p>The answer which I think I have already mentioned in my own post, is to tell the lie; I think the rabbit went the other way. And the Buddha clearly pointed out that telling such a lie in such circumstances do not constitute breaking the precept of false speech.</p>
              <p>Why? Cos the intention is the deciding factor. The Buddha in his previous life as a practising Bodhisattva, told the lie out of compassion for both the rabbit and the hunter. This would instead be a virtuous and compassionate act and hence different from that of wilful lying.</p>
              <p>The main thing is, are you, Canihelpyou02, able to make sure that your intention is the same as the Bodhisattva in the story when encountering a similar situation?</p>
              <p>If you can, then I salute you. Not only did you not break a precept, you have taken a small step towards Buddhahood.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>one thing we must remember is that the precepts are NOT "commandments" where one is condemned if one breaks them. Precepts are guidelines, and depending on the situation one is in, can be amended, provided on the intention. Like in the above story, the Buddha did not break any precept, because His intention was good for both the rabbit and the hunter.</p>

              <p>A wealthy merchant, who was a disciple of the Buddha, went with
                                                  a very large caravan of other merchants and his servants to a
                                                  certain island, to bring back for trade some of the gem stones for
                                                  which this island was famous. On board ship, on the way back, the
                                                  merchant learnt that another passenger on the boat intended to
                                                  kill all the hundreds of people on board, in order to be able to
                                                  steal the cargo of jewels.<br> <br> The merchant knew the man, and knew that he was indeed capable of
                                                  killing all those people, and he wondered what to do about it. In
                                                  the end, despite the fact that he had taken a vow with the Buddha
                                                  never to take the life of another being, he had no alternative but
                                                  to kill the would-be robber.<br> <br> He was very ashamed of what he had done, and as soon as he returned
                                                  home he went to the Buddha to confess his bad action. But the
                                                  Buddha told him he had not done wrong, because his intention had
                                                  not been to take life, but to save life. Furthermore, since he had
                                                  in fact saved the lives of hundreds of people, and had saved the
                                                  robber from the very negative karma of killing hundreds of people
                                                  and the inevitable consequences of such a bad action, the Buddha
                                                  explained that the merchant had in fact done a good action.<br> <br> ~ Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche</p>

              <p>Neither am I trying to be funny when I answered your question. I used 'lol' cos I was laughing at myself for having so many questions that people would simply find it simple to tell me to go and do my own research instead of answering me here.</p>
              <p>I don't consider your question as stupid, nor do I think you are trying to show off. But it does sound like you feel uncomfortable with the tone of my answer. If that's the case, I apologise.</p>
              <p>I answered your question in all seriousness and based on what I have heard or understood so far.</p>

              <p>The answer is, the rabbit ran the other way.Save the rabbit and save the hunter.Dont worry about this I, mine &amp; me.They always like to keep the precept pure and go to good place after they die.Kill the I,mine &amp;me,then all the action is for all beings.To save all beings from sufferings.</p>
              <p>I once ask a good friend of mine,a buddhist for many many years,this same question.The reply was to say the truth,the rabbit is behind him.He told me he want to keep the precept.I was shocked.</p>

              <p>That is a wrong understanding of karma, and is the false view of Fatalism. Secondly, karma has no judge, so there is no "lord karma". Buddha never taught this way. Karma is also never fated, a rabbit is never fated to be killed, because karma is merely one of the conditions. Only when causes meets condition then something happens. You can be the positive condition to save the rabbit's life.</p>
              <p>Please read up what is karma here: <a title="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/87.htm" href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/87.htm">http://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/87.htm</a></p>
              <p>You should never let someone die by telling the truth, and if need be, you should kill the person, as what I posted above. (if lets say he is going to kill 500 other people and there is no other way you can prevent it other than killing him)</p>

              <p>We should be flexible and think about other options.<br>I will tell the hunter I saw and get hold of the rabbit, it is now mine and ask him to leave.<br>Come on, he never own the rabbit before, he just saw it and chase it, who he is to ask me to return the rabbit.<br>If he want to use force, then I will see if I have enough money to buy the rabbit's life.</p>
              <p>Buddha last time also encountered a similar problem, whereby he found a bird wounded by his cousin devadatta during hunting, he insist not to give out the bird. Finally, the judges in their palace decided that the animal belongs to the one who saved it if it is still alive.</p>

              <p>There is another story in which the Buddha personally intervened to save a lot of people. He tried to save his clan by blocking an army led by Liu Li Prince (ç�‰ç’ƒçŽ‹å­�ï¼‰but was unable to block after the 3rd attempt.</p>
              <p>For beginner buddhists, it is not easy to judge whether killing is the only right way to save lives for a particular desperate situation. The above story about the Buddha is an exception whereby the Bodhisattva has the wisdom to judge and at the same time, some number comparison can be done (kill one, save 500, simple enough right?). But what about say 499 pirates and 500 ship passengers, would you kill 499 pirates to save the passengers? Seriously if I'm such situations, I wouldn't arrive at the decision to kill so easily.</p>

              <p>My answer would be to "tell a lie" . By doing that I save the rabbit from being killed and since I know the intention of the hunter 'to kill', I am trying to stop him from accumulating another bad karma. Hence, I kill 2 birds with a stone.</p>
              <p>Unless, it's the fixed karma that the rabbit has to be killed by the said hunter. Nothing we could almost do whether we lie or don't!</p>

              <p>i thought a better answer is to tell the hunter the rabbit is behind me. but ask how much would the rabbit fetch? i pay for the rabbit life.?</p>

              <p>The hunter goes behind,boom...........pick up the dead rabbit and left.</p>
