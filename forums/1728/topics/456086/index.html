              <p>"Monks, these four things are born. Which four? Affection is born of 
              affection. Aversion is born of affection. Affection is born of aversion.
               Aversion is born of aversion.</p>
              <p>"And how is affection born of affection? There is the case where an 
              individual is pleasing, appealing, &amp; charming to (another) 
              individual. Others treat that individual as pleasing, appealing, &amp; 
              charming, and the other one thinks, 'This individual is pleasing, 
              appealing, &amp; charming to me. Others treat this individual as 
              pleasing, appealing, &amp; charming.' He gives rise to affection for 
              them. This is how affection is born of affection.</p>
              <p>"And how is aversion born of affection? There is the case where an 
              individual is pleasing, appealing, &amp; charming to (another) 
              individual. Others treat that individual as displeasing, unappealing, 
              &amp; not charming, and the other one thinks, 'This individual is 
              pleasing, appealing, &amp; charming to me. Others treat this individual 
              as displeasing, unappealing, &amp; not charming.' He gives rise to 
              aversion for them. This is how aversion is born of affection.</p>

              <p>"Monks, these are the four things that are born.</p>
              <p>"Now, on the occasion when a monk, quite withdrawn from sensuality, 
              withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities, enters &amp; remains in 
              the first jhana — rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, 
              accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation — then any affection of
               his that is born of affection does not come about. Any aversion of his 
              that is born of affection... any affection of his that is born of 
              aversion... any aversion of his that is born of aversion does not come 
              about.</p>
              <p>"On the occasion when a monk... enters &amp; remains in the second 
              jhana... enters &amp; remains in the third jhana... enters &amp; remains
               in the fourth jhana, then any affection of his that is born of 
              affection does not come about. Any aversion of his that is born of 
              affection... any affection of his that is born of aversion... any 
              aversion of his that is born of aversion does not come about.</p>
              <p>"On the occasion when a monk, through the ending of the mental 
              fermentations, enters &amp; remains in the fermentation-free 
              awareness-release &amp; discernment-release, having known &amp; verified
               them for himself right in the here &amp; now, then any affection of his
               that is born of affection is abandoned, its root destroyed, made like a
               palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined 
              for future arising. Any aversion of his that is born of affection... any
               affection of his that is born of aversion... any aversion of his that 
              is born of aversion is abandoned, its root destroyed, made like a 
              palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined 
              for future arising.</p>
              <p>"This is said to be a monk who doesn't pull in, doesn't push away, doesn't smolder, doesn't flare up, and doesn't burn.</p>
              <p>"And how does a monk pull in? There is the case where a monk assumes 
              form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the 
              self, or the self as in form. He assumes feeling to be the self, or the 
              self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or the self as in
               feeling. He assumes perception to be the self, or the self as 
              possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or the self as in 
              perception. He assumes (mental) fabrications to be the self, or the self
               as possessing fabrications, or fabrications as in the self, or the self
               as in fabrications. He assumes consciousness to be the self, or the 
              self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or 
              the self as in consciousness. This is how a monk pulls in.</p>
              <p>"And how does a monk not pull in? There is the case where a monk 
              doesn't assume form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or 
              form as in the self, or the self as in form. He doesn't assume feeling 
              to be the self... doesn't assume perception to be the self... doesn't 
              assume fabrications to be the self... doesn't assume consciousness to be
               the self, or the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as 
              in the self, or the self as in consciousness. This is how a monk doesn't
               pull in.</p>
              <p>"And how does a monk push away? There is the case where a monk 
              returns insult to one who has insulted him, returns anger to one who is 
              angry at him, quarrels with one who is quarreling. This is how a monk 
              pushes away.</p>
              <p>"And how does a monk not push away? There is the case where a monk 
              doesn't return insult to one who has insulted him, doesn't return anger 
              to one who is angry at him, doesn't quarrel with one who is quarreling. 
              This is how a monk doesn't push away.</p>
              <p>"And how does a monk smolder? There is the case where, there being 'I
               am,' there comes to be 'I am here,' there comes to be 'I am like this' 
              ... 'I am otherwise' ... 'I am bad' ... 'I am good' ... 'I might be' ...
               'I might be here' ... 'I might be like this' ... 'I might be otherwise'
               ... 'May I be' ... 'May I be here' ... 'May I be like this' ... 'May I 
              be otherwise' ... 'I will be' ... 'I will be here' ... 'I will be like 
              this' ... 'I will be otherwise.'</p>
              <p>"And how does a monk not smolder? There is the case where, there not 
              being 'I am,' there doesn't come to be 'I am here,' there doesn't come 
              to be 'I am like this' ... 'I am otherwise' ... 'I am bad' ... 'I am 
              good' ... 'I might be' ... 'I might be here' ... 'I might be like this' 
              ... 'I might be otherwise' ... 'May I be' ... 'May I be here' ... 'May I
               be like this' ... 'May I be otherwise' ... 'I will be' ... 'I will be 
              here' ... 'I will be like this' ... 'I will be otherwise.'</p>
              <p>"And how does a monk flare up? There is the case where, there being 
              'I am because of this (or: by means of this),' there comes to be 'I am 
              here because of this,' there comes to be 'I am like this because of 
              this' ... 'I am otherwise because of this' ... 'I am bad because of 
              this' ... 'I am good because of this' ... 'I might be because of this' 
              ... 'I might be here because of this' ... 'I might be like this because 
              of this' ... 'I might be otherwise because of this' ... 'May I be 
              because of this' ... 'May I be here because of this' ... 'May I be like 
              this because of this' ... 'May I be otherwise because of this' ... 'I 
              will be because of this' ... 'I will be here because of this' ... 'I 
              will be like this because of this' ... 'I will be otherwise because of 
              this.'</p>
              <p>"And how does a monk not flare up? There is the case where, there not
               being 'I am because of this (or: by means of this),' there doesn't come
               to be 'I am here because of this,' there doesn't come to be 'I am like 
              this because of this' ... 'I am otherwise because of this' ... 'I am bad

              <p>"And how does a monk burn? There is the case where a monk's conceit of 'I am' is <em>not</em> abandoned, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of 
              the conditions of development, not destined for future arising. This is

The highest life form in the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#realm">Three Realms of Existence</a>.

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">T</span>he Buddhist concept of heaven and
                      hell is entirely different from that in other religions. Buddhists do not accept that
                      these places are eternal. It is unreasonable to condemn a man to eternal hell for his
                      human weakness but quite reasonable to give him every chance to develop himself. From the
                      Buddhist point of view, those who go to hell can work themselves upward by making use of
                      the merit that they had acquired previously. There are no locks on the gates of hell. Hell
                      is a temporary place and there is no reason for those beings to suffer there forever. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>The Buddha's Teaching shows us that there are
                      heavens and hells not only beyond this world, but in this very world itself. Thus the
                      Buddhist conception of heaven and hell is very reasonable. For instance, the Buddha once
                      said, 'When the average ignorant person makes an assertion to the effect that there is a
                      Hell (patala) under the ocean he is making a statement which is false and without basis.
                      The word 'Hell' is a term for painful sensations. 'The idea of one particular ready-made
                      place or a place created by god as heaven and hell is not acceptable to the Buddhist
                      concept. http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/whatbudbeliev/303.htm</span> </span></p>
