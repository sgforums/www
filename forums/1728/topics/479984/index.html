              <p>(By various Dharma protectors)</p>
              <p>We should respect all beings,<br> even helpful humans, gods and ghosts.<br> However, Buddhists only take refuge<br> in the perfect Buddhas, Dharma and Aryasangha.</p>
              <p>An interestingly phrased question arose recently – ‘Why do mediums 
              not get any Buddha to answer their devotees’ questions?’ Before there is
               further confusion, we should be clear that <span style="color: #ff0000;">the use of mediums is not a Buddhist practice</span>.
               Instead, for Chinese culture, it is part of folk religion. There are 
              naturally irreconcilable aspects of different religions, which is why 
              they are different in the first place and remain so. In this sense, even
               if a medium of any religion claims to be able to ‘channel’ a Buddha or 
              Bodhisattva through him or her, this is entirely frowned upon by all 
              orthodox Buddhists with right understanding. The only exception is the 
              traditional but very exclusive use of a few trusted oracles in Tibetan 
              Buddhism involving time-tested and dedicated Dharma protector deities 
              (who are not Buddhas or Bodhisattvas) for very special matters.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Even if there are some who claim advice
               from some mediums believed to represent Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to be 
              effective, Buddhists should never consult their services.</span> There 
              are two kinds of ‘mediums’ – the false ones and the genuine ones. As it 
              is difficult to discern one from the other, one might be paying (or 
              contributing ‘donations’) while being tricked. For false mediums, there 
              are again two kinds. The first are the downright fakes, who consciously 
              put on theatrical acts to fool devotees to part with their money. The 
              second are somewhat but not total fakes, who subconsciously autosuggest 
              themselves, often also through peer pressure of those who believe they 
              are special, to have the ability to call upon ‘higher beings’. Such 
              ‘mediums’ are still false, even if they have no intention to deceive, 
              and do wish to help others.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Despite power of the autosuggestable 
              mind, that can even express seemingly superhuman feats of endurance, 
              there are still obvious physical and spiritual limits.</span> If a 
              medium, say, is supposedly possessed by an ‘animal-god’, such as a 
              ‘monkey’, why is he or she not able to climb and swing from trees, 
              somersaulting like a real monkey? Unless… the medium was not really 
              possessed by such a being, while being unable to fully autosuggest 
              oneself to believe such feats can be done. Even if capable of some 
              acrobatics, there is the puzzle of how a character from a fictitious 
              novel can assist real people with real problems. If the Monkey King in 
              ‘Journey to the West’ (which is not a proper Dharma text) was written to
               have learnt the Dharma, this begs the question of why, if he is real, 
              his ‘mediums’ do not preach it directly, which would surely lead to full
               house classes attended by thousands.</p>
              <p>Even if a medium is genuine, he or she will not be able to ‘summon’ 
              the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas – as the enlightened ones never taught that
               they are summonable through any medium. In fact,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> in the Surangama Sutra (æ¥žä¸¥ç»�), Sakyamuni Buddha, our fundamental 
              teacher, clearly instructed Bodhisattvas and Arhats who manifest in 
              various manners in our world to aid us to never ever reveal their true 
              identities while alive</span>, at most disclosing who they are just 
              before (or after) departure. While this might sound deceptive, the 
              purpose of this is exactly the opposite – for preventing legitimisation 
              of self-proclaimed identities for deception by anyone. Imagine if the 
              Buddha taught instead, that all Bodhisattvas and Arhats should announce 
              who they are to the whole wide world. Not that there are not already 
              many, there would be even more with bold false claims.</p>
              <p>Therefore, anyone who puts up an actual or virtual signboard (e.g. 
              biodata, namecards, websites, posters, tickets, books, magazines) 
              claiming oneself to be a Buddha, Bodhisattva or Arhat is directly not a 
              true Buddhist, much less a Buddhist teacher or spokesperson for any of 
              the enlightened, who are explicitly forbidden to claim any enlightened 
              identity in our era. As the Buddha gravely put it, <span style="color: #ff0000;">‘Thus
               as I have said, is named the Buddhas’ speech [teachings]. Not thus as 
              said, is Papiyan’s [Mara: the evil one] speech.’ (‘å¦‚æˆ‘æ‰€è¯´ï¼Œå��ä¸ºä½›è¯´ã€‚ä¸�å¦‚æ­¤è¯´, 
              å�³æ³¢æ—¬è¯´ã€‚’)</span> Those who make audacious claims and remain in this world 
              are out to gather fame and fortune. Such worldly ambitions straightaway 
              render them spiritually impure. In some cases, false teachers have been 
              influenced or possessed by Mara (or his minions) personally, to confuse 
              the masses, and distract them from the true Dharma.</p>
              <p>Genuine mediums, at most, can only ‘channel’ gods and ghosts. Even 
              the duo can be hard to differentiate as there are some ghosts (or 
              wandering spirits) who like to possess mediums to relay messages, while 
              impersonating others. Helpful to some extent as they might be at times, 
              and playful at other times, their advice is not ultimate as they are not
               enlightened – which is why they are ghosts. Even if a god possesses a 
              medium, the messages conveyed are still imperfect as he or she is not a 
              fully enlightened ‘Teacher of humans and gods’, a title reserved for 
              Buddhas. Believability in mediums arises when they seem to know past 
              events and current situations. This is simply because <span style="color: #ff0000;">gods
               and ghosts (and some humans) can read the thoughts of their devotees 
              about their past and present to limited extents, so as to give seemingly
               ‘relevant’ answers, that do not guarantee accurate forecast of the 
              future</span>.</p>
              <p>Mediums are also surely not messengers of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as
               they are usually consulted only by non-Buddhists or confused Buddhists 
              lacking in understanding. As such, the queries presented to them are 
              usually mundane in nature, while they are never asked profound Dharma 
              enquiries. Thus, these mediums are never ‘tested’ on their authenticity 
              as ‘enlightened’ spokespersons. Even if not asked, they ought to speak 
              more in congruence with actual Buddhist teachings, using more direct 
              references from the Buddha’s teachings to further interest in the 
              Dharma. For instance, <span style="color: #ff0000;">if a medium claims 
              to be able to ‘summon’ Guanyin Bodhisattva, he or she should be able to 
              expound on her teachings, such as the Heart Sutra, with incomparable 
              clarity</span>, delivering detailed sermons often, instead of merely advising on worldly woes.</p>
              <p>Mediums of the like above are also never dedicated students of the 
              Dharma, for if they are, they would have come across the Surangama Sutra
               teaching, which admonishes assumption of sacred identities for 
              ‘branding’ their ‘spiritual’ consultations. Some might imagine that 
              since the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have great compassion, they should 
              also manifest through mediums. Well, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the enlightened will never go against the unequivocally stated Surangama teaching, as this would confuse us.</span> Even if they really do help through mediums, they will never say they 
              are the enlightened, which would counter that teaching. The Buddha’s 
              warning against seeking (and being) such mediums is clear and 
              indisputable. Even though Buddhists know others ‘borrow’ the statuses of
               Buddhist enlightened beings for medium practices, it does not mean this
               is agreeable. As these great beings originate from Buddhism, all should
               learn its true teachings to know what they really stand for.</p>
              <p>The more one frequents mediums, the further one digresses from the 
              path to Buddhahood. There would be greater refuge in gods and ghosts 
              than in the ‘Teacher of humans and gods’ (and ghosts and all other 
              beings). One might be asked to do practices against the Dharma too, such
               as animal sacrifice, which creates negative karma, aggravating existing
               problems. With possible addiction to medium advice for life’s issues 
              instead of learning and applying the Dharma, this can stunt growth of 
              personal wisdom. Most importantly, <span style="color: #ff0000;">even if
               the advice is somewhat helpful, it does not lead to liberation, as gods
               and ghosts themselves are still trapped in the rounds of rebirth</span>.
               With much proximity to mediums, especially those with access to real 
              ghosts, the devotee’s karmic affinity with them might deepen, to further
               associate with them when being reborn.</p>
              <p>Since summoned beings are unenlightened, they have greed, hatred and 
              delusion to some extent. This means there might be a price to pay if 
              their wrath is incurred, or if their expectations are not met. Praying 
              to enlightened Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, there is no such problem. Since
               consultation of mediums does not ensure ideal results, and might even 
              be dangerous, Buddhists stay clear of them. What is the alternative for 
              those who wish to ‘look for’ deceased ones? As stated in the Ksitigarbha
               Sutra (åœ°è—�ç»�), <span style="color: #ff0000;">one can ask the Buddha, who 
              has perfect compassion and wisdom, for help, before sincerely being 
              mindful of his name. Connecting to his blessings, inspired answers will 
              arise</span> in the mind or in a dream so vivid that one will know it is
               not imagined. Mindfulness of the Dharma for diligent practice helps us 
              much in everyday life too.</p>
              <p>In Tibetan Buddhism, although some masters are believed by disciples 
              to be manifestations of the enlightened, they never personally claim so.
               Even H.H. the 14th Dalai Lama, the most popular Tibetan Buddhist 
              teacher, when asked if he is Guanyin Bodhisattva, says he is just ‘a 
              simple monk’. If one comes across ‘teachers’ with repeated use of 
              self-proclaimed titles of being such and such an enlightened being, or 
              as a special earthly representation, it is best to keep far away. <span style="color: #ff0000;">All authentic Buddhist teachers would follow the Buddha’s advice to attract the interested through the Dharma itself</span>,
               not through such dubious marketing, which unfortunately easily attracts
               those uninformed of the Surangama teaching. Regarded as a 
              ‘demon-reflecting mirror’ that reveals those affected by inner and/or 
              outer demons, it must be used for self-reflection and for checking the 
              integrity of ‘teachers’.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">There are many kinds of false teachers riding on the name of Buddhism for easy gain of popularity.</span> Some use many Buddhist terms and even speak of Buddhist sutras, 
              mantras, meditation and such – for luring in nominal or new Buddhists 
              who are vaguely familiar with them, to look credible, while 
              reinterpreting them with self-concocted twists, throwing in non-Dharma 
              in the mix that deviates from the real deal. This makes their teachings 
              different, as if of a new tradition with exclusive ‘benefits’, while 
              they are corrupting the actual teachings. Anything that radically 
              differs from what the Buddha and great ancient Buddhist masters taught 
              is almost always erroneous. Some claim to have special powers, such as 
              being able to recall devotees’ past lives for advising accordingly – 
              when these stories cannot be verified at all. This is how they stay off 
              the hook.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">They play mind games, making wide and 
              thus safe guesses to suggest having predictive power, getting devotees 
              to publicise only right guesses.</span> Any open display of supernormal 
              powers, not that they are real in the case of false teachers, that 
              especially fosters the ego and distracts others from the true Dharma is 
              forbidden by the Buddha. Those who display them are not true Buddhists. 
              Pretending to be able to heal some is one of the easiest ways to attract
               crowds. But if one is so capable, why not directly visit hospitals? Any
               even true physical healing does not lead to good rebirths or liberation
               from rebirth anyway. The Buddha was thus focused on being a spiritual; 
              not a physical doctor, as death is inevitable. That said, practice of 
              the Buddha’s true teachings can lead to natural healing due to 
              eradication of negative karma that causes illness.</p>
              <p>With their bursting egos, false teachers tend to sell themselves 
              through others, as being the ‘best’ teachers available. With heavy 
              international marketing, they can easily gather many of the faithful but
               deluded. Some use planted or incomplete ‘testimonials’ of those who 
              ‘had’ semi-imaginary ‘healing’ effects with their ‘assistance’ to 
              attract more. The more lavish packaging there is, the more should all be
               alert. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The biodata of false teachers is 
              also usually elaborate but upon closer look, is vague and untraceable to
               reputable and still existing people and institutions</span> in the 
              Buddhist community. Some appear monastic or even pseudo-monastic, 
              especially those without a recognised lineage, or with one that disowned
               them. Some are established in worldly life, and tap upon this for 
              popularising themselves as ‘Buddhist teachers’ – when these factors are 
              not connected at all.</p>
              <p>Some create spurious awards to praise and promote themselves. Some 
              claim to have had special private instructions from late great teachers,
               so as to lean on their fame, while appearing to be their top disciples 
              taking up the mantle. Some create fake histories through detailed 
              (auto)biographies by their ‘devotees’, with outlandish claims of their 
              ‘supernormal powers’ and ‘enlightened’ experiences, which cannot be 
              proven. <span style="color: #ff0000;">While ensuring such tall tales circulate, they cunningly pretend to be ‘humble’.</span> Some even claim to have met the ‘enlightened’, who ‘endorsed’ them, 
              which makes them their ‘equivalent’ or their ‘messengers’. Such ways of 
              promoting the so-called ‘Dharma’, focusing on personal claims is wrong 
              as the Buddha taught us to rely on the Dharma, instead of any 
              personality. If a person is relied on in excess, one can easily be 
              misled eventually.</p>
              <p>How do the truly enlightened manifest in our world then? A great 
              example would be Great Master Yinguang (1861-1940). Despite living a 
              truly humble and frugal life, he was so awe-inspiring in conduct and 
              instruction, that adheres strictly to the Buddha’s teachings, that he 
              was posthumously conferred as the 13th Patriarch of the Pure Land 
              Tradition by the Buddhist world, while being revealed to be a 
              manifestation of Mahasthamaprapta [Dashizhi; Great Power Arrived] 
              Bodhisattva. Never flashy, yet he remains prominent in his influence as 
              an outstanding teacher. Remember – <span style="color: #ff0000;">even 
              the Buddha, who announced his true and full enlightenment, did not keep 
              harping on his status, and let the worth of his actions and teachings 
              speak for themselves</span>. Egoistic imposters however, seek more 
              attention for deluded reasons. Their demons are all clearly reflected in
               the great mirror of the Surangama Sutra!</p>
              <p>Even helpful humans, gods and ghosts<br> who have yet to take refuge<br> in perfect Buddhas, Dharma and Aryasangha<br> have yet to truly realise their worth.</p>
