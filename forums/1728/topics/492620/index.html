              one of her workers at Kalighat, her home for the dying destitute in Calcutta.</span></p>

              spoke no English and led me to a door. I walked with him into the dimly lit
              room to find a score of shrouded bodies on the wooden shelves. Without a word
              he reached over and grasped the shoulders of one of the deceased and as he slid
              the body off the shelf he motioned for me to grab the feet. We carried the body
              across the hall to a waiting transport van at the curb. Then we took another
              body from the van back to the morgue. My congressional colleague watched this
              exchange with amazement.</span></p>

              about what I had just done I was sure this would be the most memorable day in
              my congressional career.</span></p>

              started when my colleague, congressman Mike Synar of Oklahoma, invited me to
              join him on a congressional visit to South Asia. Mike told me from the start we
              would not be sitting poolside at a four-star hotel — we would be visiting some
              of the poorest places on Earth. He promised I would never forget the trip and
              that I would come home with a different view of the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>He was

              Kathmandu in Nepal with its massive Buddhist prayer wheels and at the time a
              ruling King. We trekked at high altitude into a mountain village with no
              electricity or running water. The locals with a third eye painted on their
              foreheads stacked wreaths of flowers around our necks. Through translators they
              were anxious to know about a young American from Pittsburgh who as a Peace
              Corps volunteer had lived with them for two years. They were sure we would know
              him. He was the only American they had ever known.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>We journeyed
              to Bangladesh, a country which often seemed to fall off of God’s radar and
              languish in the misery of poverty and horrific natural disasters. We walked the
              crowded streets of Dhaka with future Nobel Peace Prize honoree, Muhammad Yunus,
              founder of Grameen Bank. We learned that a loan of ten dollars to a poor woman
              could buy a goat and save a family from starvation. I later led the effort in
              the Senate to give Dr. Yunus the congressional Gold Medal for his lifetime of
              dedicated service to the poor.</span></p>

              Catholic nun in Calcutta (now Kolkata), barely five foot tall, who gave us a
              day still fresh in my memory more than twenty years later.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>We had
              scheduled visits with a long list of Indian government leaders but decided to
              add a stop at 6:00 am when we learned Mother Teresa and her nuns welcomed
              visitors to an early morning Mass at her chapel. Her fellow Missionaries of
              Charity filled the pews in their simple white habits with blue piping. The last
              row in the chapel was saved for visitors from around the world who like us
              wanted to meet this woman from Albania who had dedicated her life to the
              poorest souls on Earth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>After the
              Mass we were invited to have a cup of tea. We met Mother Teresa who welcomed us
              and talked about her busy day ahead. Mike Synar pulled me aside and said let’s
              cancel our meetings today and volunteer to help her. I agreed and we asked
              Mother Teresa if she could use two American volunteers. She said of course and
              we followed her into Kalighat.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Kalighat was
              a hospice where the street people in their final days of life were gathered
              from the dark corners of Calcutta and brought to die with dignity. There were
              two long rooms, one for women and another for the men. They rested on simple
              cots as Mother’s nuns and volunteers brought them water and food. There were no
              IV’s running and the only medicine appeared to be aspirin. I remember a badly
              burned woman and emaciated men who stared into space. The rooms were silent
              aside from the whispers of those who were attending the dying. When I remarked
              about the quiet of these rooms, Mother Teresa told me that for many of these
              people this was the only moment in their lives when they were at peace and felt
              truly loved.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Our job at
              that day, thank goodness, was simple. It was laundry day and we found her nuns
              washing the sheets and bedding by hand in steaming tubs. Mike and I were
              assigned to carry the baskets of clean laundry up three flights of stairs to
              the clothes lines on the roof. Aside from that side trip to the morgue, I spent
              several hours lugging the baskets up and down the stairs. Mother Teresa told us
              California Governor Jerry Brown had volunteered for the same job several weeks
              before and after a few days of practice became very good at it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Our next
              stop was her orphanage with a room full of wide-eyed toddlers hanging on to the
              bars on the cribs. Mother Teresa told us that she no longer turned to families
              around the world for placement. Indian families were now adopting these
              abandoned children and importantly were not concerned about the age-old caste
              differences.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>I asked
              about leprosy and she told me of the special place they had reserved for its
              victims. Before I knew it we were driving across Calcutta to see it. She sat in
              the front seat of our SUV silently fingering a rosary as our truck worked its
              way across the city. We slowed to a crawl behind ambling cows and witnessed the
              tableau of a Third World city with rush hour crowds of vendors and mothers and
              babies and partially clothed men showering with cans of water next to the
              street.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>I still
              remember the low roofs and building walls covered with drying cow dung pies
              used for fuel. They were lifted from the street and slapped on the walls to be
              retrieved later. They looked like giant peanut butter cookies, an image I have
              never forgotten to this day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>When we
              reached the refuge for lepers Mother Teresa led us from the truck. She was
              stopped several times by people who would fall to their knees to kiss her
              sandals. She tried to stop them but they would not be deterred.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The refuge
              was an abandoned railroad warehouse which Mother Teresa had commandeered for
              the poor. No right-thinking government bureaucrat would say no to her. Many of
              the leprosy victims were badly scarred and had lost fingers and limbs to the
              disease. She gave them the assignment of making the beautiful white habits for
              her nuns in return for food and shelter. The love they had for her was obvious
              in the words spoken and in their eyes. For Mother Teresa they were not
              outcasts.</span></p>

              week thousands gathered in St. Peter’s Square as Pope Francis formally
              announced that this simple woman who spent her life among the poorest of the
              poor was formally recognized as a saint by the Church.</span></p>
