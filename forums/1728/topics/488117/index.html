              YOU SIT, do not change the position again until the end of the time you
              determined at the beginning. Suppose you change your original position because
              it is uncomfortable, and assume another position. What happens after a while is
              that the new position becomes uncomfortable. Then you want another and after a
              while it, too, becomes uncomfortable. So you may go on shifting, moving, changing
              one position to another the whole time you are on your meditation cushion and
              you may not gain a deep and meaningful level of concentration. Therefore, do
              not change your original position, no matter how painful it is.</span></p>

              avoid changing your position, determine at the beginning of meditation how long
              you are going to meditate. If you have never meditated before, sit motionlessly
              for not longer than twenty minutes. As you repeat your practice, you can
              increase your sitting time. The length of sitting depends on how much time you
              have for sitting meditation practice and how long you can sit without
              excruciating pain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>We
              should not have a time schedule to attain the goal, for our attainment depends
              on how we progress in our practice based on our understanding and development
              of our spiritual faculties. We must work diligently and mindfully toward the
              goal without setting any particular time schedule to reach it. When we are
              ready, we get there. All we have to do is to prepare ourselves for that
              attainment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>After
              sitting motionlessly, close your eyes. Our mind is analogous to a cup of muddy
              water. The longer you keep a cup of muddy water still, the more the mud settles
              down and the water will be seen clearly. Similarly, if you keep quiet without
              moving your body, focusing your entire undivided attention on the subject of
              your meditation, your mind settles down and begins to experience the bliss of
              meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>To
              prepare for this attainment, we should keep our mind in the present moment. The
              present moment is changing so fast that a casual observer does not seem to
              notice its existence at all. Every moment is a moment of events and no moment
              passes by without an event. We cannot notice a moment without noticing events
              taking place in that moment. Therefore, the moment we try to pay bare attention
              to is the present moment. Our mind goes through a series of events like a
              series of pictures passing through a projector. Some of these pictures are
              coming from our past experiences and others are our imaginations of things that
              we plan to do in the future. The mind can never be focused without a mental
              object. Therefore we must give our mind an object which is readily available
              every present moment. One such object is our breath.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>The
              mind does not have to make a great effort to find the breath. Every moment the
              breath is flowing in and out through our nostrils. As our practice of insight
              meditation is taking place every waking moment, our mind finds it very easy to
              focus itself on the breath, for it is more conspicuous and constant than any
              other object.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>After
              sitting in the manner explained earlier and having shared your loving-kindness
              with everybody, take three deep breaths. After taking three deep breaths,
              breathe normally, letting your breath flow in and out freely, effortlessly, and
              begin focusing your attention on the rims of your nostrils. Simply notice the
              feeling of breath going in and out. When one inhalation is complete and before
              exhaling begins, there is a brief pause. Notice it and notice the beginning of
              exhaling. When the exhalation is complete, there is another brief pause before
              inhaling begins. Notice this brief pause, too. This means that there are two
              brief pauses of breathâ€”one at the end of inhaling and the other at the end of
              exhaling. These two pauses occur in such a brief moment you may not be aware of
              their occurrence. But when you are mindful, you can notice them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Do not
              verbalize or conceptualize anything. Simply notice the incoming and outgoing
              breath without saying, "I breathe in" or "I breathe out."
              When you focus your attention on the breath ignore any thought, memory, sound,
              smell, taste, etc., and focus your attention exclusively on the breath, nothing
              else.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>At the
              beginning, both the inhalations and exhalations are short because the body and
              mind are not calm and relaxed. Notice the feeling of that short inhaling and
              short exhaling as they occur without saying, "short inhaling" or
              "short exhaling." As you continue to notice the feeling of short
              inhaling and short exhaling, your body and mind become relatively calm. Then
              your breath becomes long. Notice the feeling of that long breath as it is
              without saying, "Long breath." Then notice the entire breathing
              process from the beginning to the end. Subsequently the breath becomes subtle,
              and the mind and body become calmer than before. Notice this calm and peaceful
              feeling of your breathing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Similarly,
              as you continue this exercise, your breath becomes so subtle and refined that
              you might not be able to notice the feeling of breath at all. When this happens
              do not worry. It has not disappeared. It is still where it was beforeâ€”right at
              the nostril-tips. Take a few quick breaths and you will notice the feeling of
              breathing again. Continue to pay bare attention to the feeling of the touch of
              breath at the rims of your nostrils. As you keep your mind focused on the rims
              of your nostrils, you will be able to notice the sign of the development of
              meditation. You will feel the pleasant sensation of a sign. Different
              meditators experience this differently. It will be like a star, or a round gem,
              or a round pearl, or a cottonseed, or a peg made of heartwood, or a long
              string, or a wreath of flowers, or a puff of smoke, or a cobweb, or a film of
              cloud, or a lotus flower, or the disc of the moon, or the disc of the sun.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Earlier
              in your practice you had inhaling and exhaling as objects of meditation. Now
              you have the sign as the third object of meditation. When you focus your mind
              on this third object, your mind reaches a stage of concentration sufficient for
              your practice of insight meditation. This sign is strongly present at the rims
              of the nostrils. Master it and gain full control of it so that whenever you
              want, it should be available. Unite the mind with this sign which is available
              in the present moment and let the mind flow with every succeeding moment. As
              you pay bare attention to it, you will see that the sign itself is changing
              every moment. Keep your mind with the changing moments. Also, notice that your
              mind can be concentrated only on the present moment. This unity of the mind
              with the present moment is called momentary concentration. As moments are
              incessantly passing away one after another, the mind keeps pace with them,
              changing with them, appearing and disappearing with them without clinging to
              any of them. If we try to stop the mind at one moment, we end up in frustration
              because the mind cannot be held fast. It must keep up with what is happening in
              the new moment. As the present moment can be found any moment, every waking
              moment can be made a concentrated moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>To
              unite the mind with the present moment, we must find something happening in
              that moment. However, you cannot focus your mind on every changing moment
              without a certain degree of concentration to keep pace with the moment. Once
              you gain this degree of concentration, you can use it for focusing your
              attention on anything you experienceâ€”the rising and falling of your abdomen,
              the rising and falling of the chest area, the rising and falling of any
              feeling, or the rising and falling of your breath or thoughts and so on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>To
              make any progress in insight meditation you need this kind of momentary
              concentration. That is all you need for the insight meditation practice because
              everything in your experience lives only for one moment. When you focus this
              concentrated state of mind on the changes taking place in your mind and body,
              you will notice that your breath is the physical part and that the feeling of
              breath, consciousness of the feeling, and the consciousness of the sign are the
              mental parts. As you notice them you can notice that they are changing all the
              time. You may have various types of sensations, other than the feeling of
              breathing, taking place in your body. Watch them all over your body. Don't try
              to create any feeling which is not naturally present in any part of your body.
              But notice whatever sensation arises in the body. When thought arises notice it
              too. All you should notice in all these occurrences is the impermanent,
              unsatisfactory, and selfless nature of all your experiences whether mental or
              physical.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>As
              your mindfulness develops, your resentment for the change, your dislike for the
              unpleasant experiences, your greed for the pleasant experiences, and the notion
              of selfhood will be replaced by the deeper awareness of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness,
              and selflessness. This knowledge of reality in your experience helps you to
              foster a more calm, peaceful, and mature attitude toward your life. You will
              see what you thought in the past to be permanent is changing with such
              inconceivable rapidity that even your mind cannot keep up with these changes.
              Somehow you will be able to notice many of the changes. You will see the
              subtlety of impermanence and the subtlety of selflessness. This insight will
              show you the way to peace, happiness, and will give you the wisdom to handle
              your daily problems in life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>When
              the mind is united with the breath flowing all the time, we will naturally be
              able to focus the mind on the present moment. We can notice the feeling arising
              from contact of breath with the rim of our nostrils. As the earth element of
              the air that we breathe in and out touches the earth element of our nostrils,
              the mind feels the flow of air in and out. The warm feeling arises at the
              nostrils or any other part of the body from the contact of the heat element
              generated by the breathing process. The feeling of impermanence of breath
              arises when the earth element of flowing breath touches the nostrils. Although
              the water element is present in the breath, the mind cannot feel it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Also,
              we feel the expansion and contraction of our lungs, abdomen, and lower abdomen,
              as the fresh air is pumped in and out of the lungs. The expansion and
              contraction of the abdomen, lower abdomen and chest are parts of the universal
              rhythm. Everything in the universe has the same rhythm of expansion and
              contraction just like our breath and body. All of them are rising and falling.
              However, our primary concern is the rising and falling phenomena of the breath
              and minute parts of our minds and bodies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Along
              with the inhaling breath, we experience a small degree of calmness. This little
              degree of calmness turns into tension if we don't breathe out in a few moments.
              As we breathe out this tension is released. After breathing out, we experience
              discomfort if we wait too long before having fresh air brought in again. This
              means that every time our lungs are full we must breathe out and every time our
              lungs are empty we must breathe in. As we breathe in, we experience a small
              degree of calmness, and as we breathe out, we experience a small degree of
              calmness. We desire calmness and relief of tension and do not like the tension
              and feeling resulting from the lack of breath. We wish that the calmness would
              stay longer and the tension disappear more quickly than it normally does. But
              the tension will not go away as fast as we wish nor will the calmness stay as
              long as we wish. And again we get agitated or irritated, for we desire the
              calmness to return and stay longer and the tension to go away quickly and not
              to return again. Here we see how even a small degree of desire for permanency
              in an impermanent situation causes pain or unhappiness. Since there is no
              self-entity to control this situation, we will become more disappointed.</span></p>

              if we watch our breathing without desiring calmness and without resenting the
              tension arising from breathing in and out, and experience only the
              impermanence, the unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of our breath, our mind
              becomes peaceful and calm.</span></p>

              memories, emotions, perceptions, consciousness, and mental formations as well.
              When we experience these states, we should forget about the feeling of breath
              and immediately focus our attention on these statesâ€”one at a time, not all of
              them at one time. As they fade away, we let our mind return to the breath which
              is the home base the mind can return to from quick or long journeys to various
              states of mind and body. We must remember that all these mental journeys are
              made within the mind itself.</span></p>

              time the mind returns to the breath, it comes back with a deeper insight into
              impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness. The mind becomes more
              insightful from the impartial and unbiased watching of these occurrences. The
              mind gains insight into the fact that this body, these feelings, the various
              states of consciousness, and numerous mental formations are to be used only for
              the purpose of gaining deeper insight into the reality of this body-mind

              <p>How is your breath not similar to the previous one, or, how is your breath different from the previous one? Are you letting go of the attachments that unwittingly arise, is it not delusions that you have forgone, how about the desires that you already forgotten?</p>
              <p>Still, are you still practicing the sitting? Or, is the sitting just another day's work?Are you not heartened by opportunity to relax, reinvigorate and recharge? Is it not an opportunity of thankfulness and mindfulness as it comes to mind?</p>
