              <p><strong>A monk asked Tozan, “When cold and heat come, how can we avoid them?”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Tozan said, “Why don’t you go to the place where there is no cold or heat?”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The monk said, “What is the place where there is no cold or heat?”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Tozan said, “When it’s cold, the cold kills you; when it’s hot, the heat kills you.”</strong></p>
              <p>This is not advice to “accept” your situation, as some commentators 
              have suggested, but a direct expression of authentic practice and 
              enlightenment. Master Tozan is not saying, “When cold, shiver; when hot,
               sweat,” nor is he saying, “When cold, put on a sweater; when hot, use a
               fan.” In the state of authentic practice and enlightenment, the cold 
              kills you, and there is only cold in the whole universe. The heat kills 
              you, and there is only heat in the whole universe. The fragrance of 
              incense kills you, and there is only the fragrance of incense in the 
              whole universe. The sound of the bell kills you, and there is only 
              “boooong” in the whole universe…</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by simpo_:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">Hi Beautiful951,<br> Firstly, I will like to state that i am still learning so can           
                            only share from my own opinion. Please read with a pint of
                                       salt.<br> Emptiness is not a belief but an insight that can be borne from         
                              experience. It is better to experience it for oneself as
               before and                         after the insight, it can still be 
              'unbelievable' for the mind.                         Emptiness is quite 
              hard to experience and usually the realisation                         
              of no-self comes before emptiness.<br> As mentioned, no-self will be easier to realise. I will describe        
                               the insight of  no-self/egolessness generally here. 
              When doing                         insight meditation one may realise 
              that the sensory experiences                         (including mental 
              formation/thinking) are arising and passing away                        
               independently of one another. That is, seeing is seeing, hearing is    
                                   hearing, thinking is thinking and they are all 
              flowing                         independently. With that observation, 
              one will realise that there                         is no self holding 
              all these sensory experiences together.                          Self 
              that we originally assumed, is just these sensory experiences           
                            arising and passing away and the attention focusing on 
              them.<br> As for emptiness, it requires a deeper penetration into                 
                      consciousness. Emptiness reveals that everying is not physical 
              and                         solid at all... but are 'holographically 
              united'. There is no way                         to accurately describe 
              it as it is not the way a mind unaware to it                         
              will think. Like the first insight of no-self, emptiness is a           
                            paradigm shift... towards ever clearer seeing of the truth
               of                         Reality.<br> Please understand that seeing emptiness is not end of story. At         
                              least, not for my case. I am currently working on the 
              remaining                         defilements. This doesn't meant that i
               will need to forcefully                         remove them. Forceful 
              willing will only result in suppression.                         Rather,
               the 'method' is to be <strong><em>aware of</em></strong> and <strong><em>be equanimous</em></strong> to whatever that is                         arising in order for them 
              to pass away naturally. This 'aware of'                         is not 
              as easy as it sounds.<br> Regards</div>

                           always missed! Due to a very fundamental flaw in our 
              ordinary                         dualistic framework of things... and 
              our deep rooted belief in                         duality.<br> <br> In the seen, there is just the seen! It is completely                   
                    non-dual... there is no 'the seen + a perceiver here seeing the   
                                    seen'.... The seen is precisely the seeing! There 
              is not two or                         three things: seer, seeing, and 
              the seen. That split is entirely                         conceptual 
              (though taken to be reality)... it is a conclusion due                  
                     to a referencing back of a direct experience (like a sight or a  
                                     sound) to a centerpoint. This centerpoint could 
              be a vague                         identification and contraction to 
              one's mind and body (and this                         'center of 
              identification within the body' could be like two inches                
                       behind your eyes or on the lower body or elsewhere), or the    
                                   centerpoint could be an identification with a 
              previous nondual                         recognition or authentication 
              like the I AM or Eternal Witness                         
              experience/realization. It could even be that one has gained            
                           sufficient stability to simply rest in the state of 
              formless                         Beingness throughout all experiences, 
              but if they cling to their                         formless samadhi or a
               'purest state of Presence', they will miss                         the 
              fact that they are not just the formless pure existence but             
                          that they are/existence is also all the stuff of the 
              universe                         arising moment to moment... And when 
              one identifies oneself as this                         entity that is 
              behind and separated from the seen, this prevents                       
                the direct experience of what manifestation and no-self is.<br> <br> But in direct experience it is simply not like that: there is           
                            nothing like subject-object duality in direct 
              experience.... only                         This - seen, heard, sensed, 
              cognized. Prior to self-referencing,                         this is 
              what exists in its primordial purity.<br> <br> So, in the seen, there's just That! Scenery, trees, road, etc...        
                               but when I label these as such, instead of putting a 
              more                         subjective term such as 'experiencing'.... 
              they tend to conjure                         images of an objective 
              world that is 'out there' made of multiple                         
              different objects existing in time and space separated by               
                        distances.<br> <br> But no, the Buddha says: in the seen, just the seen! There is no        
                               thing 'here' (apart from the seen).... nor something 
              'there' (as if                         the seen is an objective reality 
              out there). From the perspective                         of the logical 
              framework of things, the world is made of distance,                     
                  depth, entities, objects, time, space, and so on, but if you take   
                                    away the reference point of a self... there is 
              simply Pure                         Consciousness of What Is (whatever 
              manifests) without distance or                         fragmentation. 
              You need at least two reference points to measure                       
                distance... but all reference points (be it of an apparent            
                           subjective self or an apparent external object) are 
              entirely                         illusory and conceptual. If there is no
               'self' here, and that you                         are equally 
              everything... what distance is there? Without a self,                   
                    there is no 'out there'...<br> <br> The seen is neither subjective nor objective.... it just                         IS....<br> <br> There is pure seeing, pure hearing, everything arising without          
                             an external reference other than the scenery being the 
              seeing                         without seer, the sound being the hearing
               without hearer (and vice                         versa: the hearing 
              being just the sound, the manifestation).<br> <br> But even the word 'hearing', 'seeing', 'awareness' can conjure          
                             an image of what Awareness is.... As if there is really 
              an entity                         called 'hearing' or 'seeing' or 
              'awareness' that remains and stays                         constant and 
              unchanged.<br> <br> But.... if you contemplate on "How am I experiencing the moment         
                              of being alive?", or, "How am I experiencing the moment 
              of                         hearing?", or "How am I experiencing the 
              moment of seeing?" or "How                         am I experiencing the
               moment of being aware?"<br> <br> All the bullshit concepts, constructs and images of an                  
                     'aliveness', a 'hearing', a 'seeing', an 'awareness' simply      
                                 dissolves in the direct experiencing of whatever 
              arises... just                         'seeing is seeing, hearing is 
              hearing, thinking is thinking and                         they are all 
              flowing independently', with 'no self holding all                       
                these sensory experiences together'.<br> <br> If readers find my explanation a bit too hard to grasp, please          
                             read Ajahn Amaro's link because he explains it much 
              better than                         me.</div>
