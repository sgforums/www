I remembered that before my current house is renovated, we have this room, whereby it's dark, eerie, which I would never ever thought of going in.  But my grandmother kept her jewellery in that room losely in a very accessible drawer.  So one day when my house was burgled, somehow or rather, items in that room was still intact and nothing was missing.  My grandmother said that it was the blessing of my grandfather and my great grandfather.  Now that room is my bedroom.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
