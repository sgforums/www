            <div class='col-md body'><strong>COMPLAINING AND RESENTMENT</strong><br><br>Complaining is one of the ego's favorite strategies for strengthening itself. Every complaint is a little story the mind makes up that you completely believe in. Whether you complain aloud or only in thought makes no difference. Some egos that perhaps don't have much else to identify with easily survive on complaining alone. When you are in the grip of such an ego, complaining, especially about other people, is habitual and, of course, unconscious, which means you don't know what you are doing. Applying negative mental labels to people, either to their face or more commonly when you speak about them to others or even just think about them, is often part of the pattern. Name-calling is the crudest form of such labeling and of the ego's need to be right and triumph over others: "jerk, bastard, bitch"-all definitive pronouncements that you can't argue with. On the next level down on the scale of unconsciousness, you have shouting and screaming, and not much below that, physical violence.<br><br>Resentment is the emotion that goes with complaining and the mental labeling with people and adds even more energy to the ego. Resentment means to feel bitter, indignant, aggrieved, or offended. You resent other people's greed, their dishonesty, their lack of integrity, what they are doing, what they did in the past, what they said, what they failed to do, what they should or shouldn't have done. The ego  loves it. Instead of overlooking unconsciousness in others, you make it into their identity. Who is doing that? The unconsciousness in you, the ego. Sometimes the "fault" that you perceive in another isn't even there. It is a total misinterpretation, a projection by a mind conditioned to see enemies and to make itself right or superior. At other times, the fault may be there, but by focusing on it, sometimes to the exclusion of everything else, you amplify it. And what you react to in another, you strengthen in yourself.<br><br>Nonreaction to the ego in others is one of the most effective ways not only of going beyond ego in yourself but also of dissolving the collective human ego. But you can only be in a state of nonreaction if you can recognize someone's behavior as coming from the ego, as being an expression of the collective human dysfunction. When you realize it's not personal, there is no longer a compulsion to react as if it were. By not reacting to the ego, you will often be able to bring out the sanity in others, which is the unconditioned consciousness as opposed to the conditioned. At times you may have to take practical steps to protect yourself from deeply unconscious people. This you can do without making them into enemies. Your greatest protection, however, is being conscious. Somebody becomes an enemy if you personalize the unconsciousness that is the ego. Nonreaction is not weakness but strength. Another word for nonreaction is forgiveness. To forgive is to overlook, or rather to look through. You look through the ego to the sanity that is in every human being as his or her essence.<br><br>The ego loves to complain and feel resentful not only about other people but also about situations. What you can do to a person, you can also do to a situation: make it into an enemy. The implication is always: This should not be happening; I don't want to be here; I don't want to be doing this; I'm being treated unfairly. And the ego's greatest enemy of all is, of course, the present moment, which is to say, life itself.<br><br>Complaining is not to be confused with informing someone of a mistake or deficiency so that it can be put to right. And to refrain from complaining doesn't necessarily mean putting up with bad quality or behavior. There is no ego in telling the waiter that your soup is cold and needs to be heated up---if you stick to the facts, which are always neutral. "How dare you serve me cold soup..........." That's complaining. There is a "me" here that loves to feel personally offended by the cold soup and is going to make the most of it, a "me" that enjoys making someone wrong. The complaining we are talking about is in service to the ego, not of change.<br><br>See if you can catch, that is to say, notice, the voice in the head, perhaps in the very moment it complains about something, and recognize it for what it is: the voice of the ego, no more than a conditioned mind-pattern, thought. Whenever you notice that voice, you will also realize that you are not the voice, but the one who is aware of it. In fact, you are the awareness that is aware of the voice. In the background, there is the awareness. In the foreground, there is the voice, the thinker. In this way you are becoming free of the ego, free of the unobserved mind. The moment you become aware of the ego in you, it is strictly speaking no longer the ego, but just an old, conditioned mind-pattern. Ego implies unawareness. Awareness and ego cannot co-exist.The old mind-pattern or mental habit may still survive and reoccur for a while because it has the momentum of thousands of years of collective human unconsciousness behind it, but every time it is recognized, it is weakened.<br><br>(A New Earth)</div>

But my master explained that, the "great-fire-pit" refers to the fires of hatred and anger, while the pond, clear and pure, refers to our Buddhamind. This relates to a true story, or experience, back in Taiwan.<br><br>My master had once observed that one of his disciples will meet a tribulation in the coming days... He called him up, and advised him not to be moved away from the triple jems (buddha, dharma, sangha), CHANT Guan-Shir-Yin frequently, and never to be affected by any anger. Just next day, this disciple was working at the construction site (he is a construction worker). Then, he got into an argument with someone on who should use the machine first. Tension rosed, and finally they decided to "settle it" outside. Suddenly, this person remembered my master's words, and began to truly regrett his earlier harshness. He chanted Namo Guanshiryin Pusa, and became very peaceful and calm, and smiled happily. The other person then went there to "settle" the issue, but seeing that he was smiling, he walked away. He threw a vegetable knife he was hiding onto the table. On seeing this, the person (who chanted guanshiryin) was extremely shocked, and realised what could have happened if he had continued the conflict. He was without any weapons, how could he be able to survive, fighting him with a fist?<br><br>From this, we should chant, pay reverence, learn, and most importantly, Be Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. We should learn to be compassionate in all situations, a Bodhisattva's compassion is selfless.<br><br>This is the testimonial to the "power of Avalokitesvara", of course, testimonials are really a lot, many people meeting disasters, car accidents, those that one definitely could not have survived, are saved miraculously by the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>Those who suffers from bad temper and strong hatred can try chanting regularly.. perhaps, 108 times a day. Most importantly, when we chant, we must not let our mind wander, and focus on the chanting. In this way, chanting works best to remove our minds of sentient, samsaric thoughts.<br><br>We should all learn to be compassionate like Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>Â“The ultimate goal of teaching is that Emptiness whose essence is Compassion.Â” - Great Pandita Atisha</div>

Poof. There is nothing to endure, because our thoughts and reactions are seen through, are empty. Your mind is simply empty like vast space, whatever happens or whatever things that happen 'out there' just happens by itself and there is no 'you' that is affected, because you are just like vast space. Even if people want to throw things at you, or even if a thought arises, it will not land anywhere. Instantaneously gone. We can try to practice like that, if we can then such things will be very simple for us.</div></blockquote>Found this beautiful verse:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If folks argue and slander you, let them:<br>they are playing with fire, trying to burn the sky.</span><br><br>~ <a href="http://www.wwzc.org/translations/shodoka.htm" rel="nofollow">Shodoka: Song of Freedom</a></div>
