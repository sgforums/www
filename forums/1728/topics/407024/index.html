              <p>Actually, you can practice meditation anywhere that is safe and
                                      comfortable.<br> <br> I started learning meditation at home, and still prefers to
                                      meditate at home. However, I usually meditate after midnight, when
                                      everyone else in the family is sleeping.<br> <br> My personal experience, start of meditation, sit in a comfortable
                                      position, back against the wall, close eyes, pay attention to my
                                      breathing. When thoughts arises, just be aware of it and go back to
                                      breathing.<br> <br> Eventually, increases awareness, can feel the energy swelling in my
                                      crown chahkra region, can feel heartbeats, breathing became very
                                      light or almost stop breathing.<br> <br> Next, I have only two possible outcome<br> <br> 1. I fall asleep in my siting position.<br> <br> 2. I stand up, stretch my muscles, walk to bed and sleep.<br> <br> I also noticed, my body will get heated up during meditation and I
                                      will still sweat even under celling fan and cool night
                                      conditions.<br> <br> Anyone can enlighten me, did all my meditation failed? What is
                                      there to achieve in such meditation other getting heated up and
                                      falling asleep?</p>

              <p>Very good meditation guide.</p>
              <p>Regarding what you experienced, it is common and nothing is going wrong. I have experienced them before.</p>
              <p>The reason why your breath slows down, it is due to thoughts slowing down. You will see that there is a direct link between thoughts and breathing, when your thoughts are racing, your breathing is also hard. Through meditation the breath can become so shallow it is almost unnoticeable. I notice this always happens as I approach thoughtlessness in breathing mindfulness.</p>
              <p>The heartbeat and energy/chakra thing is very common as well. When you meditate, concentration and awareness will arise. For me, the heart beat will become very intensely felt and there are tingling sensations in the third eye area. As for the crown chakra, is there energy flowing up and down from crown down to your naval and then back up again?</p>
              <p>Body heated up is characteristic of third nana, I have experienced this as well... sometimes its like a rush of heat suddenly coming up the body.</p>
              <p>Anyway whatever you experienced is the side effect of concentration. It is a good sign as it shows your meditation is progressing, not to worry too much.</p>
              <p>Getting sleepy is common but if your mindfulness is very intense, it is hard to fall asleep. You can also try meditating earlier in the day or in the morning.</p>

              <p>Yes when you become aware, you experience intense heartbeat, and I also notice that when some form of rapture/bliss arise you will also experience the heartbeat, and also for expanding, when you let go of your fixation naturally you will experience expansion. This is good.</p>
              <p>Anyway the heat might not be third nana. There are other characteristics before concluding with the diagnosis.</p>

              <p>Open your eyes, or keep them half open half closed. Don't close totally. Keep your mindfulness/awareness. What kind of meditation do you practice?</p>
              <p>If you want to close your eyes, make sure you have enough sleep and preferably not too late into the night (try morning or afternoon).</p>

              <p>It sounds like you have crossed the A&amp;P, 4th nana or 2nd vipassana jhana. As Daniel says of A&amp;P,<em> "Wild “kundalini” phenomena are very common at this point, including 
                  powerful physical shaking and releases, explosions of consciousness like
                   a fireworks display or a tornado, visions, and especially vortexes of 
                  powerful fine “electrical” vibrations blasting down one's spinal column 
                  and/or between one's ears."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had many A&amp;P experiences, it is actually not uncommon. You can write to Daniel and ask if you want.</p>
