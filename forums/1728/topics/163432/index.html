Can someone give me some advice? Got anything for me to meditate?</div></blockquote>Are you a Buddhist?<br><br>For a start, you should chant Na Mo Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa, 108 times everyday.<br><br>---------------<br><br>from <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=98448" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=98448</a><br><blockquote>If anyone wants to hurt you and pushes you into a great fire-pit, if you contemplate the power of Avalokitesvara, the fire-pit will change into a pond. - Lotus Sutra</blockquote>So, this is what the translation says. But my master explained that, the great-fire-pit refers to the fires of hatred and anger, while the pond, clear and pure, refers to our Buddhamind. This relates to a true story, or experience, back in Taiwan.<br><br>My master had once observed that one of his disciples will meet a tribulation in the coming days... He called him up, and advised him not to be moved away from the triple jems (buddha, dharma, sangha), CHANT Guan-Shir-Yin frequently, and never to be affected by any anger. Just next day, this disciple was working at the construction site (he is a construction worker). Then, he got into an argument with someone on who should use the machine first. Tension rosed, and finally they decided to "settle it" outside. Suddenly, this person remembered my master's words, and began to truly regrett his earlier harshness. He chanted Namo Guanshiryin Pusa, and became very peaceful and calm, and smiled happily. The other person then went there to "settle" the issue, but seeing that he was smiling, he walked away. He threw a vegetable knife he was hiding onto the table. On seeing this, the person (who chanted guanshiryin) was extremely shocked, and realised what could have happened if he had continued the conflict. He was without any weapons, how could he be able to survive, fighting him with a fist?<br><br>From this, we should chant, pay reverence, learn, and most importantly, Be Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. We should learn to be compassionate in all situations, a Bodhisattva's compassion is selfless.<br><br>This is the testimonial to the "power of Avalokitesvara", of course, testimonials are really a lot, many people meeting disasters, car accidents, those that one definitely could not have survived, are saved miraculously by the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>Those who suffers from bad temper and strong hatred can try chanting regularly.. perhaps, 108 times a day. Most importantly, when we chant, we must not let our mind wander, and practice Samadhi (concentration, one-pointedness) on the chanting. In this way, chanting works best to remove our minds of sentient, samsaric thoughts.<br><br>We should all learn to be compassionate like Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>Â“The ultimate goal of teaching is that Emptiness whose essence is Compassion.Â” - Great Pandita Atisha<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>Lastly, if you are not a Buddhist yet, you should take refuge in Three Treasures. You may also wish to learn Meditation from a qualified teacher.</div>

'Xiiiiii', breathe in and breathe out. No. You simply remain focused and aware of your breathing. Breathe normally. And a person should learn Meditation from a qualified Buddhist teacher...<br><br><blockquote>erm...actually everyone can invoke communication with the unseen(spiritual).. juz ned to improve ur sensitivity wif human beings first..coz spiritual will b close to those wo will tink like them..

Even if a person has the abilities to communicate with the spiritual world, it may not be a very good thing, and does not mean a person has attained much. Because Spirit realm belongs to the 3 lower realms, it is not what we seek. Another thing is, a person can have 'Gui3 Shen2 Tong1' and able to see many things a normal person can't. This is not good, it is not the 'Shen2 Tong1' that great practitioners have. Gui Shen Tong has to do with the spiritual realm.<br><br>A person should have Enlightenment as his focus.<br><br><blockquote>how to improve?<br>juz ned a silent prayin for the well-being for all human being...frm here u will gradually improve ur sensitivity and which will lead to many tings..a sincere heart will do..<br>but however this kind of tings might lead to some physology kind of things..so ned to b careful but if u can recover frm mental illness..it will b even best(hope can understand)....character oso play a part too...</blockquote>Develope compassion and loving kindness for all beings, but not some kind of special abilities. Aiming to develope special abilities can be dangerous. A person should just sincerely practise the Dharma and not be too bothered about these kind of things...<br><br></div>

If you are a very virtuous person, naturally good spirits, and even deva (celestial beings) if you are a very very virtuous person, will protect you. But being a Buddhist, we don't really deal with these beings. Unless we are enlightened beings, then it is another matter. If we deal with such beings it would be for the purpose of liberating them.</div>
