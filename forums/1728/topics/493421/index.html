              Better Not To Hate Them</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Diana Winston FALL 2004
              tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Even
              if they are really horrible, greedy, corrupt, and completely deserve it. . .</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              know how easy it is to sit around during this election year and smolder in
              rage. I have years of personal experience reading newspapers or listening to
              news while the urge to violence hijacks my mind. Getting wind of the latest
              degradation to decades-old environmental legislation or another slash to health
              care and education is sure to get me steaming. I have entertained countless
              fantasies of moving to another country (and that’s the tame end of things). But
              in spite of my anger, rage, and disbelief, I have a commitment to try not to
              hate, or at least to try to temper my hate with a little bit of compassion and
              understanding. Why? Well, I think it’s the sane way to be—and my dharma
              practice demands it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
              this end, I’ve concocted a set of reasons that I use to remind myself not to
              hate our government. These reasons are by no means meant to disempower me or
              prevent me from acting. What they do instead is provide an antidote to my
              bitterness. They serve as practice instruction to see how wide I can open my
              heart. They provide a Buddhist twist to counteract my habitual tendencies so
              that I can ultimately respond to perceived injustice from a healthier place.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">1.
              HATRED HURTS.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Buddha taught that hatred is a form of suffering. He said that holding hatred
              in the mind and heart is like tightly clutching a hot coal in your hand—guess
              who suffers? You can experience the burning quality of hatred by examining your
              own mind. What does your mind feel like when it is filled with love? Most
              likely you feel connection, spaciousness, openness. What does it feel like when
              your mind is full of hate? Probably you feel disconnection, pain, and
              separation, all accompanied by some good old self-righteousness. Dharma
              practice is about the development and cultivation of skillful mind states—no
              matter what the situation. This is not to say difficult mind states don’t arise
              unbidden, but which ones do you want to hang on to? What kind of mind do you
              want?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">2.
              NO ONE IS ETERNALLY OR INHERENTLY ANYTHING.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhist
              teachings remind us there is no essential “self’ that lasts or is inherent.
              This person we are hating is not always this way, has not always been this way,
              and may act very differently at other times. And within each of us lie the
              seeds of change. When I can remember this, my clinging to blame can soften. I
              am reminded of the Buddhist tale of Angulimala, the murderer who wore a garland
              of 999 fingers around his neck to commemorate the brutal death of each of his
              victims. When the Buddha saw that the murderer’s mother was to be his
              thousandth victim, he intervened and, with a single teaching, converted this
              evil criminal into a fully enlightened being, albeit one who still had to
              accept the karmic consequences of his earlier actions. It’s an interesting
              teaching tale of the potential for change within each of us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">3.
              WE’RE THAT WAY, TOO.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">No
              one corners the market on greed, hatred, or delusion. These mental states are
              inside all of us. When I’m in the middle of a heated argument, I sometimes
              point out to myself that I’m filled with anger, just like the person I’m mad at.
              We may not have the degree of anger we see reflected in the violence in the
              world. We may not have the power to do damage on the level of a world leader.
              But for anyone who has ever sat down to observe the mind, it’s clear how
              plentiful the three poisons are in there. We all might have the capacity to do
              anything, given the right circumstances. When dire circumstances in Rwanda in
              the 1990s turned neighbors and dear friends into murderous enemies and rapists,
              one expert from Human Rights Watch stated: “This behavior lies just under the
              surface of any of us.” Remember the famous Milgram experiments at Yale in the
              1960s, where subjects administered harmful electric shocks to actors posing as
              cosubjects, simply because authority</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">  </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">figures instructed them to do so? It could be us. In fact, it is us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">4.
              WE DON’T KNOW FOR SURE WHO IS RIGHT.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              is a hard one to stomach, but it’s true. How can we possibly know? We can hold
              long-cherished ideals, bur the truth is, since we are not omniscient, some of
              what we believe may be wrong. Review your own political history and ask
              yourself whether your beliefs have changed over the years. Many of my currently
              pacifist Buddhist friends were once part of militant revolutionary
              organizations using violent means for social change. According to basic
              Buddhism, one of the greatest forms of suffering is attachment to views. No
              matter what the view, if we are attached, we will suffer. The dharma invites us
              to rest in not-knowing, to tolerate the discomfort of a mind with no firm ground.
              It asks us for a more flexible mind that might be open to other views. From
              this place, can we soften our critique of the thing we hate? Sometimes when I’m
              really mad I say to myself, “Diana, maybe in some way they’reright. You just
              don’t know for sure.” And it’s true, I don’t. This does not mean I can’t
              develop discriminating wisdom that allows me to keep seeing clearly, and acting
              on my insights. I just try not to hold on to my views so tightly, especially
              the views that make me see others as enemies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">5.
              YOU CAN’T FIGHT KARMA.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhism
              teaches that acts that cause suffering to oneself or others are rooted in an
              ignorance of karma. According to teachings of karma, unwholesome actions lead
              to suffering in this life or the next. Even if you don’t believe in rebirth,
              it’s a safe bet that ignoring karmic laws will take its toll and lead to
              suffering in this life, not to mention the next. From a Buddhist perspective,
              the act of hating can only bring the hater unhappy results in the long run. So
              hating is just not a good idea, karmically speaking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Also
              remember that if your enemies are acting in unskillful ways, they will probably
              suffer quite a bit down the road. The tremendous compassion His Holiness the
              Dalai Lama feels toward the Chinese is striking. His compassion comes from
              understanding karma, knowing that the suffering the Chinese military has caused
              the Tibetan people in these fifty years of cultural genocide has already had
              and will continue to have pretty scary results for the Chinese. Rather than
              filling with rage and revenge, his heart goes out to them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">6.
              THROUGH UNDERSTANDING WILL COME COMPASSION.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One
              reason we hate is that we don’t see the full force of the other’s situation.
              When I can’t feel compassion—whether I’m fighting with my partner or listening
              to a news item on the radio—I can ask myself, “What is it I don’t understand I”
              The more thoroughly we can understand the source of pain—causing actions, the
              more we personalize the supposed evildoer rather than being caught in
              projection and assumption, which generally breed more misunderstanding and
              hatred.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              you see someone acting in a way that’s upsetting you, stop for a moment and
              imagine being that person. Imagine the streams of causes and conditions that
              led to this very moment and that particular behavior. Bring to mind the
              person’s early history and training, the levels of fear and ignorance inside
              them. Remind yourself of the structural violence under which this person grew
              up—racism, classism, unexamined privilege. Bring to mind an entire culture that
              has likely validated the action.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Start
              small—say, with your anger at a coworker—and expand the inquiry to political
              figures and ultimately social systems. Keep in mind that the point is not to
              minimize their actions nor to excuse them, bur to foster an investigation—based
              compassion that softens hatred.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">7.
              HATRED WILL NEVER CEASE WITH HATRED.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              the Buddha taught in the Dhammapada, hatred will never cease with hatred, but
              only through nonhatred will hatred cease. We will reap what we sow. The Buddha
              uncompromisingly advocated the development of skillful mind states such as
              love, compassion, and generosity as true antidotes to their unskillful
              opposites. My own experience in years of meditation has shown me that whatever
              qualities I practice, those qualities increase. If I want to be more generous,
              I need to practice generosity. If I spend a lot of time on obsessive worrying,
              more worries are sure to come. The Buddha likened this phenomenon to filling a
              bucket a few drops at a time—one day we look down and the bucket is full. What
              do we want in our bucket?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Thich
              Nhat Hanh’s term “being peace” speaks to this principle. It invites us to link
              ends and means in our activism (and in whatever we do in our lives). What would
              a protest look like that didn’t replicate the structures it was fighting
              against? A. J. Muste, the longtime radical activist, said, “There is no way to
              peace, peace is the way.” If we want to have a vision of a better world—free
              from hate, violence, and destruction—where else do we start except with
              ourselves?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sound
              daunting? Perhaps, bur take this list as a mental experiment to practice and
              reflect on. Study the results in your life and activism and you’ll see that
              these explorations won’t result in inaction. We may fear that if we’re too
              good-hearted, we will be ignored or taken advantage of, and the political
              crisis will continue unchallenged. But there is a big difference between loving
              our enemies and letting them get away with their wrongdoing. We can hold these
              principles and practices in mind and still act on behalf of justice, peace,
              equity, environmental sanity. What would the world be like if we acted from a
              place of compassion, open-heartedness, and a willingness to maybe kind of sort
              of love the enemy? It’s an amazing thought…..</span></p>
