              <p class="MsoNormal">The Vajrasattva meditation and recitation is important
              because in order to have the realizations of the path, we have to make our
              mental continuums receptive and ripe for such realizations. Manjushri advised
              Lama Tzong Khapa that in order to have proper realizations of the high path,
              three factors must be</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">complete:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">1) requesting to the Guru inseparable from the meditational
              deity,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">2) purifying negativities and accumulating positive
              potential,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">3) practicing the visualization of the sadhana, which is the
              principal cause of having realizations.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Lama Tzong Khapa did many purification practices and later
              realized the empty nature of</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">phenomena. Although in reality he is the manifestation of
              Manjushri and so had realized emptiness</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">before, Lama Tzong Khapa did purification practices to set
              an example for his followers. In that way, we will understand the importance of
              doing purification practices prior to the actual practice. One Kadampa master
              said, "Because the nature of all functional things is impermanent, if
              someone engages in the practice of purification, accumulates positive
              potential, practices visualizing the celestial mansion, and does the sadhana
              with great effort, what may now seem impossible to achieve, like high
              realizations, will come about one day."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In India
              there were many great past masters like Nagarjuna, the two jewels and the six
              ornaments. In Tibet
              there also were many highly realized beings. All of them have experienced these
              high realizations, whereas we have not. It cannot be that they are the only
              people who can have realizations and we cannot. The difference is that our
              continuum is still obscured by defilements, disturbing attitudes and karma.
              There is no difference as far as the Buddha nature is concerned. Just as these
              great beings have Buddha nature, we also have both types of Buddha nature: the
              natural Buddha nature which is the base for achieving the Dharmakaya and the
              transformational Buddha nature which is the main cause for achieving the form
              body. These are within our mindstreams. The only difference between us and the
              highly realized beings is that our mental continuums is still obscured by
              defilements.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Therefore, the practice of Vajrasattva meditation and
              recitation is very important, as it purifies these obstacles. Unless we do
              purification practices to eliminate the negativities, our present store of
              negativities will continue to increase. It is like borrowing a huge sum of
              money: the interest keeps accumulating.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Doing the Vajrasattva practice and reciting the l00 syllable
              mantra l00,000 times is said to purify the negativities if done properly, with
              all the factors complete. This has been explained in the tantra Ornament of the
              Vajra Essence. If the recitation is done without all four factors present, we
              cannot purify the negativities completely. However, if the Vajrasattva
              meditation and recitation is undertaken properly,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">with the four opponents powers, and the mantra is recited 21
              times a day, it is said to prevent the negativities from increasing. If we
              recite the mantra l00,000 times, it actually purifies the negativities.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The four opponent powers are:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">1. the power of reliance</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">2. the power of regret</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">3. the power of the antidote</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">4. the power of resolve.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">1. THE POWER OF RELIANCE</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There are two viewpoints regarding the power of reliance.
              Some lamas maintain that it refers to the object<span>  </span>be it a statue or a living person in whose
              presence we disclose our negative actions. However,according to the tradition
              of the past great masters like the late Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche, the power of
              reliance refers to taking refuge and generating the bodhicitta. The reason for
              identifying these as the power of reliance is this: when a person falls on the
              ground, he/she has to get up by depending upon that very ground. In the same
              way, when we commit negative actions, they are directed either towards the
              Buddhas and holy objects, or towards sentient beings. Therefore, purification
              of those negativities is done in reliance upon the holy objects and sentient
              beings. Refuge relates to the former and bodhicitta to the latter.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">To take refuge, visualize the objects of refuge at the level
              of your mid-brow, not too high and not too low. They are the distance of about
              an armspan from you. There, your root Guru instantly appears in the form of
              Buddha, who is surrounded by all the meditational deities, Buddhas,
              bodhisattvas and so forth. Their realizations and cessations appear in the
              aspect of scriptures beside them, with the marking cloth facing towards you.
              All of the scriptures resonate the sound of the Dharma.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Visualize yourself surrounded by all the beings of the six
              realms, either in their individual aspects or all of them in human aspect. In
              either case, they are undergoing the various sufferings of the six realms.
              Since this is a Mahayana practice of taking refuge, the three causes for
              Mahayana refuge should be complete:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">1. dread of both your own and all others' sufferings in
              samsara,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">2. strong conviction that the objects of refuge have the
              power to free you from these sufferings,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">3. strong compassion for all sentient beings, not being able
              to bear seeing them suffer.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">With these three causes for taking refuge complete in your
              mind, recite the refuge prayer in the sadhana.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The first two lines of this prayer, "At all times I
              take refuge in the Buddhas, the Dharma and the Sangha" is like a summary
              of the refuge. "Buddhas" includes all the types of Buddhas, both
              those who are enjoyment bodies and emanation bodies according to the sutrayana,
              and the meditational deities like Guhasamaja, Yamantaka, Heruka and so on that
              are explained in the tantra. Take refuge in all these Buddhas by thinking,
              "You are the masters who can really show the path correctly, without any
              mistakes."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"Dharma" refers to the verbal doctrine and to the
              actual Dharma which is the realizations and cessations in the mindstreams of
              the Arya beings. The Dharma refuge appears in the form of scriptures.
              "Sangha" refers to all of the Sangha mentioned in the sutrayana - the
              Arya beings and Arhats - and to all of the Sangha mentioned in the tantra, like
              the dakas, dakinis, heroes, heroines and so forth. They assist you by
              overcoming obstacles on your path and gathering the necessary conditions for
              your practice of the path.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"...in all of the Three Vehicles, in the dakinis of
              secret mantra yoga," shows taking refuge in the Dharma. It refers to the
              three vehicles as explained in the sutrayana - the vehicles of the hearers,
              solitary realizers and bodhisattvas. "Secret mantra yoga" refers to
              all four classes of tantra. Here, "dakinis" refer not to the
              goddesses but to the tantras of the dakinis, that is, the mother tantras, of
              which Heruka is the chief one.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"...in the heroes, heroines and powerful goddesses, in
              the great beings, the bodhisattvas," is taking refuge in the Sangha.
              Heroes are those such as Khandakapala. Heroines include Pracandi and others.
              Empowering goddesses are the partners of the four Dhyani Buddhas and Vajra
              Varahi. These are the Sangha according to the tantra. Sangha as mentioned in
              the sutrayana are the bodhisattvas who have attained the irreversible path.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"And above all, at all times I take refuge in my
              spiritual master," refers to your own root Guru who is inseparable from
              the principal deity of the celestial mansion. Understanding the different ways
              of relating to the Three Jewels, take refuge in them from the depth</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">of your heart. Go for refuge in these noble objects while
              simultaneously encompassing all sentient beings in the field of your
              compassion. When you recite the refuge formula "I go for refuge to the
              Buddhas...." imagine that you are leading the chanting and that all
              sentient beings are going for refuge in the Three Jewels with you. This is the
              way of going for refuge in the causal objects of refuge. The second type of
              taking refuge is to take refuge in the resultant refuge objects. This refers to
              the resultant state of Vajra Dhara that you are aspiring to achieve. Develop
              the strong aspiration to actualize this state. Think, "I shall achieve the
              state of Vajra Dhara." Focusing upon your resultant state of</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Buddhahood, the purified aspect of your own mind, take
              refuge in that. Then generate the altruistic attitude, the mind of
              enlightenment. To do this, focus upon the suffering</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">of all the sentient beings around you. Think, "Whether
              or not I remember it, all these beings have been my mothers in my beginningless
              rebirths. Their kindness to me is boundless both when they were my mother and
              when they were not. If I think of myself alone and am unconcerned with the
              welfare of others, the Buddhas and bodhisattvas would be offended. The welfare
              of the sentient beings is the only thought</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">the Buddhas and bodhisattvas have in their minds. So if I
              neglected sentient beings, it would not please the holy beings. From my own
              part, it would not be fair either. Since I have enjoyed the boundless kindness
              sentient beings have extended to me, it is my responsibility to repay this
              kindness. Therefore, the responsibility to free sentient beings from their
              sufferings actually falls upon me."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Think that the majority of sentient beings do not meet the
              proper spiritual path and thus lack the right outlook in their actions. Not
              understanding what is to be avoided and what is to be adopted, they suffer in
              this cycle of existence without end. Some sentient beings are fortunate enough
              to meet the Dharma and some are even more fortunate to enter into the mandala,
              receive empowerments and so forth. But some of them are not fortunate enough to
              observe the vows and commitments, and then take rebirth in the vajra</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">hell. Thinking in such a way, develop very strong compassion
              for each and every sentient being. Generate loving kindness, the wish to place
              all sentient beings on the path leading toward nonabiding nirvana, the final
              state of enlightenment. Develop the special attitude, the determination "I
              shall bring about the great welfare of the sentient beings."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Then cultivate the bodhicitta, thinking, "At present, I
              do not have the ability to act for the benefit of sentient beings as I wish to.
              Therefore, I shall attain enlightenment to be able to lead all sentient beings
              to the state of Heruka. To do this, I must practice all six perfections
              according to the sutrayana, and I must also observe the vows and commitments
              and practice the two stages of the tantrayana." With such</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">virtuous thoughts and mental preparation, recite the passage
              for taking refuge and generating bodhicitta. To visualize Vajrasattva on your
              crown, first visualize just above your crown, but not touching it, a white PAM
              which is the nature of the wisdom of bliss and emptiness, the mind of your root
              Guru, Vajra Dhara. This PAM transforms into a white lotus, with 1,000 or
              100,000 petals. Between the top of your head and the lotus, there is an
              intervening space of about a handspan.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">At the center of the lotus, from a white AH which is the
              nature of the wisdom of bliss and emptiness comes a moon seat, like a crystal
              mandala base. Do not think the moon which is in the sky is on your head. It is
              a moon seat. On it is a HUM which is also the nature of the wisdom of bliss and
              emptiness. It transforms into a five-spoked white vajra, marked with a HUM at
              its hub. The vajra is one cubit high. From the HUM at the hub of the vajra,
              light rays radiate in all directions, touch all the sentient beings, purify
              their negativities and place them in the state of Vajrasattva. Again, light
              rays radiate,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">making offerings to all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. The
              rays draw forth their blessings and they absorb into the HUM.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">By the force of absorbing rays and blessings, the white
              five-spoked vajra and the HUM at its hub transform into white Vajrasattva. He
              sits in the vajra posture and faces the same way as you. He is adorned with
              celestial garments and ornaments.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Although it is not explicitly stated in the sadhana,
              Vajrasattva is adorned with six mudras: the crown ornament which has a jewel,
              bangles, necklace, the elaborate Brahma thread, human ashes and earrings. This
              is the visualization of the commitment being.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Light rays now radiate from Vajrasattva's heart and invite
              the wisdom beings which are identical to the deities you have visualized. Many
              of them are invited, and before they dissolve into the commitment beings, they
              merge into one. This one then dissolves through Vajrasattva's crown and becomes
              non-dual with the commitment beings.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When the wisdom beings dissolve into the commitment beings,
              it is helpful if the field of positive potential (the objects of refuge)
              dissolve with them, through the crowns of the commitment beings. If not, you
              can do the dissolution of the field of positive potential earlier. When
              dissolving the field of positive potential along with the wisdom beings into
              the commitment beings, first dissolve the field of positive potential into the
              wisdom beings, and then the wisdom beings into the commitment beings. As the
              wisdom beings dissolve into the commitment beings, say DZA HUM BAM HO. When you</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">say DZA, the wisdom beings come above the crown of the
              commitment beings and face the same way as the commitment beings. With HUM,
              they enter into the commitment beings. With BAM, they merge, and with HO the
              merging is stabilized.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Again light rays emanate from Vajrasattva, inviting the
              empowering deities: the five Dhyani Buddhas, their partners and so forth.
              Request them to bestow the empowerment. They consent, giving the empowerment to
              Vajrasattva by pouring nectar down through his crown. This fills his body and
              the excess which spills out of his crown becomes the ornament of Akshobya.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">At the heart of Guru Vajrasattva is a HUM on a moon seat. It
              is surrounded by the l00 syllable Heruka Vajrasattva mantra. Since Vajrasattva,
              the moon seat and the mantra syllables are all white in color, it may be
              difficult to visualize them clearly. Therefore, according to the tradition of
              the masters, to visualize them distinctly, you can visualize Vajrasattva white
              like a conch, the moon seat white like a crystal, and the mantra syllables
              white like silver.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Then request Guru Vajrasattva to purify the negative karma
              and obscurations of all sentient beings and purify all degenerated and broken
              commitments. Light rays radiate from his heart, touch you and the sentient
              beings and purify the negativities. These light rays re-absorb. Again light
              rays emanate, at the tips of which are offering goddesses who make offerings to
              all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions. If you have time, also
              perform the seven limb practice at this point. The Buddhas and bodhisattvas are
              pleased, and light rays from Vajrasattva's heart draw forth their inspirations,
              blessings and excellent qualities in the form of light rays. The light rays and
              blessings absorb</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">into the HUM at Guru Vajrasattva's heart. This causes nectar
              to flow from the mantra letters down through Vajrasattva’s body into you. These
              nectars flow through your crown, fill your entire body and purify the
              negativities.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">2. THE POWER OF REGRET</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The first of the four opponent powers, the power of
              reliance, is completed by taking refuge and generating the enlightened
              attitude. This was done before visualizing Vajrasattva. The second power is
              regret. This is developing strong regret for all the non-virtuous actions you
              have committed. Reflect upon all the negative actions of body, speech and mind
              you have done since beginningless time.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Although you may think, "I have not really committed
              such grave non-virtuous actions," remember that you have taken rebirth in
              cyclic existence since beginningless time, sometimes as a being in the lower
              realms. You have not always taken a human form with all the necessary conditions
              for Dharma practice. In all these rebirths in the lower realms, you have had
              many opportunities to indulge in negative actions, and there was hardly any
              opportunity to engage in virtue. For example, look at the way animals lead
              their</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">life, the way they indulge in negative actions with such
              great readiness. By looking at animals' behavior, you can infer you have
              committed many negative actions in the past when you were born as an animal.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">But even when you took rebirth as a human being, if that
              rebirth was in a place where Dharma was not prevalent, then how easily and
              readily you could have engaged in non-virtuous actions without any moral
              restraint! You may have taken human rebirth many times in situations where you
              had no idea how to follow the law of cause and effect, how to restrain yourself
              from negative actions, how to accumulate favorable conditions for Dharma
              practice or how to accumulate virtuous actions.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Even if you ignore past lives and talk only about this
              present life, although you may outwardly think that you have not engaged in any
              grave negative actions, upon probing deeper, you will find that under the
              influence of emotional afflictions like hatred, attachment, close-mindedness
              and so forth, you have actually indulged in many negative actions. If these
              negative actions were to have form, the three realms would be too small to
              contain them.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">No matter how small a negative action may be, if it is not
              neutralized by the force of purification, it can produce rebirth in the lower
              realms. Shantideva said, "If one has to take rebirth in a lower realm as a
              result of doing small negative actions, by the force of all the negative
              actions you have done in previous lives, there is hardly any chance for you to
              take rebirth in an upper rebirth, like that of a human being."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If you probe deeper into your own accumulation of negative
              actions within this lifetime, you will surprise yourself and wonder, "How
              could I ever have done these negative actions? Was I crazy at that time?"
              You will be amazed at the quantity of negative actions you have done. You will
              discover that emotional afflictions like hatred, closed-mindedness, desire and
              others are generated in your mind so naturally, so spontaneously, hardly
              depending on any external circumstances. Under their influence, you do many
              negative actions. If you consider the non-virtuous actions accumulated so far,
              you will find there is no choice but to take rebirth in the lower realms.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If a practitioner with monastic vows transgresses the
              secondary vows, he/she takes rebirth in the reviving hell. If one transgresses
              a vow from the category of "individual confession," one is reborn in
              other hells. If one commits one of the four defeats, one takes rebirth in the
              lowest hell realm. Recollect all the negative actions you could have done
              during this lifetime. Though you may not be able to remember the negativities
              created in past lives, you can reflect upon them through reasoning and
              inference, thinking, "I must have done all these negative actions at some
              time when I was born in all the</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">various realms of samsara." By recollecting all these
              negative actions, cultivate a very strong sense of regret, just as someone who
              finds out he/she accidentally swallowed poison regrets it immediately.
              Cultivation of a strong sense of regret can be induced by reflecting upon the
              consequences of these negative actions: the maturation result of rebirth in the
              lower realms, the result concordant with the causes, the habitual result, the
              environmental result. If you reflect upon these different effects that
              nonvirtuous</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">actions produce, then you will be able to develop strong
              fear of getting trapped in a lower rebirth, and you will be able to generate
              strong regret for having committed these negative actions. If a person has
              accidently taken poison and then learns of its effects - that he/she could die
              - then he/she will develop strong fear and regret for having taken the poison.
              But if a person takes poison without knowing its effects, he/she would not
              regret it at all.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">All of you here have taken certain vows - vows of individual
              liberation, bodhisattva vows, tantric vows - so you could have accumulated
              negativities by transgressing these vows and commitments. Also, recollect the
              ten non-virtuous actions of body, speech and mind you have done, and reflect
              that they bring rebirth in the lower realms. Reflecting upon all these negative
              actions, one Kadampa master said, "If we look deeper, we will find that
              the negative actions we have committed even when joking are strong</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">enough to throw us into the lower realms. If that is so, we
              must have negative actions powerful enough to throw us into the lower realms
              for a long time."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Recollect all these negative actions and develop strong
              regret. Having sincere regret is the second opponent power, the power of regret.
              If you have strong regret your purification will be more powerful. If you lacks
              this essential factor of regret, it is difficult to purify the negativities.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">3. THE POWER OF THE ANTIDOTE</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The Lam Rim quotes The Compendium of Trainings, listing six
              principal antidotes to negative actions: recitation of mantra, meditation on
              emptiness, prostration, making images of the Buddha, reciting Dharma texts and
              offering. Among these, the one employed in this purification practice is the
              recitation of the l00 syllable mantra of Heruka Vajrasattva and meditation on
              the deity.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The fourth power, that of resolving not to do these
              non-virtuous actions again in the future, will come after the recitation of the
              mantra.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">To complete the power of the antidote, recite the mantra 21
              times or more. The recitation is done in the form of making a request to
              Vajrasattva. If you cultivated strong divine identity at the beginning of the
              sadhana, at this point loosen or relax it a little bit. Retain the clarity of
              the appearance of the deity, but slightly relax the force of your divine
              identity.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The meaning of the mantra is:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">OM</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">syllable of the vajra body (It is spelled A-U-M, which

              <p class="MsoNormal">destroy all the delusions and sufferings.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When the meaning of these individual phrases are put
              together, they mean "O Vajrasattva, you have generated the mind to help
              all sentient beings and you engage in the activities for their welfare. In
              accordance with the pledge you have taken, when I do good actions always be
              pleased with me and regard me favorably. Should I uncontrollably do negative
              actions, please kindly understand and be patient with</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">me." Sometimes you do negative actions out of
              ignorance. By requesting Vajrasattva to be patient with you even in those
              circumstances, you become aware of the extreme compassion of the deity. The
              request continues, "May I have firm realizations of the grounds and paths
              and all perfections of rebirth in the higher status. May I achieve all
              activities and powerful attainments in my mind, ultimately leading to the
              achievement of the glory of supreme enlightenment." Reflecting upon the
              meaning of this</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">mantra, recite it in the form of a request. The recitation
              of the l00 syllable mantra done with the appropriate visualization is the
              actual power of the antidote.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If you have close friends or relatives or people that you
              have to take care of, you can visualize them around the HUM at your heart. When
              purifying your negativities, visualize their negativities being purified at the
              same time. If you can manage, it is also good to visualize all sentient beings
              around the HUM at your heart and do the purification. If not, visualize them
              seated around you. I have seen a text</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">which explains to visualize the sentient beings around you
              when purifying, but I have not seen a text saying that you can visualize them
              around the HUM. But the past masters have given this oral instruction.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">While reciting the l00 syllable mantra, visualize nectars
              flowing from the mantra syllables at Vajrasattva's heart, down through his
              body, through the moon seat and lotus, and down through your crown into you.
              When doing the purification of negativities by the nectars descending and flowing
              through your body, there are three types of visualizations that can be done:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">1. expelling downward</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">2. expelling upward</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">3. expelling spontaneously.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">1. expelling downward</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Imagine the nectars and light rays descend from above
              through your body. They flow down and wash away all the negativities of your
              body and obscurations in the form of black, ink-like liquids that come out of
              the anus, the secret organ, and from the pores of your body. Illness in the
              form of blood, phlegm and pus and harmful spirits, and interfering forces in
              the form of frightening animals like scorpions and snakes come out from the
              orifices of the lower part of your body. When a volcano erupts,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">the lava washes away all the trees and things in that place.
              Likewise, the nectar forcefully washes away all negativities.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Visualize that the negativities, illnesses and spirit harms
              in these different aspects go under the earth. If you are doing this
              purification practice together with the practice of longevity, then visualize a
              yama under the ground, with his mouth gaping and wide open. All the
              negativities, illnesses and spirit offenses go into his mouth. He is very
              pleased and satiated. At the end, his mouth closes and is blocked by either a
              crossed vajra or a thousand-spoked wheel. Although all the negativities are
              purified during the</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">visualization of expelling downward, think that chiefly the
              negativities of the body are being purged and washed away.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">2. expelling upward</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Imagine the nectars and light rays descend from Vajrasattva
              into your body and fill you from the soles of your feet up. The nectars fill
              your entire body and all the negativities, diseases and spirit offenses come
              out of your sense faculties - your mouth, eyes, ears, nose etc. It is like
              pouring water into an empty bottle: any dirt on the bottom is carried upward
              and spills out the top. During the meditation of expelling</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">upward, all the negativities, and chiefly those of speech
              are purified.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">3. expelling spontaneously</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Visualize all the negativities, illnesses and spirit harms
              gather at your heart in the form of a black heap. When the nectars and light
              rays descend through your crown and strike that heap, it is like turning on a
              light in a dark room. Just as darkness is dispelled instantly when a light is
              turned on, the heap of negativities, illnesses and spirit harms instantly
              disappears when the nectar and light rays touch them. In this visualization,
              all negativities are purified, with special emphasis placed on the negativities
              of the mind.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Having done these three visualizations individually, at the
              end do them simultaneously. The negativities and so forth emerge from your
              anus, secret organ and come out of the entrances to the sense faculties at the
              same time as the heap of negativities at your heart is instantly dispelled. In
              this way, the three visualizations are performed together at the end and all
              the negativities of body, speech and mind, together with their imprints are
              purified.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If you do these three visualizations thinking that the first
              is for purifying negativities, illnesses and spirit harms of the body, the
              second those of the speech and the third those of the mind, then do all three visualizations.
              However, during one visualization, like that of expelling downward, if you
              imagine all your negativities of body, speech and mind are purified, then it is
              not necessary to perform all three visualizations during one session. It
              depends on how you meditate.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">According to oral instructions, visualize the bodily
              negativities are purged during the visualization expelling downwards, the
              negativities of the speech while expelling upwards, the negativities of mind while
              expelling spontaneously. The negativities of body, speech and mind and their
              imprints are expelled by doing all three of the above visualization simultaneously.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If you meditate like this, then divide the 21 recitations of
              the mantra into groups of five each: five repetitions for expelling downward,
              five for expelling upward, five for expelling spontaneously and five for all
              three simultaneously. Recite the mantra once more to make 21. Another way is to
              count seven each for the first three visualizations to make 21, without doing
              the three visualizations simultaneously. There are different ways to do it. You
              can choose.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There are many visualizations that can be done during the
              Vajrasattva meditation and recitation. At the end of however many mantras you
              recite, develop the strong conviction, "I have actually purified all negativities."
              It's important to generate this conviction because having lingering doubts
              about whether the negativities have actually been purified is harmful.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If this purification practice is undertaken properly, with
              all the four opponents powers complete, then there is no reason why you should
              not be able to purify the negativities. The Buddha himself said that certain
              types of actions are negative and doing them is creating negative karma. The
              Buddha also said that negative actions can be purified by certain techniques.
              So if it is true <span> </span>that committing certain
              actions accumulates non-virtue, then it also should be true that these
              non-virtues can be purified by specific techniques and methods that have been prescribed. There is no reason
              for the Buddha to lie. No matter how strong and forceful the negative actions
              may appear, they have the nature of being able to be purified by doing the
              proper practices.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Past accounts prove that negativities can be purified by
              doing a practice complete with the four opponent powers. For example, King
              Ajatasattu committed a grave negative action by killing his own father. By the
              force of having great regret and doing the appropriate purification practices,
              he was able to achieve realizations within his lifetime.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Angulimalla killed 999 people. He later strongly regretted
              his actions and engaged in correct methods to purify them. Thus he also
              achieved high realizations in his lifetime.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is effective to seal this purification practice by
              reflecting upon the emptiness of inherent existence of the circle of three -
              the purifier, the purification practice and the object to be purified.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">4. THE POWER OF RESOLVE</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Then recite the prayer in which you take refuge in
              Vajrasattva and develop firm resolve not to do these negative actions again.
              "Through ignorance and delusions..." This means that you did not
              foresee the unwanted consequences of these negative actions. "I have
              broken and degenerated my commitments." This is explicitly the power of
              regret. Implicit in this is the power or resolve never to do those actions again.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Say to Guru Vajrasattva, "I take refuge in you alone,
              you who are the embodiment of all Three Jewels. By the force of your
              compassion, please protect me and other sentient beings from doing these</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">negative actions again in the future. With your compassion,
              protect us and lead us to the final goal,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">enlightenment."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Vajrasattva says to you. "O child of a good family,
              your negative karma, obscurations and all degenerated</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">and broken commitments are now cleansed and purified."
              When he calls out to you using this term of</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">endearment and of intimacy, "O child of a good
              family," try to experience great bliss. If not, imagine</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">experiencing great delight and rejoice at having purified
              your negativities. With great affection for you and being very pleased with
              you, Vajrasattva now dissolves into you through your crown. He enters your central channel and
              becomes inseparable with your very subtle body, speech and mind. Concentrate on your body, speech and mind
              being inseparable from those of</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Vajrasattva, your root Guru.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">To summarize, do the Vajrasattva meditation and recitation
              with all four powers complete. Taking refuge in the Three Jewels and generating
              bodhicitta is the power of reliance. Recollecting all the negative actions and
              developing a strong sense of regret or repentance is the power of regret.
              Actually doing the meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva with strong and
              stable visualization is the power of the antidote.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Developing a strong resolve never to indulge in such actions
              in the future is the power of resolve, also called the power of turning away
              from the negative actions. Several visualizations can be done while reciting
              the mantra: expelling downward, expelling upward, expelling spontaneously. Or
              you can imagine receiving the four empowerments in the form of blessing.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">By practicing all four opponent powers properly, you can
              actually purify negativities committed over a long period of time. This is the
              power of the Dharma, and it is the kindness of the Dharma. Although you may not
              be able to recall the past lives during which these negative actions have been
              done, still by the force of strong practice, you can purify all these
              negativities in a short time. With this, the explanation of the Vajrasattva
              meditation and recitation is complete.</p>
