              <p>Hi Positron,</p>
              <p>1.  First must understand what taking refuge is.  It is not like a membership form that one can fill in superficially.  It should be from the heart.  If you seek refuge from Triple Gems means you rely on them ultimately to gain liberation.  If i can find any article, i'd post it.</p>
              <p>2.  Your friend chant Namo Amituofo,in the heart, it is already taking refuge in Amitabha, asking Amitabha to bring him/her to pureland/liberation.  It is already relying completely on Amitabha.  But it'd be good to take official refuge through a ceremony because one can then receive the lineage.</p>
              <p>Whether can go to pureland or not, depends on how serious.  Everyone view "serious" differently. But want to go pureland must be very strong in aspiration. </p>
              <p>Sometimes when i chant, i ask myself if Amitabha come right now, can i drop everything straight away and go (ie. die and go pureland) ?  Do i have that kind of renunciation of samsara?  Or do i have many excuses to do this first, or that first, worry about this person first, or that person etc before i can go... this is a very strong difference between serious and not-serious. </p>
              <p>In theory, you ask yourself, you think you will say yes. But if you really go very deeply and ask yourself. Many people still can't let go.  It is a very tough question actually.</p>

              <p>If he believe in the Buddha and Buddha's teaching, and want to achieve Nirvana, why not take refuge? Taking refuge is the triple gems is basically taking refuge in what is proper and not taking refuge in what is improper. <br><br>Whether your friend can go to the Pureland or not depends on his faith and vows. If someone chant the Buddha's name to lets say to recover from a sickness or have a good life and did not have faith or make a vow to be born in the Pureland, he won't go to Pureland.</p>
              <p>Pre-requisites of PL birth is faith, vows, and practice.<br>(Below is an explanation of what is faith, vows and practice)<br><br><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: black;">One with Proper Faith, Proper Vows, and Proper Practice</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Faith, vows, and practice are the three prerequisites of the</span> <span style="color: black;">Pure</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">Dharma-door. One who goes on a journey takes along some food and a little money. One who wishes to go to the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span> <span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span> <span style="color: black;">needs faith, vows, and the practice of holding the Buddha's name.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Faith is the first prerequisite, for without it one will not have an affinity with Amitabha Buddha in the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span> <span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. You must have faith in yourself, faith in the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">, as well as in cause and effect, noumenon and phenomenon.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">What does it mean to believe in oneself? It is to believe that you certainly have the qualifications necessary to be born in the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span> <span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. You should not take yourself lightly and say, "I have committed so many offenses, I can't be born there." Suppose you have created karma involving heavy offenses, well, now you have a good opportunity: you can "take your karma with you into rebirth." That means that regardless of the offenses you have committed in the past, you can still be reborn in the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">, and that karma goes along with you. However, you need to know that the karma you can take is karma you have already created, not karma that you continue to create. Karma you have already created is the karma from previous lives. Karma you continue to create will ripen in the future. What you can carry is offenses that come from karma created in the past; what you cannot carry is offenses from karma you create now that will ripen in the future. No matter what you have ever done, not withstanding any kind of offenses, you can now change your faults and reform your conduct, stopping evil and becoming wholesome. Then you can take those previously-created offenses with you to the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span> <span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. But continuing to create karma will keep you from being able to go.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Secondly, you must have faith in the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss which is hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands from here. Before he realized Buddhahood, Amitabha Buddha, as the Bhikshu Dharma Treasury, vowed to create the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span> <span style="color: black;">where living beings of the ten directions who vowed to be born there could gain rebirth by reciting his name. There is no need to do anything else; it is easy, simple, convenient, and interpenetrating--yet it doesn't cost a thing and doesn't waste energy. This Dharma-door can be considered the highest and most supreme, for if you just recite, "Namo Amitabha Buddha," you will be born in the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span> <span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">It is also necessary to believe in cause and effect. Believing in cause is to believe that in the past you have planted good roots that now enable you to believe in this Dharma-door. Without good roots, no one can encounter this Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha's name, or any other Dharma-door, for that matter. Because of the good roots you planted in the past, you can now encounter the</span> <span style="color: black;">Pure</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">Dharma-door of faith, vows, and holding the name. But if you don't continue to nourish the good roots you planted, then you won't be able to reap the fruition of Bodhi in the future. That is why you must believe in cause and effect; believe that in the past you already planted causes for Bodhi and so in the future you will certainly reap the fruition of Bodhi. The principle is the same as planting a field: the seeds must be watered and nourished before they can grow.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Finally, one must have faith in phenomenon and noumenon. The specific phenomenon is this: Amitabha Buddha has a great affinity with us and will certainly guide us to Buddhahood. The noumenal principle is this: We know the great affinity exists because without it we would not have met the</span> <span style="color: black;">Pure</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">Dharma-door. Amitabha Buddha is all living beings and all living beings are Amitabha Buddha. Amitabha Buddha became Amitabha Buddha by reciting the Buddha's name, and if we recite the Buddha's name, we, too, can become Amitabha Buddha.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">We should cultivate according to the phenomena and the noumenal principle. The<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">Avatamsaka Sutra</em><span> </span>speaks of four Dharma Realms:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">1. The Dharma Realm of Unobstructed Phenomena<br>2. The Dharma Realm of Unobstructed Noumena<br>3. The Dharma Realm of Noumena and Phenomena Unobstructed<span> </span><br>4. The Dharma Realm of All Phenomena Unobstructed</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Considering the four Dharma Realms, and speaking from the standpoint of our self-nature, we and Amitabha Buddha are united in one, and therefore we have the qualifications to realize Buddhahood.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">&lt; Amitabha Buddha is the Amitabha Buddha within the minds of all living beings, and living beings are the living beings within the mind of Amitabha Buddha. Due to this interconnection, there are phenomena and the noumenon. However, you must believe in this principle and energetically practice it by reciting the Buddha's name; you cannot get lazy. Your recitation of the Buddha's name should increase day by day, not decrease.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Having discussed faith, we will now discuss vows. What is a vow? When you want something, when your thoughts tend toward a certain thing, your mind has a wish, then you make a vow. In Buddhism there are four vast vows:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: center; padding: 0px;"><em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: black;">I vow to save the limitless living beings.<br>I vow to cut off the inexhaustible afflictions.<br>I vow to study the immeasurable Dharma-doors.<br>I vow to realize the supreme</span></em> <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: black;">Buddha Way</span></em><em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: black;">.</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">All Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the past, present, and future practiced the Bodhisattva conduct and attained Buddhahood by relying on these four great vows.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">But in order to make vows you must have faith. First, believe there is a</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span> <span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">; secondly, have faith in Amitabha Buddha; thirdly, believe that you and Amitabha Buddha have a great affinity, and that you can certainly be born in the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span> <span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. With faith in these three things, you may then make the vow, "I desire to be born in Amitabha's country." There is a saying,</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: center; padding: 0px;"><em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: black;">"I want to be born in the</span></em> <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: black;">Western</span></em> <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: black;">Pure</span></em> <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: black;">Land</span></em><em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: black;">."</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">I want to be born there. Nobody's forcing me to go; nobody's dragging me there. Although Amitabha Buddha has come to guide me, I'm going as a volunteer because I want to be close to him. I want to be born in the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span> <span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span> <span style="color: black;">and to see Amitabha Buddha when my lotus flower opens. I want to meet the Buddha and hear the Dharma." These are the vows you need.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Then you must practice. How? Recite the Buddha's name, saying "Namo Amitabha Buddha, Namo Amitabha Buddha..." as if you were trying to save your head from the executioner, running ahead to keep your head.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Faith, vows, and practice are the travel expenses for rebirth in the</span> <span style="color: black;">Land</span> <span style="color: black;">of</span> <span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. They are your ticket.</span></p>

              <p>Second question is self explanatory. Many fine example of oldies in the past did not even take refuge and just chanting NMAMTF to attain rebirth in Pureland. NMAMTF in itself is triple jewels and is proper faith, vow and practice. However, it is also good to take refuge in triple jewels in mass ceremonial observation as all kindness and bliss is brought together for the benefit of nation and world bliss.</p>

              <p>In theory, you ask yourself, you think you will say yes. But if you really go very deeply and ask yourself. Many people still can't let go.  It is a very tough question actually.</p>

              <p>Hi WisdomEye,</p>
              <p>I just felt that since we are here now, we got to perform our duties... such as taking care of parents, doing housework, working, etc etc</p>
              <p>In meantime, we can learn Buddhism and gain knowledge.</p>
