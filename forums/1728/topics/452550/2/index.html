              <p>Oh, so you want to allow gays their rights but give their right a different name.</p>
              <p>But back when the issue was inter-racial couples and polygamous marraige, was a new name coined? Would it deny their rights if we coined a new name for them now?</p>

              <p>In some countries, civil unions and marriage exist side by side. A heterosexual couple can opt to solemnize their marriage in court and have a civil union. Or they can do it in church. They have equal rights in the eyes of the law.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, all marriages are civil unions. They are synonymous. That's why it is a criminal offence to hold a traditional ceremony without first registering your marriage officially. You are free to hold a church or customary ceremony after or not hold one at all. But to hold a ceremony without registering it and then go round saying you are married will be punished with jail time.</p>

              Setting aside any other ideology, there is no right or wrong of having a same sex marriage.  If two people, regardless of their sexuality preferances want to lead their life under protective consitution... why not? We should give their blessing as long as they are happy in a relationships and feel better with someone they love.
                          
              What worse is being bigotry, a less compassionate idea or action. Discriminating and imposing our own ideas onto others. Regardless of what people are, as long as they did no harm, we should accept and love people as who they are.

              <p>Of course you are against the idea of gays using the term "marriage", you think it is exclusive to you.</p>
              <p>I would encourage gays to get married (such as in a foreign jurisdiction, we have many gay expat couples here, and some local ones) and to use the term. The lawful bonds of marriage will apply to you, just that ROM will not register you, so go overseas. No one can stop you. And like I said above, in Singapore, a registered civil union is a marriage.</p>
              <p>If people like this say the word is not for you, pay them no heed and carry on.</p>

Marriage in civilised society is either sanctioned by state and religon or customary rites. For example, in Singapore, it is not uncommon for Christian couples to go through all three ceremonies, ROM, church wedding, tea ceremony. Also, wedding vows must have witnesses to make complete the vows and not forgetting the wedding banquet! Obviously, a wedding must be recognised by it's society before it(state or community) will accrue the union it's right to protection. For couple who cohabited without state sanctioning have common law wife/ husband status. Recognition by society is important.</span></span></em></p>

To deprive individuals from such civil right is oppressive, <span>discriminatory, and infringes on the very rights of individuals to decide on their own destiny.

I have never used the word natural and or intended to use it in such context! Please don't put words in my writing! All occurrances is phenomena!

              Ail TC, thank you for channelling this thread to a constructive one! 
                  I do not have strong views as in being very emotionally attached to the outcome! 
                  I contemplated when I've realised that even people I've considered kind hearted felt repulsive and violated when related to such an issue. It did'nt sit right with me!

                  <p><span>It is good to hear the views and reasons from
                  someone who is strongly against same sex marriage. About your views
                  and reasons:</span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span><span style="color: #000080;">I beg to differ in this instance,
                  marriage as an institution is to be recognised by society at large.
                  Marriage in civilised society is either sanctioned by state and
                  religon or customary rites. For example, in Singapore, it is not
                  uncommon for Christian couples to go through all three ceremonies,
                  ROM, church wedding, tea ceremony. Also, wedding vows must have
                  witnesses to make complete the vows and not forgetting the wedding
                  banquet! Obviously, a wedding must be recognised by it's society
                  before it(state or community) will accrue the union it's right to
                  protection. For couple who cohabited without state sanctioning have
                  common law wife/ husband status. Recognition by society is
                  important.</span></span></em></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Other than the civil
                  registration at the ROM, all others reasons that you have stated
                  above such as religious and customary rites including the tea
                  ceremony are just 'optional' for many nowadays. Without these
                  practices and formalities, a marriage is still considered valid and
                  recognized once registered with the ROM. That is the main
                  recognition by society itself. To deprive individuals from such
                  civil right is oppressive, <span>discriminatory, and infringes on
                  the very rights of individuals to decide on their own destiny. Laws
                  that presently criminalize gaysâ€™ practices are also
                  unacceptable.</span></span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Why should society
                  expect individual to sacrifice their rights and freedom for the
                  collective wishes of the majority of society just because same sex
                  marriage is not the social norms, behavior, traditions and normal
                  practice of society? Isnâ€™t it a rather selfish act to expect this
                  kind of â€˜givingâ€™ from individuals just because they are different
                  from the majority?</span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span><span style="color: #000080;">I still refer to birthright of the
                  future offspring, the need to protect the vulnerable, the baby and
                  the long period he/she needs to become a fully fledged human being.
                  As the same sex couple is unable to bear offspring, why should it
                  demand and deprive couples with offsprings of social care intended
                  to perpetuate the community and species. Please understand the same
                  sex and man/ women sexual do not have the same end game! Adoption
                  must compatible with contemporary social mores! Also gender roles
                  for species propogation must be considered, the expectation of
                  oneâ€™s social role when one becomes anotherâ€™s parent. Currently, the
                  more common family unit is a patriachal one!</span></span></em></p>
                  <p class="" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">
                  <span>I still cannot see what <span style="font-family: Calibri;">protection you are referring to that is
                  needed for â€˜the vulnerable, the baby and the long period he/she
                  needs to become a fully fledged human being.â€™ And how since same
                  sex couples are unable to bear offspring, it would deprive couples
                  with offsprings of social care intended to perpetuate the community
                  and species?</span></span></p>

                  difference between gay union and gay marriage, also gay marriage vs
                  hereotosexual marriage. Both are unions but only one is
                  procreational!</span></span></span></em></p>

                  <span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">By the way, If marriage is all about having
                  kids, wouldnâ€™t letting a man or woman who is known to be sterile
                  married defeats the whole purpose of the institution of marriage?
                  If you look at the declining population in Singapore, having kids
                  is certainly not a top priority for a great numbers of <span>hereotosexual marriages here.</span></span></span></p>

                  creatures will always be political creatures! They exploit whatever
                  is to their political advantage! If you push an agenda too hard
                  against current social mores be carefup of a social backlash! One
                  must cultivate positive image and
                  goodwill.</span></span></span></em></p>

                  <p class="" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">
                  <span>I do not think that putting in place laws that recognized
                  same sex marriage is going to cause any negative political backlash
                  against the present government. If it so, allowing the
                  establishment of the two casinos here would have incurred even
                  worst social furore. It may have cause unhappiness in some quarters
                  but it certainly did not cause any major social
                  backlash.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Marriage an institution is practised by more evolved societies, mainly patriarchal, as I am awoare some matrilineal societies, eg. Mosu, do not have a more ritualised form of marriage! Memory is sketchy here, so I stand to be corrected!  Civil rights, in the way you put it, is about rights two individual forming  an union, not a family unit! Why the extra expense to go through the optional ceremonies, if a simple ROM would suffice! The simple reason is to cover all base! A country may fail, a community may also fail! Which is more important, the needs of two individual or the future of the community/ state. Back to the Mosu, when a lady is of age, she will wear attire showing she  is available and join the social dances. If there's one she fancies, she"ll pass a secret signal, that her paramour will visit her conjugal room later that night! The couples don't even live together! Why does such arrangement exist in the absence of your civil rights!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The state may or may not want to allocate resources two individual, but the states would definite want allocate to their future. Raising a child is hard, that's why extra resources are given to the family! In Singapore and in many first world countries, making babies and grooming them to  successful adult is harder as compared to poorer society. The difference is apiration for the children!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When one civil group pushes too hard or too in your face when pursuing agenda, it usually forms a backlash. This is what I was referring to, thanks for the chance for clarification. As for building casinos, as long as most people benefit in some way, status quo will remain. But social decay sets in at the middle class, the clamour for change will get louder and more pugnacious!</div>
