            <div class='col-md body'>Is not recognising a same sex marriage the same as not recognising a same sex union?Are we going to lump the two issues together?!! People are going have relationship and sexual union, eg. fucking with one another, whether out of wedlock or not, or same sex or not!  Marriage as an institution to safeguard progenies arising out of such an union. There is a difference between a sexual union and pro creation. Should we afford bestowing such a recognition for an evolutionary dead end sexual union?!! Since time immemorial, children born out of wedlock, eg.  bastards, is discriminated upon as compared to those born in wedlock! There will be not birth right issues,  as same sex union is not a self perpetuating basic family unit!</div>

              <p><strong>From wikileaks</strong></p>
              <p>Classified By: Ambassador Patricia L. Herbold for reason 1.4(d)<br> <br> Lee Kuan Yew: the Liberalizer?<br> ------------------------------<br> <br> 2. (C ) 2007 turned out not to be a breakthrough year for gay<br> rights in Singapore, disappointing advocates who had hoped<br> for a major change.  Since Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong<br> came to office in 2004, the Government of Singapore (GOS) has<br> consciously loosened social controls in an effort to give the<br> country a reputation for "buzz," even as the government has<br> maintained tight political controls (Ref B.)  <strong>The government<br> has promoted the arts, licensed casinos, permitted racy<br> billboards, and even allowed topless revues.</strong>  This could not<br> have happened without at least the tacit approval of Minister<br> Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, who still towers over Singapore public<br> life seventeen years after passing on the premiership.<br> Still, some have wondered how comfortable LKY is with these<br> changes, given his reputation for "Victorian" sensibilities.<br> <br> 3. (SBU) So it was a bit surprising when LKY helped spark a<br> public debate through a series of public comments about<br> homosexuality, beginning with a meeting early this year with<br> young ruling party activists at a popular night club.  As<br> reported in the press, LYK told the group, "You take this<br> business of homosexuality.  If in fact it is true that you<br> are genetically born a homosexual because that's the nature<br> of the genetic random transmission of genes, you can't help<br> it.  So why should we criminalize it?  You have to take a<br> practical, pragmatic approach to what I see is an inevitable<br> force of time and circumstance."  In August, LKY told New<br> York Times interviewers that liberalized policies toward gays<br> in Singapore was a "matter of time."  <strong>But due to the<br> sensitivities of "conservative older" Muslim, Chinese and<br> Indian segments of the population, Singapore would take an<br> "ambiguous" position, he added.  "We say, O.K., leave them<br> alone, but let's leave the law as it is for the time being."</strong></p>
              <p>Petitioning the GOS<br> -------------------<br> <br> 4. (C ) Notwithstanding LKY's foreshadowing of the outcome,<br> activists and bloggers quickly took up the cause in an effort<br> to have Article 377A, banning sex between men, repealed as<br> part of the broader penal code reform.  (Note: <strong>There is no<br> provision of law in Singapore that bans sex between women,<br> but the idea that Article 377A involves gender discrimination<br> against men did not become a significant issue in the Article<br> 377A debate.  </strong>End Note.)  An on-line petition appeared on a<br> gay rights group website, Global Voices Online, and was<br> widely circulated by email, eventually garnering nearly 3,000<br> signatures.  While political apathy is the norm in Singapore,<br> many noteworthy citizens signed the petition, including<br> multinational company executives, engineers, teachers, local<br> media celebrities, as well as civil society activists.  Alex<br> Au, co-founder of the gay rights organization "People Like<br> Us", told us he was pleased with the public response, and<br> noted that previous on-line petitions had not been<br> particularly effective in promoting change.<br> <br> No Repeal<br> ---------<br> <br> 5. (SBU) <strong>However, in the weeks leading up to the<br> parliamentary session, local media began to carry stories on<br> the conservative views of Singaporeans and their strong<br> support for traditional family values.  The<br> government-influenced Straits Times newspaper published a<br> survey reporting that over two-thirds of Singaporeans held<br> negative attitudes toward homosexuality. </strong> MP Sin Boon Ann<br> <br> observed in the article that the survey reflected the<br> traditional values of Singaporeans.  <strong>After a long period of<br> public comment, the GOS submitted to Parliament in October<br> the final draft Penal Code revision bill, which retained<br> Section 377A.</strong></p>
              <p>6. (U) When Parliament debated the Penal Code revision bill<br> and NMP Siew Kum Hong's petition later the same day,<strong> nine<br> ruling People's Action Party (PAP) MPs joined the debate to<br> support retention of Section 377A.  The MPs said the petition<br> had prompted residents in their wards to contact them to<br> express their support for keeping the ban.  MP Dr. Muhammad<br> Faishal claimed the Malay/Muslim community wanted to preserve<br> the traditional family unit at a time when it is threatened<br> by rising divorce rates, single-parent households and work<br> pressure.  MP Ong Kian Min insisted that, "Singaporeans<br> simply are not ready to change their family values and<br> endorse homosexuality as normal."  MP Hri Kumar agreed with<br> keeping Section 377A, but noted that it was "virtually<br> impossible" to enforce </strong>(There were only eight convictions<br> under 377A from 1988 to 2003, according to press reports.)</p>

              but i am really curious to know which era showed signs of gays/lesbianism....
              
              it would be hilarious and surprising to know that it already began between cavemen or between cavewomen....

              <p><strong>From wikileaks</strong></p>
              <p>Classified By: Ambassador Patricia L. Herbold for reason 1.4(d)<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew: the Liberalizer?<br>------------------------------<br><br>2. (C ) 2007 turned out not to be a breakthrough year for gay<br>rights in Singapore, disappointing advocates who had hoped<br>for a major change.  Since Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong<br>came to office in 2004, the Government of Singapore (GOS) has<br>consciously loosened social controls in an effort to give the<br>country a reputation for "buzz," even as the government has<br>maintained tight political controls (Ref B.)  <strong>The government<br>has promoted the arts, licensed casinos, permitted racy<br>billboards, and even allowed topless revues.</strong>  This could not<br>have happened without at least the tacit approval of Minister<br>Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, who still towers over Singapore public<br>life seventeen years after passing on the premiership.<br>Still, some have wondered how comfortable LKY is with these<br>changes, given his reputation for "Victorian" sensibilities.<br><br>3. (SBU) So it was a bit surprising when LKY helped spark a<br>public debate through a series of public comments about<br>homosexuality, beginning with a meeting early this year with<br>young ruling party activists at a popular night club.  As<br>reported in the press, LYK told the group, "You take this<br>business of homosexuality.  If in fact it is true that you<br>are genetically born a homosexual because that's the nature<br>of the genetic random transmission of genes, you can't help<br>it.  So why should we criminalize it?  You have to take a<br>practical, pragmatic approach to what I see is an inevitable<br>force of time and circumstance."  In August, LKY told New<br>York Times interviewers that liberalized policies toward gays<br>in Singapore was a "matter of time."  <strong>But due to the<br>sensitivities of "conservative older" Muslim, Chinese and<br>Indian segments of the population, Singapore would take an<br>"ambiguous" position, he added.  "We say, O.K., leave them<br>alone, but let's leave the law as it is for the time being."</strong></p>
              <p>Petitioning the GOS<br>-------------------<br><br>4. (C ) Notwithstanding LKY's foreshadowing of the outcome,<br>activists and bloggers quickly took up the cause in an effort<br>to have Article 377A, banning sex between men, repealed as<br>part of the broader penal code reform.  (Note: <strong>There is no<br>provision of law in Singapore that bans sex between women,<br>but the idea that Article 377A involves gender discrimination<br>against men did not become a significant issue in the Article<br>377A debate.  </strong>End Note.)  An on-line petition appeared on a<br>gay rights group website, Global Voices Online, and was<br>widely circulated by email, eventually garnering nearly 3,000<br>signatures.  While political apathy is the norm in Singapore,<br>many noteworthy citizens signed the petition, including<br>multinational company executives, engineers, teachers, local<br>media celebrities, as well as civil society activists.  Alex<br>Au, co-founder of the gay rights organization "People Like<br>Us", told us he was pleased with the public response, and<br>noted that previous on-line petitions had not been<br>particularly effective in promoting change.<br><br>No Repeal<br>---------<br><br>5. (SBU) <strong>However, in the weeks leading up to the<br>parliamentary session, local media began to carry stories on<br>the conservative views of Singaporeans and their strong<br>support for traditional family values.  The<br>government-influenced Straits Times newspaper published a<br>survey reporting that over two-thirds of Singaporeans held<br>negative attitudes toward homosexuality. </strong> MP Sin Boon Ann<br><br>observed in the article that the survey reflected the<br>traditional values of Singaporeans.  <strong>After a long period of<br>public comment, the GOS submitted to Parliament in October<br>the final draft Penal Code revision bill, which retained<br>Section 377A.</strong></p>
              <p>6. (U) When Parliament debated the Penal Code revision bill<br>and NMP Siew Kum Hong's petition later the same day, <strong>nine<br>ruling People's Action Party (PAP) MPs joined the debate to<br>support retention of Section 377A.  The MPs said the petition<br>had prompted residents in their wards to contact them to<br>express their support for keeping the ban.  MP Dr. Muhammad<br>Faishal claimed the Malay/Muslim community wanted to preserve<br>the traditional family unit at a time when it is threatened<br>by rising divorce rates, single-parent households and work<br>pressure.  MP Ong Kian Min insisted that, "Singaporeans<br>simply are not ready to change their family values and<br>endorse homosexuality as normal."  MP Hri Kumar agreed with<br>keeping Section 377A, but noted that it was "virtually<br>impossible" to enforce</strong> (There were only eight convictions<br>under 377A from 1988 to 2003, according to press reports.)</p>

               I beg to differ in this instance, marriage as an institution is to be recognised by society at large. Marriage in civilised society is either sanctioned by state and religon or customary rites. For example, in Singapore, it is not uncommon for Christian couples to go through all three ceremonies, ROM, church wedding, tea ceremony.  Also, wedding vows must have witnesses to make complete the vows and not forgetting the wedding banquet! Obviously, a wedding must be recognised by it's society before it(state or community) will accrue the union it's right to protection. For couple who cohabited without state sanctioning have common law wife/ husband status. Recognition by society is important.

            <div class='col-md body'>I still refer to birthright of the future offspring, the need to protect the vulnerable, the baby and the long period he/she needs to become a fully fledged human being. As the same sex couple is unable to bear offspring, why should it demand and deprive couples with offsprings of social care intended to perpetuate the community and species. Please understand the same sex and man/ women sexual do not have the same end  game! Adoption must compatible with contemporary social mores! Also gender roles  for species propogation must be considered, the expectation of one's social role when one becomes another's parent.
