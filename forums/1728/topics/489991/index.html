              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>In mid-August 2015 Myanmar’s parliament passed the final two of
              four controversial religious protection laws. The bills have now been signed
              into law by President Thein Sein, joining the Interfaith Marriage Law and
              Population Control Law. The international narrative depicts them as a package
              of legislation that discriminates against women and non-Buddhists, being
              promoted by anti-Islamic nationalists led by MaBaTha (or the Organization for
              the Protection of Race and Religion) and the 969 Movement. In Myanmar, the
              legislation is opposed by civil society groups — led most vocally by women’s
              and rights groups — who argue that the laws violate international norms,
              Myanmar’s treaty obligations, and are likely to further inflame religious
              conflict.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Yet this simplistic binary narrative of opposition ignores the
              appearance of widespread support for the laws not only among large swathes of
              the male population, but also among some women. How do we explain the fact that
              some groups of women in Myanmar would back a set of laws that other groups of
              women claim will be bad for women?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>To date, the general discourse focuses on the ways prominent
              monks may use the laws to gain socio-political influence for MaBaTha and 969.
              Similarly, political parties and government officials are thought to back the
              legislation strategically as a way of </span><a href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2015/03/12/buddhist-nationalism-threatens-myanmars-democratic-transition/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>courting
              Buddhist voters</span></a><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>. But these instrumental accounts cannot effectively explain
              laywomen’s support for the laws. Most Myanmar women are not in a position to
              realise these types of political benefits.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Another explanation either explicitly or implicitly suggests
              that women who advocate for the laws do not fully understand them and are
              themselves naive, manipulated, and/or exploited by power-hungry monks and
              political leaders. This argument is equally problematic as it is not only
              demeaning to women — who have frequently taken a very active, visible role in
              the protests in Rakhine State or the nation-wide signature campaigns — but also
              strips them of agency by not recognising them as self-aware, rational actors.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>How do women explain their support for these laws and for the
              monk-led groups that promote them? Interviews in Rakhine State, for example,
              reveal that the most pressing and immediate fear for many women is the threat,
              plausible or not, of physical assault or rape by Muslim men. It is undeniably
              true that politicians have continuously overlooked the issue of physical and
              sexual violence against women in Myanmar, in part due to the perceived
              ‘traditional high status of women’. In their rhetoric, monks like U Wirathu, a
              prominent figure in 969 and MaBaTha, have taken it upon themselves to protect
              not only Buddhism but specifically, Buddhist women, by acknowledging these
              fears and pledging to take action in defence of women.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Despite this protection being specifically and only offered
              against Muslim men, for many women in Rakhine State it is still more of an
              acknowledgement of the precariousness of women’s lived experiences than they
              see is typically provided by other groups.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>It should be noted that none of the religious protection laws
              deal with physical or sexual violence against women. MaBaTha’s legislative
              platform does not do anything to directly address this primary concern that
              Rakhine Buddhist women have expressed. But the general stance of the
              organisation and its representatives has been to engage sympathetically with Buddhist
              women. They denounce other political actors for not responding to their fears
              and loudly and publicly claim that they are acting on behalf of women.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>There is another dynamic at work here. Despite frequent claims
              regarding the traditional high status of women in Burmese culture, the position
              of women within Burmese Buddhism remains inferior culturally, if not as
              obviously in the political or juridical sense. Besides a persistent belief that
              one must be reincarnated as a man in order to become enlightened,
              institutionalised paths to religious authority or influence are closed off to
              women. Burmese nuns (<em>thila shin</em>) are not considered to be of similar
              status as monks.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Women must also navigate confining roles within marriages and
              families, producing additional fear, anxiety or unhappiness. While entering the
              monastery offers other ways of living in the world, it too falls short of
              enabling the majority of <em>thila shin</em> to freely pursue their spiritual
              and ethical objectives, as most women remain indelibly tied to familial
              obligations outside the monastery.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>In a highly restricted context like this, supporting 969,
              MaBaTha or the religious protection laws can be a way for women to take a
              leading role in the </span><a href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2014/12/16/what-are-myanmars-buddhist-sunday-schools-teaching/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>protection
              of Buddhism</span></a><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'> — a central and well-regarded means of merit-making. Prevented
              from obtaining traditional positions of religious authority, it’s unsurprising
              that some women would embrace these avenues as a way of claiming or asserting a
              religious identity and achieving the religious objectives that are limited by
              their role within lay and monastic society.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The intention of this analysis is not to challenge or undermine
              the argument made by civil society groups that Myanmar’s religious protection
              laws are discriminatory against women and non-Buddhists, violate international
              human rights norms and treaty obligations, and are likely to exacerbate
              religious conflict. These points are all true. But these reasons appear
              unlikely to convince enthusiasts of the laws — including women — to withdraw
              their support.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Closer examination of the experiences of women who back a
              package of laws that some claim runs contrary to their interest reveals the
              self-aware and nuanced ways in which women evaluate and navigate their
              religious and cultural circumstances. Civil society groups will need to engage
              directly and honestly with the full range of Myanmar women’s grievances and
              desires, if they wish to effectively campaign against these laws and the
              discrimination and conflict they are likely to produce.</span></p>
