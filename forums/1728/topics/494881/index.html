              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Vittoria Traverso October 19, 2017 Atlas Obscura </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Hungry Ghost Festival provides them with paper effigies
              of money, food—and iPhones. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There’s a pretty clear,
              well-defined</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> set of
              traits that make up a ghost in the Western world—from the mushy green slimers
              of Ghostbusters to translucent, pudgy Casper to the myriad diaphanous denizens
              of Harry Potter’s Hogwarts. They’re immaterial, legless floaters that often
              care little for the material concerns of the living. It’s mostly a reflection
              of the Western conception of the afterlife, as place above (or below) the
              living world. But ghosts in other parts of the world can be rather different.
              In China, for example, ghosts experience the same desires and, quite literally,
              appetites of the living. And it’s in our best interests to give them what they
              want.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The traditional view of death in China is different from the
              traditional view of death in the West,” says Nick Tackett, an historian from
              University of California, Berkeley, who studies traditional Chinese death
              rituals, especially those from Song and Liao periods. The spirit of the
              deceased separates into two parts, which one might call two souls. One of which
              resides—and ideally remains—in the tomb, and one of which resides in the
              ancestral tablet,” a plaque kept in shrines in homes or temples. After burial,
              souls need to be fed constantly, Tackett explains. “Regular offerings at the
              ancestral altar and periodic offerings at the grave helped satiate the souls of
              the deceased.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But if something goes awry—forgetful relatives who neglect
              their feeding duties, an improper burial, or some unfinished business on
              Earth—a dead person’s soul can wander out of the tomb, hungry. These ghosts
              rarely meddle in the affairs of the living, but starting on the 15th day of the
              seventh month of the Chinese lunar calendar—roughly sometime in July/August—the
              gates of the underworld unlock, allowing flocks of hungry ghosts to roam freely
              for a month, the appropriately titled Ghost Month (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">é¬¼æœˆ</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">), also
              known as the Yulan or Zhongyuan Festival.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The origins of this belief are thought to go back to a
              third-century tale about a Buddhist monk, Mulian, whose deceased mother came
              back to haunt him as a thin-throated, huge-stomached, ravenous apparition.
              Mulian desperately wanted to satisfy her, but he was unable. The more he fed
              her, the hungrier she became. It turns out she had been too greedy during her
              lifetime, leaving her insatiable in death. So the monk turned to Buddha for
              advice and learned that, on a particular auspicious day, he could visit the
              temple with food, money, and all sort of goodies to fill the ghost’s appetite.
              It worked, and the “Hungry Ghost” tradition was born.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Of course, the true origins of the ghost rituals are a little
              more complex. They developed out of a centuries-long process of mixing and
              matching of local folk traditions, Taoism, and Buddhism, dating to well before
              the third century. “Although the Ghost Festival is found only in East Asia in
              medieval times, many of its rituals and mythological components derive from
              lands to the West of China, not only India but the many kingdoms and trading
              centers of central Asia so crucial in the dissemination of Indic and Aryan
              culture to the east,” writes Stephen S. Teiser, a scholar of Buddhism and
              religion at Princeton University, in The Ghost Festival in Medieval China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But Mulian’s tale is a significant part of the practice
              today. “Hungry ghosts are the spirits of people who always wanted more than
              they had, were never grateful for what they were given, and cannot find peace
              in the afterlife any more than they could when they lived,” according to writer
              Emily Mark in the Ancient History Encyclopedia. “They are often depicted as
              people with enormous stomachs but tiny mouths and necks which no amount of food
              could ever fill.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">On top of being rather hangry, these ghosts have some
              particular preferences during their month-long wandering on Earth. There is a
              long list of things that the living should avoid during Ghost Month. Whistling
              attracts ghosts. Leaving clothes out to dry tempts ghosts to try them on.
              Staying up late courts possession. Getting married or starting a relationship
              is a bad idea, as it is not likely to end well. And whatever you do, don’t buy
              a home or apartment during Ghost Month. It will be haunted forever. These
              beliefs actually have real life repercussions, as shown in a 2015 study by
              Agarwal Sumit and his colleagues at the National University of Singapore.
              During Ghost Month, they found, demand for housing goes down, which opens up
              good real estate deals for nonbelievers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Now that you know what not to do, here’s what you should do
              to avoid the ire of hungry ghosts. Just like Buddha’s recommendations to
              Mulian, most of these rituals revolve around the provision of material goods.
              “There were numerous ways in which the dead seem to have benefited from a sort
              of ‘virtual reality,’” says Tackett. “Within the tomb, the soul of the deceased
              could enjoy an afterlife banquet represented in tomb murals. Similarly, fake
              paper money was as useful as real money.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Archeological evidence suggests that paper offerings, known
              as zhizha, or “hell money,” date as far back as 1000 B.C. The idea is that
              through the act of burning, this fake money is transported to the underworld,
              where ghosts can squander it as they see fit. “It is implicitly agreed that if
              a person received proper burial and sacrifice, the ghost of this person will
              not come back to harm people,” writes Mu-chou Poo, a historian at the Chinese
              University of Hong Kong, in Rethinking Ghosts in World Religions. During the
              Song Dynasty (960–1279) other goods started to be made into a form of zhizha
              for ghost rituals. Paper effigies of clothes, houses, horses, and even servants
              were burned to send these items to the underworld’s lavish economy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The desires of hungry ghosts have evolved with the times.
              “The festival, and the wider act of burning items to send to one’s ancestors in
              the underworld, reveals the cultural flows of globalization, and the
              consumption habits of individuals,” says Terence Hang, a sociologist at
              Singapore Institute of Technology who studies the festival’s visual culture.
              “Individuals now purchase and burn whatever is fashionable to consume in a
              contemporary, globalized society. One can get hold of paper iPads, paper credit
              cards, paper Rolls Royces, and more.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The idea is that you try to update their lifestyle to match
              your modern comfort,” says Xiaoxia Zhou from China Institute in America, a
              nonprofit organization that promotes Chinese culture. “Your ancestors should
              have the same things you have, read the same things you read. So people now
              burn paper TVs, paper fridges, [and] in some cases—taking female objectification
              to its extreme—even a beautiful mistress or a secretary.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There was a moment when this centuries-long tradition seemed
              to be on its way out. It has long been tied the Chinese concept of filial piety
              (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">å­�</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">, xiao), which asserts that sons and daughters should
              take care of their parents the best they can. The 1911 revolution sought to do
              away with such ideas and practices. “Ghost Festival rituals or other
              manifestations of xiao were seens as backward folklore that was preventing
              China from modernizing,” says Zhou. Decades later, Mao Zedong, then a
              librarian, integrated this sentiment into his Cultural <em>Revolution.</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But the Ghost Festival was entrenched in Chinese culture. Not
              only has it survived, but now the Chinese government considers it part of the
              country’s intangible cultural heritage. Zhou explains that the tradition is
              strong in rural areas and southern provinces, but less so in China’s burgeoning
              urban centers. Some urban communities are now trying to make the centuries-old
              festival more relevant to young, Western-influenced city dwellers. In 2015 a
              community in Hong Kong launched the first Ghost Festival costume contest. “It
              can be just like Halloween,” Anven Wu Yim-chung, director at the Federation of
              Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community Organizations, told the South China Morning Post.
              The competition welcomed both traditional Chinese ghost options and anime
              characters. The 2016 edition added a ghost grappling competition and ghost
              opera.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And as the Hungry Ghost Festival loses some ground among the
              young, so does the centuries-long craft of making traditional zhizha paper
              effigies, which have been replaced by cheap, mass-produced versions available
              online rather than in traditional shops. But the ancient craft does endure.
              After graduating from design school in the early 1990s, Au Yeung Ping-chi
              decided to follow in his father’s footsteps and learn how to twist and turn
              thin sheets of bamboo paper to make evocative ghost effigies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ping-chi, who runs his workshop in Hong Kong’s Sham Shui Po
              district, made a name of himself as an “unconventional” effigy maker after he
              crafted a ghost guitar for the spirit of Koma Wong Ka-kui of renowned Hong-Kong
              rock band Beyond, who died after falling from a stage in Japan in 1993.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Since then he’s taken on a variety of commissions for unusual
              effigies, according to Zolima magazine: an Xbox, a skateboard, a nail clipper,
              a tamagotchi. Ghost food is another popular option. Ping-chi makes great ghost
              chicken wings and ghost dumplings. And the largest effigy he ever made was a
              full-scale fishing pole.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">His father Wai-kin worries a bit about the direction the
              practice has taken. “The appearance of our effigies … have to be equivalent to
              what the living used, so the underworld can experience progress too,” he told
              the South China Post. “But some popular products now deviate from that
              principle.” One has to wonder what a hungry ghost would need an iPhone for
              anyway.</span></p>
