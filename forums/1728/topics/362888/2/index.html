              <p>No, soka gakkai is not the same as mainstream Buddhism. You should really look into the mainstream Buddhist teachings and learn what it is about. Buddhism emphasis is on enlightenment and liberation. However SGI idea of Buddhism and Buddhahood is very warped. It's teachings is skewed towards humanism and not awareness and awakening. Nothing about liberation and realising our true nature.</p>
              <p>Vegetarianism is never a compulsory part of any Buddhist tradition. Theravada and Vajrayana Buddhist monks continue to eat meat. Mahayana monks do not eat meat, but Mahayana lay practitioners may eat meat. It's really a personal choice.</p>

              <p>Today, I met with Kenji Yoshigo, the Vice President and Executive Director of Soka Gakkai Office of International Affairs. Soka Gakkai is a Buddhist sect which is one of the largest and most influential in Japan. One of the key things that sets it apart from other Buddhist sects is their active involvement in society including education, International relations and politics. They are the force behind the Komeito Party.</p>
              <p>I had heard about Soka Gakkai from a variety of people, usually with negative connotations. Some people alluded to conspiracy, others refer to them like some sort of cult. The only real first hand negative interactions that I had heard of were interactions with overly enthusiastic members trying to recruit people. I had always been curious about the Soka Gakkai, but not curious enough to overcome the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and actually approach them.</p>
              <p>Kana, a young woman who works for me is Soka Gakkai. I found out when I learned that she was marrying a staff member of the Komeito and I asked her whether she was Soka Gakkai. She is one of the hardest working people on our team and has a passion for justice that exceeds ones expectations. She invited me to give the toast at their wedding. At this wedding, they showed video messages from the young children she was mentoring, and I met many of the Soka Gakkai people she worked with. I was very impressed with how intelligent, aware of current issues, and friendly they were. The impression I got at the wedding changed my mental image of Soka Gakkai.</p>
              <p>Early this year, Lou Marinoff, a well known philosopher who I had met several times in Davos visited Japan. He had been invited by Soka Gakkai. I had dinner with Lou and his Soka Gakkai host. Lou told me how impressed he was with their efforts and urged me to contact them and learn more about Soka Gokkai. I respect Lou's opinions greatly and he is quite knowledgeable and objective. His description of the variety of things Soka Gakkai was doing made me decide to try to contact Soka Gakkai to try to get a first hand impression.</p>
              <p>After the dinner with Lou, I asked Kana if she would help me learn more about Soka Gakkai. It took a bit of scheduling, but she coordinated this meeting with Mr. Yoshigo.</p>
              <div class="asset-more-link">Continue reading <a rel="bookmark" href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/08/20/meeting-with-ke.html#more"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Meeting with Kenji Yoshigo of Soka Gakkai</span></span></a>.</div>
              <div id="more" class="asset-more">
              <p>I asked Yoshigo-san to explain Soka Gakkai to me. Soka Gakkai is Buddhist sect and their core principles are very much in tuned with the teachings of most Nichiren Buddhists. Soka Gakkai was originally set up as an educational institution and has worked very hard to try to make society a better place by actively participating in it, unlike many more "passive" sects. I think it is the active participation in politics that causes those in power to fear Soka Gakkai. Yoshigo-san said that they teach people to question authority, think for themselves and be very active. These are also my core principles. Although Soka Gakkai has a large organization with "management" he said that they do not control the thinking of their members and have quite a diverse group of people. They do not worship their founder, nor do they teach people to blindly follow.</p>
              <p>Since I am quite curious about the definition of "evil", I asked Yoshigo-san what he thought was "evil". He said that in Soka Gakkai, they believed very strongly in life and believed that those who destroy life, either through murder or the destruction of humans rights were evil. In the same context, those who ruin their own lives were in a way, "evil". Killing human beings, especially in the name of religion, he believed was evil. This definition works for me.</p>
              <p>He also said that Buddhist teachings say that 1/3 of the world will be "believers" or "followers of the path," 1/3 of the world will be people who will be supportive and part of the same community, and 1/3 of the world will be actively involved in trying to hurt or subvert "believers." According to these teachings, this was the proper "balance" and that trying to make the whole world peaceful or "converted" was not only impossible, but unnatural. So, although there are some overzealous young Soka Gakkai members who try to convert all of their friends, Yoshigo-san made no attempt to try to make me join and made it clear that Soka Gakkai is open to interaction and cooperation with everyone. In fact, the head of one of their schools is Muslim.</p>
              <p><a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/08/27/some_koyasan_notes.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">When I visited Koyasan</span></span></a>, a monk told us that during the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government visited most of the European countries in power those days and realized that they were able to use religion as part of the State and used it in war. Japan took the decentralized animist religion, Shinto, and centralized it under the Emperor. When Japan lost WWII, they lost their religion. Similarly, the student uprisings in the 60's and 70's were squashed. Images of young soldiers dying for their divine Emperor as well as the images of youths wearing helmets and fighting with the riot police are considered silly and quite unfashionable to youths in Japan today. Young people in Japan today believe that fighting for a cause, either religious or political, is stupid and un-cool. This lack of spiritualism and activism makes Soka Gakkai's role quite clear.</p>
              <p>We talked about Japan. We agreed on nearly every point about the lack of democracy, the apathy among the people, the risk of a right-wing popular uprising, and other issues. We agreed that the notion of unquestioning dependence on authority is still prevalent in Japan and was the cause of much of the problems. We talked about how those in power abuse power and those who follow do not have the will to rise up. Having recently had more and more experience with those in power in Japan, I began to realize how dangerous the Soka Gakkai was to those in power.</p>
              <p>It makes sense that those in power would spread FUD about Soka Gakkai and try to discredit their efforts. The more I listened, the more I saw how the negative image Japanese have of Soka Gakkai was part of the standard operating procedure of those in power. If you can't co-opt them, marginalize them in any way possible. Call them, lefties, freaks, extremists, a cult... what ever it takes. Being quite sensitive to how powerful the mass media FUD machine is these days, it was a great feeling to discover yet another mental stigma, planted in my head by "the machine" that I was able to yank out and make my mind more clear.</p>
              <p>I have still only had one meeting with Yoshigo-san, but we spent nearly two hours and he answered every question I had directly and without hesitation. He said I could blog anything we talked about. He also agreed to be available if I had any further questions. Now I ask YOU -- Especially all of you who told me that I shouldn't even meet with them. What do you actually KNOW about Soka Gakkai and why do you think they are so weird/bad. Could it be that you are also just a subject of Japanese mass media FUD? If you have any questions for Soka Gakkai, please let me know. Obviously, this can not consume ALL of my time, but my intention is to try dispel some of the FUD and understand more clearly.</p>

              <p>Please don't talk about politics.</p>
              <p>In the first place, I never said SGI is bad. In the same way I never say Christianity, Islam, etc are bad.</p>
              <p>It's not a question whether they are bad or evil, if they are they would have been banned in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Just that they are not in line with the Buddha's teachings and intentions. And does not lead to the goal intended by Buddha. SGI's interpretation of the teachings are warped.</p>
              <p>All religions teach people to avoid evil, do good, and teaches qualities like compassion and so on -- but only true Buddhism teaches the way to attain insights about our own nature and gain liberation from all sufferings and afflictions. Other religions result in good karma and rebirth in better realms, only Buddhism teaches one to escape the cycle of rebirth and sufferings.</p>

              as well as the images of youths wearing helmets and fighting with
              the riot police are considered silly and quite unfashionable to
              youths in Japan today. Young people in Japan today believe that
              fighting for a cause, either religious or political, is stupid and
              un-cool. This lack of spiritualism and activism makes Soka Gakkai's
              role quite clear.</p>
              <p>We talked about Japan. We agreed on nearly every point about the
              lack of democracy, the apathy among the people, the risk of a
              right-wing popular uprising, and other issues. We agreed that the
              notion of unquestioning dependence on authority is still prevalent
              in Japan and was the cause of much of the problems. We talked about
              how those in power abuse power and those who follow do not have the
              will to rise up. Having recently had more and more experience with
              those in power in Japan, I began to realize how dangerous the Soka
              Gakkai was to those in power.</p>
              <p>It makes sense that those in power would spread FUD about Soka
              Gakkai and try to discredit their efforts. The more I listened, the
              more I saw how the negative image Japanese have of Soka Gakkai was
              part of the standard operating procedure of those in power. If you
              can't co-opt them, marginalize them in any way possible. Call them,
              lefties, freaks, extremists, a cult... what ever it takes. Being
              quite sensitive to how powerful the mass media FUD machine is these
              days, it was a great feeling to discover yet another mental stigma,
              planted in my head by "the machine" that I was able to yank out and
              make my mind more clear.</p>
              <p>I have still only had one meeting with Yoshigo-san, but we spent
              nearly two hours and he answered every question I had directly and
              without hesitation. He said I could blog anything we talked about.
              He also agreed to be available if I had any further questions. Now
              I ask YOU -- Especially all of you who told me that I shouldn't
              even meet with them. What do you actually KNOW about Soka Gakkai
              and why do you think they are so weird/bad. Could it be that you
              are also just a subject of Japanese mass media FUD? If you have any
              questions for Soka Gakkai, please let me know. Obviously, this can
              not consume ALL of my time, but my intention is to try dispel some
              of the FUD and understand more clearly.</p>

              <p>Just some correction. The Komeito is no longer a branch under Soka Gakkai and is no longer related to Soka Gakkai officially as Soka Gakkai would like to have more neutral stand on politics in Japan. Komeito still do have a lot of supporters from SGI Japan though.</p>
              <p>Another thing to note. SGI and SGI Japan are different entities. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

                              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Nichiren School founded in
              Japan by 13th-century Buddhist priest Nichiren, belongs to the
              Mahayana stream of Buddhism.<br>
              <br>
              The doctrines of Nichiren Buddhism are derived from the Lotus Sutra
              widely regarded to be Shakyamuni Buddha's most definitive teaching.
              Nichiren (1222 - 1282) taught that the core teaching of the Lotus
              Sutra is to be found in its title Myoho-Renge-Kyo, which expresses
              as the universal Law underlying all phenomena. Nichiren also
              emphasized that the key teaching in the Lotus Sutra is the Buddha's
              revelation that all people can develop a life state similar to his
              own, called the Buddha nature or Buddhahood.<br>
              <br>
              Nichiren established a practice of chanting the phrase
              Nam-myoho-rengekyo, an invocation that brings the individual in
              harmony with the universal Law, and thus unlocks the potentiality
              of an enhanced self empowered with wisdom and life force
              characteristic of the Buddha nature. Besides, Nichiren taught that
              this personal practice for one's happiness should be complemented
              with one is selfless act in enabling others to awaken likewise to
              their innate potential, an act that is synonymous with the Buddha's
              compassion.</span><br></p>

              Buddhism:<br></a></span></p>
              <p>Dear all,<br>
              <br>
              Nichiren Buddhism has been in the mainstream Buddhist circle as
              seen in the website of Japan Buddhist Federation (<a href="http://www.jbf.ne.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jbf.ne.jp/</a>)
              where Nichiren Buddhist schools are members with exception to
              Nichiren Shoshu &amp; Soka Gakkai.<br>
              <br>
              Probably what needs to be banned from this forum is actually
              "Nichirenism". Well, I'll make a summary explanation of this.<br>
              <br>
              In Japan, Buddhism is almost exclusively of the Northern tradition
              (Mahayana). The lineages are mainly from Tiendai (Tien-tai),
              Shingon, Jodo (Pure Land), Zen, Nichiren &amp; Nara schools. Due to
              the sectarian nature of Japanese Buddhism, each lineage consists of
              subsects together with the main sect.<br>
              <br>
              For Nichiren Buddhism, the main sect will be Nichiren Shu with
              subsects such as Kempon Hokke Shu, Honmon Butsuryu Shu, Honmon
              Hokke Shu &amp; 3 offshoots of Hokke Shu. There are 2 sects that
              advocates "Nichirenism" instead &amp; they are Honmon Shoshu,
              Nichiren Shoshu &amp; its one-time lay organisation Soka
              Gakkai.<br>
              <br>
              Here's the brief difference between Nichiren Shu, Nichiren Shoshu
              &amp; Soka Gakkai:<br>
              <br>
              3 Treasures of Buddhism<br>
              - Buddha<br>
              - Dhamma<br>
              - Sangha<br>
              <br>
              1) Nichiren Shu<br>
              - Buddha : Eternal Sakyamuni Buddha<br>
              - Dhamma : Mahayana Tripitaka with the Lotus Sutra as base, Namu
              Myoho Renge Kyo<br>
              - Sangha : Nichiren Shonin (with the monastics &amp; lay
              community)<br>
              <br>
              2) Nichiren Shoshu<br>
              - Buddha : Nichiren Daishonin<br>
              - Dhamma : The Lotus Sutra, Nam Myoho Rengo Kyo (with emphasize on
              the Goshos)<br>
              - Sangha : Nikko Shonin &amp; successive High Priests<br>
              <br>
              3) Soka Gakkai [2 types]<br>
              {A} Official<br>
              - Buddha : Nichiren Daishonin<br>
              - Dhamma : The Lotus Sutra, Nam Myoho Rengo Kyo (with emphasize on
              the Goshos)<br>
              - Sangha : Nikko Shonin<br>
              {B} In Reality<br>
              - Buddha : President Daisaku Ikeda<br>
              - Dhamma : Writings &amp; Teachings of the President &amp; Soka
              Gakkai<br>
              - Sangha : Soka Gakkai organisation &amp; members<br>
              <br>
              Reason for stating the above 3 organisations is that they are more
              known thru out the world &amp; are ones with branches in
              Singapore.<br>

              hey Poolman, you got to realise that in Buddhism, there are no one god concept, unlike god religions, which is a revealing religion. I can briefly tell you that Buddhism is about realising as opposed to revealing, thats a key difference.
              
              your mom should respect your wishes if you want to be a free thinker, to each his/her own. you will be a buddhist if there is a cause planted lifetimes ago, if you believe in rebirth. another central tenet in Buddhism, besides rebirth, is karma, which is cause and effect.
              
              Buddha did not say he is a god, bringing you to heaven. he said he is a human being and everyone has a Buddha nature.

              <p>And how would yyy explain this relation to soka gakkai or even nichiren shu? I believe this would be an assumption on his part. I understand Budai to be part of Zen Buddhism with some relation to taoism or even I kuan Dao. Relation to Nichiren Shoshu or Soka Gakkai however is non-existence.</p>
