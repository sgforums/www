              <p>Yeah. I wasn't aware that Budai became a God of Fortune in Japan. It seems to belong to those folklore cultures.</p>
              <p>"<strong>INTRODUCTION.</strong> The Shichifukujin <span style="font-family: '?? ?????',monospace;">ä¸ƒç¦�ç¥ž</span> are an eclectic group of deities from Japan, India, and China. Only one
              is native to Japan (Ebisu) and Japan's indigenous Shinto tradition.
              Three are from the Hindu-Buddhist pantheon of India (Daikokuten,
              Bishamonten, and Benzaiten) and three from Chinese Taoist-Buddhist
              traditions (Hotei, Juroujin, and Fukurokuju). In Japan, they travel
              together on their treasure ship (takara bune <span style="font-family: '?? ?????',monospace;">å®�èˆ¹</span>)
              and dispense happiness to believers. Each deity existed independently
              before Japan's "artificial" creation of the group in the 17th century.
              Images of the seven appear with great frequency in modern Japan, and
              the most common ordering is: Ebisu, Daikoku, Benzai, Hotei, Fukurokuju,
              Juroujin, Bishamonten. Each deity is presented briefly below. Click any
              deity name for full textual reviews &amp; numerous photos. <a style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" href="http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/ivory-set.html">Click here for photo montage</a>."</p>

              <p>Just to make a correction, the deity in the photograph is not Budai (Jpn: Hotei) but Daikokuten (å¤§é»’å¤©). Hotei would be the Chinese-style Maitreya bodhisattva (aka "Laughing Buddha"). That pic, by the way, looks like the one enshrined in Kiyomizu Temple here in Kyoto.</p>
              <p>In Nichiren-shu style Butsudans (fo tan ä½›å£‡, that's what the "black cabinet" is, and is NOT limited to just Nichiren Shoshu or Soka Gakkai, but used in all Buddhist traditions in Japan), Daikokuten and Guizimu (é¬¼å­�æ¯�) are also enshrined next to the Omandala like below.</p>

              <p>Soka is considered a new-age religion here (Japan). Although Nichiren shoshu is considered as a "traditional" form of Buddhism, as pointed out, due to its exclusivism and views on other Buddhist traditions, Nichiren-influenced or not, it is not a member of the All-Japan Buddhist Federation and does not participate in ecumenical activities.</p>

              <p><strong>HÄ�rÄ«tÄ«</strong> (<a title="Sanskrit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>), also known as <strong>Kishimojin</strong> in <a title="Japanese language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a>:é¬¼å­�æ¯�ç¥ž, is a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Buddhist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist">Buddhist</a> goddess for the protection of children, easy delivery, happy child
              rearing and parenting, harmony between husband and wife, love, and the
              well-being and safety of the family. Women without children also pray
              to Kishimojin to help them become pregnant.</p>
              <p>Originally, Kishimojin/ Hariti was a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Cannibal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibal">cannibalistic</a> <a title="Demon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon">demon</a>.
              She had hundreds of children whom she loved and doted upon, but to feed
              them, she abducted and killed the children of others. The bereaved
              mothers of her victims pleaded to <a title="Gautama Buddha" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">ÅšÄ�kyamuni Buddha</a> to save them.</p>
              <p>ÅšÄ�kyamuni stole <a class="new" title="Aiji (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aiji&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Aiji</a>, youngest of Kishimojin's sons, and hid him under his <a title="Rice" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice">rice</a> <a title="Bowl (vessel)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_%28vessel%29">bowl</a>.
              Kishimojin desperately searched for her missing son throughout the
              universe. Finally, she pleaded with Shakyamuni for help. The Buddha
              pointed out that she was suffering because she lost one of hundreds of
              children, and asked if she could imagine the suffering of parents whose
              only child had been devoured. She replied contritely that their
              suffering must be many times greater than hers, and vowed to protect
              all children.</p>
              <p>Kishimojin became the goddess of easy birthing and the protection and parenting of children.</p>
              <p>Some stories describe her as an aspect of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Kuan Yin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuan_Yin">Kannon</a>.

              <p>Thanks so much for your response Sarnath.</p>
              <p>From my experience and long discussions of
                  Buddhism with my SOKA friends, after having visited their centre, and also visited
                  the centre of Nichiren Shoshu of Singapore. I realise that both places had very warm
                  and nice people and I could see that their followers have strong faith
                  and solid practice. <br> <br> From my very preliminary encounter with them, in the Nichiren
                  Shoshu school, their main tenets are basically the same with all
                  mahayana schools of Buddhism, practicing to rid the 3 poisons, karma,
                  to lessen attachments etc. They believe this can be done through the
                  chanting of the mantra Nam Myo Ho Ren Ge Kyo. From my observation,
                  generally, their followers do have a good solid foundation in the same
                  Buddhism which is taught at other Mahayana temples. They do know about
                  the tipitaka(maybe the japanese version to be more accurate) And also
                  of course the different Mahayana schools of thought. However, they
                  strongly emphasize those mentioned above being book knowledge and the
                  door to being able to integrate those book knowledge into one's daily
                  life and actions is thru the chanting of the mantra as mentioned
                  above.  <br> <br> As for their dedication towards chanting their mantra, from what I
                  observe, it is no less than those who follow the Pureland school. As
                  such, as with the pureland schools, they appeal to ppl who like the
                  methods of mantra recitation.
                  <br> <br> In the practice of mantra, I guess that I can safely say that
                  concentration is practised and at the same time, the practice of mantra
                  generally generates a very powerful mental energy in the practitioner
                  that goes with the mantra. This is common with all schools that
                  practice the mantra method. The practitioners of the Nichiren schools also
                  seem to experience and exhibit these from my personal observation.
                  <br> <br> In SOKA, from what I know, their practitioners chant the same
                  mantra to bring out the inherent life force in them. From the
                  explanation of my friend who shared this with me, the life force he
                  means is the life force which is one with the whole universe and
                  himself and all beings. After some further discussion, I gather his
                  explanation of the life force being a little similar to the concept of Buddha
                  Nature of the Mahayana Schools. From what I know, this
                  chanting also serves to align one to the natural way of things in this
                  world. Sometimes people also chant for more altruistic purposes, like
                  for all one's friends to be well and happy and free from suffering, or
                  more mundane wants like to get a good job. About their base in the
                  general Buddhist teachings, I cannot say much as I have not really
                  spoken much with them about it. But I do know that in Singapore, they
                  do have dedicated classes that teach Buddhist knowledge. They also do
                  have a certain basic understandings of the 3 poisons etc. <br> <br> Other than that, to clarify a misconception, they do not pray to a
                  box or a piece of paper. The 'piece of paper' in the box is actually a
                  mandala first drawn up by Nichiren and subsequently by the priests of
                  the tradition. On it contains the names of many Great Patriarchs and
                  Bodhisattvas, heavenly kings and heavenly protectors. Of course, not
                  forgetting their main mantra as the centre piece. My friend told me,
                  when bowing to the Gohonzon(the mandala, gohonzon actually means the
                  main image of worship in japanese) , one is bowing to one's Buddha
                  inside oneself, or one's Buddha nature in short. To remember this great
                  potentiality inside everyone to achieve the sublime state of
                  Buddhahood. And to remind one to strive to that stage and be one with
                  it one day sooner.
                  <br> <br> Similarities aside, it is an interesting fact to note that Nichiren
                  went around exploring all other schools of Buddhism of his time and
                  challenged their practitioners in public debate. Thereafter, mostly he
                  saw the futility of all other schools to achieve Buddhahood. Or maybe,
                  could it be that the practitioners of his time or those which he
                  encountered were not any good in their practice?
                  <br> <br> Yea, so just to give you guys a better idea of the insides of these
                  two schools from what I know. If anyone readin is a member of these
                  organisations, pls do correct me if i do make any mistakes along the
                  way.</p>
              <p><br>In
                  any case, as what is said in the famous Kalama Sutta, I think the faith
                  of these people from the Nichiren Schools comes from the truth they
                  find in the practices evocated by Nichiren. On the other hand, I think
                  that those who have not explored and ventured and had first hand
                  contact with the Nichiren or SOKA followers and temples not comment too
                  much on their form of Buddhism.</p>
              <p><strong>Another thing I would like to
                  share is that what we always hear and see about the Nichiren schools
                  could be just the critism of one school on the other. For example when
                  I was speaking with the people from Nichiren Shoshu, they were talking
                  about the corupt practices of the Nichiren Shu which resulted in their
                  break away and about SOKA being politically oriented. When I speak with
                  the people from SOKA, they would talk of the people from Nichiren
                  Shoshu having corupt practices which are not in line with Nichiren's
                  teachings anymore. So whatever hearsay we hear or read of could be
                  added on rumous started by any of these factions. Thus my advice is NOT
                  to believe in any of these or take any other person's word for it but
                  truly explore and know for yourselves their teachings first hand.</strong></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>just to share my own personal experience. For about half a year between 1999 and 2000 after finishing NS i was quite interested and did attend meetings at both Soka Gakkai and Nichiren Shoshu.</p>
              <p>Whilst they were truly warm and sincere, however, i was rather peeved off by their constant attacks on each other (which still continues till today, especially in Japan) and attacks on other Buddhist teachings. I still remember we were actually asked to chant the daimoku to "attain victory and to shakubuku the other party (SGI vs NSS)". There is also a book published by SGI that details on the wrongdoings of Nichiren Shoshu and its former head priest, which of course, Nichiren Shoshu rebutts.</p>
              <p>If you are really interested in knowing about Nichiren Buddhism, there's the "Lotus Sutra Buddhist Association (Nichiren Shu)" whose member supa-naga posts in this forum often.</p>
              <p>For myself, i'm a Jodo Shin Buddhist (Pure Land).</p>

              <p>Thanks so much for your response Sarnath.</p>
              <p>From my experience and long discussions of Buddhism with my SOKA
              friends, after having visited their centre, and also visited the
              centre of Nichiren Shoshu of Singapore. I realise that both places
              had very warm and nice people and I could see that their followers
              have strong faith and solid practice.<br> <br> From my very preliminary encounter with them, in the Nichiren
              Shoshu school, their main tenets are basically the same with all
              mahayana schools of Buddhism, practicing to rid the 3 poisons,
              karma, to lessen attachments etc. They believe this can be done
              through the chanting of the mantra Nam Myo Ho Ren Ge Kyo. From my
              observation, generally, their followers do have a good solid
              foundation in the same Buddhism which is taught at other Mahayana
              temples. They do know about the tipitaka(maybe the japanese version
              to be more accurate) And also of course the different Mahayana
              schools of thought. However, they strongly emphasize those
              mentioned above being book knowledge and the door to being able to
              integrate those book knowledge into one's daily life and actions is
              thru the chanting of the mantra as mentioned above. <br> <br> As for their dedication towards chanting their mantra, from what I
              observe, it is no less than those who follow the Pureland school.
              As such, as with the pureland schools, they appeal to ppl who like
              the methods of mantra recitation.<br> <br> In the practice of mantra, I guess that I can safely say that
              concentration is practised and at the same time, the practice of
              mantra generally generates a very powerful mental energy in the
              practitioner that goes with the mantra. This is common with all
              schools that practice the mantra method. The practitioners of the
              Nichiren schools also seem to experience and exhibit these from my
              personal observation.<br> <br> In SOKA, from what I know, their practitioners chant the same
              mantra to bring out the inherent life force in them. From the
              explanation of my friend who shared this with me, the life force he
              means is the life force which is one with the whole universe and
              himself and all beings. After some further discussion, I gather his
              explanation of the life force being a little similar to the concept
              of Buddha Nature of the Mahayana Schools. From what I know, this
              chanting also serves to align one to the natural way of things in
              this world. Sometimes people also chant for more altruistic
              purposes, like for all one's friends to be well and happy and free
              from suffering, or more mundane wants like to get a good job. About
              their base in the general Buddhist teachings, I cannot say much as
              I have not really spoken much with them about it. But I do know
              that in Singapore, they do have dedicated classes that teach
              Buddhist knowledge. They also do have a certain basic
              understandings of the 3 poisons etc.<br> <br> Other than that, to clarify a misconception, they do not pray to a
              box or a piece of paper. The 'piece of paper' in the box is
              actually a mandala first drawn up by Nichiren and subsequently by
              the priests of the tradition. On it contains the names of many

              protectors. Of course, not forgetting their main mantra as the
              centre piece. My friend told me, when bowing to the Gohonzon(the
              mandala, gohonzon actually means the main image of worship in
              japanese) , one is bowing to one's Buddha inside oneself, or one's
              Buddha nature in short. To remember this great potentiality inside
              everyone to achieve the sublime state of Buddhahood. And to remind

              <p>Hi , Emanrohe , I think you have a idea that they are nice .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SGI do not represent Buddhism in any ways .first they refused to recognise Sakyamuni and based their belief on a lay man words.this layman is the current president of SGI international</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next , You should try to go and find out whats their curriculum for SGI .They have to take exams for the Lotus Sutra and they rejected the Universal Gate Chapter .Since you are from Kwan Yin School of Korean Zen .You should know this chapter is Praise of Avalokiteshvara</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They classified the Lotus Sutra as inferior and superior chapters .May I ask this question,Who turn the wheel of the Wondeful Lotus ?Nichiren  or Sakyamuni</p>
              <p>stop twisting the fact of this sutra .</p>
              <p>Then they feel they use new terminology to deal with modern social issue .That to me isnt Buddhism ,but an new age religion .</p>
              <p>I have friend who left Sokka Gakkai after disgusted by their shallow of teaching and constant criticism of other school of Buddhism</p>
              <p>So ,let me go back to Kalama Sutta .Do you need to be a christian , muslim , hindu ,catholic before you come to Buddhism ?</p>
              <p>the answer is no .You just need those who were once in that religion to understand their religion more , instead of experiencing yourself</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thats y i feel certain teaching in Pali Cannon is incomplete ,and cannot be use as Yardstick for Buddhist practice</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Since its founding Soka Gakkai was part of Nichiren Shoshu's lay branch, and SGI's first two presidents were adherents of Nichiren Shoshu. SGI and NSS split bitterly in 1990 due to a rift between Ikeda and Nikken, as the two accused each other of trying to intervene in each other's policies. Nikken excommunicated Ikeda and the whole of Soka Gakkai around 1990 to 1991. THAT'S why they're still bitter towards each other.</p></div>
