              <h2><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Microlender
              sets interest according to borrower’s good deeds, avoids defaults with
              neighborly peer pressure </span></h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>BAAN NA
              KLUEA, Thailand—Buddhist monks aren’t really known for dipping into the
              material world of finance. Phra Subin Paneeto, though, says he felt he didn’t
              have much choice when he saw his neighbors near Thailand’s border with Cambodia
              were struggling to make ends meet.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>So, in
              the early 1990s, he started a microlending operation with a few thousand baht,
              lending small amounts to villagers to help pay for home repairs, buy new farm
              machinery and pay off other, larger debts.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Today,
              Phra Subin’s micro-banking network has amassed about $60 million in deposits an
              loans.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The
              idea is that its 66,000 members will each contribute sums ranging from 10 baht
              to 500 baht, or about 30 cents to $15, a month. Each member who wishes to
              borrow is bundled together with three to five guarantors, and is allowed to tap
              more than they put in, at an interest rate of 1% to 2% a month—or less if other
              villagers agree. Some borrowers pay no interest. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The
              guarantors, who are all members of the group, are often friends, relatives or
              neighbors of the borrowers. Members have an incentive to be guarantors so that
              others will be guarantors for them when they wish to borrow money.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Half of
              the venture’s earnings are paid to the members at the end of each year. The
              rest go to a village welfare fund.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Thais
              have plenty of other banking options to choose from. According to the Bank of
              Thailand, the country’s central bank, about 90% of Thai households have access
              to financial services. In rural areas, government-sponsored village credit
              programs have lent more than $5 billion since the idea caught on in the early
              2000s, making Thailand one of the biggest players in the global microfinance
              scene.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Nonetheless,
              demand for Phra Subin’s Buddhist-flavored lending program, called Sajja Sasom
              Sab, continues to gain traction.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Other
              temples and monasteries around predominantly Buddhist Thailand have followed
              his example. More than 40 of the country’s 76 provinces have witnessed monks
              get involved in similar microfinance projects.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The
              reason for Phra Subin’s continued success?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Some
              borrowers, depending on how well they are perceived to follow Buddhist precepts
              such as telling the truth or avoiding intoxicating substances, aren’t charged
              interest, Phra Subin says. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>“Other
              financial institutions, they look at your financial records, assets and
              collateral,” he explained in a Buddhist temple in the hub of his saving network
              here in Trat province. “But the community will evaluate your good deeds.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>No-interest
              loans cut into the lender’s profit margin, but Phra Subin says that is offset
              by his system’s emphasis on Buddhist principles—he calls it a karmic
              peer-pressure system—which makes defaults virtually nonexistent. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>“If you
              are not honest or sincere to other group members, nobody will help you when you
              want to borrow the money,” Phra Subin continued. “This community will force you
              to practice Dharma, work hard, be honest and take responsibility. Otherwise no
              one will want you.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Dharma
              refers to the teachings of Buddha.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Other
              religious groups around the world have tried to tackle poverty using microfinance.
              The Roman Catholic charity Caritas Manila has helped form microbanks in the
              Philippines that have expanded access to credit there; its cooperative now has
              20,000 members and has a repayment rate of 96%. The Catholic church has
              embarked on similar projects in Indonesia, where it has set up credit unions in
              remote areas of the archipelago, such as Kalimantan province on the island of
              Borneo.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>In
              India, Hindu charities and temples have helped rural communities secure loans
              from banks. Indian banking regulations prohibit banks and microfinance
              institutions from taking an explicitly religious approach in their lending
              decisions. But some Hindu groups do help, says Shantharam Pai, financial
              director with Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project, a charitable
              trust that is associated with a Hindu temple in the southern state of
              Karnataka. His organization acts on behalf of commercial banks, as agents, to
              help people, mostly women, navigate the banking system and obtain loans.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>By
              applying Buddhist precepts to its lending policies, Phra Subin’s microfinance
              operation in Thailand goes considerably further than its counterparts. Its
              supporters say that applying the concept of karma, that an individual’s actions
              inevitably affect them later in life, appears to reinforce the peer-pressure
              model that is at the root of most microfinance programs, helping to keep the
              operation’s borrowers from defaulting. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The
              operation’s managers say there are no current defaults and the lender is in
              contact with all borrowers who are late on their payments. In Thailand’s
              commercial sector, loan defaults were about 2.16% of outstanding loans, or
              278.2 billion baht in 2014.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Moreover,
              the more a borrower repays, the lower the interest rate will be the next month,
              unlike at commercial banks, which calculate interest rates at set levels.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Traditional
              bankers generally applaud such a system. “These forms of lending and savings promotion
              are typically observed in low-income communities in rural areas,” says Piyasak
              Ukritnukun, managing director of CFG Services Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Bank
              of Ayudhya. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>He said
              larger commercial banks tend to shy away from similar lending structures “due
              to the relatively small loan sizes and lower interest rates coupled with high
              operating costs.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>There
              are other potential drawbacks to the less-formal village microfinance system:
              Much of the Sajja Sasom Sab network’s success is bound up in the efforts of its
              charismatic founder, Phra Subin. Economists such as Luxmon Attapich at the
              Asian Development Bank say it is sometimes a problem for lenders to rely so
              heavily on the leadership of one person. “What if they are not around anymore?”
              she asked. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>She and
              other economists say that some informal microfinance programs, while initially
              successful, ultimately falter because their leaders die or move away.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Still,
              Phra Subin’s network has been a boon to the many Thais who still don’t use the
              formal banking network. According to an Asian Development Bank report, more
              than 1.7 million Thais borrow from informal lenders, including some 335,000 who
              borrow from loan sharks or other unlicensed lenders.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Dusit
              Satharalai, for instance, borrowed some 300,000 baht with an 8% annual interest
              rate from an agricultural cooperative in 1992 to start a durian plantation.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The
              venture was slow to bear fruit, however. Twenty years later, Mr. Dusit found
              himself struggling to make payments and prevent his land being seized. Adding
              to his problems, the co-op increased his interest rate to 13% because of late
              payments, he said.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>He
              borrowed money from his sister, but when she had to pay for her children’s
              school fees, Mr. Dusit was running out of options.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>At his
              brother’s suggestion, Mr. Dusit turned to the Sajja Sasom Sab group in 2013,
              securing a 400,000 baht loan from the fund with an interest rate of 0.5% per
              month. After two years, he has already paid half of it back and plans to clear
              his debt to zero by the end of this year, including the co-op loan. Business
              has picked up at Mr. Dusit’s plantation, which has helped with his payments,
              but the lower-interest loan from the Sajja Sasom Sab has also eased his
              struggles.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Mr.
              Dusit’s niece, Panisa Satharalai, whose father borrowed 1 million baht from the
              fund to rebuild the family home, says she has doubled her income since then by
              offering home-stay accommodation and starting a catering business.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>“This
              is a happy debt,” said Ms. Panisa. “This loan gave me a job and makes me want
              to get up early every morning to work hard, and it shows how united our
              community is. I won’t need to worry that I could not pay it back and risk
              losing my house and land.”</span></p>
