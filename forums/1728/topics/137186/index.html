            <div class='col-md body'>People like living but dislike death. So people seldom discuss the topic of how to die in a good way. (Note, am not talking of suicide!) When a person dies, the consciousness wonders up to 49 days, and for every 7 days, thereÂ�fs a chance of rebirth. Cases of similar near death experience where a person come back from death can be seen both in the west and the east. There are 2 scenarios. One is when proven dead by doctors, one hear a familiar noise or frightening sound, due to the reaping of bad karma. Second is the scenario of one moving through a dark and long tunnel, due to the separation of mind (consciousness) and body. If the consciousness wishes to escape from the exit of the eyes, the movement to the exit point will form a tunnel like scenario.<br><br>(Note: For those whose consciences are good, or did plentiful of good deeds, the consciousness run to the exit point of the crown, where beings of the deva-realms starts to manifest. For purelanders, itÂ�fll be the manifestations of the Pureland sages (Amitabha, Avalokitesva, Mahasthamaprapta) appearing to escort, also exit from the crown area.)<br><br>Then the spiritual body sees the form body. For good people, one sees the body radiates brightness. It also sees other spiritual bodies with similar frequencies of consciousness. One starts to recall life and what one did in fast flashbacks. This is a point when consciences and confidence are of most importance. One cannot be thinking of oneÂ�fs practice is not worthy of Pure Abodes. Cite the case where, even one who committed the graves offense can change over a new leaf, but I am not worst than him. Cite the inconceivable virtues of AmidaÂ�fs Great compassioned 18th vow. Etcs. Do not let karma or guilt lead one off to a bad rebirth. There are 2 kinds of people where one need not undergo these stages, or where rebirth to the next realm is instantaneous. ThatÂ�fs one of great meritorious deeds such as cultivations and one of enormous evil deeds.<br><br>---<br><br>The Spiritual Bodies/consciousness that come out of the dead body (aka soul as convenience, but rather "intermediate state/bardo/7-8 consciousness" in Buddhism, as it's not permanent as yet) are formless, like light, like energy. The Spiritual Body can hear clearly the sound spoken by people around the dead body. So the people around should not speak ill will of the dead, but rather give encouragements and confidence. It's been written that there are cases like accident/sudden death where the Spiritual Body do not know that it had separated from the form body, until they sight they own bodies and surrounding police/ambulance. A life when dies, only changes in state of substance, just like water has liquid, solid or gaseous state. What seems to die, actual it is still there. Life too is divided into different moral and karmic stateÂ�C thus formulate difference in ranks. Like Cunningness state formulates state of 'fox-like' realm. Fierce and Cruelty formulates state of 'lion-like' realm. Vegetarian but ignorance formulates state of realm of herbivore. State of detachment, purity and equality, formulates state of Buddhas/bodhisattvas realms. Etcs. Cite a case in America where a genial old lady consciously went to a very peaceful place where the sun is not hot, the water in the lake is clear, life there is like her character genial. After coming back consciously, she longs for the place, but couldn't go back. If a person had in it's mind in peace, when die, one would rebirth into a place similarly as peaceful. If a person keeps fighting over foods, then one's due to reborn into the animal realms. Karma had always been imprinted in out sub-consciousness (alaya).<br><br>Beings of the intermediated states cannot feel time nor space, as it's not of the 3rd dimensions. 4th dimensions is a convenient saying, in fact it's multiple dimensions/realms. Buddhas/bodhisattvas had transcend even the multiple dimensions yet, the multiple dimensions has the dwelling of Buddhas/bodhisattvas. Buddhas/bodhisattvas have no ranks, as they had realized multiple dimensions are based on emptiness. Hence they dwells neither in multiple dimensions nor not dwell in multiple dimensions. They can transform the multiple dimensions yet are not turn by the multiple dimensions.<br>The base faculties such as thinking, feeling of Beings of the intermediated states are not affected by the change of dimensions. (For purelanders too, when reborn in Pureland, still have thinking and feelings. If not, it would be called Ultimate Bliss.)<br><br>A good cultivator can die without attachment, and a mind without confusion, is due to great amount of daily practices (of letting-go) and not wait until the moment of death.<br><br>Above is potion note translated from Ven Master Hui Lui's<br>'Perperation for the dying.'<br>http://book.bfnn.org/books/0258.htm#a03<br>http://www.fa-in.org/film/hl/chinese_028.htm<br>Also found in the Tibetan Book of the Dead<br>http://www.near-death.com/experiences/buddhism01.html<br><br>/\<br>Amituofo.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That scenario was shown in Near Death Experiences -<br><br><blockquote>'Life after Life' is based on 150 accounts, and from these accounts Moody extracted the fifteen most frequent elements. He labelled these in the sequence in which they tended to occur as follows: ineffability, hearing the news, feelings of peace and quiet, <strong>the noise, the dark tunnel</strong>, out of the body, meeting others, the being of light, the review, the border or limit, coming back, telling others, effects on lives, new views of death, and, finally, corroboration. This next account, a descriptive summary by Kenneth Ring, puts flesh on the bones of these elements.</blockquote></div>
