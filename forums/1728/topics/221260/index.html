Actually Â“True SelfÂ” is only a name, if you think that Â“True SelfÂ” is really True Self, then that is wrong, it should be Â“No-Self is SelfÂ”, that is True Self. - Ven.Shen Kai</blockquote>This part of the article I pasted on the previous thread by Casino_King is very important because it is this that sets the difference between Hinduism and Buddhism. No-Self is Self literally means that - the nature of Self is No-Self, is emptiness. It is <strong>not</strong> a "non-egoistic Self" or "selfless Self", it means, No-Self is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">precisely</span> (the true nature of) Self, and if you think there is a Self with inherent existence apart from the true nature of No-Self, then you are wrong. And that is why in Mahayana, 'Self' is only a name... is not seperated from Emptiness.<br><br>I have read about this a long time ago... that Mahayana's teachings on 'Self' is merely a re-assertion of a wrong concept of Self that sentient beings have, with the right "concept" of Emptiness. Without understanding this, one may misunderstand that there is a 'true Self' to be found after the ego (small self) dies. When small self dies, Great Self/True Self/Dharmakaya (the terms found in many mahayana sutras, especially those on tathagathagarbha) "manifest" but this Dharmakaya is Emptiness and without inherent existence.<br><br>So, 'true self' is really just a substitute names... refering to our true nature of emptiness... there is no inherent existence/self at all.<br><br>See: <a href="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php?showtopic=38847&amp;st=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php?showtopic=38847&amp;st=0</a><br><br><blockquote>The wiki article sounds like Dr Tony Page or one of his followers. He runs the Mahaparinirvana Sutra site. He is convinced that, in a Jonangpa-ish manner Buddha really taught a self-existent Atman or Self.<br><br>What these folks ignore is that when Atman is used, without being criticised, and is equated or linked to Tathagatagarbha etc.; the Buddha-nature does not = atman, but Atman = buddha-nature. That is, the non-inherent, shunyata, emptiness of buddha-nature is also the nature of Atman. Not that the inherent self-nature, svabhava of Atman = buddha-nature.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thusness agreed with the post by the E-Sangha member about <span style="font-style: italic;">the Buddha-nature does not = atman, but Atman = buddha-nature. That is, the non-inherent, shunyata, emptiness of buddha-nature is also the nature of Atman. Not that the inherent self-nature, svabhava of Atman = buddha-nature</span> but would like me to add on...<br><br>Not that nothing exist, but existence is always in a form of manifestation.  When we say Â‘selfÂ’, we cannot understand it apart from the 5 aggregates.  When we say Â‘SelfÂ’, it cannot be understood apart from bare 18 dhatus (without the intervention of mental formation) phenomena that dependently arise as a result of causes and conditions.<br><br>That is, there is thinking, hearing, seeing but there is no thinker, hearer and seer.  If we fail to see the thinking, hearing and seeing, we are deluded; if we see the hearer, thinker and seer, we are also deluded; if we see and not understand the arising is due to conditions we are also deluded for arising is not without conditions and cannot be separated from conditions.  .<br><br>Postulation of something experiencing another thing arises only conceptually not directly.  In direct experience, Â‘SelfÂ’ has no role; there is no necessity for us to postulate a Â‘selfÂ’ or Â‘SelfÂ’ in actual experience.</div>
