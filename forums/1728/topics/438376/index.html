              <p>I once refused joss sticks at the funeral of my colleague's father. The reason is because I know my Muslim colleague will not hold the joss sticks, so I refuse just so that he won't feel at odds.</p>
              <p>But later I felt bad, because I think I have been rude by refusing the joss sticks.</p>
              <p>I have no issue about the putting joss sticks at other funerals. Its what the deceased's custom entail. It is just a simple gesture to bestow honour to the decease and respect for the bereaved family customs. I felt if I didn't want to put joss sticks, I should not join the line paying their last respects.</p>
              <p>I think one can put ones belief aside, and perform a simple gesture in accordance with the deceased tradtion. </p>

              <p>My uncle, his sister, was a toaist, he loved his sister so much, cried and forgot he brought the joss stick.</p>

              <p>After quickly offering the joss stick with some fruits and food at one quiet corner of the floor , the wind suddenly gone and become peaceful.</p>

              <p>i didn't mean it to link both scenarios directly, but for juxtaposition's sake. if it(holding joss sticks) goes against religion A, then i thought the question should also be put to the buddhist on the other hand. it goes both ways to be fair.</p>

              <p>People with 3rd eye knows very well where do the souls go to for those with last minute conversion to other religion which the deceased are not familiar or not willing to. People with 3rd eye said theirs are lost souls which are the most pitiful.</p>
              <p>I've heard of many real stories of those people who forgo their life long religion and converted to other religion, let their closed ones dreamt that their souls were suffering. The most common complaint is hunger.</p>
              <p>There was this auntie whose son was of heavenly religion and died at young age. He told his mum in her dream, asking her to bring food for him and not just brought flowers to his graveyard. He said he felt so "paiseh" (shy) that he had to ask for food from "his Toaist friends." </p>

              <p>i guess anyone can pay their respects in any way that they wish to.</p>
              <p>however, if one brings joss-sticks to a funeral which doesn't cater for it, then they will just have to put them in a make-do location. To go to a funeral you know will not cater for certain other religions customs, but you still want to bring your own style and then afterwards become angry....then the focus is no longer on the deceased, rather to please yourself.</p>

              <p>I also do not understand why joss stick comes to be associate with paying respect to the deceased? shouldnt respect be done when one was alive? whats the use of paying respect when the person is no longer around and the body lying in a coffin.</p>

              <p>did anyone bother asking the deceased which religion he/she prefers when the deceased was alive and the type of funeral arrangement the deceased wants? what if the deceased really wanted is to scatter his remains in the sea and not hold the 3 day funeral in HDB void deck.</p>
              <p>also do you think last minute change of religion will help the deceased go to heaven as in christianity? dun kid yourself. in that case, Osama also can go to heaven if he were to accept Jesus before he died?</p>
              <p>if you understand kamma, the deceased will bring his good and bad kamma along with him to his next life. the fate of his next existence depend on his kamma. no amount of chanting will change his destiny in his next life, only kamma.</p>

              <p>you grief cos you are bring brought up or conditioned to cry when people, esp your family and relatives pass away. we are being taught that when someone close to you, you need to cry to show your grief. those who doesnt cry or show their grief is unfilial.</p>
              <p>I know of one chap. when his grandfather died, he didnt feel sad, cos he felt that his grandfather will be reborn in heaven. see the difference.</p>
