              <p>Even you conceded that a "Mind" of some sort exists in a beginingless way, so what mind/matter dilemma are you talking about? Anyway, the Bible tells us that God created living things to reproduce after their kind. The answer is given, it contradicts no logic or anything that we know for a fact.</p>
              <p>Before time was created, we do not speak of "before" chronologically, but logically. Thus an eternal God who is timeless created the universe, at the moment of creation, time/space/matter was born. Thus the first three words of the Bible "In the beginning" is a most scientific phrase!</p>
              <p>I doubt that Buddha was talking about atoms back then. Anyway, IMO there is nothing noble about recognising the fact of suffering (no offense intended please). I don't think anyone would deny there is suffering. The issue is whether there is a solution to it, and whether the solution is adequate.</p>

              <p>4. No, 'what is suffering' is simply saying 'who is suffering' in another way. My point is that there is no 'what' or 'who' behind suffering. When suffering arises, there is only suffering without sufferer. Since Buddha never said "You suffer" or "He suffer" or "I suffer" (other than as conventional speech) but "suffering arises", the correct question should be asked then: what is the causes and conditions in which suffering arises?<br><br>Everything arises through causes and conditions, without agency/controller/perceiver/experiencer.</p>

              <p>anyway, that in Buddhism, is only microscopical, we also have smaller or middle or greater "end days" on earth. greater "end days" is when hell, and the all lower realms are ended. like in a person that's birth, old age, illness and death. the earth also undergo birth, old age, illness and death, but we call it æˆ�ä½�å��ç©º. 20 years a person live in the birth stage, and another 20 for old age stage and another 20 for illness and finally another 20 for death stage. each 20 years belong to the middle end days. and the end of 1 year is the smaller end days. then we magnify that on earth, earth or the universe also have the 20+20+20+20 kalpas/age, but in a longer period.</p>
              <p>but even this greater "end days" on earth is microscopical, as there are countless universes/earth out there. all this are existence in play.  new universes are form and old ones die everyday. this is in line with science. Buddha already talk about it 2500-3000 years ago.</p>
              <p>macroscopical part is the talk on illusion of all this samsaric existence. Enlightenment is the "end days" of the entire samsaric existence. maybe we can say the return to .....</p>

              <p>1. Natural has the connotation of being inherent, not causal, etc. But yes, ignorance is conditioned, is dependent on conditions, and those causes and be removed. That is the purpose of the whole Buddhist path.<br><br>Here the sutta teaches:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.009.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.009.than.html</a></p>
              <h4>Ignorance</h4>
              <p>Saying "Good, friend," having delighted in and approved of Ven. Sariputta's words, the monks asked him a further question: "Would there be another line of reasoning by which a disciple of the noble ones is a person of right view... who has arrived at this true Dhamma?"</p>
              <p>"There would. When a disciple of the noble ones discerns ignorance, the origination of ignorance, the cessation of ignorance, and the way of practice leading to the cessation of ignorance, then he is a person of right view... who has arrived at this true Dhamma.</p>
              <p>"And what is ignorance? What is the origination of ignorance? What is the cessation of ignorance? What is the way of practice leading to the cessation of ignorance?</p>
              <p>"Any lack of knowledge with reference to stress, any lack of knowledge with reference to the origination of stress, any lack of knowledge with reference to the cessation of stress, any lack of knowledge with reference to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress. This is called ignorance.</p>
              <p>"From the origination of fermentation comes the origination of ignorance. From the cessation of fermentation comes the cessation of ignorance. And the way of practice leading to the cessation of ignorance is just this very noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>
              <p>"Now, when a disciple of the noble ones discerns ignorance, the origination of ignorance, the cessation of ignorance, and the way of practice leading to the cessation of ignorance in this way, when — having entirely abandoned passion-obsession, having abolished aversion-obsession, having uprooted the view-&amp;-conceit obsession 'I am'; having abandoned ignorance &amp; given rise to clear knowing — he has put an end to suffering &amp; stress right in the here-&amp;-now, it is to this extent, too, that a disciple of the noble ones is a person of right view... who has arrived at this true Dhamma."</p>
              <p><br><br><br>2. I would rather say that murder is causing harm and pain and suffering, and because nobody wishes to be killed, and because anyone with a kind heart would not wish anyone else to be killed, laws are enacted out of a compassionate, well wishing heart, or sometimes out of fear, etc. Laws are enacted on the basis of whether an action is unwholesome or wholesome...<br><br>3. Ignorance and suffering is not eternal - they are without beginning as a stream that arises and ceases and re-arises out of latent conditions again and again, but those causes and conditions can be treated and ended.<br><br>4. Yes. Just like you cannot escape the natural effects of cancer Only if you chain smoke (you cannot escape the effects of smoking), and the solution is just to stop or not start smoking, likewise you can avoid karma by no longer planting the seeds of karma. But karma can only truly be 'escaped' in liberation. The noble eightfold path is the way.<br><br>5. Yes. Buddha is very precise and teaches us the twelve links of dependent origination, both forward and reverse.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1. Natural has the element of being inherent? As in having inherent existence? I draw your attention again to the incoherence of contingent entities without end. In any case I would note that defining the lack of knowledge as the origin of ignorance is really not saying much, it is saying the samething.</p>
              <p>2. Murder certainly causes harm and suffering. The question is, why is it wrong to cause harm and suffering? Why should anyone be held punishable for murder if this is the natural law at work? We do not put a lion on trial for eating a deer.</p>
              <p>3. Again, without beginning is the same meaning as eternal.</p>
              <p>4. Is it humanly possible to adhere to the 8 fold path perfectly? I don't think so.</p>
              <p>5. 12 links of dependent origination as in <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot05.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot05.htm</a>  The Bible offers a different view. It was not lack of wisdom that resulted in suffering. It was lack of obedience. Perhaps an analogy might be children. Yes, they lack knowledge, but all they need to do is to listen and obey their parents and they will be safe. But the moment they disobey there will be adverse consequences.</p>

                                        of contingent entities without end. In any case I would note that
                                        defining the lack of knowledge as the origin of ignorance is really
                                        not saying much, it is saying the samething.</p>
              <p>2. Murder certainly causes harm and suffering. The question is,
                                        why is it wrong to cause harm and suffering? Why should anyone be
                                        held punishable for murder if this is the natural law at work? We
                                        do not put a lion on trial for eating a deer.</p>
              <p>3. Again, without beginning is the same meaning as eternal.</p>
              <p>4. Is it humanly possible to adhere to the 8 fold path
                                        perfectly? I don't think so.</p>
              <p>5. 12 links of dependent origination as in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot05.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot05.htm</a> 
                                        The Bible offers a different view. It was not lack of wisdom that
                                        resulted in suffering. It was lack of obedience. Perhaps an analogy
                                        might be children. Yes, they lack knowledge, but all they need to
                                        do is to listen and obey their parents and they will be safe. But
                                        the moment they disobey there will be adverse consequences.</p>

              <p>1. On the contrary, ignorance is defined very precisely there. Also it is clearly taught that ignorance depends on factors that has went on without beginning. If you read that page, it says fermentation is the origin of ignorance. Then there is another section which says ignorance is the origin of fermentation. So it's a cycle.<br><br>From that page:</p>
              <p><em>Second, Ven. Sariputta here continues the pattern of dependent 
                                        co-arising past ignorance — the usual endpoint — to look for its 
                                        origination, which is mental fermentation. Because these fermentations 
                                        in turn depend on ignorance, the discussion shows how ignorance tends to
                                         prompt more ignorance. But, as Ven. Sariputta has demonstrated 
                                        throughout his discussion, ignorance needn't keep propagating forever. 
                                        Because it is simply a lack of knowledge in terms of the four noble 
                                        truths, it can be replaced by knowledge that does look at things 
                                        in terms of the four noble truths — the framework derived from the 
                                        topics of skillful/unskillful and nutriment. When knowledge in terms of 
                                        this framework is applied at any point in the causal framework, the 
                                        entire framework dependent on ignorance can be brought to an end.</em></p>
              <p><br>2. Because we identify ourselves as human beings, that is why we find a need to protect our species, just like mothers find a need to protect her children (but not someone elses' children), out of well intentions for others or out of fear.<br><br>3. No... eternal means "without beginning AND end", "changeless" (dictionary). Furthermore, ignorance is arising and subsiding and re-arising moment by moment. It also has the characteristic of impermanence and ever-changingness. But its final end can come about in liberation.<br><br>4. The eightfold path is not about being a moral perfectionist (at least not at the beginning) and morality is not an ends in Buddhism. Morality is only one part - and its purpose is simply so that we are free from the guilt and other mental hindrances that prevent us from developing Samadhi (meditative concentration) and Insight (into the nature of things). The main practise to develope insight is Vipassana/Vipashyana practise. Many practitioners have become enlightened through this practise. There are thousands, tens of thousands of liberated practitioners in Buddha's times and countless till today. Even today people are getting enlightened.<br><br>And when you are enlightened, and liberated, then it is no longer matter of following rules because the root cause of unwholesome actions - passion, aggression and delusion is cut off. Like a root that is removed, the trees and branches no longer grow. We cut the problem at its roots and not the leaves - we purify our minds and not just practise "do good, avoid evil".<br><br>5. Yes I understand the Christian POV. This is another point along a long list where we differ.</p>

              <p>Abhidhamma in Buddhism is very scientific.</p>

              <p>Chapter 2</p>
              <h3><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">MATTER</span></h3>
              <p>As mentioned in previous chapter, the basic abstract elements or smallest matters (maha bhuta) in the cosmos are the following;</p>
              <p>Basic Abstract Elements Characteristics (1) Abstract earth <em>(pathavi)</em> To harden and to soften (2) Abstract water <em>(apo)</em> To flow and to paste (3) Abstract Air <em>(vayo)</em> To expand and to contract (4) Abstract heat <em>(tejo)</em> To heat and to cool.</p>
              <p><strong>These elements are also called units (kriya), because they exist by repetition of beats, about 176,470,000,000 times in a flash of lightning.</strong></p>
              <p>The atoms are not round in shape. They are feather-like as in <a id="c5start" rel="nofollow" name="c5start"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20050404163741/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/articles/cosmos3.htm#c5"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Chart 5B</span></span></a>. Although they can join together, but are never completely mixed up like water and milk, because each unit of abstract element maintains its identity by a tiny cushion of space or sky element (<em>akasa rupa</em>). The sky element within a substance or body is called atmosphere (<em>paricchedaskasa</em>) which maintains the same temperature throughout the three feature elements (birth, existence and death) of an abstract element. The section of the space between the planets and stars is called stratosphere (<em>ajatakasa</em>). In fact these two are one continuously stretching within substances and throughout the cosmos.</p>
              <p>.....</p>
              <p>Chapter 3</p>
              <h3><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">THE MIND</span></h3>
              <p><strong>The mind beats 3, 000, 000, 000, 000 times in a flash of lightning, about 17 times faster than the beats of matter.</strong> The time of a beat, although immeasurably fast, is standard and never varies and was therefore normally used by the Buddha. The mind, being very powerful, gathers the abstract matter to form the body, sustain and to build it bigger and stronger. All sentient beings have each a unit of mind. It can at any time be present at any part of the body, but not outside, except for the Buddhas and Arahants. The mind of a Buddha, being absolutely pure, omniscient and omnipotent, can appear anywhere and any time in the cosmos.</p>

              <p>to me mind and matter is already part of existence, no dilemma. just that mind "control" matter. in a sense, u can say it's "first".</p>
              <p>to me ur god-like "timeless/spaceless" are nothingness/nullism, as nothing is beyond everything.  that's my take on "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exist</span>-ence".  unless ur 'god' is nothingness or do not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exist</span>. we Buddhism can already talk of timeless/spaceless in this existence, like how Buddhas/bohisattvas can travel to anywhere in time or space, no need to go beyond. u want to talk about 'eternalism', u also talk within Existence. the creation myth also reminded me of å¥³å¨² Nüwa. the taodejing also talk of how the Oneness of Tao, created Yin and Yang and then 4 stems and then 8, 16, , 32, 64 and so on. Yin and Yang reminded me of Adam and Eve.</p>

              Suffering is more than just mental, I am sure you know that. Buddha suffered and died for a fact i.e. his suffering did not end. As to whether he could indeed have the ability to freely extend his life, this point is now moot since he died. I would have think his ability to overcome the effects of eating contaminated food or lived for a few decades or so would go a long way in perpetuating the truth of his teachings or at least demonstrate that suffering cannot hurt him.

              <p><br><br>The Buddha had enormous powers and that is why he could choose things like that. But powers does not equate to liberation or awakening, nor does awakening necessarily equate to having powers. Non-Buddhists also have powers. Those who mastered jhanas and samadhi can have powers. <br><br>Among the Buddha's powers are:<br><em><br> 1. The knowledge or ability of attaining insight (With this knowledge, He knows, “my
              body is material, made from four great elements, born of mother and father, fed on rice
              and gruel, impermanent, liable to be injured and abraded, broken and destroyed, and this
              is my consciousness which is bound to it and dependent on it.”), <br> 2. the knowledge of the production of a mind-made body, or the supernormal power of the
              mind-made body (With this knowledge, out of this body He produces another body, having a
              form, mind-made, complete in all its limbs and faculities.), <br> 3. the various supernormal powers (With the super-normal powers, being one, He becomes
              many, and being many, He becomes one; He appears and disappears; He passes through fences,
              walls, and mountains unhindered as if through air; He sinks into the ground and emerges
              from it as if it were water; He walks on the water <br> without breaking the surface as if on land; He flies cross-legged through the air like a
              bird with wings; He even touches and strokes with His hand the sun and moon, mighty and
              powerful as they are, and He travels in the body as far as the Brahma world.), <br> 4. the divine ear (With the divine ear, He hears sounds both divine and human, whether far
              or near.), <br> 5. the knowledge of others’ minds [understanding the ways of others’ thought]
              (With this knowledge, He knows and distinguishes with His mind the minds of other
              beings.), <br> 6. the knowledge of previous existences [the remembrance of one’s former states of
              existence] (With this knowledge, He remembers many previous existences: one birth, two
              births,. . . . a hundred thusand births etc.), <br> 7. the divine eye or the knowledge of the passing-away and arising of beings (With this
              divine eye, He sees beings passing-away and arising, inferior and superior, well-favored
              and ill-favored, to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them.), and <br> 8. the knowledge of eradicating defilements (With mind concentrated, purified and
              cleansed, unblemished, free from impurities, malleable, workable, established and having
              gained imperturability, He applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of eradicating
              defilements or destruction of corruptions. With this knowledge, He <br> knows as it really is: “This is suffering, the origing of suffering, the cessation of
              suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering.) <br> (Dighanikaya, Vol.1,Samathaphala Sutta) </em><br><br><br><br>* The Buddha taught that this is how liberated beings experience pain:<br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.006.nypo.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.006.nypo.html</a></p>
              <p>..."Having been touched by that painful feeling, he does not resist (and
                   resent) it. Hence, in him no underlying tendency of resistance against 
                  that painful feeling comes to underlie (his mind). Under the impact of 
                  that painful feeling he does not proceed to enjoy sensual happiness. And
                   why not? As a well-taught noble disciple he knows of an escape from 
                  painful feelings other than by enjoying sensual happiness. Then in him

                  In him who knows thus, no underlying tendency to ignorance as to neutral
                   feelings comes to underlie (his mind). When he experiences a pleasant 
                  feeling, a painful feeling or a neutral feeling, he feels it as one who

              <p>An arahant’s consciousness is not dependent (anissita) on any 
              findable support, and therefore, is untraceable (ananuvejja) here and 
              now. MN 22 AlagaddÅ«pama Sutta:</p>
              <blockquote>Monks, when the gods with Indra, with BrahmÄ� and with 
              PajÄ�pati seek a monk who is thus liberated in mind, they do not find 
              [anything of which they could say], “The tathÄ�gata’s consciousness is 
              dependent on this.” Why is that? A tathÄ�gata, I say, is untraceable even
               here and now.</blockquote>
              <p>Elsewhere this non-abiding mind is designated as consciousness which 
              is “not established” (appatiá¹­á¹­ha viññÄ�á¹‡a). SN 22.53 Upaya Sutta:</p>
              <blockquote>When that consciousness is not established, not increasing, 
              not concocting, it is liberated. Being liberated, it is steady. Being 
              steady, it is content. Being content, he is not excited. Unexcited, he 
              personally attains complete nibbÄ�na. He discerns that, ‘Birth is ended, 
              the holy life fulfilled, done is what had to be done, there is nothing 
              further here.’</blockquote>
              <p>Discerning that “birth is ended” is the gnosis of elimination 
              (khayeñÄ�á¹‡a) and discerning that “there is nothing further here” is the

              <p>Jesus was not an ordinary man who achieved some spiritual status. He was God who took the form of ordinary man. Jesus was 100% man and 100% God, though He set aside the full use of His divine faculties and limited Himself. But He suffered and died as a man, and rose from the dead on the third day, and ascended into heaven 40 days later before the eyes of His closest disciples.</p>

              <p>Excellent question! But you have jumped the gun. It doesn't make my statement a bias account. I did not say that it means similar beliefs claimed by Jesus are verified. There are many truth claims that cannot be verified. But all is not lost. Jesus told Nicodemus, ‘<span class="scripture">I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?</span>’ (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%203.12"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 3:12</span></span></a>).</p>
              <p>So if the Bible can be trusted on the many things that it claimed which have been verified by what can be known, then there are good reasons to trust the Bible in its heavenly claims.</p>
