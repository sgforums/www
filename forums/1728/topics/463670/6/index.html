              <p>1. If ignorance is beginningless, that means it is eternal. Why
              should this state be considered inferior to being enlightened since
              it preceded enlightenment?</p>
              <p>2. Your explanation for moral laws is flawed, especially when
              you try to base it on evolution. Again the same naturalistic
              fallacy is committed in your argument. In a survivial of the
              fittest environment, there is nothing to say that it is wrong to
              take from you by force if survival is the purpose. The best
              explanation would be that man is created as a moral being. Laws are
              necessary in a fallen world, and laws are to show that man has
              broken the law. Yes, kings and kingdoms have changed and toppled,
              but this only shows the sinful nature of man.</p>
              <p>3. Why do people wish to be free from suffering if ignorance has
              been the eternal condition? Apparently telling people that they
              have no real existence do not solve the problem. Buddha may have
              been enlightened but he still fell sick and died. In other words,
              he was still subject to death and suffering. Compare this with
              Christ, whom though He also suffered and died, rose physically from
              the dead to show His victory over death.</p>
              <p>4. Apart from there being a moral law to be accountable, why
              should anyone be held for an action that leads to unwholesome
              effects? And why do anything that goes against the ignorance state
              which is the primordial or beginingless state?</p>
              <p>5. Babies grow because, like all living things, they are
              designed to grow, unless they have some problems that inhibit
              growth. A Christian view of life is that while suffering and death
              exists in a fallen world, it is not the way things should be, thus
              it would be consistent to want to see the end of death and
              suffering. But in a natural law universe where things are just the
              way they are, why go against nature?</p>

              <p>1. Whether ignorance preceded enlightenment or not has nothing to do with 'inferiority' or 'superiority'. No ideas where you get that notion. Ignorance is not eternal because it arises due to causes and conditions (i.e. a previous instance of ignorance and defilements), and it can end through the Buddhist path. The mindstream (arising and ceasing and re-arising moment by moment according to causes and conditions) driven by ignorance however is beginningless - beginningless is not the same as eternal.<br><br>2. I didn't mention anything about survival of the fittest. But it is true that laws are enacted based on circumstances.<br><br>3. What has wishing to be free from suffering got anything to do with whether ignorance is beginningless? The fact is people wish to be free from suffering, that's all. And there's a way.<br><br>4. Karma is a natural law and nobody can escape from it even if it takes lifetimes to play out. Just like nobody can escape from cancer or at the very least negative health effects from chain smoking.<br><br>5. In Buddhism, there is no 'things are the way it should be'. There is no 'should' or 'should not'. It is just plain cause and effect - if you touch hot charcoal, there will be pain. And naturally you will want to avoid pain.</p>

              <p>1. I cannot speak for all Buddhists, and since evolution is a rather recent scientific study the Buddha was of course unable to comment on it. But I find it does not contradict the basis of Buddhism. The Buddha's job is just to teach us about suffering and the end of suffering, his job is not to teach us evolution or science of medicine or arts or mathematics or biology or chemistry or physics... these are worldly subjects that are best dealt by scientists. But we must never go against science as that would be denial of facts and reality.<br><br> As Dalai Lama says, “If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims.” <br><br>2. Press F5 on that page.</p>

              <p>fyi, what i am saying is, human came from ape is nonsensical.  to what i know from discover channel, science has not found the "missing link" between human and ape. i forgot the number, but how many millions/billions of years ago, human were already walking on two legs. and between the short interval time period, ape cannot possiblity "evolve" into human/<em style="font: inherit; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">homo sapiens</em><span style="line-height: 1.231;">, the time is too short. </span></p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2. If nothing exists then there is no change to talk about. To talk about the fact of change without addressing the existence of things on which change can work on is still an incomplete answer. Or perhaps it is an issue that is being sidestepped to avoid the conclusion that there is a Creator? It does not follow that if God exists then He must also be subject to change. Existence precedes change, but you have put it the other way round. Consider the belief in evolution. Why do evolution use the tactic of saying that abiogenesis is different from evolution? Only so because they can then ASSUME the existence of life, on which biological evolution (change) can logically and chronologically proceed.</span></p>

              <p>2. If there's absolutely nothing, then it should remain so. No change to speak of. No cause no conditions. Just nothing. Change is not necessarily a function of existence. It is not impossible that something can exists unchanged. In fact, change only applies to contingent beings/entities. Why should thinking be considered change?</p>
              <p>3. There's good change and bad change, so why should change be dissatisfaction?</p>

              <p>I truly agree with you that the notion of men evolving from apes(like) creatures is nonsense. Yet this is taught as fact in schools and in media.</p>
              <p>Yes, humans have morality but animals do not. This would be very consistent with the Bible's teaching that man is made in God's image.</p>
              <p>If humans can create AI or life, it only means that you need intelligence to get life, which again points to intelligent design, not pure natural causes.</p>

              <p>1. Whether ignorance preceded enlightenment or not has nothing to do with 'inferiority' or 'superiority'. No ideas where you get that notion. Ignorance is not eternal because it arises due to causes and conditions (i.e. a previous instance of ignorance and defilements), and it can end through the Buddhist path. The mindstream (arising and ceasing and re-arising moment by moment according to causes and conditions) driven by ignorance however is beginningless - beginningless is not the same as eternal.<br><br>2. I didn't mention anything about survival of the fittest. But it is true that laws are enacted based on circumstances.<br><br>3. What has wishing to be free from suffering got anything to do with whether ignorance is beginningless? The fact is people wish to be free from suffering, that's all. And there's a way.<br><br>4. Karma is a natural law and nobody can escape from it even if it takes lifetimes to play out. Just like nobody can escape from cancer or at the very least negative health effects from chain smoking.<br><br>5. In Buddhism, there is no 'things are the way it should be'. There is no 'should' or 'should not'. It is just plain cause and effect - if you touch hot charcoal, there will be pain. And naturally you will want to avoid pain.</p>

              <p>1. If ignorance has been the beginingless state of things, then wouldn't that be the natural state? What's the difference between the term beginingless and eternal? If ignorance arises due to conditions, then ignorance is contingent. But what is it contingent upon? And how can it be contingent yet eternal? <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beginningless">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beginningless</a></p>
              <p>2. Legal laws are enacted based on circumstances, but stll they are ultimately based on moral laws that are discovered. No human made the law that murder is wrong. No human decided for everyone else that murder is wrong. Murder is considered wrong every where.</p>
              <p>3. If ignorance has been the eternal state, then so has suffering. And since that is the natural law, why go against it?</p>
              <p>4. It is true that nobody can escape from natural laws. So is it impossible to escape from karma and be free of it?</p>
              <p>5. The idea of cause and effect is certainly not unique to Buddhism. Causes have effects, this is not disputed or denied at all. The question is whether adequate causes are identified for certain effects. For example, why do we feel pain? That's because we have nerve cells. Humans therefore are "hardwired" to feel pain and respond physically to external things that hurt us. What accounts for that? To say causes and conditions is not to say much.</p>

                      Buddhism. Causes have effects, this is not disputed or denied at
                      all. The question is whether adequate causes are identified for
                      certain effects. For example, why do we feel pain? That's because
                      we have nerve cells. Humans therefore are "hardwired" to feel pain
                      and respond physically to external things that hurt us. What
                      accounts for that? To say causes and conditions is not to say
                      much.</p>

              <p>1. Natural has the connotation of being inherent, not causal, etc. But yes, ignorance is conditioned, is dependent on conditions, and those causes and be removed. That is the purpose of the whole Buddhist path.<br><br>Here the sutta teaches:<br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.009.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.009.than.html</a></p>
              <h4>Ignorance</h4>
              <p>Saying "Good, friend," having delighted in and approved of Ven. 
                      Sariputta's words, the monks asked him a further question: "Would there 
                      be another line of reasoning by which a disciple of the noble ones is a 
                      person of right view... who has arrived at this true Dhamma?"</p>
              <p>"There would. When a disciple of the noble ones discerns ignorance, 
                      the origination of ignorance, the cessation of ignorance, and the way of
                       practice leading to the cessation of ignorance, then he is a person of 
                      right view... who has arrived at this true Dhamma.</p>
              <p>"And what is ignorance? What is the origination of ignorance? What is
                       the cessation of ignorance? What is the way of practice leading to the 
                      cessation of ignorance?</p>
              <p>"Any lack of knowledge with reference to stress, any lack of 
                      knowledge with reference to the origination of stress, any lack of 
                      knowledge with reference to the cessation of stress, any lack of 
                      knowledge with reference to the way of practice leading to the cessation
                       of stress. This is called ignorance.</p>
              <p>"From the origination of fermentation comes the origination of 
                      ignorance. From the cessation of fermentation comes the cessation of 
                      ignorance. And the way of practice leading to the cessation of ignorance
                       is just this very noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, 
                      right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right 
                      mindfulness, right concentration.</p>
              <p>"Now, when a disciple of the noble ones discerns ignorance, the 
                      origination of ignorance, the cessation of ignorance, and the way of 
                      practice leading to the cessation of ignorance in this way, when — 
                      having entirely abandoned passion-obsession, having abolished 
                      aversion-obsession, having uprooted the view-&amp;-conceit obsession 'I 
                      am'; having abandoned ignorance &amp; given rise to clear knowing — he 
                      has put an end to suffering &amp; stress right in the here-&amp;-now, it
                       is to this extent, too, that a disciple of the noble ones is a person 
                      of right view... who has arrived at this true Dhamma."</p>
              <p><br><br><br>2. I would rather say that murder is causing harm and pain and suffering, and because nobody wishes to be killed, and because anyone with a kind heart would not wish anyone else to be killed, laws are enacted out of a compassionate, well wishing heart, or sometimes out of fear, etc. Laws are enacted on the basis of whether an action is unwholesome or wholesome...<br><br>3. Ignorance and suffering is not eternal - they are without beginning as a stream that arises and ceases and re-arises out of latent conditions again and again, but those causes and conditions can be treated and ended.<br><br>4. Yes. Just like you cannot escape the natural effects of cancer Only if you chain smoke (you cannot escape the effects of smoking), and the solution is just to stop or not start smoking, likewise you can avoid karma by no longer planting the seeds of karma. But karma can only truly be 'escaped' in liberation. The noble eightfold path is the way.<br><br>5. Yes. Buddha is very precise and teaches us the twelve links of dependent origination, both forward and reverse.</p>

              <p>anyway, that in Buddhism, is only microscopical, we also have smaller or middle or greater "end days" on earth. greater "end days" is when hell, and the all lower realms are ended. like in a person that's birth, old age, illness and death. the earth also undergo birth, old age, illness and death, but we call it æˆ�ä½�å��ç©º. 20 years a person live in the birth stage, and another 20 for old age stage and another 20 for illness and finally another 20 for death stage. each 20 years belong to the middle end days. and the end of 1 year is the smaller end days. then we magnify that on earth, earth or the universe also have the 20+20+20+20 kalpas/age, but in a longer period.</p>
              <p>but even this greater "end days" on earth is microscopical, as there are countless universes/earth out there. all this are existence in play.  new universes are form and old ones die everyday. this is in line with science. Buddha already talk about it 2500-3000 years ago.</p>
              <p>macroscopical part is the talk on illusion of all this samsaric existence. Enlightenment is the "end days" of the entire samsaric existence. maybe we can say the return to .....</p>

              <p>your Counterfeit coins or genuine coins simile is a good one. but it's not about which is first or second. as there's no second at all.</p>
              <p>my simile is the moon reflected on the water. the moon in the water is just a reflection of the real moon. there's only One Real moon! the reflection is fake and illusive, yet it came from the moon. without the moon, there's no reflection.</p>
              <p>not knowing can have two meaning, in a higher understanding, it is to remain Stillness of thoughts, don't want to know any more and let it flow; the other as u are thinking is stupidity. not knowing although is cause for samsara, it's also a cause for enlightenment.</p>
              <p>yes, there's only the Moon(God/Truth for u to understand). the reflections or creations or error are fake/illusory. hence i mentioned, enlightenment is when the wave realised that its the ocean. alll return to the ocean, the moon.</p>

              <p>4. No, 'what is suffering' is simply saying 'who is suffering' in another way. My point is that there is no 'what' or 'who' behind suffering. When suffering arises, there is only suffering without sufferer. Since Buddha never said "You suffer" or "He suffer" or "I suffer" (other than as conventional speech) but "suffering arises", the correct question should be asked then: what is the causes and conditions in which suffering arises?<br><br>Everything arises through causes and conditions, without agency/controller/perceiver/experiencer.</p>
