              <p>Jesus was not an ordinary man who achieved some spiritual
              status. He was God who took the form of ordinary man. Jesus
              was 100% man and 100% God, though He set aside the full use of His
              divine faculties and limited Himself. But He suffered and died as a
              man, and rose from the dead on the third day, and ascended into
              heaven 40 days later before the eyes of His closest disciples.</p>

              that is also within ur context. so long got birth, grow older, and die, that to people is human. same as ur argument that Buddha, got birth, grow old and die is human to your view. u believe Jesus is god or father , we believe Buddha is teacher of gods, beyond human and god. hence i said the argument and excuse apply to both.

              <p>No, not at all.</p>
              <p>Unlike Buddha, Jesus NEVER denied His humanity. In fact, anyone reading the Gospels cannot fail to see that in all aspects Jesus was 100% man. He never denied He was human, but He never said He was just a mere man. He made claims to be God. He was God in human flesh.</p>

              <p>Well if Jesus was still alive, he would still be with us right now. The only thing saying that he resurrected is the bible. If Jesus could do it, why can't he do it for any of the Christians since his time. I have not heard of anybody who was resurrected from the dead except in zombie movies. Pardon my irreverence here. ; )</p>

              <p>Yes, Jesus is still with us, but not in the flesh, since He has ascended to heaven. He said to His disciples in Matthew after He rose from the dead and before ascending to heaven, "I will be with you always until the end of the age."</p>
              <p>Of course you have not heard of anyone who was resurrected, except Jesus. I am sure you heard of that, right? That's what Good Friday and Easter Sunday is all about. Zombie? Too much movies lah. Anyway, you need to understand what resurrection is. It is not resuscitation, nor is it zombie.</p>

              <p>I wanted to post the same thing <a href="http://nichiren.info/buddhism/lotussutra/text/chap16.html">http://nichiren.info/buddhism/lotussutra/text/chap16.html</a></p>
              <p>In my humble opinion, Gautama Buddha was in flesh until the end. The enlightenment referred to his mind. His mind became free and there was no need to find another host (rebirth) because he had successfully destroyed all his sankara through Vipassana meditation. Hence, it was his last rebirth. His human vessel would be subjected to human conditions, don't you think?</p>
              <p>Once he had reached enlightenment, he expounded many other ways to reach enlightenment as well eg Theravada, Mahayana, vajrayana, tantrayana, pure land etc.</p>
              <p>Also, Buddhists are not really concerned with creation etc. What difference would it make? During Buddha's time, when asked about creator etc, he remained silent. Our own liberation is through our own effort. We have to walk our own path. For example, someone shot you in the leg with a poison arrow, do you go running around looking for the accomplice or do you treat your wound?</p>
              <p>Metaphorically, suppose you are transported to an unknown forest. The Buddha cleared the walk path and showed the way. Bodhisattvas are our guides and assistance on standby along the path. The Dhama is like streetlight and runway lights lighting the way. Would it be beneficial to look for the person who transported you to the forest or walk the path and find the way out?</p>

              <p>I think the point I wanted to raise was just that suffering and death did not end for Buddha after his enlightenment. He also succumbed to that eventually, like every other person.</p>
              <p>Buddha's silence about the Creator does not render the subject irrelevant or not. It's like going into a cinema halfway through the screening. What difference does it make? Huge! You would be lost and confused, and you would prefer to know what happened at the beginning. You can of course be nonchalant about it and say "who cares?" but 10 other people may reply "We care even if you don't."</p>
              <p>In Australia, if you are bitten by a venomous spider, you would realise how important it is to who WHAT species of spider bit you. You would die soon if you just tell the doctor, "Why in the world you want to know what bit me? It's not important! Treat me now!" The doctor would show you 50 bottles of anti-venom, you want all 50 needles to puncture your backside in quick succession? Or just the right one given the right description of the spider that bit you?</p>
              <p>Buddha claimed to show the way. Jesus claimed "I Am the Way."</p>

              <p><strong>The origin of the joss paper<br></strong>In the olden days, the common people used hemp stalks as toilet paper while the rich used very rough paper. The rough paper resembles the present day's joss paper that is used as offering in the Seventh Lunar Month. But, it is clear that merits come from the sincerity of the heart and not the actual offering itself. Therefore, the burning of joss paper is a waste, a potential fire risk, and a source of environmental pollution.<br><br>Once, a man from Jiayi came to Hualien to see me. He told me, "Master, every year, I use to burn more than ten thousand dollars worth of joss papers." I asked, "Why would you do that?" He answered, "I fall ill often, and the mediums told me that I must burn joss paper to regain health."<br><br>Just a few days prior to his visit, he had burnt a full truck-load of joss paper, costing him NT$80,000. "Did you regain your health after that?" I asked him. "No, and I almost burnt myself due to the heat, and felt exhausted for the next three days. I did not feel any better. This is why my friend brought me here to seek your advice!"<br><br>Then I told him a story about burning joss paper as offering:<br><br>Once there was a couple who lived by selling paper. Business was not good, and there was a lot of stock. The wife thought of a scheme to sell the paper. Her husband pretended to die, and she cried loudly to attract the attention of her neighbours.<br><br>As people crowded into her house, she performed a ritual. She placed an iron bucket and started to burn bundles of paper in it as paper money for her 'deceased' husband to take along on his journey to the next world.<br><br>It was arranged that he would sit up in the coffin, and announce loudly: As my wife has burnt so much joss paper for me, I now have a light leading me back to the house. And the wife would exclaim in delight, "Hear what he said! Burning joss paper is like lighting up his path, and he has come back again." Naturally, the piled up stock was sold out in no time. The legend then spread and lived on to become a tradition and ritual until today.<br><br>Having understood the background of the tradition, we should think twice about continuing such practices. Is it worthwhile to waste money and resources that are not only potential fire hazards but also affect health and pollute the environment?<br><br>Lecture by Master Cheng Yen<br>Translated by Goh Hwe Yong</p>

              <p><br>but am sure got other cases.</p>
              <p>the point is resuscitation can be mistaken as "resurrection".</p>

                      irrelevant or not. It's like going into a cinema halfway through
                      the screening. What difference does it make? Huge! You would be
                      lost and confused, and you would prefer to know what happened at
                      the beginning. You can of course be nonchalant about it and say
                      "who cares?" but 10 other people may reply "We care even if you
                      don't."</span></p>

              <p>By "going into a cinema", I suppose you consciously make the decision to enter the cinema running halfway through, right? If you are the one making decision, why enter while halfway through? Why not watch another movie or come earlier or watch another day?</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In Australia, if you are bitten by a venomous spider, you would realise how important it is to who WHAT species of spider bit you. You would die soon if you just tell the doctor, "Why in the world you want to know what bit me? It's not important! Treat me now!" The doctor would show you 50 bottles of anti-venom, you want all 50 needles to puncture your backside in quick succession? Or just the right one given the right description of the spider that bit you?</span></p>

              <p>Err.. pretty obvious since we don't have better apparatus to identify the poison, right? What if the doctor is skillful and perhaps, he was bitten by the same spider? He is able to to identify the symptoms peculiar to this spider's venom and he is able to prescribe the anti-venom. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Now that the doctor has presribed the anti-venom, do you take it or do you go running looking for the spider and perhaps, ask why? </span></p>
              <p>What about the metaphor earlier? </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Metaphorically, suppose you are transported to an unknown forest. The Buddha cleared the walk path and showed the way. Bodhisattvas are our guides and assistance on standby along the path. The Dhama is like streetlight and runway lights lighting the way. Would it be beneficial to look for the person who transported you to the forest or walk the path and find the way out?"</span></p>

              <p>As per someone else's account. None of us were there. Buddhist teachings were officially written down 500 years later. I'm not sure about the rest but personally, I don't take everything literally. I'm more concerned about its essence, the main message of the teaching.</p>
