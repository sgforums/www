              i see a different in western religion from the eastern. like their mentality, they perfer to use reward and punishment. even when young, they use Santa Claus to lie to kids, so they can behave. when grow old already still use this kind of mentality. there's no Santa.

              <p>“Anyway, the Bible teaches that the wages of sin is death. Since the Bible teaches that life is in the blood (medical science knows this now), it therefore requires the shedding of blood (death) for the remission of sins. It is either your death, or someone else who can take your place.This sets the backdrop for the blood sacrifices. The Aztecs or Mayans form of religious and cultic human blood sacrifices are perversions of the Biblical notion of blood sacrifices.” Bro In Christ</p>
              <p>This is what I meant the notion of <span>MY SACRIFICE</span> or <span>MY CULTURE</span> is much better than yours is primitive in nature.</p>
              <p>In this globalization, we should open our heart to listen. In the narration, the lay person was not putting down on the missionary religion rather pointing out the very thing he hates about others people belief.</p>
              <p>Hence try reading stuff written by this John Shelby Spong, you will be surprise that some of the fundamental views held by the churches are questionable in nature. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://johnshelbyspong.com/">http://johnshelbyspong.com/</a></p>

              <p>1. Incorrect. It is not about my sacrifice/culture better than yours, but that there is a corruption in the understanding of the blood sacrifices. But why do you raise this point when Buddhists would also think that their way of salvation is better than others, at least that's what Buddha taught when he decided to reject Hinduism, right?</p>
              <p>2. Yes, we should listen to what others are saying, but that doesn't mean accepting what is being said as true. You haven't answered me about whether the narration was a true account or just a fiction. Anyway, like I said, if the missionary thinks that a blood sacrifice is demonic and thus doubts the Bible, I have my grave suspicion as to what kind of missionary he is. Doesn't he know anything about blood sacrifices in the OT and how God instituted it? Again he confuses the distortion with the genuine and threw out the baby with the bath water.</p>
              <p>3. Actually I would rather question Spong's views! I can understand why you would recommend Spong because he completely undermines the Christian faith and to you and most nonbelievers such would be deemed as highly commendable and "objective". But that's like asking you to listen to some Buddhist monk whose teachings are at odds with the mainstream teachings.</p>
              <p>4. Of course we should strive to exercise the mind and not be a blind follower. But one can be immature and be a crowd follower and still be in the right crowd, though he would find it difficult to defend his choice of following the crowd. Truth be told, there are blind and nominal followers in both Buddhism and Christianity.</p>
              <p>5. Correction, Jesus did not come to bring happiness to people around Him. In fact He taught that people would be scandalised because of Him! Families would be divided on account of Him. Abundant life is not about being happy from within.

              <p>1. Whether I jumped to conclusions about your engagement in ad hominem or not, your heart knows. I shall not press this further.</p>
              <p>2. Why do you say it doesn't matter whether it is true if the Buddha walked those steps at birth and uttered those words? If truth does not matter, then does it matter if what Buddha taught was true or not?</p>
              <p>3. The Bible does not record what Jesus did between 12 and 30, but there are clues which I have mentioned but again you overlooked. Jewish children take after the trade of their fathers. So Jesus was likely trained as a carpenter. He was also a regular face at the synagogue. The religious leaders also noted that Jesus was from Nazareth (not India). As to the Mormons, you must be very confused. Mormons do not believe that between 12-30 years of age Jesus went to America. Anyway what's your point? Jesus was a globetrotter?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">3. The Bible does not record what Jesus did between 12 and 30, but there are clues which I have mentioned but again you overlooked. Jewish children take after the trade of their fathers. So Jesus was likely trained as a carpenter. He was also a regular face at the synagogue. The religious leaders also noted that Jesus was from Nazareth (not India). As to the Mormons, you must be very confused. Mormons do not believe that between 12-30 years of age Jesus went to America. Anyway what's your point? Jesus was a globetrotter?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“but there are clues which I have mentioned but again you overlooked. Jewish children take after the trade of their fathers. So Jesus was likely trained as a carpenter.” -&gt; so, one is unsure and speculating, right? What led him to think he’s son of god? Or god himself? We know Buddha became Buddha through vipassana etc. Doesn’t sound like you when you are so adamant about origins and must know everything eg creator etc.  </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“The religious leaders also noted that Jesus was from Nazareth (not India)” -&gt; who said he’s from India? </p>

The point is to demonstrate different people have different theories and your views are right for you and may not for everyone else. </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">1. So you are saying that Mr Goenka has already been enlightened and attained Nirvana? That does not seem to be communicated at all.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">-&gt; broinchrist, did you read what I wrote? You said, “In other words, would you agree that since no one is born a Buddhist, and before one becomes a buddhist in life there would have been negative karma accumulated from young? Even then, after becoming a Buddhist it is unlikely that one will perfectly observe the 8 fold path. Naming the Buddha and his disciples are just 2500 years too far away. But if you know of someone who has perfectly observed it, out of countless many, I would be interested to know of such people currently living or in recent years.” </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Since, we have established that there is no such thing as “100% from birth to death” which sounds absurd to me, I said, “i think goenka does. so do many monks” in regards to 8 fold path. Kindly refrain from jumping into conclusions too hastily. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“So you are saying that Mr Goenka has already been enlightened and attained Nirvana? That does not seem to be communicated at all.” -&gt; even if they are or aren’t, so what? And how do you want them to communicate? Lit up fireworks? Advertise on billboards, tv commercial etc? </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">2. There is also no discrimination in Christianity. Anyone can become a Christian. But I think you may have confused the issue of what it means to be exclusive.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">-&gt; and? Oh right, only Christians go to heaven. I’d assume you know that one doesn’t need to have the Buddhist label to achieve enlightenment, right? Buddha was never a Buddhist. Unlike Christianity, we don’t worship the Buddha or Bodhisattva’s, we pay respect and homage and meditate on their qualities. When I see an image of Avalokitesvara Boddhisattva, the word compassion pops into my mind and the quality to help others.  You follow?</p>

              Bro in Christ said 
              <p>1. Incorrect. It is not about my sacrifice/culture better than
                  yours, but that there is a corruption in the understanding of the
                  blood sacrifices. But why do you raise this point when Buddhists
                  would also think that their way of salvation is better than others,
                  at least that's what Buddha taught when he decided to reject
                  Hinduism, right?</p>
              My reply
              
              I remember a Buddhist story on becoming a follower
                  Upali was one of the chief followers of the Jain master, Mahavira. Because of his intelligence, Upali often appeared in public debates on behalf of the Jains.
                   
                  There was one incident where Upali had a debate with the Buddha. At the end of the debate, Upali was so impressed with the Buddha's teachings that he asked to be the Enlightened One's follower. "Venerable Sir, please allow me to be your follower".
                   
                  To that, the Buddha answered, "Upali, you are at the height of your emotions. Go home and reconsider it carefully before you ask me again".
                   
                  Upali was extremely impressed, "If it was any other guru, he will parade a banner saying, 'Mahavira's chief lay-disciple has become my follower'. But you, Venerable Sir, you asked me to go home and reconsider. Now, I want to be your follower even more. I will not stand up until you accept me".
                   
                  Finally, the Buddha agreed to accept Upali, under one condition, "Upali, as a Jain, you have always given alms to Jain monks. When you become my follower, you will CONTINUE to give alms to Jain monks. This is my condition".
                   
                  Upali agreed to this condition. He later became one of the Buddha's chief disciples. Upali was known to be the one who compiled the Vinaya, the rules for monks.
                   
                  
              Bro in Christ said 
                  <p>2. Yes, we should listen to what others are saying, but that
                  doesn't mean accepting what is being said as true. You haven't
                  answered me about whether the narration was a true account or just
                  a fiction. Anyway, like I said, if the missionary thinks that a
                  blood sacrifice is demonic and thus doubts the Bible, I have my
                  grave suspicion as to what kind of missionary he is. Doesn't he
                  know anything about blood sacrifices in the OT and how God
                  instituted it? Again he confuses the distortion with the genuine
                  and threw out the baby with the bath water.</p>
                  
              My reply
                  O it will be great that you REREAD the story. In the story, the lay man doubt about the origin of Christian origin, not the missionary. Hence is pointless to elaborate the rest, went out of context. LOL
                  
              Bro in Christ said 
                  <p>3. Actually I would rather question Spong's views! I can
                  understand why you would recommend Spong because he completely
                  undermines the Christian faith and to you and most nonbelievers
                  such would be deemed as highly commendable and "objective". Butthat's like asking you to listen to some Buddhist monk whose
                  teachings are at odds with the mainstream teachings.</p>
                
              My reply
                  Do u know that Bishop Spong is a Theologian. A frequent university speaker with Yale, Harvard , Cambridge Theology department. Btw Episcopal Church is a MAINSTREAM CHRISTIAN denomination in America. Please read more about Christian Church history prior to putting down a good theologian. 
                  
                  
              Bro in Christ said 
                  <p>4. Of course we should strive to exercise the mind and not be a
                  blind follower. But one can be immature and be a crowd follower and
                  still be in the right crowd, though he would find it difficult to
                  defend his choice of following the crowd. Truth be told, there are
                  blind and nominal followers in both Buddhism and Christianity.</p>
               
              My reply
                  Are you? Frankly, a lot people in mega churches are just crowd follwer than thinker. They don't even digest and reflect what is share from puplit especially the prosperity gospel which is a waterdown gospel. 
                  
              Bro in Christ said 
                  <p>5. Correction, Jesus did not come to bring happiness to people
                  around Him. In fact He taught that people would be scandalised
                  because of Him! Families would be divided on account of Him.
                  Abundant life is not about being happy from within..</p>
              
              My reply
                  If Jesus did not come to bring peace to mankind, then we should throw those Christmas hymm  book away. I remember 3 month ago I was enjoying Hark! The herald angels sing,
                   â€œGlory to the newborn King;
                   Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
                   God and sinners reconciled!â€�
                  In the Catholic Christmas midnite mass. 
                  Here u r proclaiming Christ is NOT KEEN TO BRING happiness to mankind??? WEIRD mate.

              <p>3. The Bible does not record what Jesus did between 12 and 30, but there are clues which I have mentioned but again you overlooked. Jewish children take after the trade of their fathers. So Jesus was likely trained as a carpenter. He was also a regular face at the synagogue. The religious leaders also noted that Jesus was from Nazareth (not India). As to the Mormons, you must be very confused. Mormons do not believe that between 12-30 years of age Jesus went to America. Anyway what's your point? Jesus was a globetrotter?</p>
              <p>“but there are clues which I have mentioned but again you overlooked. Jewish children take after the trade of their fathers. So Jesus was likely trained as a carpenter.” -&gt; so, one is unsure and speculating, right? What led him to think he’s son of god? Or god himself? We know Buddha became Buddha through vipassana etc. Doesn’t sound like you when you are so adamant about origins and must know everything eg creator etc.  </p>
              <p>“The religious leaders also noted that Jesus was from Nazareth (not India)” -&gt; who said he’s from India? </p>
              <p>“As to the Mormons, you must be very confused. Mormons do not believe that between 12-30 years of age Jesus went to America. Anyway what's your point? Jesus was a globetrotter?” -&gt; oh right. They believe that jesus went to America after he died. The point is to demonstrate different people have different theories and your views are right for you and may not for everyone else. </p>

              <p>1. So you are saying that Mr Goenka has already been enlightened and attained Nirvana? That does not seem to be communicated at all.</p>
              <p>-&gt; broinchrist, did you read what I wrote? You said, “In other words, would you agree that since no one is born a Buddhist, and before one becomes a buddhist in life there would have been negative karma accumulated from young? Even then, after becoming a Buddhist it is unlikely that one will perfectly observe the 8 fold path. Naming the Buddha and his disciples are just 2500 years too far away. But if you know of someone who has perfectly observed it, out of countless many, I would be interested to know of such people currently living or in recent years.” </p>
              <p>Since, we have established that there is no such thing as “100% from birth to death” which sounds absurd to me, I said, “i think goenka does. so do many monks” in regards to 8 fold path. Kindly refrain from jumping into conclusions too hastily. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“So you are saying that Mr Goenka has already been enlightened and attained Nirvana? That does not seem to be communicated at all.” -&gt; even if they are or aren’t, so what? And how do you want them to communicate? Lit up fireworks? Advertise on billboards, tv commercial etc? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. There is also no discrimination in Christianity. Anyone can become a Christian. But I think you may have confused the issue of what it means to be exclusive.</p>
              <p>-&gt; and? Oh right, only Christians go to heaven. I’d assume you know that one doesn’t need to have the Buddhist label to achieve enlightenment, right? Buddha was never a Buddhist. Unlike Christianity, we don’t worship the Buddha or Bodhisattva’s, we pay respect and homage and meditate on their qualities. When I see an image of Avalokitesvara Boddhisattva, the word compassion pops into my mind and the quality to help others.  You follow?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“I believe Buddha went about and taught others that he was awakened, enlightened? Else how could he have claimed to know the way out?” -&gt; and? What are you trying to refer to?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“My point about asking for people you know, is also that I can understand how such people are in real life. Do they have loved ones? Are they attached to anything? Do they have desires in life, like hungry for food or like to watch movies? Or are they just like any other normal good person?” -&gt; and? What good does it serve you? For your mind satisfaction and mind orgasm? It's like as though I'm a fan of the British royal family and I want to know everything about them like what they eat, drink clothes etc. What good is it? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Hmm...so you blamed the Gospel for killing off cultures around the world? Interesting. Some facts please?” -&gt; are you for real again, broinchrist? Ok. Let me try another approach so that you may not feel too emotional and think it’s ad hominem.</p>
              <p>What do you think? Is it the gold’s fault that people are killed? Is it the diamond’s fault that people are killed? What do you think, broinchrist? Does gospel advocate killing or fanatics thinking “thou shalt have no other gods” applies to everyone just because it is true to them? Also, please do your research on mayans and the burning of their books during Spanish inquisition, perish of paganism in Europe etc. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"As to witchcraft and salem. Pray tell what do you REALLY know about it? Or are you simply based on hearsay? See http://thetruthofthesalemwitchtrials.blogspot.sg/ in case you end up in being unfair and prejudiced towards Christianity."</p>
              <p>-&gt; oh right. That one resource which resembles a  homework blog concludes everything? Are you for real again, broinchrist? How about you try googling “salem witch trials Christianity” </p>
              <p>Here is one of many sites you can refer to.  http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/brief-salem.html</p>

              <p>1. You don't think your way of salvation is better than others? Now that's a very strange statement you made. And I wasn't even talking about labels. I am asking whether you believe Buddhism is exclusively true. Is the Middle Way the ONLY way?</p>
              <p>2. Figures of speech and metaphors are understood. So are you saying that Buddha's baby steps and speaking those words were NOT literally true i.e. did not happen in fact? Your not witnessing it is irrelevant to whether it happened or not.</p>
              <p>3. That entire "Do not believe anything...." text? I take issue with the part that says "But, whatever, after thorough investigation and reflection, you find to agree with reason and experience, as conducive to the good and benefit of one and all and of the world at large, accept only that as true, and shape your life in accordance with it." It simply say the same thing in a different way! It say you should accept as true anything that agrees with your own reason and experience. Conducive to good and benefit of one and all? What is conducive? Again it has to agree with your reason and experience. Basically it means to accept as true what you accept as true. Why? Because the final arbiter of truth is no other than yourself! But our reasoning is not infallible.</p>
              <p>4. There are better grounds to conclude that Jesus was in the land of Israel than the baseless speculation that He went to India or the Americas between 12-30 years of age. Jesus never doubted His own divinity. The Scriptures teach that Jesus was always aware of His own deity. It did not occur to Him that He was the Son of God. BTW, there's nothing wrong with being adamant about the issue of origins. You are just as adamant about it as me.</p>
              <p>5. Re the point about Jesus going to America. Since you are wrong about the Mormons' beliefs, it proves that it is false to think that conflicting and contradictory views can be a matter of what's right for you is just for you.</p>
              <p>6. Basically you are conceding that there is no good basis to think that Mr Goenka is enlightened or has attained Nirvana. We can leave it as that.</p>
              <p>7. Perhaps you did not know that the earliest believers were only called Christians some years after Jesus went to heaven? That was in Antioch, Acts 11. So one need not be called a Christian to be a follower of Christ. That was so in the earliest years. But then again, there's nothing wrong with being called that now.</p>
              <p>8. If a person who supposedly attained Nirvana is not any different from a person who has not i.e. he still have emotions and affections, he falls sick and can suffer and die, then how do you tell the diff?</p>

              <p>10. So the Smithsonian website concludes everything but not the website I linked? Genetic fallacy on your part here. Anyway the point is, what do you intend to prove with the Salem Witch Trials? That millions of innocent people died? Or perhaps only a number of people died? And that it had really nothing to do with the Bible at all but that some people acted on their fears and it was a trial gone wrong? Many people like to throw up things like Crusades or Inquisition or Salem as mere smoke screens and red herrings. These things, tragic as they are, do not reflect Christian teachings.</p>

              <p>Bro in Christ said</p>
              <p>1. Incorrect. It is not about my sacrifice/culture better than yours, but that there is a corruption in the understanding of the blood sacrifices. But why do you raise this point when Buddhists would also think that their way of salvation is better than others, at least that's what Buddha taught when he decided to reject Hinduism, right?</p>
              <p>My reply I remember a Buddhist story on becoming a follower Upali was one of the chief followers of the Jain master, Mahavira. Because of his intelligence, Upali often appeared in public debates on behalf of the Jains. There was one incident where Upali had a debate with the Buddha. At the end of the debate, Upali was so impressed with the Buddha's teachings that he asked to be the Enlightened One's follower. "Venerable Sir, please allow me to be your follower". To that, the Buddha answered, "Upali, you are at the height of your emotions. Go home and reconsider it carefully before you ask me again". Upali was extremely impressed, "If it was any other guru, he will parade a banner saying, 'Mahavira's chief lay-disciple has become my follower'. But you, Venerable Sir, you asked me to go home and reconsider. Now, I want to be your follower even more. I will not stand up until you accept me". Finally, the Buddha agreed to accept Upali, under one condition, "Upali, as a Jain, you have always given alms to Jain monks. When you become my follower, you will CONTINUE to give alms to Jain monks. This is my condition". Upali agreed to this condition. He later became one of the Buddha's chief disciples. Upali was known to be the one who compiled the Vinaya, the rules for monks. Bro in Christ said</p>
              <p>2. Yes, we should listen to what others are saying, but that doesn't mean accepting what is being said as true. You haven't answered me about whether the narration was a true account or just a fiction. Anyway, like I said, if the missionary thinks that a blood sacrifice is demonic and thus doubts the Bible, I have my grave suspicion as to what kind of missionary he is. Doesn't he know anything about blood sacrifices in the OT and how God instituted it? Again he confuses the distortion with the genuine and threw out the baby with the bath water.</p>
              <p>My reply O it will be great that you REREAD the story. In the story, the lay man doubt about the origin of Christian origin, not the missionary. Hence is pointless to elaborate the rest, went out of context. LOL Bro in Christ said</p>
              <p>3. Actually I would rather question Spong's views! I can understand why you would recommend Spong because he completely undermines the Christian faith and to you and most nonbelievers such would be deemed as highly commendable and "objective". Butthat's like asking you to listen to some Buddhist monk whose teachings are at odds with the mainstream teachings.</p>
              <p>My reply Do u know that Bishop Spong is a Theologian. A frequent university speaker with Yale, Harvard , Cambridge Theology department. Btw Episcopal Church is a MAINSTREAM CHRISTIAN denomination in America. Please read more about Christian Church history prior to putting down a good theologian. Bro in Christ said</p>
              <p>4. Of course we should strive to exercise the mind and not be a blind follower. But one can be immature and be a crowd follower and still be in the right crowd, though he would find it difficult to defend his choice of following the crowd. Truth be told, there are blind and nominal followers in both Buddhism and Christianity.</p>
              <p>My reply Are you? Frankly, a lot people in mega churches are just crowd follwer than thinker. They don't even digest and reflect what is share from puplit especially the prosperity gospel which is a waterdown gospel. Bro in Christ said</p>
              <p>5. Correction, Jesus did not come to bring happiness to people around Him. In fact He taught that people would be scandalised because of Him! Families would be divided on account of Him. Abundant life is not about being happy from within..</p>
              <p>My reply If Jesus did not come to bring peace to mankind, then we should throw those Christmas hymm book away. I remember 3 month ago I was enjoying Hark! The herald angels sing, “Glory to the newborn King; Peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled!” In the Catholic Christmas midnite mass. Here u r proclaiming Christ is NOT KEEN TO BRING happiness to mankind??? WEIRD mate.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1. That Buddha wanted Upali to continue to give alms to Jain monks would be similar to Christians continuing to support the Jews in Israel. This does not amount to denying that Jesus is still the only way to God.</p>
              <p>2. Re the lay man, you are right. It was my mistake. But then again, the Missionary should have clarified the error in the thinking of the layman.</p>
              <p>3. I know that Spong is a Liberal Theologian who has denied central doctrines of the Christian faith, I would even say he is NOT a true Christian. So what if he is in the mainstream denomination and wore clerical robes though retired now? The Bible warns about wolves in sheep clothing. People like Spong are a dangerous horde. He denies the virgin birth and the bodily resurrection, which attacks the Person and finished work of Christ. Please familiar yourself with what he promotes here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Shelby_Spong">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Shelby_Spong</a> </p>
              <p>4. I do not belong to a mega-church nor am I a believer in the Prosperity Gospel. So I do not call myself a crowd follower in that sense.</p>
              <p>5. You should read the Bible some time. Jesus said He did not come to bring peace but division. People will be divided because of Him. Yet He also came to bring peace. Your problem is that you failed to discern what kind of peace Jesus came to bring. So before you throw away any Christian hymn book you should check yourself to see if you have misunderstood anything. Always be fair and objective and not act out of bias and prejudice.</p>

              <div>1. You don't think your way of salvation is better than others? Now that's a very strange statement you made. And I wasn't even talking about labels. I am asking whether you believe Buddhism is exclusively true. Is the Middle Way the ONLY way?</div>
              <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; strange? Why do you think it's strange?</div>
              <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ' am asking whether you believe Buddhism is exclusively true' -&gt; I think Buddhism is true. Exclusively? Haven't thought much about exclusive. Hmm.. We don't use some of the terminology that you use. Jesus said, 'love neighbor like yourself', from that people treat others good.  The actions of treating others well and benefitting others well create good karma. Hmm I really don't know what to say to 'exclusive'</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>2. Figures of speech and metaphors are understood. So are you saying that Buddha's baby steps and speaking those words were NOT literally true i.e. did not happen in fact? Your not witnessing it is irrelevant to whether it happened or not.</div>
              <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LOL!!! Whether it happened or not, so, what?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>3. That entire "Do not believe anything...." text? I take issue with the part that says "But, whatever, after thorough investigation and reflection, you find to agree with reason and experience, as conducive to the good and benefit of one and all and of the world at large, accept only that as true, and shape your life in accordance with it." It simply say the same thing in a different way! It say you should accept as true anything that agrees with your own reason and experience. Conducive to good and benefit of one and all? What is conducive? Again it has to agree with your reason and experience. Basically it means to accept as true what you accept as true. Why? Because the final arbiter of truth is no other than yourself! But our reasoning is not infallible.</div>

              <p>9. So long as you agree that the Gospel does not teach certain things you accused the followers of doing, that is already a good distinction made. Just be careful in future how you word your accusation or reason for rejecting Christianity. It is not more valid than it is for me to say I reject Buddhism because you did not behave like a good Buddhist should.</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “Just be careful in future how you word your accusation or reason for rejecting Christianity.” -&gt; don’t have to. Just let historical events speak. Don’t you think?</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “It is not more valid than it is for me to say I reject Buddhism because you did not behave like a good Buddhist should.” -&gt; LOL!!! How should a Buddhist behave? And should anyone conform to your expectations in the first place? LOL!! </p>

              <p>It seems that you are deliberately playing daft here. If not everything is true for everyone is itself a true statement, then on what objective basis do you say it is true that not everything is true for everyone? It can actually be false, true or not? It's not that I cannot read between the lines, but that your notion of truth is false at worst and flawed at best.</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “It seems that you are deliberately playing daft here.” -&gt; funny. I thought it was you. even after so many many many replies, you still don't get it. what's true for you is for you and may or may not be for others, too. you really don't get it or you're messing around?</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “If not everything is true for everyone is itself a true statement, then on what objective basis do you say it is true that not everything is true for everyone?” -&gt; dark grey is the best colour in the world. Is it true for you also?</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “It's not that I cannot read between the lines, but that your notion of truth is false at worst and flawed at best.” -&gt; are you trying to crack me up again with your self-endorsed authority on what’s false, worst and flawed? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A person with a twisted sense of humour can find the most serious thing as a joke, in the same way that a person with a warped sense of logic can see truth as relative. Yet such a person believe that "truth is relative" is absolutely true! If you still cannot see the self-refuting nature of relativism, then perhaps you may wish to stand on the MRT tracks during peak hours and say "well, the belief that the train will come and knock you down is true for you but not for me."</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “A person with a twisted sense of humour can find the most serious thing as a joke” -&gt; "twisted sense of humour" such as? And what’s “the most serious thing”?</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “then perhaps you may wish to stand on the MRT tracks during peak hours and say "well, the belief that the train will come and knock you down is true for you but not for me." -&gt; you have unwholesome wish for another? This is terrible. This is the “twisted humour” you mentioned earlier? Quite twisted, indeed! I suggest you see a REAL specialist. Try to experience the real world. It’s not that “hellish place”.</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “"well, the belief that the train will come and knock you down is true for you but not for me." -&gt; aiyo. Are you for real or are you trying to crack me up? what do you think? Will the train knock one down or not? </p>

              <p>Looking back at our exchanges It seems to me that you are unable to articulate any rational defense of Buddhism, except to vary your answers along the same self-refuting and self-defeating slogan of "what's true for you is true for you but not for me" which is intended to be conversation-stopper.</p>
              <p>What's even worst is that you can't see how the slogan is nonsensical and self-defeating since you are expecting me to agree with you that the slogan is true for me as well as it is for you which renders the slogan false. If it is true then it is false! Or is that slogan just true for you??? Why should it apply to me?</p>
              <p>You thus fail to see that statements like “That’s true for you, but not for me” are not only self-contradictory but guilty of the self-excepting fallacy. You cannot even be consistent on applying it to yourself.</p>
