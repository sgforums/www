              <p>Dear All ,</p>
              <p>I would like to seek your opinion on the above topic as it is greatly troubling to me.</p>
              <p>In many religions around the world, there have been practices where animal or human victims have been murdered on the altar in the belief that it will bring blessings.</p>
              <p>I am deeply disturbed by all these. Perhaps anyone can kindly share his buddhist beliefs on the topic of blood sacrifice.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Here's my thoughts, though this is not sharing from Buddhist beliefs.</p>
              <p>I believe there is this universal belief all over the world throughout human history that mankind have angered the gods and that sacrifices are needed to placate their wrath. But where does this idea comes from? Do people just make up this idea that somehow is universal in scope? What can explain this?</p>
              <p>I believe there is a kernel of truth running though this idea, and that the Bible explains this very well. The Bible teaches that man sinned against God and a blood sacrifice was required for the atonement of sins. At the tower of Babel, God scattered the human population by changing their languages. And as each language group scattered all over the world they retained this belief of blood sacrifice for the remission of sins. But over time more is being embellished, but I believe the Bible contains the true account of its origins.</p>

              <p>Allow me to share from a Christian perspective.</p>
              <p>The Bible teaches that in the beginning God made us all vegetarians. Every green plant was for food. Plants and trees are not "living" in the Biblical sense, as distinct from the biological sense. They are not called "nephesh chayah". So humans and animals eating plants and fruits would not be guilty of anything or killing anything. Anyway, it was only because of man's sin that death i.e. of humans and animals which are called "nephesh chayah" entered the world at the time of the Fall. And it was only after Noah's Flood that God permitted humans the eating of animal meat, which would make sense since there won't be time for agriculture after they left the Ark.</p>
              <p>BTW, Jesus ate meat too : )</p>

              <p>Negative and Positive karma is accumulated not in the action but the underlying motivation behind the action. Someone could be eating because he have to be a useful member of society by doing charity, then eating becomes good karma.

              <p>Whether there is karma in eating meat or not (I shall not go into that), one should also be aware that 1) not only the Buddha ate meat that is 'pure' - i.e. meat that is not seen, heard, or suspected (to be killed for him/her), is pure - but, 2) he allowed all his monks to eat 'pure meat' regardless of whether they are ordinary unenlightened monks or they are arahants - and his monks in the early sangha do in fact, eat meat, and the Theravada tradition follows the early sangha up till today*, 3) when Devadatta demanded Buddha to implement strict vegetarianism the Buddha declined. 4) millions of animals and insects are killed by pesticides and harvesters in the cultivation of plant-based food as well. There is no way we can avoid indirectly causing the death of animals regardless of the food we choose to eat.<br><br><br>So if we are too insistent on vegetarianism, we are in fact, becoming like Devadatta ourselves. Of course, vegetarianism is also a good way to cultivate compassion, yet it should never become insisted as a requirement to become a Buddhist (not saying you are at fault here). Some may argue it is important for a Bodhisattva practitioner but I digress.<br><br><br>*<span style="font-style: italic;">Devadatta next plots discord among the 
                                      monks by proposing that the Buddha mandate five austere disciplines for 
                                      all recluses. These five are as follows:<br><br>1. forest dwelling<br>2. alms begging<br>3. the wearing of only refuse-rag robes<br>4. living at the foot of a tree<br>5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">not eating meat or fish</span></span><br><br>All of these disciplines, Devadatta suggests, should be followed “for as long as<br>life lasts.” <br><br>The Buddha’s response is again sharp:<br><br>Enough, Devadatta. . . . Whoever wishes, let him be a forest-dweller;<br>whoever wishes, let him stay in the neighbourhood of a village; whoever<br>wishes, let him be a beggar for alms; whoever wishes, let him accept an invitation;<br>whoever wishes, let him be a rag-robe wearer; whoever wishes,<br>let him accept a householder’s robes. For eight months, Devadatta, lodging<br>at the root of a tree is permitted by me. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fish and flesh are pure in respect<br>of three points: if they are not seen, heard or suspected (to have<br>been killed on purpose for him</span></span>)</span><br><br> -  Daniel Boucher - Bodhisattvas of the Forest and the Formation of the Mahâyâna<br><br><br>Elsewhereï¼Œthe Buddha said:<br><br>... meat should not be eaten under three circumstances: when it is seen 
                                      or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely 
                                      slaughtered for the eater); these, Jivaka, are the three circumstances 
                                      in which meat should not be eaten, Jivaka! I declare there are three 
                                      circumstances in which meat can be eaten: when it is not seen or heard 
                                      or suspected (that a living being has not been purposely slaughtered for
                                       the eater); Jivaka, I say these are the three circumstances in which 
                                      meat can be eaten. —<strong>Jivaka Sutta</strong>, MN 55</p>
              <p>Furthermore, in the Amagandha Sutta in the Sutta Nipata, a vegetarian Brahmin confronts <a title="Kassapa Buddha" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassapa_Buddha">Kassapa Buddha</a> (a previous Buddha before Gautama Buddha) in regard to the evil of 
                                      eating meat. The Buddha countered the argument by listing acts which 
                                      cause real moral defilement and then at the end of the verse, he 
                                      emphasized that the consumption of meat is not equivalent to those acts.
                                       ("... this is the stench giving defilement, not the consumption of 
                                      meat").</p>
              <dl><dd>"[t]aking life, beating, wounding, binding, stealing, lying, 
                                      deceiving, worthless knowledge, adultery; this is stench. Not the eating
                                       of meat." (<strong>Amagandha Sutta</strong>).<br><br></dd></dl>
              <p>........<br><br><br>Loppon Namdrol/Malcolm Smith:<br><br><br>The argument is, and it is the Buddha's argument, recall, that meat 
                                      that was not slaughtered for you specifically, that you have not seen 
                                      slaughtered, and did not request slaughtered is pure. In case someone 
                                      feels this is merely a HinayÄ�na argument, let me also remind you that 
                                      the Madhyamaka author Bhavaviveka also follows the same argument. 
                                      Shantideva of course is well known for arguing against meat eating. <br><br>While
                                       it is true that the lower tantras instruct us that to be vegetarian -- 
                                      tantras like Hevajra instruct us in the opposite fashion. <br><br>So, again, it all depends on what you personally want to practice. <br><br>I
                                       am a Dzogchen Community practitioner, therefore I practice according to
                                       that tradition. I believe that refusing to eat meat is a refusal to 
                                      extend one's compassion. <br><br>In the end, we are all food. Get used to it. <br><br>N</p>

              <p>Sorry if I have offended you in some way. But this is a genuine question I am asking. According to some here, you can accumulate positive and negative karma, then it would not be unreasonable to ask who or what is keeping the "score" and how each person would know where he stands. I don't profess to know heaps about Buddhism, so I am open to being corrected.</p>

              <p>Karma is not a score card. Karma literally means actions and each action we do leaves an indelible mark in our mind. It reinforces our mind either towards selflessness - the concern for others or selfishness, which is the concern for only ourselves. In Buddhism, when we are overly selfish, we create problems for ourselves and we becoming increasingly unhappy. People who are happiest is usually people who are more selfless or those that have others as their concern. So any action leading to either states of mind determines whether it is positive or negative. In the end of the day, karma is registered within the deepest levels of our mind and from this part of our mind, karma will reappear to us as 'fruits' of actions. </p>
              <p>Since it is stored within us, that's why we have people with various talents and mental dispositions right from the moment of our births. If karma and retribution was in the hands of God, then God is really biased and unfair and this is totally opposite of how Christians describe him. Why are some people born mute, impaired or left to suffer in diseased and war torn countries while others are born rich and living comfortably in Singapore? </p>

              <p>The Bible teaches that we reap what we sow. But this is not to be confused with the doctrine of karma. The Bible also teaches that we should be selfless, again not to be confused with the notion that there is no self. You can't be selfish if there is no self to talk about. Since karma can be positive and negative, why would it not be possible to know where you stand on this karmic register? How much merits must one accumulate to escape samsara? You can't see how far you have gone if you can't look back and see where you have been or take stock of present position.</p>
              <p>The idea of karma is foreign to the Bible. The fact of death and suffering is explained in the Bble, it is because we live in a fallen world. There are people born deaf and blind which Jesus healed. But there will come a time when all is restored. Have you read about the man with no limbs? Why is he also happy? See <a href="http://www.lifewithoutlimbs.org/about-nick/">http://www.lifewithoutlimbs.org/about-nick/</a></p>
              <p>When we see the world through Biblical lens we come away with a completely new outlook. We understand why the world is the way it is, and we look forward to a new heavens and a new earth.</p>

              <p>In Christianity, "reaping and sowing" has both a natural order meaning and a moral order meaning. In a natural order meaning, it means the laws of nature applies. If you jump off the cliff without parachute, you reap the consequences of a splattered body at the base. In a moral order meaning, it means if you do wrong then you must face the moral (and legal) consequences that come with it. It also means that only moral agents can enforce a moral law. God is a moral being, and thus created humans as moral beings too. Thus God's moral standards apply, He tells us what is right and wrong. He is the absolute moral standard. And He judges rightly in accordance to His holy and just character.</p>
              <p>This is different from Buddhism where Karma is a natural law, inanimate. Is it then a moral law? But how is morality enforced by something that is itself just natural law, like the law of gravity? A moral Person can judge right and wrong, how does a natural law make that judgement?</p>

              <p>In Christianity, "reaping and sowing" has both a natural order
                      meaning and a moral order meaning. In a natural order meaning, it
                      means the laws of nature applies. If you jump off the cliff without
                      parachute, you reap the consequences of a splattered body at the
                      base. In a moral order meaning, it means if you do wrong then you
                      must face the moral (and legal) consequences that come with it. It
                      also means that only moral agents can enforce a moral law. God is a
                      moral being, and thus created humans as moral beings too. Thus
                      God's moral standards apply, He tells us what is right and wrong.
                      He is the absolute moral standard. And He judges rightly in
                      accordance to His holy and just character.</p>
              <p>This is different from Buddhism where Karma is a natural
                      law, inanimate. Is it then a moral law? But how is morality
                      enforced by something that is itself just natural law, like the law
                      of gravity? A moral Person can judge right and wrong, how does a
                      natural law make that judgement?</p>

              <p>Buddhist karma is not so much about 'right' and 'wrong'. It is more about wholesome and unwholesome actions. No judge is involved.<br><br>For example, a seed of hatred etched deep in one's mind will eventually grow into a fruit, a result, and that karmic result must naturally correspond to that seed or karmic cause, which is why those who are always killing other beings are going to be reborn in a place of suffering such as hell.

              <p>Then in Buddhist thought do you call something e.g. rape, murder, adultery, wrong or merely unwholesome? And who/what decides what is wholesome or unwholesome?

              <p>You can judge it to be 'wrong', I wouldn't have problem with that. But karma in and of itself isn't about 'wrong' or 'right'... karma is either wholesome, unwholesome, and pure [i.e. actions not done out of craving, aggression and delusion].<br><br>With regards to karma, nobody decides something to be wholesome or unwholesome just like nobody decides something to be black or white... what is black is seen to be black by a discerning eye, and a black seed seen plainly in sight produces a black result, while a white seed produces a white result... just like a black animal produces a black offspring and a white animal produces a white offspring. A chinese man produces a chinese offspring, a western man produces a western offspring [lets not talk about mix blood]. You don't need to "judge" if someone is a chinese, i.e. his skin colour is already plain in sight for you to see, and if you have the intelligence to discern. Seeing is enough, no need for judgement. Same goes for karma.<br><br>When the Buddha calls it 'wholesome' or 'unwholesome' he is not making a judgement on things, he is simply <em>describing </em>the action and its results. What is wholesome produces states of well being, happiness, freedom from suffering and afflictions. What is unwholesome is... well... the opposite of that. <br><br>For example smoking two packs of cigarettes a day is certainly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unwholesome </span>because it does damage to one's body. You don't get cancer because of someone's judgement that it is 'evil' and 'wrong', you get cancer because smoking is unwholesome, it causes addiction and the tars accumulate and cause cancer. We don't say smoking is 'evil' or 'wrong' - well, you are certainly entitled to your own opinion, but regardless of your opinion whether it is 'right' or 'wrong' - it is a fact that smoking is 'unwholesome', so karma is non-judgemental in that sense yet can be catergorized as wholesome/unwholesome with its corresponding effects:<br><em><br></em></p>
