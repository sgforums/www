              <p>1. Thank you for clarifying that in Buddhism there is no problem
                      of evil because there is no such thing as evil, or good for that
                      matter.</p>
              <p>2. Yes, it is only in Christianity there there is a "problem" of
                      evil. But it is not a problem at all because it FAILS to be an
                      argument against the existence of God, since it can only be raised
                      in a theistic context.</p>
              <p>3. Your analogy of the person with burning clothes is a good
                      one. In the Letter of Jude, the apostle encourages the Christian to
                      save others by snatching them from the fire, referring to the need
                      to preach the Gospel. All of us are in danger of hell fire, our
                      lives are burning, so to speak. Only a fireman can save us, and
                      this fireman is Christ who came through the fires to take us out.
                      Perhaps I am wrong, but wouldn't Buddhism be saying that the one on
                      fire try to save himself or die trying?</p>
              <p>4. People see the problem of evil as a problem because they are
                      entertaining wrong views of God or have failed to think clearly
                      about what they are demanding. The question is not about God's
                      ability, because God can surely stop evil right now. But have you
                      thought deeply about what that would mean if God should decide to
                      stop evil now? What outcome would most of us have when we face
                      God in judgment? Consider the parable about the wheat and the
                      tares. The enemy planted the tares which grew with the wheat. The
                      solution is not to go in and destroy the tares, for you would also
                      destroy the wheat. The solution would be to wait for harvest, and
                      when that comes you can easily separate the wheat from the tares,
                      and gather the tares for burning.</p>

              <p>1. Yes there is no problem of evil in Buddhism, but we see suffering everywhere. Suffering, unwholesome action and unwholesome results driven by passion, aggression and delusion are abound.The Buddha teaches that there are only two basic things he taught: suffering and the end of suffering. We see suffering all over the world. They arise due to various causes and conditions.<br><br>2. The question isn't about whether there is a God, but that IF there is a God, then as the Buddha has said:<br><em><br><br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why does he order such misfortune<br>And not create concord?      <br><br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance <br>And he such inequity and injustice create?      <br><br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord <br>Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta) <br>Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!     <br><br></em><br>Now even if you say that evil is due to the fall of Adam etc... still, the argument stands which I elucidated earlier.<br><br><br>3. If there is an all-powerful God, he would be able to do more than that isn't it?<br><br>Yes, Buddhism asks one to attain liberation through one's efforts, and it works. So many people have attained liberation. Nobody, including Buddha, can grant enlightenment but they can only show the way. Christians say there is an all-powerful God, in that case he could easily have chosen to 'stop evil', 'save everyone' etc.<br><br>4. If God is all-powerful he could have stopped 'the tares' from being planted.</p>

              <p>2. I think your point about the law saying prostitution is OK is
              flawed. What is legal does not always translate to morally right.
              In many instances the legal law is far from catching up with the
              moral law. It's basically that sinful man always fail to live
              up to God's moral standard. Every law in existence is directly or

              saying that this is the same law that applies when one tells a lie
              or commits adultery is to confuse things, to commit the
              naturalistic fallacy. That which DESCRIBES what happens should not

Well this just proves my point that the law is not founded on notion of 'good and evil' or religious doctrines. Law is law, not a religion.<br><br>3. In Buddhism, karma is also a natural law so we see no discrepencies. Therefore it is different from Christian notion of sin and judgement.</p>

              <p>1. So why would suffering be a problem that requires an end to? In the Bible, suffering and death are seen as the curse of sin. Death is an enemy to be destroyed because it is an intrusion to God's perfect creation.</p>
              <p>2. If there is no God, then everything cannot be accounted for, not even the laws of logic. For why would countless mental streams give rise to uniform laws of nature and the laws of logic? Why would impersonal laws give rise to personhood, consciousness and morality? You cannot give what you do not have. You cannot draw blood from rock.</p>
              <p>3. Only the Bible supplies the answer to the problem of death and suffering, because it also supplies the cause of death and suffering. The answer is simple, and I have earlier alluded to it. While we do see order and design in the universe today, we also see suffering and death. Why? Because we live in a FALLEN world, but it was not so from the beginning. This is why Genesis 1-11 is very important but many people miss that, even Christians. God did not create evil, or deceit or ignorance. Buddha's allegation of an evil God is most regretful. Of course if he had read the Bible I am most certain that he would change his view.</p>
              <p>4. Why would the free will of Adam still makes your argument stand? Please elaborate. God is all powerful and all knowing. He knows of no other way or plan that would preserve the free will of humans and yet being able to redeem them and restore all things. What better plan can you think of that does not violate human free will and does not act contrary to God's holy and just nature? I submit you would not be able to come up with any. God has done all that He could to redeem us. Nothing more He could do.</p>
              <p>5. Again, the issue is not whether God could have done this or that. God's ability is not in question. God could have even zap the serpent into oblivion when the serpent even thought of talking to Eve in the Garden. God could have even suddenly cause the tree to literally and physically uproot itself and run from Adam and Eve! Short of being comical this is a world that is nonsensical. It completely obliviates the need for free will, discernment, thinking, and the laws of nature. Again I submit that you may not have carefully thought about what you are asking.</p>

                        way to express this is to say that the cup is not "in" space but itself 
                        <em>is</em> space: the cup is "what space is doing in that place," so 
                        to speak. The same is true for the temporality of the cup. The cup is not an 
                        atemporal, self-existing object that just happens to be "in" time,

Firewood does not turn into ashes, firewood abides in the phenomenal expression of firewood and ash abides in the phenomenal expression of ash even though each moment is manifested interdependently with all its causes and conditions. There is no-thing going from past to present to future. Each phenomenal expression and experience is irremediably temporal and thus transcends the notion of time-things-self-being dichotomy, an instant reveals itself to be timeless and yet dissolving instantly.</p>

              <p>1. I understand that Buddhists don't (want to) talk about a
                          first cause or consider it as irrelevant or unimportant compared to
                          the present. But not wanting to talk about the past is not the same
                          as denying anything about the past. And if you believe in causes
                          and conditions that things manifest, why would that be a denial of
                          God as cause of the universe? Can you clarify if the Buddha himself
                          in his documented teachings explicitly DENIED there is a Creator
                          God?</p>
              <p>2. Indeed only if there is birth i.e. life can one talk about
                          death. The precondition for death is life, or birth if you like. So
                          what is the precondition for life? I submit that it is Life itself.
                          Life begats life. Even in science we have the law of biogenesis,
                          where life comes only from life.</p>
              <p>3. The issue is not the conditions for life. As mentioned,
                          having the conditions for life does not translate to having life.
                          What is necessary conditions does not mean it is sufficient
                          conditions. We have no evidence of life elsewhere, it is merely an
                          article of faith, not a known fact. Which is why I consider this
                          speculation. You may strongly believe there is life out there, but
                          it is just strong faith, perhaps even wishful thinking.</p>
              <p>4. The main reason that people believe there is life out there
                          is simply because people believe in evolution. They reason that
                          given billions of years life can evolve elsewhere just as it did on
                          earth. But that's just a belief. There are good reasons to think
                          that evolution is false.</p>
              <p>5. To say that without H2O there would be no rain is a rather
                          incoherent thing. Rain IS H2O. The issue is not about the
                          conditions for rain, or the laws of nature. The question is what
                          can account for the laws of nature themselves? Just to clarify, I
                          am not disputing any known undisputed fact of the universe, I am
                          saying that all these need to be accounted for in some ways. We can
                          actually sum it all up at the level of the universe and ask, since
                          the universe began to exist it must be contingent, so what is its
                          cause? What is the best explanation?</p>
              <p>6. But it seems you do teach an eternal but eternally changing
                          stream of consciousness. You said you teach an endless streams of
                          causes and effects. But this is incoherent if you think about it.
                          You must have a first cause. Every effect requires a cause. You can
                          even have causes that are also effects, but you can't have ALL
                          causes being effects. It is illogical.</p>

              <p>2. You are incorrect. I am certainly not saying that rain presuppose a rainer. I am saying that just as rain has a cause (which ultimately points to God who established the laws of nature from which we get rain via the hydraulic cycle), therefore the universe also must have a cause. Wind is just moving air. Water falling from the clouds is rain. Let's not dwell on these things, we know what they are. The question is in explaining their existence. Why is water special, unlike any other substance? Why is it necessary for life? A car is a assembly of parts. But we all acknowledge that a car does not assemble itself. Intelligent design goes into it. How much more then when we look at living things that are much more complex than a car? So why would it not be the delusion that we do not exist? Perhaps the problem is not the clinging to self, but that the solution is that by clinging to God we truly find ourselves?</p>
              <p>3. If you cannot count from today till infinity (impossible!) how can you ever get to today from the past? Consider a point marked X. You said you have been travelling for infinity to come to point X. Is this possible? Absolutely not. You would have to begin somewhere to come to this point. But if you did begin somewhere, then you never did travel an infinite distance. And ultimately when you realise that this cannot be done logically, it seems that the best option is to therefore to deny existence altogether, which is what I think you did. If you do not exist, then it is not about you anymore since there is no you to speak of. Everything becomes illusory and temporal, except the view itself, the view that "everything is temporal and illusory" becomes the only eternal and real truth which has real existence. But this is self-contradictory, and it goes against all sense experience.</p>

                                                universe also must have a cause. Wind is just moving air. Water
                                                falling from the clouds is rain. Let's not dwell on these things,
                                                we know what they are. The question is in explaining their
                                                existence. Why is water special, unlike any other substance? Why is
                                                it necessary for life? A car is a assembly of parts. But we all
                                                acknowledge that a car does not assemble itself. Intelligent design
                                                goes into it. How much more then when we look at living things
                                                that are much more complex than a car? So why would it not be the
                                                delusion that we do not exist? Perhaps the problem is not the
                                                clinging to self, but that the solution is that by clinging to God
                                                we truly find ourselves?</p>
              <p>3. If you cannot count from today till infinity (impossible!)
                                                how can you ever get to today from the past? Consider a point
                                                marked X. You said you have been travelling for infinity to come to
                                                point X. Is this possible? Absolutely not. You would have to begin
                                                somewhere to come to this point. But if you did begin somewhere,
                                                then you never did travel an infinite distance. And ultimately when
                                                you realise that this cannot be done logically, it seems that the
                                                best option is to therefore to deny existence altogether, which is
                                                what I think you did. If you do not exist, then it is not about you
                                                anymore since there is no you to speak of. Everything becomes
                                                illusory and temporal, except the view itself, the view that
                                                "everything is temporal and illusory" becomes the only eternal and
                                                real truth which has real existence. But this is
                                                self-contradictory, and it goes against all sense experience.</p>

I understand your point of view but Buddhism sees everything as dependently originated, and being dependently originated we do not assign them to an external agent like God, nor does things occur without causes - as everything manifest via causes and conditions. <br><br>3.

And it's a bit like going nowhere - because you never began at anywhere significant and there never was a beginning (it's all just empty space from top to bottom, how can there be a beginning point in empty space?), you're just like a space traveller going from nowhere to nowhere without a beginning... everywhere you go it's still empty space including Point X and will keep going on until you wake up. Just an analogy.</p>

If nobody is stealing and nobody have stuff thats stolen, there would not be a law to prevent those from happening. Laws evolve due to circumstances and incidents.<br><br>The dawning of civilization arises partly due to the discovery of ways to harvest and own 'stuff' - i.e. crops, animals, etc. Because there is ownership and property, there later arose stealing and crimes, and where stealing and crimes arose, there arose the need for governance, and then there are kings and its rule of law. Kings are not kings without the support of its people even if it is not democratic, as we have seen many kings have been overthrown in ancient history. Humans 'enact' the kings due to a need... we depend on rule and law for order in society.<br><br>In a sense those rules are invented due to necessity.<br><br>3. Wait... I didn't say suffering or not suffering has anything to do with moral obligation.

You are missing the point. My point is that just like babies can grow, we too can end suffering and ignorance.

              <p>So how do you come to the conclusion that there is no being that

              <h4>The principle here, derived from the core insight of Interdependent Transformation,
                  is that all things appear from a causal base. This understanding is extended
                  to the existence of entire universes or world systems. The Dalai Lama makes
                  this same point in his commentary on Shantideva’s <em>Guide to the Bodhisattva’s
                  Way of Life</em>, the Ninth Chapter on Wisdom. Verse 124 speaks directly
                  to this discussion:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>124. ... [I]f Creation were dependent upon conditions, the complete collection
                  of those causal circumstances would be the cause, and not <em>Ishvara</em> [Note: <em>Ishvara</em> was a common name for God in ancient India, similar
                  to <em>Yahweh</em>.] If the complete conditions were assembled, <em>Ishvara</em> would be powerless not to create; and if they were absent, there would
                  be no creation.</h4>
              <h4>The Dalai Lama’s Comment:</h4>
              <h4>If creation and destruction are dependent upon a collection of causal conditions,
                  the totality of those conditions would be the cause, and not a God who
                  is independent of and uninfluenced by events. If the causal conditions
                  were assembled, <em>Ishvara</em> would be powerless not to create the resultant
                  phenomena; and if they were not assembled, those phenomena would not be
                  produced.</h4>

              <p>1. Ignorance is beginningless. I don't suscribe to beginningless enlightenment.<br><br>2. All human laws arise only when trouble, disorder, where suffering comes about.

Laws evolve due to circumstances and incidents.<br><br>The dawning of civilization arises partly due to the discovery of ways to harvest and own 'stuff' - i.e. crops, animals, etc. Because there is ownership and property, there later arose stealing and crimes, and where stealing and crimes arose, there arose the need for governance, and then there are kings and its rule of law. Kings are not kings without the support of its people even if it is not democratic, as we have seen many kings have been overthrown in ancient history. Humans 'enact' the kings due to a need... we depend on rule and law for order in society.<br><br>In a sense those rules are invented due to necessity.<br><br>3. Wait... I didn't say suffering or not suffering has anything to do with moral obligation. I merely said people wish to be free from suffering, and Buddhism provides the path to the end of suffering.<br><br>Conventionally, you are of course responsible for your actions, wholesome actions lead to a wholesome karmic result and unwholesome action leads to an unwholesome result.... just like you are responsible for your cancer if you continue smoking everyday.<br><br>4. You are missing the point. My point is that just like babies can grow, we too can end suffering and ignorance. And we do not say 'suffering is natural because we are born with suffering therefore we should continue to suffer'.</p>

              <p>1. If ignorance is beginningless, that means it is eternal. Why should this state be considered inferior to being enlightened since it preceded enlightenment?</p>
              <p>2. Your explanation for moral laws is flawed, especially when you try to base it on evolution. Again the same naturalistic fallacy is committed in your argument. In a survivial of the fittest environment, there is nothing to say that it is wrong to take from you by force if survival is the purpose. The best explanation would be that man is created as a moral being. Laws are necessary in a fallen world, and laws are to show that man has broken the law. Yes, kings and kingdoms have changed and toppled, but this only shows the sinful nature of man.</p>
              <p>3. Why do people wish to be free from suffering if ignorance has been the eternal condition? Apparently telling people that they have no real existence do not solve the problem. Buddha may have been enlightened but he still fell sick and died. In other words, he was still subject to death and suffering. Compare this with Christ, whom though He also suffered and died, rose physically from the dead to show His victory over death.</p>
              <p>4. Apart from there being a moral law to be accountable, why should anyone be held for an action that leads to unwholesome effects? And why do anything that goes against the ignorance state which is the primordial or beginingless state?</p>
              <p>5. Babies grow because, like all living things, they are designed to grow, unless they have some problems that inhibit growth. A Christian view of life is that while suffering and death exists in a fallen world, it is not the way things should be, thus it would be consistent to want to see the end of death and suffering. But in a natural law universe where things are just the way they are, why go against nature?</p>
