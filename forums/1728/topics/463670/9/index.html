              <p>By "going into a cinema", I suppose you consciously make the decision to enter the cinema running halfway through, right? If you are making a decision, why enter while halfway through? why not watch another movie or come earlier or watch another day?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Err.. pretty obvious since we don't have better apparatus to identify the poison, right? What if the doctor is skillful and perhaps, he was bitten by the same spider? He is able to to identify the symptoms peculiar to this specific spider's venom and he is able to prescribe the anti-venom. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Now that the doctor has presribe the anti-venom, do you take it or do you go running looking for the spider and perhaps, ask why? </span></p>

              <p>as per someone else's account. none of us were there. Buddhist teachings were officially written down 500 years later. I'm not sure about the rest but personally, I don't take everything literally. I'm more concerned about its essence, the main message of the teaching.</p>

              <p>1. Re the cinema illustration, you missed the point. The point is that origins is not an irrelevant issue. It is also not whether you think creation matters or not, but whether creation is true. Your attitude towards this issue is irrelevant to the truth of the issue. If there is a Creator, then this fact has implications for our lives even if you personally think there is none.</p>
              <p>2. Re the spider bite, it proves the point that it is still important to know WHAT bit you. Even if you don't know, the doctor knows (and you are just lucky he happens to know!), and that is an important fact to know which makes a life and death difference.</p>
              <p>3. Re the metaphor, it is important to find out how you got into the forest. Who transported you there and why. Just because someone claimed to have cleared the path doesn't mean much. Imagine this person claiming to find the path out of the forest eventually is found by you dead as well. What hope is there for you? </p>
              <p>4. The Way that Jesus showed is that only through Jesus can one find salvation.</p>
              <p>5. Buddha's writings were indeed written many centuries after Buddha died, but Jesus' words were recorded in the Gospels within decades, by EYEWITNESSES.</p>

              <p>Then the onus would be on you to show that Jesus' resurrection was in fact a resuscitation. A lawyer by the name of Frank Morrison tried that, and he became a Christian.

              <p>How about what if you're kidnapped, made unconscious and later found yourself left in a forest? There's a footpath left by someone (the buddha) and lights (dharma) lighting the way. Do you walk the path or go searching for the kidnappers? As mentioned earlier, Gautama Buddha's human vessel was subjected to human conditions. Even though, his human vessel is no longer here, his dharma continue to lit the path. His teaching is very much alive and relevant even to this day. In his last moments, the buddha advised us to focus on the teaching rather than the person.</p>

              <p>This is a very good example that reflects the salvation freely offered by Christ! Jesus came to give us "food", He is the Bread of Life.

              <p>1. Re the cinema illustration, you missed the point. The point
              is that origins is not an irrelevant issue. It is also not whether
              you think creation matters or not, but whether creation is true.
              Your attitude towards this issue is irrelevant to the truth of the
              issue. If there is a Creator, then this fact has implications for
              our lives even if you personally think there is none.</p>
              <p>2. Re the spider bite, it proves the point that it is still
              important to know WHAT bit you. Even if you don't know, the doctor
              knows (and you are just lucky he happens to know!), and that is an
              important fact to know which makes a life and death difference.</p>
              <p>3. Re the metaphor, it is important to find out how you got into
              the forest. Who transported you there and why. Just because someone
              claimed to have cleared the path doesn't mean much. Imagine this
              person claiming to find the path out of the forest eventually is
              found by you dead as well. What hope is there for you? </p>

              <p>What if creation is true or not? What does it change? What are the implications? We're still here. Suffering is still here. As explained by the Buddha, our suffering originates from our own attachment and aversion. </p>

              <p>Your reason of finding the spider is to tell the doctor which spider had bitten you so he could give you the right anti-venom, right? What if the doctor is skillful enough and had went through the same thing and could identify all the symptoms and could gave you medicine accordingly without even looking for the spider. Do you take it or go looking for the spider? <span style="line-height: 1.231;">The spider is not going to give you an antidote, the doctor will.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>

              <p>How about what if you're kidnapped, made unconscious and later found yourself left in a forest? There's a footpath left by someone (the buddha) and lights (dharma) lighting the way. Do you walk the path or go searching for the kidnappers? As mentioned earlier, Gautama Buddha's human vessel was subjected to human conditions. Even though, his human vessel is no longer here, his dharma continue to lit the path. His teaching is very much alive and relevant even to this day. In his last moments, the buddha advised us to focus on the teaching rather than the person.</p>

              <p>5. This is a very good example that reflects the salvation freely offered by Christ! Jesus came to give us "food", He is the Bread of Life.

              <p>I was referring to buddha but if it's jesus to you, excellent!! both teach that we walk the path. As before, what good is it to look for the vegetable seller or the farmer? Knowing the farmer or seller etc won't overcome your own hunger.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I still don't understand what is the salvation you talked about? You mentioned he's the way. What way? Be like him? Dress like him? Walk his path, right? Just like the metaphor I used earlier. What's the difference? Don't tell me it's okay to walk on the path left by jesus that is lit by his teachings and not okay the path left by the buddha that is lit by his dharma.</span></p>

During His ministry Jesus told His disciples that He would be handed over to be killed but that He would rise from the dead, just like Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for 3 days.
