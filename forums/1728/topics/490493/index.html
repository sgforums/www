                                  influence on Steve Jobs. Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli explain that Jobs’
                                  1974 trip to India sparked an interest in Buddhism that stayed with for the
                                  rest of his life. From their book,<span> </span></span><em style="line-height: 16.8pt; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; transition-duration: 0s !important;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #8b8589;'>Becoming

                                  ostensibly went to India hoping to meet Neem Karoli Baba, known as Maharaj-ji,
                                  the famous guru who was an inspiration to his friends Larry Brilliant and
                                  Robert Friedland, and other seekers. But Maharaj-ji died shortly before Steve’s
                                  arrival, to his lasting disappointment. Steve’s time in India was splintered,
                                  as unfocused as the searches of many young people seeking a broader vision than
                                  the one they were handed as children. He went to a religious festival attended
                                  by ten million other pilgrims. He wore flowing cotton robes, ate strange foods,
                                  and had his head shaved by a mysterious guru. He got dysentery. For the first
                                  time he read Yogananda’s <em>Autobiography of a Yogi,</em><span> </span>a book that he would return to several
                                  times throughout his life, and that would be given to everyone who attended the
                                  reception following Steve’s memorial service at Stanford University’s Memorial
                                  Church on October 16, 2011.</span></p>

                                  his stay, according to Brilliant, “Steve had been flirting with the idea of
                                  being</span><em style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 22.45pt; box-sizing: border-box; transition-duration: 0s !important;">sadhu</em><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 22.45pt;">.”

                                  deprivation as a way of focusing solely on the spiritual. But Steve was
                                  obviously too hungry, too driven, and too ambitious for that kind of life. “It
                                  was a romance,” says Brilliant, “with the idea of being a renunciate.” But that
                                  doesn’t mean he came back to the United States disillusioned, or that he
                                  dismissed Eastern spiritualism altogether. His interests migrated toward
                                  Buddhism, which allows for more engagement with the world than is permitted
                                  ascetic Hindus. It would enable him to blend a search for personal
                                  enlightenment with his ambition to create a company that delivered
                                  world-changing products. This appealed to a young man busy trying to invent
                                  himself, and it would continue to appeal to a man of infinite intellectual
                                  restlessness. Certain elements of Buddhism suited him so well that they would
                                  provide a philosophical underpinning for his career choices—as well as a basis
                                  for his aesthetic expectations. Among other things, Buddhism made him feel
                                  justified in constantly demanding nothing less than what he deemed to be
                                  “perfection” from others, from the products he would create, and from himself.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>In Buddhist philosophy, life is often compared to an
                                  ever-changing river. There’s a sense that everything, and every individual, is
                                  ceaselessly in the process of becoming. In this view of the world, achieving
                                  perfection is also a continuous process, and a goal that can never be fully
                                  attained. That’s a vision that would come to suit Steve’s exacting nature.
                                  Looking ahead to the unmade product, to whatever was around the next corner,
                                  and the two or three after that one, came naturally to him. He would never see
                                  a limit to possibilities, a perfect endpoint at which his work would be done.
                                  And while Steve would eschew almost all self-analysis, the same was true of his
                                  own life: despite the fact that he could be almost unfathomably stubborn and
                                  opinionated at times, the man himself was constantly adapting, following his
                                  nose, learning, trying out new directions. He was constantly in the act of
                                  becoming.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; box-sizing: border-box; transition-duration: 0s !important; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>None of
                                  this was readily apparent to the outside world, and Steve’s Buddhism could
                                  befuddle even his closest friends and colleagues. “There was always this
                                  spiritual side,” says Mike Slade, a marketing executive who worked with Steve
                                  later in his career, “which really didn’t seem to fit with anything else he was
                                  doing.” He meditated regularly until he and Laurene became parents, when the
                                  demands on his time grew in a way he hadn’t anticipated. He reread Suzuki’s<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; transition-duration: 0s !important;">Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind</em><span> </span>several times, and made the
                                  intersection of elements of Asian spiritualism and his business and commercial
                                  life a regular subject of the conversations he and Brilliant enjoyed throughout
                                  his life. For years, he arranged for a Buddhist monk by the name of Kobun Chino
                                  Otogawa to meet with him once a week at his office to counsel him on how to
                                  balance his spiritual sense with his business goals. While nobody who knew him
                                  well during his later years would have called Steve a “devout” Buddhist, the
                                  spiritual discipline informed his life in both subtle and profound ways.</span></p>
