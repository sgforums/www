              <p>Just listened to Ven Hui Lu, he mentioned the same things. He said in Lankavatara Sutra, it talks about two causes for the disappearance or degeneration of dharma:</p>
              <p>1) monks who have ill intention/cause (like those who enter sangha for wrong reasons, are bad in behavior, etc)</p>
              <p>2) people start teaching counterfeit dharma that sounds like dharma, could be dharma, may be dharma, very much like dharma, sounds reasonable, can't seem to find faults with it, but actually it is not dharma.</p>
              <p>So much so that people do not know which is the true dharma anymore. Only wise, greatly enlightened people can tell the difference.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>personally i think these two things are very common nowadays</p>

              <h1>Translator's Introduction</h1>
              <p>The Buddha often likened himself to a doctor, offering a treatment 
              for the sufferings of the heart. Unlike ordinary doctors, however, he 
              could not show newcomers the state of health — nibbana — that his 
              teaching was supposed to produce. If they followed his teaching, they 
              would see it for themselves. But until they followed his teaching, he 
              could offer them no empirical proof that nibbana was a genuine 
              possibility. As he stated in <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.027.than.html">MN 27</a>,
               the proof that he was awakened — and that awakening was a good thing — 
              came with one's first taste of the Deathless, at the first level of 
              awakening, called stream-entry. However, stream-entry could be attained 
              only through a serious commitment to the practice. Thus he had to 
              provide other, non-empirical, means of persuasion to induce his 
              listeners to give his teachings a serious try.</p>
              <p>One of these means was the pragmatic argument, which differs from 
              empirical arguments as follows. An empirical argument presents facts 
              that logically imply that <strong>A</strong> must be true or false. A pragmatic argument focuses not on the facts related to <strong>A</strong>, but on the behavior that can be expected from a person who believes or rejects <strong>A</strong>.
               The Buddha's main pragmatic argument is that if one accepted his 
              teachings, one would be likely to pay careful attention to one's 
              actions, so as to do no harm. This in and of itself is a worthy activity
               regardless of whether the rest of the path was true. When applying this
               argument to the issue of rebirth and karmic results, the Buddha 
              sometimes coupled it with a second pragmatic argument that resembles 
              Pascal's wager: If one practices the Dhamma, one leads a blameless life 
              in the here-and-now. Even if the afterlife and karmic results do not 
              exist, one has not lost the wager, for the blamelessness of one's life 
              is a reward in and of itself. If there is an afterlife with karmic 
              results, then one has won a double reward: the blamelessness of one's 
              life here and now, and the good rewards of one's actions in the 
              afterlife. These two pragmatic arguments form the central message of 
              this sutta.</p>
              <p>The Pali title of this sutta is an adjective that has no exact 
              equivalent in English. It is used in two different contexts. In the 
              context of gambling, it describes a die that has not been loaded to 
              favor one side or the other. In the context of an argument, it describes
               a position that is true regardless of which side of the argument is 
              right. In other words, if there is an argument as to whether <strong>A</strong> or not-<strong>A</strong> is true, if <strong>C</strong> is true regardless of whether <strong>A</strong> is true or not, <strong>C</strong> is an apannaka position.</p>
              <p>Although this sutta is primarily concerned with the second context, 
              the Buddha implicitly makes the connection between this context and the 
              first in stating that a person who rightly grasps the apannaka position 
              has made a lucky throw, whereas a person who has wrongly grasped it has 
              made an unlucky throw. Thus, to preserve this double context, I have 
              translated apannaka as "safe-bet." "Cover-your-bets" might have been a 
              more accurate translation, but it would have been unwieldy.</p>
              <p>The sutta falls into two parts, the first part covering his 
              "safe-bet" arguments, and the second part extolling the person who 
              practices the Dhamma for tormenting neither himself nor others. The two 
              parts are connected in that they both present pragmatic arguments for 
              accepting the Buddha's teaching.</p>
              <p>The safe-bet arguments in the first part of the sutta follow two 
              patterns. The first pattern covers controversies over whether there is a
               life after death, whether actions bear results, and whether there is a 
              causal connection between one's actions and one's experience of pleasure
               and pain. The pattern here is as follows:</p>
              <ul style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 1.5em;">
              <li><strong>A</strong>: a statement of the anti-Dhamma position; </li>
              <li><strong>B</strong>: a rejection of the anti-Dhamma position; </li>
              <li><strong>A1</strong>: a pragmatic argument against holding to <strong>A</strong> — a person who does so is likely to act, speak, and think in unskillful ways; </li>
              <li><strong>A2</strong>: further unfortunate consequences that follow from holding to <strong>A</strong>, given that <strong>A</strong> is wrong; </li>
              <li><strong>A3</strong>: further unfortunate consequences that come from holding to <strong>A</strong> whether or not it is right; </li>
              <li><strong>B1</strong>: a pragmatic argument for holding to <strong>B</strong> — a person who does so is likely to act, speak, and think in skillful ways; </li>
              <li><strong>B2</strong>: further fortunate consequences that follow from holding to <strong>B</strong>, given that <strong>B</strong> is right; </li>
              <li><strong>B3</strong>: further fortunate consequences that come from holding to <strong>B</strong> whether or not it is right.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It is noteworthy that the arguments in <strong>A2</strong> and <strong>B2</strong> are not safe-bet arguments, for they assume that <strong>A</strong> is wrong and <strong>B</strong> is right. Whether these arguments date from the Buddha or were added at a later date, no one knows.</p>
              <p>The second pattern in the first part covers two controversies: 
              whether or not a person can attain a total state of formlessness, and 
              whether or not a person can attain total cessation of becoming. In the 
              context of the first controversy, the safe-bet position is that even if 
              there is no total attainment of formlessness, that still opens the 
              possibility that one could become a deva on the level of form. In the 
              context of the second, the safe-bet position is that even if there is no
               total cessation of becoming, that still leaves open the possibility 
              that one could become a deva on the formless level. One further reflects
               that total formlessness would open the way to greater peace than the 
              level of form; and that the cessation of becoming would open the way to 
              greater freedom than formlessness. These last observations in no way 
              prove that there is total formlessness or total cessation of becoming, 
              but they do incline the mind to view those possibilities favorably.</p>
              <p>The second part of the sutta divides people into four sorts: (1) 
              those who torment themselves, (2) those who torment others, (3) those 
              who torment themselves and others, and (4) those who torment neither 
              themselves nor others. The first and third alternatives describe styles 
              of religious practice that were common in the Buddha's time: practices 
              of self-torture and self-affliction, and the offering of sacrifices. The
               second alternative covers any and all bloody occupations. In opposition
               to these alternatives, the Buddha presents the fourth alternative as 
              ideal: the practice of his teachings all the way to full liberation.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion, when the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the <a id="kosalans" name="kosalans">Kosalans</a> with a large community of monks, he arrived at the brahman village called <a id="sala" name="sala">Sala</a>.
               The brahman householders heard, "Master Gotama the contemplative — the 
              son of the Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan — on a 
              wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks — has 
              arrived at Sala. And of that master Gotama this fine reputation has 
              spread: 'He is indeed a Blessed One, an arahant, rightly self-awakened: 
              consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, a knower of the 
              cosmos, an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed, 
              teacher of human &amp; divine beings, awakened, blessed. He has made 
              known — having realized it through direct knowledge — this world with 
              its devas, maras, &amp; brahmas, its generations with their 
              contemplatives &amp; brahmans, their rulers &amp; common people. He has 
              explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the 
              middle, admirable in the end; has expounded the holy life both in its 
              particulars &amp; in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. 
              It is good to see such a worthy one.'"</p>
              <p>So the brahman householders of Sala went to the Blessed One. On 
              arrival, some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side.
               Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and, after an 
              exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, sat to one side. Some 
              of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palm-to-palm
               over their hearts. Some of them sat to one side having announced their 
              name &amp; clan. Some of them sat to one side in silence.</p>
              <p>As they were sitting there, the Blessed One asked them, 
              "Householders, is there any teacher agreeable to you, in whom you have 
              found grounded conviction?"</p>
              <p>"No, lord, there is no teacher agreeable to us, in whom we have found grounded conviction."</p>
              <p>"As you have not found an agreeable teacher, you should adopt and

              individual is a butcher of sheep, a butcher of pigs, a butcher of fowl, a

              <p>"And which is the individual who torments himself and is devoted to 
              the practice of torturing himself, and also torments others and is 
              devoted to the practice of torturing others? There is the case where an 
              individual is a head-anointed noble warrior king, or a brahman of great 
              wealth. Having had a new temple built to the east of the city, having 
              shaved off his hair &amp; beard, having dressed himself in a rough hide,
               having smeared his body with ghee &amp; oil, and scratching his back 
              with a deer horn, he enters the new temple along with his chief queen 
              &amp; brahman high brahman. There he makes his bed on the bare ground 
              strewn with grass. The king lives off the milk from the first teat of a 
              cow with an identical calf; the queen lives off the milk from the second
               teat; the brahman high brahman, off the milk from the third teat. The 
              milk from the fourth teat they pour<a id="fnt-6" class="noteTag" name="fnt-6" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.060.than.html#fn-6">[6]</a> into the fire. The calf lives on what is left.</p>

              servants, &amp; workers make preparations, weeping with tearful faces, 
              spurred on by punishment, spurred on by fear. This is called an

              torturing himself, and also torments others and is devoted to the

              <p>"And which is the individual who neither torments himself nor is 
              devoted to the practice of torturing himself, neither torments others 
              nor is devoted to the practice of torturing others; who — neither 
              tormenting himself nor tormenting others — dwells in the here-&amp;-now 
              free of hunger, unbound, cooled, sensitive to happiness with a 
              Brahma-like mind?</p>
              <p>"There is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world, worthy and
               rightly self-awakened. He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its 
              beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims 
              the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence, entirely 
              perfect, surpassingly pure.</p>
              <p>"A householder or householder's son, hearing the Dhamma, gains 
              conviction in the Tathagata and reflects: 'Household life is confining, a
               dusty path. Life gone forth is the open air. It isn't easy, living at 
              home, to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, a 
              polished shell. What if I, having shaved off my hair &amp; beard and 
              putting on the ochre robe, were to go forth from the household life into
               homelessness?'</p>
              <p>"So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth, large or small; 
              leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and 
              beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life 
              into homelessness.</p>
              <h2><a id="virtue" name="virtue">Virtue</a></h2>
              <p>"When he has thus gone forth, endowed with the monks' training &amp; 
              livelihood, then — abandoning the taking of life — he abstains from the 
              taking of life. He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down, 
              scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living 
              beings.</p>
              <p>"Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking 
              what is not given. He takes only what is given, accepts only what is 
              given, lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure.
               This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
              <p>"Abandoning uncelibacy, he lives a celibate life, aloof, refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way.</p>
              <p>"Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech. He speaks 
              the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the 
              world.</p>
              <p>"Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech. What he
               has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from 
              these people here. What he has heard there he does not tell here to 
              break these people apart from those people there. Thus reconciling those
               who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves 
              concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create 
              concord.</p>
              <p>"Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech. He 
              speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that 
              go to the heart, that are polite, appealing and pleasing to people at 
              large.</p>
              <p>"Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks in
               season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, 
              the Dhamma, and the Vinaya. He speaks words worth treasuring, 
              seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal.</p>
              <p>"He abstains from damaging seed and plant life.</p>
              <p>"He eats only once a day, refraining from the evening meal and from food at the wrong time of day.</p>
              <p>"He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and from watching shows.</p>
              <p>"He abstains from wearing garlands and from beautifying himself with scents and cosmetics.</p>
              <p>"He abstains from high and luxurious beds and seats.</p>
              <p>"He abstains from accepting gold and money.</p>
              <p>"He abstains from accepting uncooked grain... raw meat... women and 
              girls... male and female slaves... goats and sheep... fowl and pigs... 
              elephants, cattle, steeds, and mares... fields and property.</p>
              <p>"He abstains from running messages... from buying and selling... from
               dealing with false scales, false metals, and false measures... from 
              bribery, deception, and fraud.</p>
              <p>"He abstains from mutilating, executing, imprisoning, highway robbery, plunder, and violence.</p>
              <p>"He is content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms 
              food to provide for his hunger. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies 
              with its wings as its only burden; so too is he content with a set of 
              robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger. 
              Wherever he goes, he takes only his barest necessities along.</p>
              <p>"Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless.</p>
              <h2><a id="restraint" name="restraint">Sense restraint</a></h2>
              <p>"On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or 
              details by which — if he were to dwell without restraint over the 
              faculty of the eye — evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or 
              distress might assail him. On hearing a sound with the ear... On 
              smelling an odor with the nose... On tasting a flavor with the tongue...
               On touching a tactile sensation with the body... On cognizing an idea 
              with the intellect, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which —
               if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect
               — evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail 
              him. Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties, he is 
              inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless.</p>
              <h2><a id="mindfulness" name="mindfulness">Mindfulness &amp; alertness</a></h2>
              <p>"When going forward and returning, he makes himself alert. When 
              looking toward and looking away... when bending and extending his 
              limbs... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe, and his bowl... 
              when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting... when urinating and 
              defecating... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking 
              up, talking, and remaining silent, he makes himself alert.</p>
              <h2><a id="hindrances" name="hindrances">Abandoning the hindrances</a></h2>
              <p>"Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, this noble restraint 
              over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness &amp; alertness, he 
              seeks out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a 
              mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the
               open air, a heap of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms 
              round, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and brings 
              mindfulness to the fore.</p>
              <p>"Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with an 
              awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness. 
              Abandoning ill will and anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill
               will, sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses 
              his mind of ill will and anger. Abandoning sloth and drowsiness, he 
              dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness, mindful, alert,
               percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness. 
              Abandoning restlessness and anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind 
              inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety. 
              Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed over uncertainty, with 
              no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities. He cleanses his 
              mind of uncertainty.</p>
              <h2><a id="jhanas" name="jhanas">The four jhanas</a></h2>
              <p>"Having abandoned these five hindrances — imperfections of awareness 
              that weaken discernment — then, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded
               from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: 
              rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed 
              thought &amp; evaluation.</p>
              <p>"Then, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he 
              enters and remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of 
              concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp;
               evaluation — internal assurance.</p>
              <p>"Then, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, 
              &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters and remains in
               the third jhana, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; 
              mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.'</p>
              <p>"Then, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain — as with the 
              earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress — he enters and remains 
              in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, 
              neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>
              <h2><a id="knowledges" name="knowledges">The three knowledges</a></h2>
              <p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, 
              free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to 
              imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the 
              recollection of past lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his 
              manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, 
              five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one 
              hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic
               expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, 
              [recollecting], 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had 
              such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and
               pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose
               there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such 
              an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and 
              pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose 
              here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and 
              details. This, too, is how striving is fruitful, how exertion is 
              fruitful.</p>
              <p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, 
              free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to 
              imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing
               away and re-appearance of beings. He sees — by means of the divine eye,
               purified and surpassing the human — beings passing away and 
              re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, 
              beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their 
              kamma: 'These beings — who were endowed with bad conduct of body, 
              speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and 
              undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — with the breakup 
              of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a plane of deprivation, a 
              bad destination, a lower realm, hell. But these beings — who were 
              endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile 
              the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the 
              influence of right views — with the breakup of the body, after death, 
              have re-appeared in a good destination, a heavenly world.' Thus — by 
              means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human — he sees 
              beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are 
              inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in 
              accordance with their kamma.</p>
              <p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, 
              free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to 
              imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of 
              the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it is actually 
              present, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... 
              This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the 
              cessation of stress... These are fermentations... This is the 
              origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of 
              fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of 
              fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from 
              the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the 
              fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 
              'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, 
              the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>
              <p>"This is called an individual who neither torments himself nor is 
              devoted to the practice of torturing himself, who neither torments 
              others nor is devoted to the practice of torturing others. Neither 
              tormenting himself nor tormenting others, he dwells in the 
              here-&amp;-now free of hunger, unbound, cooled, sensitive to happiness, 
              with a Brahma-like mind."</p>
              <p>When this was said, the brahman householders of Sala said, 
              "Magnificent, master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place 
              upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way 
              to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with
               eyes could see forms, in the same way has master Gotama — through many 
              lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear. We go to master Gotama for 
              refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. May master Gotama 
              remember us as lay followers who has gone to him for refuge, from this 
              day forward, for life."</p>

                  advice. Certainly have no intention whatsoever of trying to slander
                  a member of the Sangha. By the way, you may have heard of the below
                  prophecy by the 5<sup>th</sup> Karmapa on the 17<sup>th</sup> lineage issue.</span></p>
              <p><span>At the end of the time of the Sixteenth in the
                  rosary of Karmapa<br> And at the beginning of the time of the 17th,</span></p>
              <p><span>An incarnation of a demon (lit.
                  "samaya-breaker")<br> One with the name Na-tha (also, a "relative," spec. "nephew")<br> Will arise in this seat, Sacho. By the power of the person's
                  perverted aspirations,<br> The Karmapa lineage will be near destruction.</span></p>
              <p><span>At that time, one having true aspirations from a
                  previous life,<br> A heart emanation of Padmasambhava,<br> From the Western direction,<br> One with a necklace of moles, fierce and wrathful,<br> Whose mouth speaks wrathful speech,<br> Having dark maroon colour and eyes protruding.<br> This one will subdue the incarnation of the samaya breaker,<br> He will protect Tibet and Kham for a while.<br> At that time happiness, like beholding the sun<br> In Tibet this will occur, I think.</span></p>
              <p><span>Without this, even if karmically virtuous ones
                  come<br> The dharma will wane downwards,<br> As fruit of the negative aspirations of the demon.<br> It will be difficult for happiness to arise.</span></p>
              <p><span>From the center the king of the center will be
                  defiled<br> The emanation of a demon, an officer of high rank, coming from
                  Kong,<br> Will disturb the center and destroy the center's domain.<br> Many outsiders not existing before, [Not knowing] what has arisen,
                  will conceal.</span></p>
              <p><span>The beings of the degenerate times, will be
                  seduced by the demon.<br> Not having faith in Dharma, will become full of suffering.<br> Upper, lower and middle, in all three regions,<br> Blood of disturbances and arguments will rain.<br> From quarrels, disturbances and debates,<br> There will be no place of peace even for awhile.<br> Except for this poor and busy state<br> There will be no place for riches and leisure<br> Except for these very tormented fetters,<br> There is no liberty.</span></p>
              <p><span>Three precious ones, the three roots and the
                  Dharma protectors,<br> It is not that they don't have compassion.<br> Due to the Karma of beings and the power of aspirations of the
                  demon,<br> A time will arrive of a downward decrease.<br> At that time the Secret Lineage Dharma,<br> Will have more power and bring swift blessings.</span></p>

              <p>i mean i also heard it is possible that there can be more than one reincarnation?. like in the Little Buddha movie.</p>
              <p>synopsis of Little Buddha:- "<span style="color: #888888;">Little Buddha is a story about the quest of a group of monks, led by Lama Norbu (Ruocheng Ying), to seek out the reincarnation of his great Buddhist teacher, Lama Dorje (Geshe Tsultim Gyeltsen). Lama Norbu and his fellow monks believe they have found a candidate of Dorje's reincarnation within a boy named Jesse Conrad (Alex Wiesendanger) in Seattle....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">...In the end, it is found that all three children are reincarnations of the Lama Dorje, separate manifestations of his body (Raju), speech (Gita), and mind (Jesse). His reincarnation represents the three most important aspects of life. " </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107426/synopsis">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107426/synopsis</a></p>

              <p>Actually the real issue is not a matter of who is the real Karmapa or how many Karmapas there are.  Anyone who wears robes should be respected.</p>
              <p>Many people do not understand that the real and main issue, from the POV of practitioners, is the samaya and lineage.  Because the dharma lineage of blessings passed down to the present generation has to remain uncontaminated and pure if it is to work.  And if it is contaminated, then no-one can gain true accomplishments through the practice and there are also negative repercussions.</p>
              <p>That is why it is important to make sure that the Master/Guru you receive transmissions/initiations/teachings from has a true pure lineage, unspoilt by any conflicts (mental or physical) with his own Masters and lineage.  And this cannot really be decided by anyone's authority.  As it concerns your own liberation and practice, so it should be decided by your own discernment.</p>
