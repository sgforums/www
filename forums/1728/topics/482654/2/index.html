              <p><em>The realisation of no-self and the characteristics should lead
              to a gradual dispassioning. Attachment, desire is 'self'... In
              meditation, when 'self' is dissolved, the whole lot of attachment,
              imagination, ideas pertaining to self also all drop... this will
              result in a kind of release/bliss. When there is release,
              'I/you/self' is not there to experience it.</em></p>
              <p><em><br>....<br></em></p>
              <p><em>Actually the universe (and consciousness) is holographic.
              Everything is simultaneously occuring. There is no distance, time,
              location. Beings experience events based on conditions that they
              are 'attracted/attached' to.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>Under normal circumstance, Beings' focus are binded to their
              thoughts. The thoughts form their solid-looking physical reality.
              However, what appear to be solid is not solid at all. It is a mere
              optical illusion. In actuality, everything is occurring in a
              timeless manner. </em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>To see the timeless, holographic reality, the
              'agents/conditions' that create this illusion have to be
              disconstructed. The conditions that create the illusion of physical
              solid reality includes our mental pre-assumptions (subject-object
              division aka duality) and the sense of a self.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>For example, our mind can understand that space is infinite and
              without an end. However, our individual personhood does not seem to
              be able to see onto infinity. One of the spell that create this
              limited condition is the attachment of the focus onto thoughts
              about the past and future (imagination).... and the sense of an
              individual self. When awareness is aligned into the direct Present
              moment (Now), no thinking about past and future... the sense of a
              self can momentarily cease and awareness will have an awakening
              that it has never experienced before. Awareness will understand its
              all-pervading presence... just like space has no border.</em></p>

              <p><em>'No-self' is not about someone having a self then the self
                  dissappear. Rather, it is an original truth of how things really
                  are. .. that is... things are without self-nature.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>In Buddhism, this realisation of no-self is required for
                  'stopping' the rebirth cycle.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>This realisation of no-self does not mean that you suddenly have
                  no sense-of-self completely. The complete dissolving of
                  sense-of-self is a very gradually process that can take up to a
                  maximum of 7 lifetimes. </em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>It is like... one initially discover the truth of things.... but

                  In another word, at each penetrating moment it is already without

              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>Thought, thinking, mental opinions, ideas, strategies form a
                  continous flow as if someone(me) is there. Relax them and they will
                  disjoint and disconnect. </em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>Thoughts will pop out and go away.... in a disjointed manner...
                  deepening the insight that there is no self all along.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>These aggregates arise not in an environment of a 'me' and an
                  environment outside 'me'. They appear in a non-dual manner without
                  subject and object... as a series of dynamics dependently
                  originated.<br><br>...</em></p>
              <p><em>From my limited experience, all i can say is that thoughts will
                  be clearly seen...  When there is no-self and there is
                  clarity, thoughts are not followed.  This allows the thoughts
                  to be clearly seen and dissolve. .  At times, thoughts may
                  even cease. That mean, when the last thought dissolve there is a
                  temporary space where no thought arise.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>So, I will not classify no-self as any particular state. It can
                  have thoughts as well as being without thoughts. In the clarity,
                  these thoughts are very vivid and their dissolving is also very
                  vivd.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>Normally, with a sense of self... thoughts are fuzzy....
                  thoughts form a continunous chain.</em></p>

              Come to think of it, Openness is not scary anymore.
              
              After having read articles on reality, i understand reality is constructed upon our observations.
              
              This is very shocking to me.....reality is constructed upon our observations. Then everything and anything around me is all an illusion. All experiences, feelings, emotions........
              
              It took me some time to accept it.

              <p>Joan Tollifson just wrote this:<br><br><span class="userContent">Responding
               to my last post, someone wrote that when he drops into simply being 
              present, at first what he finds “seems to be flat and ordinary. There is
               breathing, there are noises. So what?” And then he describes that when 
              he stays with it, there is often a sudden shift: “thinking stops and 
              everything becomes deep and interesting.” He comments that there seem to
               be “two radically different modes o<span class="text_exposed_show">f 
              experiencing the now,” the flat and boring one and the deep and 
              interesting one, and then he describes being in the flat place trying to
               get to the deep place. He notices that this shift from flatness to 
              depth happens by itself, not by trying to make it happen, and he 
              describes this shift as being at once “radical and subtle.” These are 
              wonderful observations, and I wanted to comment further on all of this.<br> <br> The present moment seems flat and ordinary when we’re experiencing it 
              through the smog of mental ideas, thoughts and stories about it. When 
              we’re not really seeing what’s in front of us deeply and openly, then it
               can indeed seem very boring. Breathing, traffic noises…and the mind 
              asking, “So what? Been there, done that. What does this do for me? Who 
              cares?” Boredom is an interesting experience to explore. What does it 
              feel like in the body? What thoughts accompany or trigger it? And what 
              is under that superficial, all-purpose label we call boredom? Is it 
              restlessness, anxiety, fear, sorrow, disappointment, regret, unease? I’m
               not talking about merely coming up with more labels, but rather, 
              exploring and feeling this thing called boredom nonconceptually, 
              somatically, as sensation and energy in the body. It may turn out to be 
              much less boring than we thought!<br> <br> If we look at our kitchen 
              table through the smog of conceptualization, we don’t really see it at 
              all. We see an image on a map. Thought tells us that it’s just our same 
              old kitchen table. We think we’ve seen it before. Thought tells us that 
              it’s something ordinary, mundane, unimportant, meaningless, and 
              therefore uninteresting and boring. What can our kitchen table do for us
               aside from holding up the plates during meals? Not much, we think. If 
              we’re steeped in a certain variety of eastern religion, thought may even
               tell us that our kitchen table is nothing but an illusion, that it’s 
              only the phenomenal manifestation, that it’s not the real deal. But when
               we really look at our kitchen table with the eyes of a very little 
              child or with the eyes of an artist or with open and awakened eyes, we 
              see something we’ve never seen before, something that is new in every 
              moment. We see light and color and shape and gesture, a happening that 
              no words can contain. We may even see something extraordinary and 
              marvelous. <br> <br> Of course, “extraordinary and marvelous” are 
              dangerous words, because we may hear that and immediately begin 
              evaluating whether our present experience is “extraordinary and 
              marvelous,” and then we’re immediately lost in another conceptual spin. 
              From that conceptual place, chances are, our present experience will 
              fall short of seeming extraordinary and marvelous, and then we’ll begin 
              wondering what we’re doing wrong. And of course, when we get caught up 
              in trying to see something marvelous all the time, it is a losing 
              endeavor guaranteed to end in disappointment. Evaluating and judging our
               experience, taking it personally, seeking a better experience, clinging
               to the good stuff when we find it, resisting what we don’t like—this is
               our human suffering in a nutshell. <br> <br> To some degree, of course,
               chasing pleasure and fleeing pain is a natural survival instinct, part 
              of our animal nature, and it serves an intelligent purpose. But in 
              humans, it gets carried off into some very bizarre places that have 
              nothing to do with intelligence or actual survival. No other animal 
              smokes or drinks itself to death or goes broke sitting in front of a 
              slot machine. Humans are susceptible to unique forms of suffering due to
               our complex brains and our subsequent ability to think and self-reflect
               in ways other animals cannot. So in a way, what we are doing in all of 
              this meditation and awakening work is learning how to function more 
              intelligently with these complex brains. <br> <br> As this person noted,
               the shift from boring to marvelous, from flatness to depth, happens by 
              itself. We cannot make it happen. All we can do is get out of the way 
              and allow it. We do that by being aware of all the ways we obstruct 
              it—seeing those obstructions for what they are as they arise. Trying to 
              make this shift or this seeing happen is one of the ways we obstruct it.
               And we can’t make ourselves stop trying. We can’t force these habits of
               obstruction to go away through an act of will, on command. But in the 
              light of awareness, by allowing them and seeing them clearly and feeling
               them as pure sensation and energy, these conditioned habits lose their 
              power, their allure, their credibility, their ability to hook us. So all
               we can do is start where we are in this very moment, by being aware of 
              the trying, or being aware of the boredom. Simply see it, feel how it 
              feels, see the accompanying thoughts as thoughts, give it space and 
              allow it all to be as it is. <br> <br> And can this happen without 
              seeking a result? Is it possible to approach unwanted or uncomfortable 
              states of mind such as boredom, loneliness, anxiety, seeking, resisting,
               and so on with open curiosity, interest and wonder, in the same way we 
              might approach a beautiful flower or the face of our beloved? Can we 
              explore these uncomfortable states and conditioned habits of the 
              bodymind with love and without expectation or judgment? And if 
              expectation or judgment arises, if we notice that we’re doing all this 
              for a result, can we simply start right here with that? Notice that 
              desire for a result, that expectation. See it. Feel it. Be aware of it. 
              Allow it to be. Don’t try to get rid of it, because trying not to try 
              just adds more trying (more seeking and resisting) to the mix. <br> <br> And that’s the golden key right there to the subtle and radical shift 
              from flatness to depth, from samsara to nirvana, from delusion to 
              enlightenment. What actually invites this shift is very 
              counter-intuitive. Instead of an infinite regression of trying not to 
              try, what actually works is to simply allow the trying to be as it is. 
              See it, feel it, be awake to it. Give it all the space it needs. Be 
              curious about it. Embrace it. And needless to say, if we’re doing all 
              that in a goal-oriented way, in order to make the trying go away and 
              achieve a result, then we’re not really allowing it to be as it is. It 
              requires complete surrender to what is, complete acceptance, complete 
              effortless presence. The thinking mind tells us this is dangerous, that 
              if we do this, the bad stuff will never end. But in fact, 
              counter-intuitively, quite the opposite is true. <br> <br> That shift to
               complete openness without an agenda happens instantly when it happens, 
              but it may take considerable time to get to that point when the 
              grasping, goal-oriented, seeking mind finally relaxes and lets go. And 
              even when that shift finally does happen, the habit may return a moment 
              later. Certain habitual patterns may take decades to completely unwind 
              and dissolve, and some may persist over an entire lifetime. We can’t 
              force this kind of transformation, this kind of undoing. But when we 
              really understand that none of it is personal, that all of it is a 
              happening of life, then we are willing to give it however much time and 
              space it needs. It’s not about me anymore. And we can enjoy the journey 
              in all its various twists and turns.<br> <br> So are we willing to be 
              bored? Is there a willingness to meet what seems to be the same old 
              habit, or the same old kitchen table, or the same old depression anew in
               this moment, to see it freshly with open eyes, with love and curiosity?
               In fact, in the dance of existence, there is endless variation: cloudy 
              days, sunny days, warm days, cold days, sickness, health, happy, sad, 
              and so on. Grey and flat is an experience that we all have sometimes. 
              Every moment isn’t going to be a moment of extraordinary bliss and 
              magnificence. But the more we look and feel deeply and closely and 
              openly into what at first seems grey and boring, or painful and bleak, 
              the more we discover the jewel at the core of every experience. <br> <br> The jewel is the awaring presence, not the object being seen. That’s 
              why we can be bored and disappointed while gazing at the Swiss Alps and 
              ecstatic and blissed out over a crumpled cigarette package in the 
              gutter. The beauty is in the quality of the seeing, the awareness, the 
              presence, not in the object being seen. <br> <br> A single thought pops 
              up unbidden out of conditioned habit: “Oh no, it’s raining again,” or 
              “Is this all there is?” or “So what?” If that thought isn’t instantly 
              seen for what it is, then we’re no longer awake and present. And before 
              we know it, we’re lost in a whole story about how, “Nothing works, 
              everything is hopeless, life is a mess, I’m a loser, I’m doomed, there’s
               no way out, it’s another miserable day,” and so on, accompanied by 
              queasy feelings in the gut, an ache in the chest, a lump in the throat, 
              an over-powering feeling of exhaustion, a feeling of stuckness. And then
               more thoughts, more stories, more disturbing sensations, more 
              emotions—an endless feedback loop of emotion-thought that spirals into 
              more and more despair or discouragement or irritation or whatever it is.
               And next thing we know, we light a cigarette, start a fight with our 
              wife, drop a bomb on our neighbors, drink ourselves to death, shoot 
              ourselves in the foot, or whatever it is we do. This is our human 
              suffering and we can see it playing out at every level from the personal
               to the global.<br> <br> So how do we meet this sinking feeling in the 
              gut, this overwhelming exhaustion, this frightening sense of anxiety, 
              uneasiness, disappointment, depression? Do we go to war with it? Do we 
              try desperately to find the bliss in it? Do we rush to the liquor 
              cabinet or light up a cigarette or grab for a spiritual book? Or maybe, 
              just maybe, does it occur to us to turn toward it and actually meet it 
              with open minds, open hearts, open eyes, open arms…and to see what it 
              really and truly is. That is waking up. Not once and for all, not 
              forever after, but moment to moment, now. And it’s not about perfection.
               Sometimes we don’t wake up, sometimes the old conditioning overpowers 
              the ability to open, sometimes delusion happens. No one is beyond this. 
              But the amazing thing is, we can always start anew right where we are, 
              right here, right now.</span></span></p>
