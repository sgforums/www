              <p>Openness</p>
              <p>The following article was adapted from a talk by Toni Packer on Day 4 of the September 1994 retreat.</p>
              <p>In a group meeting someone said: "Hearing you talk, it sounds as though
               there should be no wanting. That I should be free from wanting. And 
              yet, I wanted to come here and here I am. I want to live and enjoy life.
               I don't feel I can let go of wanting."</p>
              <p>Let's clarify right from 
              the outset that we don't talk in terms of "letting go of wanting," or 
              "being free from wanting." There is no talk about overcoming anything. 
              Rather, we speak in terms of seeing, being aware of what goes on, in 
              myself, alone and in relationship with others.</p>
              <p>It's an 
              interesting thing to observe and to realize that we already listen with 
              certain categories of thinking which are well-established in the brain 
              from past history. How does it happen? Can we watch? Here is a talk on 
              wanting. There may be a certain inflection and intensity in my voice as 
              the nature and consequences of wanting are looked at and put into words —
               the pain that ensues from not getting what one wants, or from losing 
              what one once had. The conclusion is then drawn in the listener, without
               anyone actually having said it — it happens automatically — that Toni 
              has said wanting is bad — one shouldn't want. Be free from wanting!</p>
              <p>So, in listening to a talk here with each other, can one also be aware 
              of the quick conclusions drawn by the mind? That seems difficult, 
              doesn't it? How rapidly thought slides into conclusions: "it shouldn't 
              be like this, it should be the opposite way."</p>
              <p>Is there a 
              resistance to listen and to look at what goes on in ourselves, a 
              resistance to listen without the safety of a point of view? Difficulty 
              in looking without judging something right or wrong? It is so strange, 
              so alien to this conditioned mechanism of listening, so radically 
              different from how we've been brought up always thinking in opposites: 
              good and bad, right and wrong. If you're not good, you must be bad. If 
              you're not diligent, you must be lazy. If I'm not intelligent, I must be
               stupid. If people don't like me they must hate me.</p>
              <p>So — is it possible to hold still this instant, hold it, and just look at what is happening right now? No conclusions?</p>
              <p>Someone is talking right now, but there is also looking — I'm not just 
              talking from rote memory, but am looking at the same time. So in 
              talking/listening, can we all look together and watch, hold still, keep 
              looking, keep wondering and listening? Without falling into this trap of
               opposition, either opposing what is said or thinking that the opposite 
              of what is pointed out must be the good and right thing to do, to be.</p>
              <p>Can we look at wanting? Having spent a lot of hours quietly — sitting 
              or walking, lying down, working, eating — it becomes quite obvious, 
              doesn't it, that wanting is going on most of the time. Manifesting in 
              restlessness. Wanting something different from what is going on, and 
              imagining, scanning, searching for something better, for something 
              different. Has that been observed?</p>
              <p>Right now there is a buzzing 
              sound, someone is sawing somewhere. Can we just listen? Without any 
              resistance? Without opposition? Or is there wanting it to be quiet? At 
              this moment it is quiet!</p>
              <p>It is true that wanting can have 
              results! You wanted to come here. We wanted to go to the moon and we 
              made it. Someone wanted to be president of the United States badly 
              enough, and there he is. Wanting can have concrete results.</p>
              <p>We 
              are looking directly at this process of wanting in ourselves, without 
              falling into mere intellectualization. One can very easily follow 
              something intellectually and not look directly at what's happening in 
              oneself. So right now can we evoke the memory of something that we have 
              wanted, recently... today... last minute... this moment? Are we doing 
              it?</p>
              <p>And what we want right now, this moment, isn't that a 
              concept, an idea, a picture? Wanting to be free — is that something 
              "real", or an idea, a picture? Imagining ourselves walking joyfully 
              through the "world," freely through "life." We have an idea about it and
               can verbalize and picture it. Wanting something delicious to eat, 
              wanting to be attracted to someone or look attractive to someone. 
              Wanting a different mate, a better place to live, to meditate, a better 
              job. Right now all of this is imagination and idea, isn't it? Can we 
              agree on that? Can we look and be silent with what's there?</p>
              <p>Is 
              wanting led on by an idea, by a fantasy of what could be there for me, 
              where I could be better off, happier, more peaceful, more purposeful, 
              more creative, more loved, more needed? On and on, imagining 
              possibilities?</p>
              <p>What comes up in fantasy spurs energies throughout
               the body to be somewhere else. Thinking of what could be, what I could 
              be doing, what I could have. And thinking about where I am right now in 
              comparison. Either the energy to go get a new thing, the new companion, 
              the new job, or confusion: "should I go there or should I stay here?" 
              All generated by the dynamics of wanting and not wanting, which are two 
              sides of the same coin. Our constant, perennial restlessness. Getting 
              away from what? To what?</p>
              <p>Being here, simply being here can also 
              be an idea. People tell me: "I suddenly realize that `being in the here 
              and now,' has just been a concept." Is it? Right now, this moment? The 
              sound of cicadas, the fresh air — are these concepts? Is this 
              humming-buzzing-chirping a concept? Maybe it is, but it's also more than
               that, isn't it? Let's listen quietly...</p>
              <p>While listening I was 
              holding the breath . And now a deep breath to make up. The body is so 
              intelligent. The heart is beating quietly right now. Chirp. Chirp. 
              Chirp. Faintly. Faint sounds of whatever. Wheels on the pavement. 
              There's some imaging there, but that's also present and does not disturb
               the listening. Trying to picture a cicada. I don't even quite know what
               a cicada looks like. Like a grasshopper? Pictures in the mind. But the 
              chirping is clearly audible. And it's right here, isn't it? Doesn't it 
              permeate this whole room and one's entire being? It is one's whole 
              being! Not if the thought persists, "I'm sitting inside and the cicadas 
              are outside. I hope they are outside, I don't want them inside hopping 
              across my mat."</p>
              <p>How quiet can the listening be? Quieting down 
              more and more and more and more, there is the transparency of concepts 
              and words that arise, of like and dislike.</p>
              <p>Does the thought 
              arise, "I don't have quietness but I want it"? That thought brings 
              discontent, restlessness and the sense of separateness: "What must I to 
              do to get it?" Can thoughts like that be listened to, quietly?</p>
              <p>Listening to the hum of wanting. To images that may be there of what I 
              want. They need not trigger the energies to get away from where I am. 
              Let the energy remain here. In listening. In sitting and sensing. In 
              openness. Just being. Not knowing what is next. Not knowing where I will
               be tomorrow. Or this evening. Is that possible? For a moment to sit 
              without knowing what will be? The turbulent thoughts for a moment not 
              agitating the body to go and get, which means more imagination of how it
               will be when I get there. In quietly listening now... [Toni imitates 
              the sound of the chain saw]... what is it all? What's sitting here? This
               moment...</p>
              <p>The movement of sounds, the movement of physical 
              sensations, and yet all of it happening in a vast silent space of no 
              motion at all. Listening right now to all the movement inwardly, 
              outwardly, has no motion of its own! Listening is simple, here, quiet. 
              Unmoved. Like a mirror reflecting what's there. No — not a mirror. It's 
              not a mirror right now. Everything is simply here. Moving without 
              motion. No movement away from listening, just looking, attending, being,
               no knowing what the next moment will bring.</p>
              <p>Does wanting arise? 
              Watch it. Wanting to have it, wanting to be this, wanting to be 
              undivided, wanting to be whole and complete. That's all idea, isn't it? 
              Or is it real?</p>
              <p>When it's real there is no wanting, because 
              everything is already here. Not to be gotten to, not to be had by 
              anyone. It's our true being.</p>
              <p>Watch the wanting. Quietly, without movement, watching the movement of wanting.</p>
              <p>What I could be... what could be for me... what I don't have... what 
              others may have... Can one sense the movement of thought? Because that's
               what it is, movement of thought going along with movement of body. They
               go hand in hand. One person this morning said, "It's so clear, thought 
              is a physical sensation." It appears this way, transparently, as 
              physical movement, physical sensation. Thinking and sensing and feeling 
              all go together. Can we pay attention to the body manifesting the 
              thinking, with its agitation, an agitated body, a tense body, headaches?
               Can they be sensed? Feel it without thinking, "I shouldn't have it, I 
              shouldn't feel tense, I should be free of the headache." Can one sense 
              the movements of those thoughts, how physical they are? Tensing against 
              tension. Resisting pain. Such a subtle movement of thought-body. But it 
              all becomes transparent in this stillness of awareness.</p>
              <p>Wanting 
              is not just mental, psychological, conceptual. It's very physical. And 
              can that be allowed to be felt, rather than wanting to turn it into its 
              opposite of not wanting?</p>
              <p>What happens when wanting is quietly, 
              dispassionately observed? Dispassionately meaning not meddling with it, 
              not interfering, not resisting it, just watching. Where is it?</p>
              <p>Can the body relax in awareness of itself? It sounds paradoxical, to 
              relax in awareness of the tensions. No need to interfere, no need to do 
              something about it.</p>
              <p>This is the essence of this work: awareness 
              without doing. This needs awareness of our compulsion to do, which is 
              physical, mental, psychological, observable. Compulsion to do something.
               "What should I do? Go for a walk or sit? Or should I lie down?" And 
              thinking goes on and on and on. Why not at this moment, wherever one may
               be, sitting down, lying down or walking, watch it: the confusion. 
              Confusion of thinking. "Should it be this or should it be that?" It's 
              all thinking, but the body goes with it. The body is thinking. Every 
              cell is also thinking. "Should it be this? Should it be that?" Listen to
               the cacophony of it. Not excluding the saw and the cicadas. And the 
              smell of fresh, wet air.</p>
              <p>People bring this up a lot: In a place 
              like Springwater, without much of any structure, it's so difficult to 
              decide what to do. Can one listen to the whole orchestration of 
              indecision? The sound of it [Toni hums]... and the body humming along, 
              tensing along, confusing along. And do nothing about it. There's nothing
               to be done! Listening is not doing. It's natural, it's open, it's 
              without effort. It's no effort to hear that saw, is it? Someone 
              laughing, heart beating, cicadas chirping... is it an effort? Is it an 
              effort to listen to the inner confusion? Listening to it lovingly, 
              gently, embracingly. Listening without doing violence.</p>
              <p>Whatever state we're in right this moment, what is it?</p>
              <p>Wondering. What is going on right now?</p>
              <p>It's not what we think! It's simply what is. As long as we think it's 
              this or that, good or bad, we aren't listening. We already have formed 
              an opinion about it, and we know, "this isn't worth it, I don't want it,
               something else must be better. I want that — not this. Not pain. Not 
              confusion. But this is what's here right now. I'm not suggesting you 
              dredge it up. It's there when it's there.</p>
              <p>How quietly can there be listening to the confusion of wanting and not wanting? All the conflicting wants.</p>
              <p>We talked about it in one meeting, how often it happens that you go to a
               doctor, because you have a symptom, it's painful, it's really bothering
               you. You begin to tell the doctor about it, and he starts asking 
              questions. You look freshly, then and there, and it's not there! Where 
              is it? Darn it. If only I had come yesterday! You leave the office and 
              there it is again! I wonder whether it has to do with a moment of 
              shared, intense looking. I'm not saying it's so with all symptoms. Of 
              course it isn't. And I'm not saying they're only in one's mind. Just 
              that if one really looks completely at whatever is there and is with it 
              unconditionally — what happens?</p>
              <p>Someone told me this morning, 
              "... there are many decisions I ought to make in my life, but it's very 
              clear that as long as thoughts are buzzing about what I should do, how 
              it will be this way or that way — as long as thoughts are buzzing about,
               I better wait. Because no true decision comes out of buzzing thoughts. 
              There has to be a settling down in quietness. Empty of buzzing."</p>
              <p>The buzzing is: "Where will I be happier? Where will it be better for 
              me? What will be the ideal situation?" Buzzing around within this 
              self-centered network. We're not saying it's bad. Or good. Let's just 
              watch it. It's there for all of us, this network of self. We're not 
              saying get rid of it. Just watch it. That's where confusion is 
              constantly generated, through buzzing thoughts about possibilities, 
              alternatives. And this person says, "it's very clear, knowing what to do
               cannot come out of this buzz." If it does come out of that buzz, 
              confusion continues.</p>
              <p>Does one say, "If I am in a buzz, then what 
              do I do?" Nothing. Nothing. We're talking here right now, we're not 
              talking a week from now or last month. Just this moment. That's enough. 
              This moment of buzzing. Being with it. The words may sound trite, 
              mechanical. Don't let it be that. It's fresh. I'm not talking 
              mechanically. Being with it means listening. Wondering quietly, "What is
               it?" Not knowing...</p>
              <p>Open. Open to the confusion, the buzz, the hum, the agitation, the queasy feeling, the headache, the tension. Cicadas chirping.</p>
              <p>Being like a mother holding her crying child without feeling guilty 
              about it. Maybe one of the hardest things. One has tried everything. The
               child is still crying. Can we keep holding it tenderly?</p>
              <p>Someone 
              made the comment, "It often sounds as though nature were pristine, pure,
               good, healing, while everything having to do with human beings is 
              programmed, compulsive, unintelligent." The person continued, "I refuse 
              to accept that. Human beings are not all programmed. Not all automatic. 
              There is freedom, isn't there? And intelligence. And not this separation
               between us and nature."</p>
              <p>I wondered about this, why do we feel so
               good walking through the meadows? The sparkling grass, the flowers, 
              raindrops hanging from the leaves and branches. Clouds and animals. Why 
              does it feel so healing? So in touch. Is it because a leaf does not 
              think? And therefore does not vibrate with confusion? It's either a 
              little brown bud, the first green glossy opening of tiny leaves, and now
               bright yellow, orange and red. There are no regrets here, no wanting. 
              No fearing. Does the leaf want to come out? Is it afraid to turn red? I 
              don't know, I've never been a leaf. Nor a tree. It doesn't affect one 
              this way. It's all here the way it is: cracked branches, upright ones, 
              dried, crumpled leaves and nibbled ones. A lot of nibbling has gone on 
              for these leaves. There they are, full of holes, like the finest of 
              lace. Somebody put some out on the dining room table. It was neat to 
              see: nibbled, holy leaves. Almost transparent. No sob story emanating 
              from them.</p>
              <p>I'm not denying that there is freedom. Of course there is!</p>
              <p>But there is a lot of buzz and fuzz in this thinking organism. Which is
               no one's fault. It has evolved this way, and now we're stuck with it, 
              or we feel we are. Caught up in our thinking, in the emotions triggered 
              by thought and memory, and taking for real what is imagination about 
              ourselves and each other. Imagining the dream to be true! The pain that 
              goes with it, the suffering, or the momentary ecstasy.</p>
              <p>Can that 
              buzz of thinking, of imagining, of wanting and fearing, and the organism
               humming along with it, can it clear up in quiet listening and looking? 
              Be seen for what it is and seen through? Not changed, but seen through. 
              In openness, stillness, emptiness.</p>
              <p>Not the words.</p>
              <p>Chirping
               of cicadas and breathing and people moving, leaves rustling and gentle 
              rain dropping... is that thought? Wanting? Or is it just happening, 
              plain and simple, with no one doing it?</p>
              <p>No one doing it. No one.</p>
              <p>That is all.</p>

              <p>The idea that what we are seeking is a higher state of consciousness obscures our natural, self-luminous ever-present nature.<br><br>http://www.spiritualteachers.org/norquist_article.htm<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br></strong></span></em></p>
              <p>"After about three years of this I had my first experience of “nonduality” as it is called. 
              I had just read a passage in Ken Wilber’s “The Spectrum of Consciousness” where he points out 
              that <strong>ordinary awareness is ultimate awareness. </strong>This struck a chord in me, I set the book down 
              and stared at a paper that was sitting on the table in front of me, after about a minute or 
              two an exciting and frightening thing happened, I disappeared! By that I mean the middle fell 
              right out of the equation. Normally there would be Steve over here looking at the paper on the 
              desk over there, now <strong>there was only the experience, "paper" but no Steve over here seeing it. </strong>It was clear that the middle that normally separated the paper from Steve did not really exist, 
              there was only the experience, "paper."</p>
              <p>Now let me try to make this more clear by giving an illustration.</p>
              <p>Imagine as clearly as you can that you enter a large house that you have never been in 
              before. You feel strange and kind of scared, there is furniture and drapes but no people. 
              You wander around feeling the creepiness of being alone in this big house. You go from room to 
              room not knowing what you will find. You start to get nervous and a little fearful being alone 
              in this big house. You wonder how long it has been empty like this. In time the sense of the 
              bigness and emptiness of the house starts to weigh heavily on your nerves. Finally, when you 
              can not stand it any longer a shocking realization occurs to you, your not there either! Only 
              the experience, "house" exists.</p>
              <p>This is how nonduality feels and is the real truth of existence. Remember the question, 
              "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Now you know the answer"</p>

And Nirvana is the ticket to be out of this game it seems. And that's something very elusive.</p>

Everyone thinks it's easy. And then the texts say how the supposedly end is not really the end and there are stages after stages and if you don't know of it you are bound to be stuck somewhere. I am yet to see any religion/group which says do this for 1 year and you are liberated or you achieve Nirvana. Everyone says this is the path and you have a good chance.

              <p>We are born selfish. Self-interest is the actuating force for 
                  economic activity. Without the rules and laws, sanctions and taxes of 
                  the state, we would descend into a war of all against all. Evolutionary 
                  science and political economy – from Adam Smith and Thomas Hobbes, to 
                  Milton Friedman and Richard Dawkins – tell us selfishness is our default
                   mode.</p>
              <p>What if they were completely wrong? Science increasingly suggests they are.</p>
              <p>Evidence from evolutionary biology and psychology, anthropology and 
                  game theory shows our uniquely sophisticated capacity for co-operation 
                  is at the heart of our evolutionary success. Science is telling us we 
                  are co-operators.</p>
              <p>We breed babies that develop slowly and need a lot of care. According
                   to Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, professor of anthropology at the University of 
                  California, mothers in hunter-gatherer tribes needed help, especially 
                  from older women, to cope with child-rearing and to supplement the food 
                  brought back by hunters. The babies most likely to survive would have 
                  been good at eliciting support, showing pro-social tendencies and 
                  emotions.</p>
              <p>For most of human history the only sure way to get food on a regular 
                  basis was to be co-operative: if a hunter returned with nothing they 
                  would rely on sharing food brought in by other more successful band 
                  members. Richard Wrangham, professor of biological anthropology at 
                  Harvard, argues that we evolved large brains because our ancestors 
                  worked out how to cook food to make it more digestible and so to provide
                   more energy. Hunting, cooking and eating together required tolerant 
                  temperaments and skills of co-operation.</p>
              <p>Michael Tomasello, the co-director of the Max Planck Institute for 
                  Evolutionary Anthropolgy in Leipzeig, who has spent a lifetime studying 
                  altruism among babies, has found that infants willingly co-operate with 
                  people they do not know. They tend to share goods like toys and food; 
                  they help by fetching out-of-reach objects for people; they are helpful 
                  and informative, even with strangers.</p>
              <p>The Swiss economist Ernst Fehr has conducted thousands of experiments
                   with people, called social dilemma games, to test their willingness to 
                  share money with other people. In general only 20% and at most 30% play 
                  these games selfishly; 50% to 60% play co-operatively.</p>
              <p>Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis, the world's leading researchers 
                  into reciprocity, led teams to study co-operation among 16 of the last 
                  hunter-gatherer societies in the world and found that the closer we get 
                  to a state of nature the more co-operative we become. They summed up the
                   new science of co-operation thus: "Many economists, biologists and 
                  others will assert, as they have for at least a century, that altruism 
                  beyond one's immediate family members is highly exceptional and 
                  ephemeral. The experimental evidence of the last two decades tells 
                  strongly against that view."</p>
              <p>Our evolutionary success depends on our ability for complex 
                  problem-solving, from how to hunt giant mammoth together to organising 
                  mass healthcare services – and all complex problem-solving depends on 
                  co-operation. Martin Nowak, professor of biology and mathematics at 
                  Harvard, argues that co-operation is the hidden, driving force of 
                  evolution: "Co-operation was the principle architect of 4 billion years 
                  of evolution. Co-operation built the first bacterial cells, then higher 
                  cells, then complex multicellular life …Co-operation can draw living 
                  matter upward to higher levels of organisation. It generates the 
                  possibility for greater diversity by new specialisations, new niches and
                   new divisions of labour. Co-operation makes evolution constructive and 
                  open ended … We need to do even more to create an environment where 
                  co-operation can flourish if we are to reap its creative benefits."</p>
              <p>These sciences are helping to show how co-operation can be sustained 
                  through norms of fairness, sanction against free riders, direct 
                  communication among co-operators and creating opportunities for people 
                  to acquire social standing by being co-operative.</p>
              <p>Co-operation – far from being quaint and anachronistic – could come 
                  to be seen as successful and modern, aspirational and dynamic. The web 
                  and social media are working in favour of co-operation, amplifying and 
                  reinforcing relationships. Sharing and co-operation are increasingly 
                  central to consumer culture – witness the rise of <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.groupon.co.uk/">Groupon</a> and <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.airbnb.co.uk/?locale=en">airbnb</a>.
                   Collaboration and co-operation lie at the heart of our most innovative 
                  activities in science, culture and business. The reform of the welfare 
                  state hinges on breathing life back into its withered sense of 
                  reciprocity. The revival of politics probably rests on what the Canadian
                   political philosopher Mark Kingwell calls co-operative citizenship: 
                  citizens learning to engage with one another to find solutions as much 
                  as with the government.</p>
              <p>New forms of co-operation will be needed at every level of our lives,
                   from the global challenges of financial instability, climate change and
                   resource depletion, to the growing recognition that most of what 
                  matters most to us – love, care, friendship, respect, trust – come from 
                  relationships.</p>
              <p>All of which leads to a simple prediction: the societies that succeed
                   in the decades to come will be fair and relatively non-hierarchical 
                  because they will be better at co-operation that those are divided and 
                  unequal.</p>
