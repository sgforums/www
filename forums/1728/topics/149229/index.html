But it's not easy to do that.<br><br>First of all, we must learn not to be affected by our sentient thoughts and all thoughts. It is just like the cloud that has no influence on the sky or space. We donÂ’t actually need to eliminate all thoughts. Just let them become one part of us that we can control and direct. In time, all thoughts will be in our command, i.e. we will have direct thoughts from our Buddha nature. So we will be able to think and do things well without any attachments. I think thatÂ’s how Wu Wei works. And by then, Yo Wei(doing) is Wu Wei(not-doing).<br><br></div>

Taiwan is still in its infancy of democracy. So does the evolution of human beings. ItÂ’s a shame to say that even we have taken refuge in Buddhism, thereÂ’s still a long way for us to go.

Our mind would all be restored to the original state. i.e. our Buddha nature or true mind. There will be no need for law, freedom, family, society, country, the virtual Earth and finally reincarnation anymore.
