            <div class='col-md body'>Through His Holiness the Dalai Lama's and Venerable Thubten Chodron's articles, we are invited to approach interreligious contact and dialogue with an open mind, respect and willingness to learn. We benefit others and are benefited in return. We become more open-minded and our abilities to investigate and examine our beliefs and ourselves sharpen. While philosophically there are differences between religions and recognizing those, we can still appreciate their similarities. We are freed from the need to agree on religious beliefs in order to have meaningful and mutually beneficial dialogues.<br><br><img src="http://www.thubtenchodron.org/InterreligiousDialogue/images/VTC&amp;FriendsOpt.jpg"><br><br>From left to right, Nancy Nesbitt, a member of Dharma Friendship Foundation; Ven.

Chodron teaching at the Interfaith Church in Seattle</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Meaningful questions arise and exist within each of us. Religions suggest answers to these questions, but real spiritual practice occurs in the heart of each person. In our spiritual search we see a variety of religions and paths. What can these various traditions offer each other? What do their practitioners have in common? How are they different? Sharing examples of interreligious contact increases understanding of other religions and encourages harmony among the followers of various faiths. It could lead to a deepening of the practice of your own faith; or if you have none, it may reactivate your interest in spiritual issues. It may stimulate you to meet and talk with people whose beliefs differ from yours, thus opening windows to new understandings with new friends. In addition, it gives a glimpse into the monastic life of both Christians and Buddhists, so that people will understand its joys and challenges, as well as what the monastic life offers to those who live it and to society as a whole."</span><br><br><strong>Ven.

True, Christians and Buddhists can focus on their similarities in any inter-religious dialogue, but at a more fundamental level, the entire metaphysical and philosophical outlook of these two religions are at odds with each other...<br><br>For example, both Christians and Buddhists will agree that we must be kind and good, but why must we be kind and good? To the Christians, we must be kind and good because God said so, but to the Buddhists, being kind and good is a necessary pre-requisite to the achievement of enlightenment.<br><br>Having said that, I do not think that such inter-religious dialogue can ever corrode the two religion's stance... You are not conceding any core teachings of the respective religions, just emphasizing on the parts that are in agreement with the other religion.<br><br>BTW, Buddhism is not a "faith", it is a belief, among other things...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Pinsky, Orlando Sentinel, May 29, 2006</span></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Central Florida Buddhists are taking part in a worldwide event to help open busy minds to new, more peaceful, journeys.</span><br><br><strong>Orlando, FL (USA)</strong> -- Evangelism isn't a word usually associated with Buddhism, but the international outreach known as "Change Your Mind Day" sounds a lot like it.<br><br>On Saturday, Central Florida Buddhists will sponsor a version of the worldwide gathering that began in 1993. The occasion is aimed at teaching people how to manage anxiety through meditation, sponsors say.<br><br>The afternoon meeting at First Unitarian Church of Orlando, which is free and open to the public, will feature talks on yoga and Zen, as well as cooking and dance demonstrations, and refreshments.<br><br>"It's more for people who are not Buddhists," says an organizer, Suzi K. Edwards of Maitland. "We're trying to teach people how to meditate, to have people become more peaceful on the inside so they'll be more peaceful on the outside."<br><br>Winter Park psychotherapist Peter Carlson will lead a session on "Letting Go of Suffering."<br><br>"Some people report after the first guided meditation a significant feeling of calmness, which is remarkable to them," he says.<br><br>On the other hand, he acknowledges, "that may just be beginner's luck."<br><br>Unlike the Central Florida gathering -- a first for this area -- many other Change Your Mind Day observations take place outdoors.<br><br>"The idea is to reach out to people who don't know about Buddhism -- in a public space," says Larry Ransom-Wiley, the event's worldwide coordinator. "From our perspective, we think people can be intimidated by going into a Buddhist temple, so we try to encourage organizers to arrange their events in public parks."<br><br>Although Change Your Mind Day sounds a lot like the festival model of evangelical Christian crusades, such as the one sponsored by Luis Palau at the Citrus Bowl recently, Ransom-Wiley says it's not proselytizing.<br><br>"It's more of an invitation," says Ransom-Wiley, who works for the New York-based Tricycle Foundation and magazine, dedicated to advancing Buddhism. "There aren't missionaries. It's always, like, a come-and-see thing."<br><br>The Orlando event runs from 2 to 5 p.m. Saturday. The church is at 1901 E. Robinson St.<br><br></div>
