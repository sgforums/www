            <div class='col-md body'>I think Buddhism and LIBERAL Christianity have many things in common.<br><br>1. It seems to me from the Bible that Jesus showed many signs that he may have been enlightened in the Buddhist sense, although of course he didn't use that terminology.

Also when he visited the house of Mary and Martha (sisters), Mary sat at peace with him (mindfulness?) while Martha fussed over preparing food, and Jesus told her just to be at peace - "only one thing is necessary".

            <div class='col-md body'>There is like a big spectrum of belief within Christianity, ranging from very liberal to very fundamentalist.  Unfortunately the fundamentalist end is the loudest and gets heard most often.<br><br>Fundamentalists -  try to take the bible literally as much as possible.  It is a very textual interpretation much like the Muslim respect for the words of the Koran.  They will believe that Jesus is literally the son of God, that God came down and impregnated a virgin without her ever having sex, and she was still a virgin when Jesus was born.  They believe that by dying on the cross he was somehow a sacrifice that took away the sins of everybody else.  You have to accept this teaching to be "saved".  I've always found this problematic and impossible to accept.<br><br>Liberal Christians - will acknowledge that the Bible is full of metaphors and figurative teachings, not always to be taken literally.  Some will go so far as to acknowledge that Jesus was just a wise and holy man, in the same way that any other member of the human race could be (in theory).  They may believe that the crucifixion was just a political event - Jesus was put to death because he was challenging the corruptness and hypocrisy of the established Church at the time.  To that extent, he is to be admired for speaking up and putting himself in mortal danger in order to be true to himself, but his death does not "magically" take away the sins of the world.<br><br>Probably the majority of Christians - don't really agree with the fundamentalist position because it is so illogical and difficult for an intelligent individual to accept but neither do they really challenge it at an intellectual level - they just go along to Church and recite prayers/creeds they don't really believe because it is more convenient.  If you ask them why they do this, they will say it is because they agree with the overall principles of Christianity- love, justice, peace, etc. so they try to ignore the small, difficult details.  I tried to do this but I find I can't anymore.  What's the point in reciting something you don't really believe?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I believe strongly and is also mentioned by my master, that Jesus is a bodhisattva. I particularly like Gospel of Thomas - it is one of the first gospels to be written. In fact many scholars of early Christianity believe that it was first written down prior to the Gospels of the Bible, closer in time to the period in which all Christian teachings were passed on orally, and therefore may in some ways be a more accurate portrayal of the true words of Jesus. Gospel of Thomas is mystical in nature and has close resemblance to Buddhist teachings.<br><br>But I think many times his teachings is interpreted wrongly and there is alot of distortions in the bible for political reasons... meaning it is no longer the original words of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Just my views, not necessarily you must share them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by la lapine blanche:</div><div class="quote_body">I think Buddhism and LIBERAL Christianity have many things in common.<br><br>1. It seems to me from the Bible that Jesus showed many signs that he may have been enlightened in the Buddhist sense, although of course he didn't use that terminology.  Examples - he was utterly unattached to possessions, wandered about homeless, relied on friends for food, etc. and urged people to be happy - pointing out that flowers and birds do not worry about things and neither should we.  Also when he visited the house of Mary and Martha (sisters), Mary sat at peace with him (mindfulness?) while Martha fussed over preparing food, and Jesus told her just to be at peace - "only one thing is necessary".  There are many indicators that the wisdom of Jesus Christ is not dissimilar to enlightenment.<br><br>2. Ethics - example, the 5 precepts, very similar in content to the 10 commandments.<br><br>3.The actual meditative experience of Buddhist monks/nuns appears to parallel that of Christian contemplatives in terms of stages one passes through - this is especially true of Christian mystics.<br><br>4. "As you reap, so shall you sow" , also "He who fights by the sword shall die by the sword" - the concept of karma is not unknown to the Bible.<br><br>5. Remember that the whole concept of Jesus being the only Son of God or specially Divine (unlike the rest of us) was only decided upon three centuries after his death, at the Council of Nicea, and this was because the emperor Constantine regarded it as politically convenient.  The weight of the evidence in the Bible suggests that Jesus himself as well as his followers regarded him as simply one in a long line of wise Jewish teachers.  Many liberal Christians are starting to come to terms with this and in fact it does not diminish the importance of Jesus' teachings in any way.<br><br>Anyway, just some of my thoughts as an ex-Christian!</div></blockquote>It is a misconception that Jesus was "only" a great teacher to his followers. It is obvious that he is God to them. The agenda of the Council of Nicaea is not to deify Jesus. The majority of Christians already know Jesus is God. Did you get this from Da vinci code or something? Go read wikipedia. Anyway, any link of Jesus with Buddhism is merely a conjecture, like how Dan Brown claims Christianity has much in relation to paganism.</div>
