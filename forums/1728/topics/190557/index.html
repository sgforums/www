(I am planning to join a Thich Naht Hanh-inspired sangha soon, so maybe they will be able to help me).</blockquote>You become a Buddhist by taking refuge in the Three Treasures, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, preferably taking it with an ordained monk and Sangha community. You should first find a good Sangha which you are comfortable with and then take refuge.<br><br><blockquote>2.  I have read about so many different texts that seem to form part of the Dhamma, and am confused by all the Sutras, etc.  How many teachings are there that make up the official literature of Buddhism, is it possible to buy them all together in one book or is that wishful thinking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Hope this doesn't sound silly.  would be grateful for advice.<br>Many thanks</blockquote>Buddha taught for 45 years after his enlightenment.<br><br>You are right that there are simply so many sutras - that it is impossible to finish reading them. What you should do is to follow an enlightened teacher who can guide you and practise what he/she taught. That will be a lot faster - otherwise you can read all the sutras and yet not become enlightened.</div>
