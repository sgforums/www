Over the next four decades, Christians will remain the largest religious group, but Islam will grow faster than any other major religion. If current trends continue, by 2050 …</span></p>

Muslims will be more numerous in the U.S. than people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>Four out of every 10 Christians in the world will live in sub-Saharan Africa. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="   text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: normal;  "><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">  </span>With the exception of Buddhists, all of the world’s major religious groups are poised for at least some growth in absolute numbers in the coming decades. The global Buddhist population is expected to be fairly stable because of low fertility rates and aging populations in countries such as China, Thailand and Japan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="   text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: normal;  "><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">  </span>Due largely to high fertility, <strong>sub-Saharan Africa</strong> is projected to experience the fastest overall growth, rising from 12% of the world’s population in 2010 to about 20% in 2050. The <strong>Middle East-North Africa</strong> region also is expected to grow faster than the world as a whole, edging up from 5% of the global population in 2010 to 6% in 2050. Ongoing growth in both regions will fuel global increases in the Muslim population. In addition, sub-Saharan Africa’s Christian population is expected to double, from 517 million in 2010 to 1.1 billion in 2050. The share of the world’s Christians living in sub-Saharan Africa will rise from 24% in 2010 to 38% in 2050.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="   text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: normal;  ">&lt;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Meanwhile, the <strong>Asia-Pacific</strong> region is expected to have a declining share of the world’s population (53% in 2050, compared with 59% in 2010). This will be reflected in the slower growth of religions heavily concentrated in the region, including Buddhism and Chinese folk religions, as well as slower growth of Asia’s large unaffiliated population. One exception is Hindus, who are overwhelmingly concentrated in India, where the population is younger and fertility rates are higher than in China or Japan. As previously mentioned, Hindus are projected to roughly keep pace with global population growth. India’s large Muslim population also is poised for rapid growth. Although India will continue to have a Hindu majority, by 2050 it is projected to have the world’s largest Muslim population, surpassing Indonesia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="   text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: normal;  ">&lt; M<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">uslims in 2050 are expected to make up more than 50% of the population in 51 countries, two more than in 2010, as both the Republic of Macedonia and Nigeria are projected to gain Muslim majorities. But Nigeria also will continue to have a very large Christian population. Indeed, Nigeria is projected to have the third-largest Christian population in the world by 2050, after the United States and Brazil.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="   text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: normal;  ">&lt;O<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">ver the coming decades, Christians are expected to experience the largest net losses from switching. Globally, about 40 million people are projected to switch into Christianity, while 106 million are projected to leave, with most joining the ranks of the religiously unaffiliated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: 14.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&lt;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">All told, the unaffiliated are expected to add 97 million people and lose 36 million via switching, for a net gain of 61 million by 2050. Modest net gains through switching also are expected for Muslims (3 million), adherents of folk religions (3 million) and members of other religions (2 million). Jews are expected to experience a net loss of about 300,000 people due to switching, while Buddhists are expected to lose nearly 3 million.</span><strong></strong></p>

So Buddhists are not necessarily Buddhist in their political life, or even in social life. People ask me, ‘Are you a Buddhist?’ My answer would be I’m studying to be one, to be a better Buddhist. I’d like to say I’m a good Buddhist, but I’m not in a position to say I’m a good Buddhist as I’m trying to learn to be one . . .- Aung San Suu Kyi<br><br>Meditation has taught me tremendous awareness of getting annoyed, getting tired and feeling better. I meditate unless I’m lazy or tired, mostly once a week . . .- Aung San Suu Kyi<br><br>I was born into a Buddhist family. Buddhism is rooted in a practical cause. It’s about the discovery of what the human mind and human beings are like. The more I meditated, the more I learned of how true to life Buddhist teachings were.- Aung San Suu Kyi<br><br>For example, I’m very fond of the teaching that explains how to distinguish a good man from a bad man. A bad man always exaggerates his good points and minimizes the good points of others. A good man does it the other way around. And a bad man will always exaggerate everything people say to him in gratitude. It’s a very simple bit of teaching. I’ve found that very human. And believe me, I can tell a good man from a bad man. - Aung San Suu Kyi<br><br>( Retrieved http://theendlessfurther.com/tag/aung-san-suu-kyi/)</p></div>
