              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">Sleeping next to a corpse, even
              that of a loved one, was a ritual I had long been dreading. Instead of bringing
              closure, it seemed a particularly cruel and gothic way to bring even more
              sorrow to a grieving family.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Yet Buddhist tradition in Japan
              dictates that a body lies in rest at home with the family for several days
              until a monk prays for the deceased's spirit to depart safely for its next life
              at the funeral, after which the body is cremated. And so my father’s body was
              brought back to my parents’ house in suburban Tokyo, the site which had been
              bought by my grandfather nearly a half-century earlier, and to which I had
              flown back to from Washington.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Having been in a steady decline
              from a debilitating lung disease until he was no longer able to breathe even
              for a minute without an oxygen tank, my father's last several months had been
              especially painful to watch. Given his struggle just to stay alive, his death
              was not unexpected, and in some ways, it was a relief that he no longer had to
              fight as he slowly ceased being the brilliant investment banker that he once
              was.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>But I had failed to be there
              when he took his final breath. While I managed to fly in to Japan to see him
              every few weeks at his hospital bed since late last year, it just wasn’t
              enough. Just when I was about to board the plane from Dulles on standby on May
              8 after my mother called that the end should be coming soon, she called again
              to say it was all over.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Long haul flights are never for
              the faint of heart, but that flight was the loneliest journey I had ever taken.
              Having no one to talk to about my loss just minutes earlier, I had over 12
              hours to myself to replay my final visit with my father the previous month, and
              to grapple with the guilt for not being there when it really mattered, in his
              final hours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>When I finally arrived at my
              parents' house, my father was laid out in a white futon on the tatami floor
              wearing a pure white kimono, a dagger placed upon his chest to ward off evil
              spirits. A long white candle burned and incense was lit, but the smell of
              lilies overpowered everything else.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>It was the least likely setting
              my father would have been comfortable in, yet his face was calmer than it had
              been in a long time. In fact, he not only looked more serene, but he actually
              looked slightly more youthful than he had when I had last seen him in hospital
              six weeks earlier.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>And without worrying about his
              oxygen supply, and not panicking every time he coughed, I was finally able to
              focus on who he really was, and what he meant to me, rather than seeing him as
              the sickly, frail patient.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Born two years before Japan
              surrendered to the United States, my father Shigenobu was born to a well-to-do
              family of landowners in Saitama, which back then "might as well have been
              rural Vietnam," according to him. His thirst for knowledge of the wider
              world, and his drive to learn English in his teens in particular were key for
              him to pursue a career in international finance, which allowed my mother and me
              to spend several years in Los Angeles and Brussels. His passion and life
              decisions, in short, ultimately came to define my own life, and eventually, my
              children’s as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>As relatives, friends, and
              former colleagues came over to pay their respects during the day as final
              arrangements for the funeral were made, I was able to spend time with my father
              each night, simply sharing time with him and talking to him about what had
              been, what could have been. It wasn’t a dead body that I was with. It was my
              father that I have always loved, who was sensible, proud, and always unafraid
              to be a bit irreverent, and who was also no longer suffering. This was the
              father that I wanted to remember, and when the time came for the undertaker to
              carry his body away to the temple, the pain of separation was overwhelming.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>My father's body was cremated
              after the funeral, and his ashes now rest at my parent's house, in accordance
              to Buddhist tradition. His remains will finally be buried by our local temple
              on the 49th day of his death, a week after Father's Day.</span></p>
