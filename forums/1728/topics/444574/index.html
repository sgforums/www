                   Wordly ‘Supra-mundane’ and other misunderstandings) from the <a title="Homepage" href="http://amitabhabuddha.wordpress.com/miao-yun-by-ven-master-yin-shun/">Selected Translations of Miao Yun</a> ,Book 1<br> ( <strong>Master Yin Shun </strong>’s English translations)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Common Buddhist Misunderstandings</strong></span></p>
              <p>It has been more than one thousand and nine hundred years since 
                  Buddhism spread to China. Thus, the relationship between Buddhism and 
                  China is very close. The development of Buddhism influenced, and was 
                  influenced by Chinese culture. In fact Buddhism became a religion of the
                   Chinese.</p>
              <p>Buddhism originated from India, and the special characteristics of 
                  the Indian culture were sometimes not easy for the Chinese to 
                  understand. <strong>The Chinese traditions influenced and modified some of the practices, and these <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deviated from the teaching of the Buddha</span>. As a result, there are unfortunately many misunderstandings about Buddhism in China among the Buddhists and non-Buddhists.</strong></p>
              <p>It is very easy to misunderstand Buddhism if one knows nothing about 
                  its origins. Some followers may practice the cultural rituals without 
                  ever knowing Buddha’s teachings. As a consequence, those who believe in 
                  “Buddhism” may not really be following the Buddha’s teachings, and those
                   who criticise Buddhism may not actually be criticising what the Buddha 
                  taught. So I hope this talk may help everyone gain a better 
                  understanding!</p>
              <p>1. Misunderstanding that arises from the teachings.</p>
              <p>The theory of the Buddha’s teaching is very profound. Some people do 
                  not understand its meanings and may only know it superficially. After 
                  listening to a few phrases, they may start to explain to the others in 
                  their own way. As a result, some explanations people tell, may not be 
                  accurate teachings of the Buddha. The most common misunderstandings are 
                  about the teachings: “life is suffering”, “out-worldly” and “emptiness”.
                   So now lets discuss these terminologies separately:</p>
              <p>a) Life is suffering</p>
              <p>The Buddha told us that “Life is Suffering”. One who does not 
                  understand the Truth of this may think that life is meaningless and 
                  become negative and pessimistic. Actually, this theory is commonly 
                  misunderstood. People in society and even some Buddhists are trapped in 
                  this wrong and gloomy view.</p>
              <p>When we encounter phenomena, and have a feeling of dislike, worry or 
                  pain, we say that there is “suffering”. This should not be generalised 
                  to “all life is suffering”, because there is also a lot of happiness in 
                  life! Noises are disturbing but nice melodies bring happiness. When one 
                  is sick, poor, separated from loved ones, one has suffering. But when 
                  one is healthy, wealthy, together with one’s family, one is very happy. 
                  Suffering and happiness exist in all phenomena. Actually where there is 
                  happiness, there will be suffering. They are in contrast with each 
                  other. If’ we only say that life is suffering when things do not go 
                  according to our wish we are rather foolish.</p>
              <p>The Buddha says, “Life is suffering”. What does “suffering” mean? The
                   sutras say: “Impermanence therefore suffering”. Everything is 
                  impermanent and changeable. The Buddha says that life is suffering 
                  because it is impermanent and ever-changing. For example, a healthy body
                   cannot last forever. It will gradually become weak, old. sick and die. 
                  One who is wealthy cannot maintain one’s wealth forever. Sometimes one 
                  may become poor. Power and status do not last as well, one will lose 
                  them finally. From this condition of changing and instability, although 
                  there is happiness and joy, they are not ever lasting and ultimate. When
                   changes come, suffering arises.</p>
              <p>Thus, the Buddha says life is suffering. Suffering means 
                  dissatisfaction, impermanence and imperfection. If a practising Buddhist
                   does not understand the real meaning of “suffering” and think that life
                   is not perfect and ultimate, they become negative and pessimistic in 
                  their view of life. Those who really understand the teaching of the 
                  Buddha will have a totally different view. We should know that the 
                  theory of “Life is suffering” taught by the Buddha is to remind us that 
                  life is not ultimate and lasting, and hence we should strive towards 
                  Buddhahood — a permanent and perfect life.</p>
              <p>This is similar to one who is sick. One must know that one is sick 
                  before wanting to seek the doctor’s treatment. Only then can the 
                  sickness be cured. Why is life not ultimate and permanent and full of 
                  suffering? There must be a cause for the suffering. Once one knows the 
                  cause of suffering, one will try one’s best to be rid of the causes, and
                   hence end the suffering and attain ultimate peacefulness and happiness.</p>
              <p>A practising Buddhist should practice according to the Buddha’s 
                  instruction, and change this imperfect and non-ultimate life to a 
                  ultimate and perfect one. Then would come a state of permanent joy, 
                  personality, and purity.</p>
              <p>Permanent means ever-lasting, joy means peacefulness and happiness, 
                  personality means freedom and non-attachment, purity means cleanliness. 
                  This highest aim of Buddhism is not only to break through the suffering 
                  of life but to transform this suffering life into a life that has 
                  permanent peacefulness, joy, freedom and purity. The Buddha told us the 
                  cause of suffering and instructed us to strive towards the goal. The 
                  stage of permanent, joy, personality and purity is an ultimate ideal 
                  phenomena. It is full of brightness and hope. It is a stage that is 
                  attainable by all of us. How can we say that Buddhism is negative and 
                  pessimistic?</p>
              <p>Although not all practising Buddhists are able to attain this highest
                   point of practice, there is still boundless benefit in knowing this 
                  theory. Most people know that they have to strive to do good when they 
                  are poor, but once they become rich, they forget about everything, and 
                  only think about their own enjoyment and hence walk towards the wrong 
                  path foolishly.</p>
              <p>A practising Buddhist should remember to strive not only when one is 
                  poor and in difficulties, but should also be mindful when one is 
                  enjoying, because happiness is not permanent. If one does not strive 
                  towards the good, they will degenerate and fall very quickly. The 
                  teaching of “Life is suffering” reminds us not to look forward for 
                  enjoyment only and go the wrong way. This is the important implication 
                  in the teaching of “Life is suffering”, taught by the Buddha.</p>
              <p>b. “Out worldly” (Supra mundane)</p>
              <p>The teaching of Buddha tells us that there is this world and the 
                  world beyond this. Many people think that this world refers to the world
                   that we are living in and the world beyond this is some place outside 
                  this world. This is wrong. We are living in this world and we remain 
                  here even if we become monks or nuns. The Arahats, Bodhisattva and 
                  Buddha are saints who have realisations beyond this world but they are 
                  still living in this world and giving assistance to us. Thus, 
                  “out-worldly” does not mean that one has to go away from this world and 
                  go to another place.</p>
              <p>What does “worldly” and “out-worldly” mean in Buddhism? According to 
                  the Chinese understanding “worldly” has the implication of time. For 
                  example, the Chinese regard thirty years as an “age” and in the West, a 
                  hundred years make up a century. Anything that exists within the time 
                  frame, from the past to the present and from the present to the future, 
                  is the “world”.</p>
              <p>The teaching of the Buddha is also as such. That which is changeable 
                  is called “worldly”. Within this time frame, from the past to the 
                  present, from the present to the future, from existence to 
                  non-existence, from good to bad, everything is changing continuously. 
                  Anything that is changing is called “worldly”. Besides, the word 
                  “worldly” also has the meaning of concealment. Normal people do not 
                  understand the cause and effect of the past, present and future. They do
                   not know where they come from, how to behave as a human being, where to
                   go after death, the meaning of life and the nature of the universe. 
                  They live ignorantly under the influence of the karma of the three 
                  births. This is called “worldly”.</p>
              <p>What does “out-worldly” (supra mundane) mean? “Out” has the meaning 
                  of beyond or superior. One who practices the teaching of the Buddha, has
                   wisdom and is able to understand the truth of the life and universe; 
                  has no defilements and is pure in one’s mind; and experiences the 
                  permanent Truth is called the “out-worldly” one. All the Buddhas and 
                  Bodhisattvas are living in this world. They have great wisdom in seeing 
                  the Truth and their minds are pure. They are not like the normal 
                  “worldly” people.</p>
              <p>Thus, the term “out-worldly” encourages all of us who are practising 
                  the Buddha’s teaching to progress further and become the man above the 
                  men, to improve ourselves from a worldly person to an out-worldly saint.
                   It is not asking us to go to another world. Misunderstanding 
                  “out-worldly”, some think that the principle of Buddhism is to run away 
                  from reality.</p>
              <p>c. Emptiness</p>
              <p>The Buddha says that everything is “empty”. Some think that this is 
                  empty, that is empty, or everything is empty. Since everything is empty,
                   and meaningless, one does not need to do either evil or good. These 
                  people understand the concept vaguely, and lead an aimless life. In 
                  fact, “emptiness” in Buddhism is the most profound philosophy. The 
                  Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are the people who have realised the truth of 
                  emptiness. “Emptiness” does not mean nothing at all, in contrast, it 
                  includes everything. The world is world, life is life, suffering is 
                  suffering, happiness is happiness, everything does exist.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, there is clear teaching as to what is right or wrong, 
                  good or evil, or cause and effect. One should turn away from the wrong 
                  one and redirect to the right one, refrain from evil and do more good. 
                  Those who do good will gain good effect, and if one practices one may 
                  attain Buddhahood. This is the cause and effect. If we say that 
                  everything is empty, then why are we practising the teaching of the 
                  Buddha? If there exist the karma, good and evil, worldly people and 
                  saint, then, why does the Buddha say that everything is empty? What is 
                  the meaning of emptiness?</p>
              <p>Things exist due to causes and conditions and do not have a real and 
                  unchangeable identity of itself. Thus, they are “empty”. The right and 
                  wrong, good and evil, and the life are not permanent and unchangeable. 
                  They exist due to causes and conditions. Since their existence is 
                  dependent on causes and conditions, they continue to change with the 
                  changes of the causes and conditions. They do not have a permanent form,
                   and therefore they are “empty”.</p>
              <p>For example, when one is facing a mirror, there will be an image in 
                  the mirror. The image is produced by various conditions. It is not a 
                  real thing. Although it is not real, it is very clear when we see it. We
                   cannot say that it does not exist. The concept of “emptiness” relies on
                   this truth that things arise due to causes and conditions. Thus, when 
                  the Buddha says that everything is empty, he is implying that everything
                   arises due to causes and conditions. A practising Buddhist must realise
                   and experience emptiness and understand the existence of the Law of 
                  cause and effect, good and evil. The perfect realisation of the two 
                  truths is that emptiness and existence are equivalent.</p>
              <p>2. Misunderstanding that arises from the system</p>
              <p>Buddhism originated from India. Its custom were different from the 
                  traditional customs of China. For example, the understanding of the 
                  aspects of renunciation and vegetarianism were different.</p>
              <p>a) To renounce (To take the vows of a monk or nun)</p>
              <p>To renounce is a custom in Indian Buddhism. In Chinese society, 
                  especially for the Confucianists, there are a lot of misunderstandings 
                  about this.</p>
              <p>In China, we always hear that, if everyone practised the teaching of 
                  the Buddha, then this world would become extinct. Why is it so? Because 
                  everyone would become monks or nuns (celibate). There would be no 
                  husband and wife, nor son and daughter. How then could society survive?</p>
              <p>This is a very serious misunderstanding. There is an example: The 
                  teachers teach the students. Will they encourage everyone to be a 
                  teacher, and therefore develop a world of teachers? In the Philippines, 
                  there is not much misunderstanding about this because there are Fathers 
                  and Sisters everywhere. They have also taken vows, but they are only the
                   minority among the Catholics. Not all Catholics must be a Father or 
                  Sister.</p>
              <p>For the Buddhists, there are the renounced ones and the lay people. 
                  One can practise Buddhism by renouncing, or as a lay person. One can 
                  practise in order to end the cycle of life and death by renouncing, and 
                  can also achieve the same aim by practising at home. It is not necessary
                   for Buddhists renounce themselves. It is also not true that if everyone
                   became a Buddhist, the world of the humans would become extinct. The 
                  question now will be, if one can attain the aim of ending the cycle of 
                  life and death by either practising as a lay person or as renounced 
                  follower, then why must one to renounce? This is because, in order to 
                  promote and encourage the spread of Buddhism, someone has to take the 
                  responsibility. The best person to take charge of this responsibility 
                  will be the renounced monks or nuns, as they do not have family 
                  responsibilities and are not involved in other work duties. Hence, they 
                  can concentrate more on their practice and the spreading of Buddhism. In
                   order to prolong the existence of Buddhism in this world, we need these
                   type of people to take responsibility. This is also the reason for the 
                  formation of the Sangha, the community of renounced ones.</p>
              <p>How great is the merit of renouncing? The merit of renunciation is 
                  very great. However, those who cannot renounce should not force 
                  themselves to do so. If one cannot practise in line with the teaching of
                   the Buddha after renouncing, it is worse then a lay follower. The 
                  higher one climbs, the worse will one fall. The merit of renouncing 
                  oneself is great, but if one is careless, one will deteriorate even 
                  more. One should develop one’s mind sincerely, practise diligently and 
                  sacrifice oneself for Buddhism. Then renunciation will be worthwhile. 
                  The Sangha (the renounced monks or nuns) are the centre members of 
                  Buddhism, they are the main force in the motivation of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>The practice of not getting married can also be found in the Western 
                  religions. A lot of scientists and philosophers also remain single so 
                  that they will not be disturbed by the matters in the family, and hence 
                  they can concentrate more on their studies and contribute more to the 
                  development of science and philosophy.</p>
              <p>The practice of renunciation in Buddhism is to get rid of one’s 
                  worldly attachment, and hence concentrate more on Buddhism. To renounce 
                  is an act of a great person, thus, one must put in extra effort. If one 
                  renounces without proper understanding, or without pure aims, one will 
                  not gain any benefit but will obstruct the development of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Some people want to renounce just after they begin to practice. They 
                  think that in order to practice the teaching of the Buddha, one must 
                  renounce. This is not correct and may frighten away the others from 
                  stepping into the practice of Buddhism. This kind of thought — that one 
                  must renounce in order to practice the Buddha’s teaching, is the thought
                   that all of us should avoid. One should recognise that it is not easy 
                  to renounce. One should first practise to be a good lay follower, 
                  practise for the sake of the Dharma, benefitting oneself and others. If 
                  one can develop one’s mind greatly and sincerely, practise the renounced
                   way, contribute to Buddhism first before one decides to renounce, it 
                  will be better for oneself and at the same time will not create any 
                  unpleasant influence to the society.</p>
              <p>With regards to renunciation, there are two points to mention here:</p>
              <p>a) Some people observe the spaciousness, majestic appearance, 
                  quietness and beauty of the temples and monasteries, and this arouses 
                  their admiration to be renounced. They think that the monks and nuns who
                   live inside there are just waiting for the offerings of the devotees 
                  and enjoying themselves. They do not need to do any work. The idioms 
                  such as “do not wake up even when the sun has risen up to three metre 
                  high”, or “cannot compare with even half-a-day’s freedom of the monk or 
                  nun” show the misunderstandings among the general people.</p>
              <p>They do not know that the monks and nuns have their own 
                  responsibilities, they need to strive hard. When they are practising 
                  themselves, they have to “practice diligently before and after 
                  midnight”; and in terms of their duty to the devotees, they should go 
                  around to preach the teaching of the Buddha. They lead a simple and hard
                   life, striving for the benefit of Buddhism and all beings, benefitting 
                  one and another. This is something very great. Thus, they are called the
                   Gem of Sangha. They are not just sitting there waiting for the devotees
                   offerings, waiting for things which are ready and never do anything. 
                  May be it is because of too many monks or nuns who are not fulfilling 
                  their responsibilities that leads to this misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>Some people who are against Buddhism say that the monks and nuns do 
                  nothing, they are parasites of society and are useless. These people do 
                  not know that it is not necessary for one to be engaged in the work 
                  force of agriculture or business in order to be considered productive. 
                  If it is so, then are people who choose to be teacher, reporter or other
                   occupations also considered as the consumers of society’s output too?</p>
              <p>It is not right to say that the monks or nuns have nothing to do. 
                  They lead a simple and hard life and striving diligently everyday. The 
                  things that they do, besides benefitting themselves, is to teach others 
                  to do good, to emphasise moral values and practices, so that the 
                  personality of the devotees can be improved, leading them to the end of 
                  the cycle of life and death. They bring great benefit to the people in 
                  the world. Thus, how can we say that they are the parasites that are 
                  doing nothing?</p>
              <p>The monks and nuns are religious teachers. They are profound and 
                  respectful educators. Thus, the saying of those who have no 
                  understanding on Buddhism, that the monks and nuns are doing nothing and
                   are the parasites wasting society’s money are in fact wrong. A person 
                  who really leads a renounced life is in fact not free, they are not mere
                   consumers but are busily repaying their gratitude to all living beings 
                  whenever they can.</p>
              <p>b) Chinese Buddhism emphasises a vegetarian diet. Thus, some people 
                  thought that one who practises Buddhism must be a vegetarian. People who
                   cannot stop eating meat misunderstood that they are not ready to start 
                  to learn about Buddhism. If we look around at the Buddhists in Japan, 
                  Sri Lanka, Thailand or Tibet and Mongolia, not to mention the lay 
                  followers, we find even the monks and nuns have meat in their diet. Can 
                  you say that they are not practicing the Buddha’s teaching? They are not
                   Buddhists?</p>
              <p>Do not think that one must be a vegetarian in order to learn about 
                  the teaching of the Buddha and that one cannot practise Buddhism if one 
                  cannot be a vegetarian. To practice Buddhism and be a vegetarian are not
                   the same thing. Some people who become a Buddhist, do not learn much 
                  about the teachings but only know how to be a vegetarian. This causes 
                  unhappiness among the members of the family. They feel that it is too 
                  troublesome to be a vegetarian.</p>
              <p>In fact one who is practising the teaching of the Buddha should: – 
                  after becoming a Buddhist – first understand the teaching of the Buddha 
                  and behave according to the teaching in both the family and the society.
                   Purifying one’s conduct and mind, so that the members of the family 
                  feel that one has changed for the better should be the goal. If before 
                  becoming a Buddhist, one was greedy, has strong hatred and lacked of a 
                  sense of responsibility and loving kindness; and after practising the 
                  Buddha’s teaching, one becomes less greedy, less paranoid and shows more
                   care to the others with a stronger sense of responsibility, then the 
                  members of the family would see the benefit of practising the Buddha’s 
                  teaching. At that time, if one wants to be a vegetarian, the family 
                  members would not object to it. In fact, they may also be encouraged to 
                  have sympathy towards other living beings and follow one to be a 
                  vegetarian. If one only knows to be a vegetarian after becoming a 
                  Buddhist and does not learn about others, one will surely encounter 
                  obstacles and cause misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>Although it is not necessary for a Buddhist to be vegetarian, it is a
                   good moral conduct in the Chinese Buddhism and is something that should
                   be promoted. The teaching of the Buddha says that becoming a vegetarian
                   will cultivate one’s loving kindness and compassion. By not harming the
                   life of other living beings, not eating the meat of the other animals 
                  one will reduce one’s karma of killing and strengthen one’s sympathy 
                  towards the sufferings of Mankind. Mahayana Buddhism advocates the 
                  practice of vegetarianism, and says that to be a vegetarian has great 
                  merits in cultivating one’s mind of loving kindness and compassion. If 
                  one becomes a vegetarian but does not cultivate the mind of loving 
                  kindness and compassion, it is only a practice of no killing in a 
                  pessimistic way. It resembles the practice of the Hinayanist.</p>
              <p>From the view point of the worldly Dharma, the benefit of becoming a 
                  vegetarian is very great. It is more economical, highly nutritious and 
                  may reduce illness. In the world at present, there are international 
                  vegetarian organisations. Everyone who likes to be a vegetarian may join
                   them. Thus, it can be seen that it is good to be a vegetarian. And as 
                  Buddhist who emphasises compassion, we should advocate the practice more
                   to others. However, one thing to note is that, do not claim that a 
                  Buddhist must be a vegetarian. Whenever meeting with a Buddhist, some 
                  will ask: have you become a vegetarian? Why are you still not a 
                  vegetarian after practising the Buddha’s teaching for so long? This will
                   frighten some people away. To regard practising Buddhism and becoming a
                   vegetarian as the same will in fact obstruct the spreading of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>3. The misunderstanding that arises due to the observances</p>
              <p>When non-Buddhists visit the monastery and see observances such as 
                  paying respect to the Buddha, intoning the sutras, repenting and the 
                  morning and evening chanting, they cannot understand the meaning behind 
                  them and comment that these are superstitious acts. There are many 
                  misunderstanding within this category. Now, lets briefly mention some of
                   them:</p>
              <p>a) To pay respects to the Buddha</p>
              <p>To pay respects to the Buddha when entering the monastery, to offer 
                  incense, flowers, candle and light to the Buddha are the observances of 
                  the Buddhist. The Theistic followers say that we are idol worshippers 
                  and superstitious In reality, the Buddha is the master of our religion, 
                  he is the saint who has attained the perfect and ultimate stage by 
                  practising from the stage of a worldly being. The great Bodhisattvas are
                   the Buddhas to be. They are our guides and indicators of refuge. We 
                  should be polite in showing respect to the Buddha and Bodhisattva just 
                  as when we show respect to our parents. When the Buddha was still in 
                  this world, there was no problem. One could show one’s respect to him 
                  directly. However, now that the Sakyamuni Buddha has already entered 
                  final Nirvana; and the Buddha and Bodhisattva of the other worlds are 
                  not in our world, we have no way to pay respects. Thus, we have to use 
                  paper to draw, ceramic, wood or stone to carve their images, to be the 
                  object of our worship. It is because of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, 
                  merits and images that we are paying our respect to them, and not 
                  because of they are the paper, earth wood or stone.</p>
              <p>It is similar to the way we respect and love our country. We use 
                  coloured cloth and make it into a flag. When the flag is flying, we pay 
                  respects to the flag. Can we say that this is also a superstitious act? 
                  The Catholics also have images in their church. The Christians, have no 
                  image of the God, but use the “cross” as the image for them to pay 
                  respect to. Some even kneel down and say their prayer. What is the 
                  difference between these acts and the paying of respects to the Buddha? 
                  To say that the paying of respects in Buddhism is idol worshipping, is 
                  just the intentional defamation of some people.</p>
              <p>What about the offerings of fragrance flowers, light and candle? 
                  During the Buddha time, the Indians offered these to the Buddha. Light 
                  and candle represent brightness, flowers represent fragrance and 
                  cleanliness. We believe in the Buddha and pay respect to the Buddha. The
                   offering of these things to the Buddha is to show our respect and 
                  faith. On the other hand, it means the gaining of brightness and purity 
                  from the Buddha. We do not offer flowers and incense so that the Buddha 
                  smells the fragrance; or offer light and candle so that the Buddha can 
                  see everything.</p>
              <p>Some religions, for example the Catholics, also use these things in 
                  their offerings. These are in fact the common observances among the 
                  religions. When we are paying respect to the Buddha, we should be 
                  respectful and sincere and contemplate on the merits of the real Buddha.
                   If one thinks of other things or talks while paying respect to the 
                  Buddha, it is not respectful and loses the meaning of the act of paying 
                  respect.</p>
              <p>b) To repent</p>
              <p>The non-Buddhist or free thinkers always feel that it is an act of 
                  superstition when they see Buddhists repent or chant. To repent is to 
                  admit one’s mistake. Everyone of us, from the past until the present, 
                  have committed countless wrong and evil deeds. We have left behind the 
                  karma that brings us sufferings and obstructs our progress towards 
                  enlightenment and freedom. In order to reduce and get rid of this karma 
                  that is obstructing and bringing suffering to us, we should repent in 
                  front of the Buddha or the Sangha and admit our mistakes, so that the 
                  past evil karma can be reduced. There are methods of repentance in 
                  Buddhism and these are equivalent to the confession’ in Christianity.</p>
              <p>This practice is very important for us to progress further along the 
                  path of Buddhahood. One must repent for oneself with great sincerity. 
                  Then this repentance can be beneficial and comply with the teaching of 
                  the Buddha.</p>
              <p>People generally do not know how to repent. So, what should we do? 
                  The great masters in the past thus compiled some procedures and 
                  observances that one could follow if one wants to repent. They taught us
                   to chant word by word, contemplate and understand the teaching behind 
                  it. The services of repentance teaches us how to pay respect to the 
                  Buddha, seeking for the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas, loving kindness and
                   compassionate protection. We should admit our own mistakes, knowing 
                  that killing, stealing and adultery are evil deeds, sincerely repenting 
                  our past evil deeds and be determined to practice for a better future. 
                  These are the procedures of repentance taught by the great masters in 
                  the past. However, the most important aim of these services is to 
                  develop one’s mind to correcting oneself and repent sincerely for one’s 
                  past evil deeds.</p>
              <p>Some people cannot even read the readily written procedures, hence, 
                  they invite the monks or nuns to lead them during the repentance. As 
                  time passes, it gradually turns out to be that these people do not even 
                  know that they should repent, and only employ the monks and nuns to 
                  repent for them. Some, when their parents or family members pass away, 
                  in order to release the past evil karma of the parents and the other 
                  family members, invite the monks or nuns to do a repentance service for 
                  them. They hope that relying on the merits of the Triple Gem, the death 
                  may be relieved from the realms of suffering. However, sometimes they do
                   not understand the real purpose of the teaching and only emphasise on 
                  how big the ceremony should be; or do it for the sake of tradition, and 
                  spend money to employ the monks or nuns to do the services for them. 
                  They do not have faith in Buddhism, and do not show any sincerity in 
                  repenting themselves. In this case the purpose of these repentance 
                  services will not be achieved.</p>
              <p>Gradually, the purpose of the services for repentance becomes vague. 
                  The Buddhist devotees do not repent and request the monks or nuns to do 
                  everything for them, As a result, the monks and nuns are busy with all 
                  these services all day; to do the service for this family today, and the
                   next family tomorrow. And these services become the only activity in 
                  some of the monasteries, with the main task of the monks and nuns being 
                  neglected. This is one of the causes of lack of faith in Buddhism 
                  nowadays.</p>
              <p>Repentance has to come from within. If one repents sincerely, even 
                  for just an hour, it has better merits than inviting a lot of people and
                   conducting a few days services but not repenting oneself. If one 
                  understands this theory, and would like to show one’s filial piety to 
                  the one’s parents, the best merit will be to do the repentance oneself. 
                  It is not right to regard the services of repentance or other services 
                  as the occupation of the monks or nuns, as this will not bring any good 
                  to the society, but creates more misunderstanding and defamation for 
                  Buddhism.</p>
              <p>c) Daily Chanting</p>
              <p>Some people who practices the teaching of the Buddha, recite the name
                   of the Buddha and chant the sutras every morning and evening as their 
                  daily homework. This is what we call daily chanting (prayer) in 
                  Buddhism.</p>
              <p>In Christianity, they have morning and evening, and meal time prayer.
                   The Catholic also chants in the morning and evening. There is nothing 
                  wrong with these religious ceremonies, but some Buddhists were concerned
                   about these matters and asked: “Maybe it is better not to practice 
                  Buddhism. Once one practices Buddhism, problems come. My mother spends 
                  at least one to two hours each morning and evening to do her chanting. 
                  If all practicing Buddhists are like this, then who is going to do the 
                  work at home?”</p>
              <p>Among some of the lay people, this is the real situation. They create
                   the misunderstanding that Buddhism is only suitable for the old people 
                  and those who are free, it is not suitable for the general people to 
                  practice. In fact, it is not necessary that one must chant a specific 
                  sutra, or recite a certain Buddha’s name or to intone for a long time. 
                  One can practise according to one’s wish. The duration of the practice 
                  should depend on the circumstances and the time that one has. The 
                  important thing in the daily practices is to recite the verse of taking 
                  refuge in the Triple Gem. The “Ten Vows of the Pu Xian Bodhisattva” is 
                  also important. The Buddhism sect in Japan, such as the Pure Land sect, 
                  the Tien Tai sect and the Secret sect, which originated from China, have
                   the daily practices of their own sect. They are simple and do not 
                  require too much time. This was the situation of Buddhism during the 
                  Tang and Song Dynasties.</p>
              <p>The daily practice in China over the last few centuries varied:</p>
              <p>i) In the forest monastery where there were hundreds of people, it 
                  took a long time to gather everyone together. In order to adapt to this 
                  special environment, the daily practices became longer.</p>
              <p>ii) Since the Yuen and Ming dynasties, the different sects in 
                  Buddhism merged. Thus, in compiling the procedure of the daily practice,
                   it included the practices of the various sects in order to suit the 
                  needs of followers. It is not necessary for a lay person now to follow 
                  all these procedures. In the older days, the Indians who practiced the 
                  Mahayana teachings practiced the Five Repentances six times per day. It 
                  does not matter if the time is shorter. The frequency of the practice 
                  may be increased.</p>
              <p>In short, to practice the teaching of the Buddha is not to chant 
                  only; and for one who is practising at home, one should not neglect 
                  one’s responsibilities at home because of long daily practices.</p>
              <p>d) To burn paper money after a death</p>
              <p>The Chinese in the olden days have the tradition of burning white 
                  silk when praying to the ancestors. They burn the silk so that the 
                  ancestors may use it. They were then replaced by paper; as it is more 
                  economical. Later, they used paper to make money, ingots, notes, and 
                  even houses and cars, and burn them for their ancestors. These are 
                  generated from the traditional customs of the olden days. They are not 
                  the teachings of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>However, there are also some good points about this. It allows the 
                  children to show appreciation to their parents. When they are drinking 
                  or eating, they think of their parents and ancestors. When they are 
                  living in good houses and wearing nice clothes, they remember their 
                  ancestors, and do not forget the help of their ancestors. This practice 
                  has the implication of remembrance. When Buddhism spread to China, in 
                  order to adapt to the Chinese culture, and for convenience sake, this 
                  practice was merged into the practice of chanting and paying respect to 
                  the Buddha. It arouses the criticism of others, and thoughts that 
                  Buddhism is superstitious and wasteful. Buddhists should understand this
                   and should not burn paper money as this is not the teaching of the 
                  Buddha. If one still wants to keep the tradition and want to show one’s 
                  remembrance towards the ancestors, then one may burn a little at home. 
                  But do not burn them in the temple or monastery as this will create 
                  misunderstanding of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>e) To draw lots, to ask for fortune, to divine</p>
              <p>In some Buddhist monasteries and temple, there is misbehaviour such 
                  as drawing lots, asking for fortune, divining etc. This arouses the 
                  criticism and ire of the society, and people say that Buddhism is 
                  superstitious. In fact, true Buddhists do not allow this behaviour 
                  (whether they are effective or not is another matter). One who is really
                   practising the teaching of the Buddha, should believe in the Law of 
                  Cause and Effect. If one has committed evil karma in the past or present
                   lives, one will not be able to avoid the effect of it through any 
                  methods.</p>
              <p>One who practises good acts will gain good fruit. One who does evil 
                  deeds will not be able to run away from the evil effects. In order to 
                  gain good effects, one must do more merits. A practicing Buddhist should
                   try to do more good deeds, according to the teaching of the Buddha, and
                   should not try to find short cuts and behave in a bad way.</p>
              <p>4. Misunderstanding that arises from the current development of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Many Chinese do not understand Buddhism and its development in the 
                  international level. They criticise Buddhism on their own accord and 
                  opinion, based on the current situation of Buddhism in China. The 
                  following are two commonly heard criticisms:</p>
              <p>a) The country will weaken and end if the people believe in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>They think that the end of India is due to its people’s belief in 
                  Buddhism. They want China too strong and hence subjectively conclude 
                  that the people should not believe in Buddhism. In fact this is totally 
                  wrong. Those who have studied the history of Buddhism will know that the
                   time when India was strongest was during the time when Buddhism was 
                  most popular. At the time of Emperor Asoka, he unified the whole India 
                  and spread the teaching of the Buddha to the whole world.</p>
              <p>Later, with the revival of the Brahmana practice, Buddhism was 
                  destroyed and India became more restless each day. When India was 
                  conquered by the Muslims and the British, Buddhism has already 
                  deteriorated to the stage of near to non-existence.</p>
              <p>Buddhism in the Chinese history also has a similar path. Now that we 
                  call the overseas Chinese the “People of the Tang”, and to call China as
                   the “Mountain of Tang”, shows that the Tang dynasty was the strongest 
                  dynasty in the history of China. And, that is in fact the time when 
                  Buddhism was at its high peak: After the destruction of Buddhism by 
                  Emperor Tang Wu Zhong, the Tang dynasty began to deteriorate. After the 
                  Tang dynasty, the Song Emperors, Song Tai Chu, Tai Zhong, Zhen Zhong and
                   Ren Zhong were all faithful followers of Buddhism. That was also the 
                  peak period of the Song dynasty. For the Ming Emperor, the Ming Tai Chu 
                  had had the experience of leading a renounced life, the Tai Zhong was 
                  also very faithful to Buddhism. Weren’t these the times when the country
                   was in good order, peaceful and strong?</p>
              <p>Although Japan is facing failure at the moment, they became one of 
                  the stronger countries in the world sometime after the Ming Zhi 
                  Revolution. Then, they were mostly Buddhist. Thus, who says that 
                  Buddhism will weaken a country? From the facts in the history, the time 
                  when a nation was strong was also the time when Buddhism was at its 
                  peak. Why are people wishing that the Chinese nation can become stronger
                   but at the same time condemn the propagation of Buddhism?</p>
              <p>b) Buddhism is useless to society</p>
              <p>The Chinese this century, see the Catholic and Christians’ 
                  contribution in setting up schools and hospitals, but little is being 
                  seen to be done by the Buddhists. Hence they feel that Buddhism is 
                  pessimistic and does not contribute to the social welfare of the 
                  society. This is a wrong concept. The most that one can say is that 
                  Chinese Buddhists this century were not hard working and responsible. 
                  This is not the attitude that the Buddha taught us to have.</p>
              <p>The Chinese Buddhist in the past also participated in the social 
                  welfare activities in the society. In Japan, Buddhists are at present 
                  setting up a lot of universities and high schools. The monks and nuns 
                  are the principals or lecturers of the universities or high schools. The
                   charitable work of the society is also conducted and organised by the 
                  Sangha of the monastery or temple. This is especially so in Sri Lanka, 
                  Burma and Thailand. The Buddhists in these countries maintain a very 
                  close relationship with the development of education and other 
                  charitable work in the society.</p>
              <p>Thus, one cannot say that Buddhism is not bringing benefit to the 
                  society, one can only say that the Chinese Buddhists have not fulfilled 
                  their responsibilities or acted as true followers of the Buddha. One 
                  should put more effort into these areas of charity in order to fulfil 
                  the basic teaching of the Buddha in relieving the sufferings of the 
                  world, and hence increase the popularity of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately many Chinese do not understand Buddhism well. Today we 
                  have discussed some of the common criticisms. I hope this has enabled 
                  you to understand better the wisdom of the Buddha’s teachings. I hope 
                  too, that you may practise according to the Buddha’s example, rather 
                  than allowing yourself to blindly follow meaningless and perhaps, 
                  unhelpful rituals.</p>
