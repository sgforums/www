              <h2>Dance In the Awakened State</h2>
              The wonderful thing about an evening of dancing is that
                  we can experience hundreds of moments of freshness, one after
                  another, all night long.  This open heartedness is
                  "the vibe" that we all share and love.
              <p>Those moments when we are dancing at our most
                  ecstatic and spontaneous best are moments without ego.
                  These are moments of experiencing basic goodness.
                  This is what we are cultivating while dancing.</p>
              <p>We can begin to notice moments of open awareness on a regular basis.
                  It is possible to remain undistracted from fresh awareness
                  for longer and longer periods of time, more and more often.</p>
              <p>If we find that the attempt to remain in contact
                  with basic goodness becomes a "thing", the best
                  approach is to forget about it for a while.
                  Freshness will find us again all by itself.
                  Real meditation is effortless and spontaneous.
                  We just need to be open to it.</p>
              <p>As time goes on we can discover that the awareness
                  of basic goodness has its own stability and its
                  own strength.  It is possible to get used to
                  the awakened state and remain undistractedly and
                  keenly aware without any special effort on our part.</p>
              <p>"In this moment, when past thought has gone and
                  future thought has not yet come, <strong>do not reconnect
                  to any thought...</strong> Be awake, vibrant, crystal-clear,
                  fully present."
                  <br><a href="http://innerrave.org/books.html#asitis">- Tulku Urgyen</a></p>
              <p>Dance and meditation come together in the experience
                  of absolute spontaneity!  When we are completely
                  in tune with the music, not a thought in our mind,
                  and no idea where the next beat will take us, then
                  we are in touch with our own spontaneous perfection.
                  This is dance as a spiritual path to enlightenment.</p>
              <p>The real awakened state is non-dual.  There is
                  no "us" meditating on something external.  In fact
                  there is no "meditation" per se.  Just real openness.
                  No conceptual thought.
                  Dance in the brilliant space of nowness!</p>
              <p>We can still walk, talk, and dance in the state
                  of openness, but with a difference.  All activities
                  are completely spontaneous and leave no trace.
                  This is real egolessness for as short or as long
                  as it lasts: two seconds, two minutes, or two hours.</p>
              <p>We may discover that we *like* the awakened
                  state and prefer it to the claustrophobia of our habitual
                  ego conceptualization.  Vividness is its own reward!
                  We can choose openness moment by moment.</p>

              <h2>The Authors</h2>
              <p>I am a happily married 47 year old computer
              programmer with two children, two cars
              (well, a station wagon for the family
              and a Westfalia camper van for outdoor parties!)
              and a mortgage.</p>
              <p>As dancers go I am a late bloomer.  I was bored with
              rock &amp; roll, bored my with life, bored with my meditation
              practice, overweight, out of shape, and drinking too much.
              Headed for an early heart attack like my father.</p>

              <p><em>John &amp; Katherine, January 1, 2000.</em></p>
              <p>In October of 2000 I was in London for a week on
              business.  I had seen all of the touristy things
              so I asked someone from the office if he would
              show me some of the real locals, maybe go out
              to a dance bar or something.</p>
              <p>He smiled and said OK!  He took me to the
              <a href="http://www.velvetroom.co.uk/">Velvet Room</a>,
              a small dark underground basement.
              Well, the music was definitely *not* rock &amp; roll,
              but what really caught my attention
              was <strong>the vibe</strong>.</p>
              <p>This was no drunken meat market pickup scene.  Every person
              in the room was consciously relating to and opening up to
              every other person in the room.  People were dancing.
              People were hugging.  I liked it!  And these people were
              obviously treating it as a spiritual journey.</p>
              <p>Back home Katherine and I checked out every dance
              bar in town.  The only place which had <strong>the vibe</strong> was the local gay/straight/whatever dance bar
              <a href="http://reflectionscabaret.com/"> Reflections Cabaret</a>,
              the Club Without Labels.</p>
              <p>We danced there every Saturday night for all of 2001
              plus a few amazing outdoor parties.  We lost weight,
              stopped drinking so much, got in shape and began to
              *really* enjoy our life!  10,000 volts in the
              romance department is all good for a marriage :-)</p>

              the Imperial Crown Princess Dita Parlow. </em></p>
              <p>Then in January of 2002 I read Tulku Urgyen's book
              <a href="http://innerrave.org/books.html#asitis"><em>As It Is</em></a> and
              put two and two together.
              Since I love dancing, and since I am a meditator,
              why not take dancing seriously as a meditative discipline?
              This site is our attempt to share that experience.</p>

              <p>There is one thing which is always the same whether
              we are partying, doing the dishes or making love.
              Freshness is always fresh!  Goodness is always good.
              Openness is always open.</p>
              <p>This is the continuity of the awakened state,
              always available, never changing.</p>
              <p>The spiritual path is the lifelong process of becoming
              stable in experiencing the continuity of the awakened state.</p>
              <p>It is possible to remain in undistracted freshness
              all day long.  This is the state of complete enlightenment,
              buddhahood.  Many thousands of people have arrived
              at total freedom in this way.  That is what I am working on.
              You can do it too.</p>
              <p>The awakened state is <strong>peace</strong>.  When we are
              not in a state of claustrophobia and suffering,
              there is less conflict within ourselves and with
              other people.</p>
              <p>The awakened state is <strong>love</strong>.  We can clearly
              see how others are tormented by their ego fixations.
              We have a natural inclination to help them wake
              up and become free of obsession.  We care for
              others one act of kindness at a time.</p>
              <p>The awakened state is <strong>unity</strong>.  Ego is based
              on duality.  Me and mine, us and them.  When ego
              oriented conceptualizing ceases, there is no them.
              There is only us.  We are all in this together.
              By changing ourselves, we are already changing our world.</p>
              <p>The awakened state is <strong>respect</strong>.  We clearly
              see that every single person possesses basic goodness
              and is worthy of respect.  We can respect the
              diversity of human experience rather than
              judge others based on a narrow view.</p>
              <p>The awakened state is <strong>sacred outlook</strong>.
              It is impossible to discover the awakened state
              and not feel awe and gratitude for everyone
              and everything that we come into contact with.
              The world is full of vivid and beautiful
              sights and sounds and amazingly sweet and
              open people.  We are all so lucky to be alive!</p>
              <p>The awakened state is <strong>the vibe</strong>.
              The shared experience of openness and unity while dancing
              is a celebration of the awakened state!
              This is a special group meditation practice that
              happens whenever a party goes off.</p>
              <p>The awakened state is <strong>enlightened society</strong>.
              If enough people hold the view
              of basic goodness and dedicate themselves to
              building a better world on a moment to moment
              basis then our world definitely will become a more
              compassionate and meaningful experience for everyone.</p>

              <h2>Meditate Anywhere Anytime</h2>
              <p>We have learned to meditate on the dance floor.
              We regularly notice moments of open heartedness.  We can dance
              keenly aware without any ego commentary for several seconds,
              perhaps even entire minutes at a time.  This is all good!</p>
              <p>The next step is to bring this practice into
              the rest of our lives.  This is the bridge between
              dance and life.  Better to meet all of life fully,
              cheerfully and productively than to only live
              for the weekend.</p>
              <p>The actual instructions for meditating during
              daily life are no different from the instructions
              for meditating while dancing.  We notice moments
              of freshness, and we let them continue for as
              long as they continue.  The main challenge is
              to remember to notice!</p>
              <h3>Any moment of contact with basic goodness is
              a moment of meditation.</h3>
              <p>All other moments are not meditation.  We are
              sleep walking, wandering in subconscious gossip.
              Being distracted from basic goodness ruins everything.
              The goodness of our life is wasted moment by moment.
              It doesn't have to be this way!</p>
              <p>Any moment of wakefulness no matter how brief
              is real contact with the awakened state
              of our enlightened nature.  They are mini
              moments of enlightenment.  One by one they
              dissolve our ego and confusion.</p>
              <h3>Meditate in short sessions, repeated many times.</h3>
              <p>When we notice a moment of freshness, it doesn't
              help to deliberately try to extend it.  Trying to
              extend a moment of freshness isn't really freshness.</p>
              <p>So the instruction is to notice <strong>many</strong> moments
              of freshness, one after another.  If they happen
              to continue, fine.  It not, fine too!  There are
              plenty more on the way.</p>
              <p>Do not fall into the trap of judging your meditation.
              When you realize that you have been wandering in
              confusion just return to openness and be happy
              to be awake again and again.</p>
              <h3>Meditate in Your Living Room</h3>
              <p>Pop a cd in the stereo.  See if you can
              get a groove on!  Dance for as long as the
              freshness lasts, then stop.</p>
              <h3>Meditate in Your Bedroom</h3>
              Meditation is not about trying to achieve
              a higher state.  It is about gently letting
              go of obsession, waking up to the moment
              and relaxing into natural open awareness.
              <p>There is nothing higher to achieve than
              the spontaneous perfection of our natural
              state just exactly the way it is right now.
              This is called "resting meditation".  Resting
              in natural wakefulness without any manipulation
              or correction of our state of mind.</p>
              <p>Sit upright on a pillow, cushion or chair with your
              eyes open.  Be aware of your environment and how you feel.
              Pay gentle attention to your out breath.  At the
              end of the out breath you may notice a moment
              of emptiness or open heartedness, a gap in ego's
              commentary.  Just relax during the in breath.</p>
              <p>If you find yourself lost in thought, think
              "thinking" to yourself and come back
              to the awareness of the out breath.
              Do this again and again.</p>
              <p><strong>Do not attempt to suppress your thoughts!</strong> Trying to stamp out thoughts is just another
              manipulative fixation and will not work.
              "I must stop thinking" is... a thought!
              One thought is fighting another rather
              than resting in natural awareness.</p>
              <p>Recognize that thoughts are simply thoughts!
              Stare right at them and they will dissolve into
              a moment of fresh unfixated awareness.
              This moment of recognition is instantaneous
              and effortless, and usually quite brief.</p>
              <p>Moments of fresh awareness will alternate
              with periods of being distracted by thoughts.
              Do not deliberately try to extend the moments
              of openness.  As soon as you notice yourself
              lost in thought recognize freshness.  Do this
              again and again, alternating between the two
              states many times.</p>
              <p>Sometimes a moment of open awareness will continue
              on for a while by itself with no effort on our part.
              When this happens there is no need to pay
              attention to the breath as a specific focus.
              Just hang out in thoughtfree awareness for
              as long as this lasts.  Open up and rest loose.
              It is quite pleasant and not a big deal.</p>
              <p>After a while, get up and do something else.
              No need for long grueling sessions.  Better to have
              several short sessions throughout the day.</p>

              <h3>Meditation Study</h3>
              Meditation and study compliment each other!
              The more we understand, the more we can connect
              with real wakefulness.  The more open our state of mind,
              the more we can understand.
              <p>I highly recommend reading several pages of
              <a href="http://innerrave.org/books.html#carefree">Carefree Dignity</a> every day.  It is one of the best meditation texts
              anywhere, readable and profound.</p>
              <h3>Meet a Meditation Master</h3>
              <a href="http://innerrave.org/books.html#carefree">Carefree Dignity</a> is a collection of talks given by
              Tsoknyi Rinpoche to beginning meditators.
              If you connect with his book you may wish
              to connect with Tsoknyi Rinpoche
              and his brother Mingyur Rinpoche in person.
              <p>Anyone is welcome to attend one of their week long
              "Introduction to the Nature of Mind" retreats.
              It is one thing to read about it but quite another
              to have the enlightened nature of your
              own mind directly pointed out to you by a
              realized meditation teacher in person.
              This can lead to complete confidence
              in our meditation practice.</p>
              <p>Here is their
              <a href="http://home.att.net/%7Epundarika/schedule.htm"> current retreat schedule.</a></p>
              <h3>Meditate Right Now</h3>
              Wherever you are and whatever you are doing,
              <strong>the best time to meditate is always right now :-)</strong>
              <p>The main challenge is to remember to recognize
              freshness.  Make a commitment to recognize
              as often as possible.  This commitment is
              the essence of the spiritual path.</p>
              <p>If you keep this commitment you will become
              enlightened and shine like a beacon of
              sanity in this world of confusion and
              suffering.

              <h2>Meditation</h2>
              Here is a more formal introduction to meditation,
              including a variety of exercises.  Try them for
              yourself and see which ones work for you.
              <p>The definition of meditation is "to be undistracted".
              The question then becomes "undistracted from what?"</p>
              <p>We possess six senses.  The traditional five are
              sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell.  In addition
              we have the mental faculty of awareness which perceives
              objects of the five sense fields as well as mental
              objects such as thoughts, memories and emotions.</p>
              <p>The following exercises are all "non blocking awareness"
              exercises.  Non blocking means that we are not blocking
              any of the sense fields and we are not blocking our
              thoughts.  This is very important to understand.
              We keep our eyes open and we stay open to all sensations
              and our environment.  We will never experience freshness
              by avoiding what is.</p>
              <p>Fresh awareness is the result of being undistracted and open
              to what is.  These exercises are training in freshness.</p>
              <h3>Visual Awareness</h3>
              Visual awareness of an object has two parts.  First, our
              eyes have to be looking at it.  Second, our mind
              needs to be aware of it.  If our mind is wandering and
              thinking about something else then we are not aware of
              the visual object even if our eyes are focused on it.
              That is called being distracted.
              <p>Pick a visual object in your field of view and look
              at it with your eyes and at the same time be aware of it
              with your mind.  Do not overfocus on it, concentrate, or
              try to block out any of the other senses or suppress
              your thoughts.  If your eyes play tricks on you
              such as seeing double pay no attention to that and
              continue looking at the object while being aware
              of the object.</p>
              <p>Do not label, judge or think about what you are seeing.
              Just the bare awareness of the visual object itself.
              Keep your eyes on the object.  Keep your mind
              merely aware of the object.  If your attention
              wanders off simply bring it back.</p>
              <p>That is meditation!  Nothing more to it.  You are being
              undistractedly aware of a visual object, and that is training
              your mind to be in the present moment, to be undistracted.</p>
              <p>The essence of sight is luminosity-emptiness, always
              fresh, never fixated.  Rest wide awake in that recognition.</p>
              <h3>Awareness of Sound</h3>
              If there is a continuous sound in your environment
              you can pay attention to that, or simply be aware
              aware of all sounds as they arise.  No need to focus
              your ear organs since they are always on.  If you find
              that your mind is no longer aware of the sound
              bring yourself back to bare awareness of the sound
              or sounds.
              <p>Do not think about what is making the sound
              or judge the sound as good or bad.  Just
              hear the actual sound itself without any
              conceptual filter.</p>
              <p>The essence of sound is communication-emptiness,
              always fresh, never fixated.  Rest wide awake
              in that recognition.</p>
              <h3>Awareness of Sensation</h3>
              Sit upright with your eyes open.  Place you mind in
              awareness of the sensations of your breathing in
              and out.  Your feel your chest and stomach move.
              You can feel the air moving in and out of your nose.
              If your mind wanders off, bring it back to undistracted
              awareness of the breathing process.
              <p>Do not overfocus in the breathing.  As an antidote
              for that, pay attention to the sensation of the outbreath
              and just relax during the inbreath.  Pay attention and relax,
              pay attention and relax.</p>
              <p>Do not attempt to suppress your thoughts or block out the other
              sense fields.  Simple bare awareness of the breath.</p>
              <p>The essence of sensation is presence-emptiness,
              always fresh, never fixated.  Rest wide awake
              in that recognition.</p>
              <p>Thats it!  Very easy and excellent awareness training
              using your sense fields.  You can make up your own exercises
              for taste and smell if you like.  I use chocolate and
              freshly roasted coffee beans :-)</p>
              <p>While dancing leave the sense fields wide open.
              Dance keenly aware and relaxed within the flow of
              sensation.</p>
              <h3>Awareness of Thoughts</h3>
              Just about every meditator, myself included, gets confused
              about what meditation is really about.  For example we
              might think "Since I regularly get distracted from nowness
              by getting lost in thoughts, therefore the solution is to stop
              thinking."  <strong>Not!</strong> We will never stop thinking.
              Attempting to suppress our thoughts is like a futile
              attempt to stop the wind itself from blowing.
              <p>Why is attempting to stop thoughts futile?  Because
              the thought "I must stop thinking" is a thought.
              The more we think that thought the more thoughts
              arise.  By fighting with them we are actually
              feeding them.  We end up with hundreds of thoughts
              and we feel defeated, like we are bad failed meditators.</p>
              <p>Whenever we have thoughts in meditation we should
              welcome them with open arms!  We say to ourselves:
              "I will notice every single thought the instant
              that it arises and I will recognize every single
              thought as being just a thought, nothing more,
              nothing less."</p>
              <p>The moment that we recognize that "this thought is just
              a thought" we are instantly liberated from this
              thought!  Since this is just a thought there is no need
              to follow it.  Since this is just a thought there is
              no need to get rid of it!  This thought becomes
              the expression of present awareness.  This thought
              loses its power to absorb us and fades by itself.</p>
              <p>The very next moment another thought may arise
              and we can recognize that this new thought is just a thought.
              One by one we are liberated from every single
              thought that arises.  Pretty soon all thoughts
              lose their power to entrap us.  They are all
              expressions of lucid wakefulness and no longer
              distract us from awareness.</p>
              <p>There is a famous saying "Seen by merely looking,
              freed by merely seeing."  It really is just that
              easy.</p>
              <p>The essence of thought is awareness-emptiness,
              always fresh, never fixated.  Rest wide awake
              in that recognition.</p>
              <p>People often try to escape from their obsessive
              thinking by way of alcohol and drugs.  That
              kind of relief is temporary and incomplete.
              While dancing liberate thoughts by recognizing
              them as simply thoughts.</p>
              <h3>Awareness Without Focus</h3>
              Once we have mastered undistracted awareness of the
              senses and learned to liberate all thoughts it is time
              to meditate without any focus at all.
              <p>The act of focusing on nowness is a subtle manipulation,
              a kind of holding on to something.  We can let go of that
              effort and rest in wakeful awareness without any focus
              at all.  Nothing to meditate on, yet not distracted
              from open awareness.</p>
              <p>This is called "undistracted nonmeditation".  Start your
              session by saying "I will not be distracted. 
              I will not meditate."  By nonmeditation we mean
              no focus, no effort, no manipulation, no modification
              of anything.  Really, seriously, don't meditate at all.
              Leave things just as they are!</p>
              <p>When thoughts arise welcome them with open arms
              as explained above.  When thoughts do not arise
              simply rest wide awake without doing anything at all.</p>
              <p>Do not modify your state of mind in the slightest.
              Accept it just as it is right now without any alteration.
              It is impossible to improve on nonconceptual awareness
              wisdom so don't bother trying!</p>
              <p>Just rest completely relaxed and vividly awake without
              holding any thought or concept in your mind.  Be undistracted
              from holding nothing whatsoever in mind.  This is the wisdom
              of unfixated open awareness which is always with us
              whether we recognize it or not.</p>
              <p>Rest easily, keenly aware, without any focus or effort.
              This is the awakened state.  Nothing more, nothing less.
              Anyone who composes themselves in the awakened state
              on a regular basis is quickly becoming enlightened.</p>
              <p>The essence of awareness is wisdom-emptiness, always
              fresh, never fixated.  Rest wide awake in that recognition.</p>
              <p>Dance in the awakened state, spontaneous, joyful
              and free.  Dance and meditation are one.

              <h3><em>Carefree Dignity</em></h3>
              <p>by Tsoknyi Rinpoche</p>
              <p>Tsoknyi Rinpoche is Tulku Urgyen's son.  He and his
              brother Mingyur Rinpoche teach
              <a href="http://home.att.net/%7Epundarika">widely</a> in the tradition of their father.</p>
              <p><em>Carefree Dignity</em> is a collection of talks given by Tsoknyi 
              Rinpoche
              to beginning meditators.  It is clear, friendly, accessible
              and profound - one of the best meditation texts anywhere.</p>
              <p>As you read it you will become familiar
              with a certain amount of buddhist terminology.
              When you come across unfamiliar terms just
              keep on reading.  Pretty soon you will figure
              out what they mean from the context.</p>
              <p>For example this site calls recognizing the
              nature of mind "freshness".  The Tibetan word

              pointed out in person by a realized master.</p>
              <p>If you connect with this book you may wish to connect
              with Tsoknyi Rinpoche and his brother Mingyur Rinpoche in person.</p>
              <p>Anyone is welcome to attend one of their week long
              "Introduction to the Nature of Mind" retreats.
              It can be a profound experience to have the enlightened
              nature of your own mind directly pointed out to you
              by a realized meditation teacher.</p>
              <p>Here is their

              <p>Here is a quote from page 158:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              For a beginner in this practice, in the first moment we notice
              that we are carried away, that we are distracted.  The second moment
              is to remind oneself to recognize the essence.  In the third moment
              one arrives back in the innate state.  That is the moment of 
              recognizing.
              <p>Sometimes it is possible to arrive in the state of rigpa while walking,
              sometimes while eating.  All of a sudden we are wide awake, in the state
              of rigpa.  Nowhere is it written that you can only recognize the nature
              of your mind while sitting on your meditation cushion!  For some people
              it may be easier to recognize mind essence while walking.  Rigpa is
              something which is possible to acknowledge at any moment, in any
              situation.  How can it happen at any time, in any situation?  When
              there's a gap between two thoughts, the intrinsic nature is revealed as
              self-existing awareness.  When the past thought has ceased and the 
              future
              thought hasn't occurred yet there's a gap, and in that gap you can 
              discover
              your intrinsic nature.  But this gap is not necessarily very long.</p>
              <p>That's why it is said "short moments, many times."  From this angle,
              then, within one meditation session it's fine to repeat the recognition 
              of
              mind essence many times - twenty times, thirty times, whatever.  First
              you recognize mind essence.  You let be.  You allow it to last a while.
              Then you lose track, you get distracted.  Then again at some point you
              remind yourself.  Again, let the meditation state last for a while.  In 
              this
              way you alternate between meditating and being distracted.  You 
              meditate,
              the meditation gets destroyed, you try again, it gets destroyed, you
              try again.  Like that.</p>
              <p>Getting really good at this meditation involves growing used to,
              getting accustomed to, rather than <em>doing</em>, because its not a 
              meditation
              on some "thing".  As a matter of fact, recognizing self-existing 
              awareness
              totally destroys the act of meditating.  Just let it be.  Immediately.
              Be sharp.  Direct.  Let be.</p>

              by Tulku Urgyen
              <p>Tulku Urgyen was one of the most enlightened
              beings on the planet.  <em>As It Is</em> Volume II
              is the main source of my current understanding
              of the spiritual path.  These are the teachings
              which lead to enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Do not make the mistake of thinking that you are
              reading philosophy.  You can experience every single
              thing pointed out in this book.  The awakened state
              is always <strong>right under your nose</strong>, so close you don't
              notice it!</p>
              <p>Here is a quote from Padmasambhava on page 141:
              <br> <em> 
              </em></p><hr><em>
              Empty cognizance of one taste, suffused with knowing,
              <br>Is your unmistaken nature, the uncontrived original state.
              <br>When not altering what is, allow it to be as it is,
              <br>And the awakened state is now spontaneously present.
              <hr>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>Here is a quote from Tulku Urgyen, page 209:</p>
              <hr>
              The nature of mind has a natural stability.
              This natural stability is evident when uninvolved
              in subject and object, not focusing on something
              as outside, not concentrating on something within.
              <p>In this moment, when past thought has gone and
              future thought has not yet come, do not reconnect
              to any thought.  To use Dzogchen terminology,
              it is to be awake, vibrant, crystal-clear, fully
              present.  These incredible words do not need
              our fabrication, our making.  They point to
              <em>what is naturally so</em>, not at what is cultivated
              through training.</p>
              <p><em>Amazing, natural awareness is beyond thought.
              <br>Vividly clear, there is no obscuration.
              <br>Nakedly manifest, there is no delusion.
              <br>Wide awake, there is no subject and object. </em></p>
              <p>The thoughtfree innate state is experienced
              in vividness.  We do not have to think of it
              to discover it.  The natural properties of
              rigpa are not conceptual.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The entire book is like this!  Practical heart to heart instructions
              on how to connect with the awakened state.</p>

              <h3><em>Shambhala, The Sacred Path of the Warrior</em></h3>
              <p>by Chï¿½gyam Trungpa</p>
              <p>A brilliant and readable book on the spiritual path.
              A warrior is anyone who is not afraid to be themselves
              and can fearlessly express their basic goodness and
              intrinsic dignity as a human being.</p>
              <p>Excellent presentation of basic goodness, ordinary magic, sacred 
              outlook,
              cosmic mirror, authentic presence, enlightened society, the kingdom
              of Shambhala.</p>
              <p>Here is a the beginning of chapter one
              <em>Creating an Enlightened Society</em>:</p>
              <hr>
              The Shambhala teachings are founded on the premise
              that there is basic human wisdom that can help
              to solve the world's problems.  This wisdom does not
              belong to any one culture or religion, nor does it
              come only from the West or the East.  Rather, it is a
              tradition of human warriorship that has existed in
              many cultures at many times throughout history.

              complete respect.
              <p>Don't use drugs to get "fucked up" or as an
              escape from awareness.
              <strong>Know</strong> your drug facts.
