Usually we never notice them and they pass on just like a movie without noticing the gaps between each frame.<br><br>During the concentration meditation, you will slowly notice the gap between each frame. As you become more aware, you will notice that the gap widen. This is the period that you feel that it is so quiet or "empty" and it is very serene or peaceful.<br><br>maybe this is what you meant by the empty?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

That coin is known as Buddha-nature in Buddhism.<br><br>Awareness brings about awareness of this.<br><br>When ppl meditate on Emptiness they sometimes fall into delusion when they only see the "Empty" aspect of Emptiness. This supposed Emptiness also has other properties. Emptiness is also all-encompassing. For example when you pour water into a space in a cup, this space will not reject the water. At the same time this space is not diminished.<br><br>The property of encompassing whatever you encounter  is none-other than Compassion. When you develope metta, arent you developing a capacity of acceptance for yourself, ppl around you, situations? Broaden this and encompass the whole universe<br><br>Your Buddha nature is also the Nature of Emptiness. True emptiness is not completely empty. You still need awareness to realise this. -- Surangama Sutta.<br><br>Your Buddha Nature is wholesome in itself. Words like Emptiness, Compassion are its properties, not itself entirely. This way you won't be confused.<br><br>In Theravada Buddhism, sometimes Vipasanna and Metta Bhavana are taught seperately. This can be a problem if you dun understand.<br><br></div>
