              Discomfort</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ven. Chang-Hwa Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-10-10 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The first challenge I encountered during the first year of my
              monastic training as a postulant was overcoming the discomfort from the clothes
              we wore. We had a special uniform—a long-sleeved, loose grey midi robe with
              long pants. In the winter, we could put on more layers inside and a black coat
              while outside. But in the hot summer, even when it was over 35ºC (about 95ºF,
              but it felt like 100ºF due to the humidity), we still needed to wear our
              uniform day and night without air conditioning. This was really too much for
              me, especially after I had become so used to the comfortable weather in the
              Westwood/Santa Monica area of California. We were sweating all the time—it felt
              like our bodies were soaking in salty water. It was even worse during
              morning/evening services and chanting ceremonies because we were required to
              wear another black maxi robe with long sleeves. I could not imagine how I would
              tolerate the habit after ordination, which has the additional layer of a
              long-sleeved maxi robe and long grey tube socks. Because of this, I also felt
              sympathy for Roman Catholic nuns!</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One day during class, some of us proposed a plan to reform
              the sangha uniform. We did not ask much, just to change the length and size of
              the sleeves. In the Buddha’s age, monastics exposed their right shoulder. The
              Tibetan monastic habit also exposes the arms. Even the robes of the Theravada
              tradition look cool. We argued back and forth with our supervisor, almost like
              warriors fighting for the benefit of the whole sangha. In the end, our
              supervisor suggested that we chant “Nam Mo Chin Liang Di Pu Sa Mo He Sa” (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">å�—ç„¡æ¸…æ¶¼åœ°è�©è–©æ‘©è¨¶è–©</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">). I felt so frustrated—was this a kind of brainwashing? Why
              do we need to chant “Cool Ground Bodhisattva” for help when some simple
              practical changes would resolve the problem? The next day, it was our executive
              head nun’s class. She seemed to have been notified of our proposal, and she
              shared how she overcame the heat by contemplating body sensation, just like how
              we deal with leg pain during long meditation sessions during retreat. She
              further explained that the purpose of chanting the “Chin Liang Di (Cool Ground)
              Bodhisattva” was to remind us to cool down our vexed, excited minds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Days later, it was our Shifu’s class. Obviously, everything
              was reported to him. He looked at us just like a father looks at his naughty
              children. He first told us how precious it is to follow the Chinese Buddhist
              tradition, especially for female monastics. Then he reminded us that Chinese
              monastics have worn this same habit for hundreds of years. Even now, all
              members of the sangha members wear it just fine, he noted, adding that we would
              soon get used to it. “No one will change our habit, not in my lifetime,” he
              cautioned. “Besides, as Chan practitioners, instead of trying to change
              conditions for the comfort of our six sense organs, we need to constantly train
              our minds to bear and accept discomfort to a larger extent; this is the
              practice of forbearance . . .” None of us ever talked about the uniform reform
              plan again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">That was the first time I realized how avidly I used to avoid
              discomfort. As a monastic, I cannot wear fewer clothes or turn on the air
              conditioning when I feel hot. I need to train my mind to remain at ease when my
              six sense organs are out of their comfort zone. Later on, after full
              ordination, I began to understand why we have 350 precepts to keep. Some of
              them help us to avoid the distraction of the attachments of our six sense
              organs in daily life. For example, we wear only grey, black, and dark brown, so
              there are no beautiful colors from which to pick and choose. Our heads are
              shaved, so there’s no need to worry about hairstyles or our appearance.
              Everything we use, including soaps and lotions, is odor-free to avoid
              attachment to fragrance, etc. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Among the six sense organs, mind training is definitely the
              hardest. Body sensation is also very hard to handle, such as heat, cold,
              itching, and pain, especially from sickness. It was a live example for us to
              see how Shifu handled his pain from cancer and the itching from kidney dialysis
              during his final four years. He told us that his body was in great pain and
              that the itching went deep into his bones, yet his mind was not suffering or
              vexed. Despite such extreme conditions, he still managed to do what needed to be
              done until the day his body was no longer functional. I don’t know if my
              practice will ever reach the level at which my mind can totally detach from the
              influence of extreme body discomfort, but I know for sure that it can be
              achieved.</span></p>
