              <p><strong>Joel Groover:</strong> So one question I had about your <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/The+Three+Speed+Transmission">Three
               Speed Transmission</a> had to do with when to try to incorporate what 
              you call 3rd Gear practice. How do you know when to do it? I see 1st 
              Gear as just infinitely vast territory. So do I not bother with the 2nd 
              or 3rd gears until I have made a lot of progress in 1st gear, or do you 
              go along with trying to do all three from the beginning? What is your 
              recommendation?</p>
              <p><strong>Kenneth Folk:</strong> I recommend that you follow your 
              interest. There will be times when, out of a clear blue sky, somebody 
              will say something like “It is already done. There is awareness in this 
              moment. You don’t have to do anything about that. You are home. Just 
              stop.” Well, that is 3rd Gear. There are seasons of development in 
              practice. One of the seasons is to be very receptive to this particular 
              instruction. In a moment of feeling tired and overwhelmed and at wit’s 
              end with all of this working-toward-something-in-the-future, it’s 
              possible to take a break and realize that what you really want is 
              already done. And why not? Why not be happy now?</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> But then we would have nothing to do.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Ha! And then the season changes and we go out 
              and we find something to do.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> So each practitioner will have a sense of where 
              the work needs to be done, right?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Right. This naturally happens with 2nd Gear as 
              well. You might be practicing–and who knows when this will happen–for me
               the 2nd Gear practice got really interesting after I had already 
              attained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_enlightenment">Fourth 
              Path</a>. I was reading Ramana Maharshi and realizing that he was 
              talking about something that was not entirely clear to me. That didn’t 
              really surprise me, because I understood that there were traditions 
              other than Theravada Buddhism. I had been practicing, after all, for 
              more than 20 years and had lots of exposure to other traditions. I knew 
              that a lot of traditions did not consider arahatship to be the entire 
              understanding and that even within Theravada Buddhism there is a big 
              difference between an arahat and a buddha. So I started looking around 
              to see if I could understand what that was, what that could be.</p>
              <p>And so when I stumbled upon this idea, or <a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2010/04/the-witness-turning-the-light-around-2/">this
               practice</a>, of turning the light of attention around, turning the 
              light of attention back on itself and dwelling as the Witness, dwelling 
              as the “I am”—I’m using terminology from all different places here, but 
              that is how I think of it–this was a revelation to me. To really do 
              Ramana Maharshi’s practice, to ask this question “Who am I?” And to 
              realize that there is this sense of a transpersonal Witness that can be 
              taken as object–to dwell as that Witness—all of that is very different 
              from vipassana. This has to be considered an entirely different category
               of practice, because vipassana is all about the objects and this 
              Witness practice is all about the subject.</p>
              <p>So when the focus is on the object, that is what I call 1st Gear; 
              when the focus is on the subject, that is what I call 2nd Gear. It’s a 
              completely different category of practice. It leads to a different 
              understanding. It objectifies different strata of mind, because you want
               the whole package, and this is not an investigative practice in the 
              sense that vipassana is. We are not interested in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence">Three 
              Characteristics</a> when we do 2nd Gear practice. We are not interested 
              in deconstructing anything. When you dwell as the Witness you are just 
              dwelling as the Witness. You are objectifying the subject, which 
              essentially makes no sense, but it turns out to be possible. Even the 
              subject can be taken as object, and then the experience is that there is
               this infinite subject, and everything else is part of that.</p>
              <p>So this sense of “I” is all-consuming and this Witness is complete. 
              It feels complete unto itself. It does not want to do anything except to
               make love to itself.</p>
              <p>You are humming along in this very stable experience of the 
              transpersonal Witness that knows <em>all this</em> and all of the 
              objects are seen as just part of the subject. Now, later on as you 
              continue to dwell as the subject, the Witness softens. In my experience 
              it took several years of nonstop dwelling as the subject—every time I 
              could think about it, asking “Who am I?”</p>
              <p>Every time I could remember to do it, I would ask “Who am I?” and 
              dwell as the “I am” just as Ramana suggested. I believed what he said. 
              For some reason, I found Ramana to be a very credible voice. He said the
               “I am”—dwelling as the Witness—is the stick that stirs the fire and is 
              eventually consumed by it. Well, I believed him and I found that to be 
              true, that you just dwell as the Witness with no effort to penetrate it,
               understanding that it will eventually burn itself out.</p>
              <p>You will come to the next, more subtle level of understanding, where 
              it is understood or it is seen that even the Witness itself is known by 
              an even more subtle sense of knowing that arises along with each thing 
              that is known… at that point you have arrived at <em>sat-chit-ananda</em> (being-consciousness-bliss).</p>
              <p>Now there is even more, and this is the convergence of 2nd Gear and 
              3rd Gear, when even the subtle sense of knowing goes away. You 
              transition from 2nd Gear to 3rd Gear and there’s just awareness without 
              any sense of a knower, or without any sense even of objects. There’s 
              just awareness which has not yet diverged into subjects and objects.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Now when it comes to that—3rd Gear practice as 
              such—is it the case that we are all basically doing “fake it until you 
              make it” practices in which we are sort of trying to not do anything at 
              all in order to allow this to just be as it is, and that there will be 
              those who have the actual 3rd Gear realization and people who are just 
              sort of doing a practice that might ultimately lead to that?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> “Fake it ‘till you make it” is an important 
              aspect of 3rd Gear practice because if you are going to teach 3rd Gear, 
              you want it to be accessible to everybody who is listening to your 
              teaching. And yet people are going to feel this experience at whatever 
              level they are capable. People are distracted to varying degrees. When 
              you are not distracted from Awareness at all, <em>you just go away</em> and there is just awareness. So that would be the pure and complete 
              understanding of 3rd Gear.</p>
              <p>And finally, there is a development that transcends and includes 3rd 
              Gear, where all three gears are integrated as a seamless whole: not-one,
               not-two. Subject, object, and awareness can be, as <a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/author/hokaisobol/">Hokai Sobol</a> says, “distinguished, but never separated.” So enlightenment is finally 
              seen as the integration of the time-bound and the timeless, in which 
              neither is reified and neither is denied. They are not picked apart and 
              they are not smashed together. When sages say that “things are as they 
              are,” it isn’t because they are trying to be cute; it’s just that there 
              isn’t a better way to say it.</p>
              <p>But while people are focusing on their 3rd Gear practice, there is 
              this whole range of experience that can happen (including 
              no-experience). They are all valid. They are all legitimate, and they 
              are in many cases “fake it ‘till you make it.” Yogis are experiencing 
              something. They are experiencing this surrender, and so they are less 
              distracted than they were a minute ago.</p>
              <p>In a 3rd Gear practice the idea is to allow recognition of the 
              awareness in which that situation arises. This is one of the reasons 
              that the Three-Speed Transmission is effective, because it scaffolds you
               into 3rd Gear. There are ways—the Advaita teachers and the Tibetan 
              Dzogchen teachers are the masters of this—to talk people into allowing 
              this recognition of awareness.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing-out_instruction">Pointing 
              out instructions</a>?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes. It usually takes time. It is nice if you 
              can take 20 or 30 minutes to lead somebody into this recognition, and it
               takes a skilled teacher to do it. But you can also get there yourself, 
              in a way that doesn’t require anyone to lead you. If you practice the 
              Three Speed Transmission, you eventually get to the point—in 2nd 
              Gear—where there is nowhere else to go; when you get to the recognition 
              of the subtle sense of knowing that arises along with each thing that is
               known, you cannot get behind that. And yet you can see–there is a 
              subtle drive, I suppose, to let even that go and to get to the next 
              level of understanding, the higher level of understanding, whatever that
               is. It turns out that the only thing you can do at that point is to 
              surrender. It is a natural thing to just give up entirely and let 
              awareness recognize awareness as it is.</p>
              <p>So 2nd Gear leads to 3rd Gear, and this is very much a part of 
              Advaita Vedanta. This is what it means—this is what it really means when
               Ramana Marharshi says “the stick that stirs the fire and is eventually 
              consumed by it.” When the Witness is consumed, you have just made the 
              leap into 3rd Gear.</p>
