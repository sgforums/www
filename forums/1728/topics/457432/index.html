              <p><br> Thusness and I have found Tommy M.'s writings on the Facebook group 
              "Useful Talk" to be well written with great clarity of insight and 
              experience. Tommy is a seasoned practitioner who participates as a 
              moderator in Daniel Ingram's online community Dharma Overground. He had 
              recently started a blog with very good and practical advises, <a href="http://methodsofawakening.blogspot.co.uk/methods-of-awakening-attentiveness.html">Methods of Awakening</a></p>

              <p>Here is a compilation of some of his postings (not in particular order):</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I
                   realized tonight that I've replied to several posts but never actually 
                  introduced myself, and given that I tend to be a wordy and annoyingly 
                  verbose writer who's style can sometimes present an air of authority, I 
                  figured it'd be useful to say hello and clear a few thing up in case my 
                  replies are taken as anything other than opinion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My 
                  name's Tommy, I have a practice history of around 15-16 years in various
                   traditions, methods and techniques ranging from Buddhism to Magick. I 
                  enjoy helping people with their practice if I can, as well as learning 
                  more about my own practice and how to live a better, happier and more 
                  helpful life. It's that simple, I'm no authority and I don't claim to be
                   an expert in anything; what I say is based on experience, not on what 
                  I've read in a book or online or heard from someone else, my current 
                  practice is (loosely) within Buddhist models although I tend towards a 
                  more freestyle approach. Basically: if it works, use it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yeah,
                   this probably comes off as some egotistical, "look at me" thing, but 
                  it's not the case and is certainly not the intent with which I post 
                  this. I just know that my way of writing can make me seem like a bit of a
                   prick to some and wanted to point this out before I continue to post. I
                   hope you all manage to find an end to suffering, stress, tension, 
                  unhappiness or whatever it is that you're seeking and am happy to be a 
                  member of the community with you all. Peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perception
                   could be described as the coming together of sense consciousness with 
                  it's corresponding point of contact and sense object, i.e. 
                  ear-consciousness, hearing and sound = perception of sound; it becomes 
                  apparent through observation that there is no distinction between the 
                  process of hearing and the sound heard, any division between the two is 
                  entirely implied by some thought via belief or some unquestioned 
                  assumption about what reality 'is'. If this is experienced clearly 
                  through direct observation, attentiveness or mindfulness (done properly)
                   of this moment-by-moment process of sensate contact - not simply 
                  through an intellectual cognition or initial insight into what it truly 
                  means to experience no sense of a 
                  self/Self/Soul/agent/do-er/center-point/Astral Voodoo Dropkick 
                  Monster/whatever - then the duality breaks down further and another 
                  level of experiencing presents itself, vivid and immediate, just as it 
                  always has been. Yet even though that mode of experiencing is, in my 
                  opinion, far preferable to any other way of living, it seems possible to
                   go beyond even that! Although by that point, such distinctions - not 
                  just intellectually but experientially, as actuality presenting itself, 
                  just part of this luminous interplay of sensations - no longer occur and
                   so to even describe it as such would be misleading. Suffice to say, 
                  it's pretty fucking cool.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please understand that I 
                  don't mean that comment about "intellectual cognition or initial 
                  insight...etc" in any derogatory or insulting sense, I'm just being 
                  upfront about what I see and read here sometimes. It's not as simple as 
                  having just "become liberated" or "awakened" or any of those labels for 
                  what is obviously a worthwhile realization; I've been there too and 
                  thought I was King Shit, how "I Am Everything &amp;amp; Everything Is 
                  Me" and all that bullshit where you think you've finally cracked it, 
                  only to have reality kick you in the ass with a lesson in why it sucks 
                  to have to deal with the push/pull of a continuing, albeit subtle at 
                  first, duality between subject and object. I’m not saying I’m anything 
                  special, an expert, authority or some super-enlightened teacher or 
                  whatever, I’m just a guy who’s been doing this for a while and found out
                   that this shit goes waaaaaayyyyyy further than you might think. When I 
                  use phrases like “beyond imagination”, I mean them literally and with 
                  total sincerity; if you’re contented to be where you’re at, so to speak,
                   that’s absolutely fine and I support that 100%, however my ongoing 
                  experience has convinced me that, although you’ve see that there never 
                  was such a thing as a self, the metaphorical rabbit hole is deeper than 
                  some smart-arsed comment I can’t think of right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inges,
                   I didn't mean to imply that you or anyone else on here had only 
                  experienced an intellectual cognition, I was indicating that such a 
                  level of understanding is quite easy to come upon but that it's very 
                  different, as you know, from experiential realization.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When
                   I say that "duality breaks down further", I mean that literally; 
                  although you've seen through the illusion of a self, there is 
                  undoubtedly still a subtle, or perhaps not-so-subtle imputation of a 
                  subject/object which is created, at it's most gross and obvious level, 
                  by a lack of clarity with regards to the arising of emotion/affective 
                  feeling. In comparison to how you experienced the world "before", this 
                  current level of clarity and non-dual awareness seems incredible, but it
                   becomes 'normal' after a while; those habitual tendencies to reify a 
                  subject to the apparent objects will recur until you’ve eliminated the 
                  fundamental ignorance which leads to their arising. Note too, when I use
                   the term “ignorance”, I don’t mean it in a insulting way, I’m using it 
                  in the sense it’s used in Buddhism to indicate a lack of insight into 
                  the nature of things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Continuing to examine and 
                  investigate your experience, just as you have, will continue to reveal 
                  more and more layers of belief, conditioning, volitional formations and 
                  unquestioned assumptions about experience to be dissected and seen for 
                  what they are: Mental fabrications. I know that my suggesting that, 
                  somehow, you’re not “there” yet might seem insulting or arrogant, and 
                  perhaps it is, but I’d ask you to look closer at who or what it is 
                  that’s “insulted by” the suggestion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Then you write:</p>
              <p>---"Yet it seems possible to go beyond even that! "--</p>
              <p>but you don't explain where, what and how. Can you say more about that?”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To
                   say that it seems “possible to go beyond even that”, is admittedly 
                  inaccurate as it implies that there is any sense of a “that” or “this” 
                  or anything involving location, direction, dimensionality or space. I’ll
                   describe a brief overview of how things have progressed for me, 
                  experientially, since initially realizing Anatta:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seeing
                   through the illusion of self is like opening the door into wonder, but 
                  taking your first tentative steps into that amazing clarity and 
                  vividness leaves you blinded somewhat. You think that you’ve made it 
                  through and experienced “awakening” or “enlightenment” ‘cause it’s like 
                  you’ve woken up from the dream that “you” even existed in the first 
                  place...it’s like the seconds after you wake up on a sunny morning, not 
                  knowing who or where you are, or what the day holds, everything fresh 
                  and new...but your eyes become accustomed to the ‘light’ and you begin 
                  to see that, rather than being anywhere “else”, you’re still right where
                   you were but with this new understanding and clarity. As you wander 
                  through this seemingly new world, you meet others and you start to reify
                   this new “identity”, this “I without an I” if you like, like a hollow 
                  mould onto which you carve your new life as “liberated”, or 
                  “enlightened”. Slowly but surely though, the old habits come back and 
                  you find yourself getting pissed off at people, being annoyed by current
                   events, emotionally perturbed by day-to-day disagreements, but all this
                   while telling yourself, like a mantra, “there’s no “me” there to feel 
                  this way so I don’t need to deal with it”. Continuing to investigate my 
                  immediate sensate experience, seeing how there is no subject to be 
                  found, that permanence and change are only imputations of mind, and how 
                  clinging/craving any of ‘this’ just led to the same cycle of bullshit 
                  eliminated even that; thought, feeling, identity, Self, Soul, agent, 
                  do-er, feeler, no affective emotional qualities whatsoever, just this 
                  complete stillness, peace and absolutely no sense of mental ‘movement’.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But
                   ‘further’ still, recently the entire construct of body and mind as 
                  having any sort of objective existence began to dissolve entirely! To 
                  experience the world as the world experiencing itself, so to speak, 
                  direct and intimate, like living life in High-Definition, even the sense
                   of existing as this physical form drops off completely; not that the 
                  body isn’t still ‘here’ and doing it’s thing, but it’s experienced as a 
                  dance of instantaneous, self-liberated, luminous sensation, not as “the 
                  body” or “the mind”. Yet things continue to deepen, to develop and 
                  change without any effort on “my” part, just this dance of creation 
                  doing what it does. Please note that I am using these words literally, 
                  when I say that the mind and body ‘drop away’, they appear to do so and 
                  all that’s left is what I can only describe as 'pure experiencing'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does
                   that give any sort of indication what I’m talking about? I’m not trying
                   to say I’m any sort of expert, all I can ever know is my own experience
                   but certain things in how others communicate their insights take on a 
                  completely different level of clarity after you’ve been there too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lisa,
                   when I use the word "experiencing" I am simply referring to basic 
                  sensate perception, i.e. seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, 
                  &amp;amp; thought. Even after a 'shift' into an entirely new perceptual 
                  experience, the world continues to be experienced as these six streams 
                  of consciousness; sense consciousness itself is equally transient, empty
                   and self-liberated, but it's arising is still dependent on conditions. 
                  Any better? :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jackson, I 
                  really like the way you describe this here: "The perceptual experience 
                  is a complete unitary gestalt." I often use the term "gestalt" when 
                  trying to describe the complete unification of the sense-field that 
                  occurs, however it fascinates me that even the apparent unity itself can
                   be broken by observing how the non-simultaneous nature of perception is
                   illusory too; in other words, it all seems to be happening at once, no 
                  sense of any passage of time or continuity between one moment and the 
                  next. Wonderful fun!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It seemed 
                  much more fragile &amp;amp; thin when I first began to encounter it, but
                   it's just the absence of any stability or anything for "me" to cling to
                   that makes it seem 'thin' or somehow insubstantial. I no longer 
                  experience 'this' reality, as in the way things were experienced prior 
                  to the elimination of the sense of being, and haven't done so for at 
                  least six weeks, and the memory of what it was like to live any other 
                  way seems so distant that it's like remembering a dream. You'll almost 
                  certainly have experienced this at some point in your life, but to live 
                  it 24/7 is really quite something &amp;amp; well worth it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Delma,
                   I tend to avoid framing my practice within the Actualist model for a 
                  number of reasons. If you're familiar with the festival of butthurt that
                   happens on the DhO every time the subject comes up, you'll know what I 
                  mean. The term "cessation of being" is, as far as I know, more of a 
                  Buddhist thing but it's an adequate description regardless of tradition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lisa,
                   it's hard to describe purely because I know that it's easy to confuse 
                  with lots of other things depending on where you're at. The sense of 
                  being, as I'd describe it anyway, is that fundamental sense of existence
                   which underlies every experience. It's what remains once the self has 
                  been seen through, but it still implies some sense of a subject or 
                  something which seems to be aware of this experience as it happens and 
                  so still implies a false duality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I
                   wasn't looking to add anything, I just find your inability to discuss 
                  the practical aspects of meditation &amp;amp; your insistence on the 
                  whole 'nothing need be done' to be laughable, not to mention unhelpful 
                  given the context you're posting in. I'm not saying you're 'wrong' in 
                  saying that there is nothing to be done, but you seem to be unable to 
                  grasp the fact that such a realization, even in your own experience, 
                  requires 'effort' at some stage simply by the application of 
                  attentiveness/mindfulness to ones immediate experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Feelings
                   can only appear in relation to an object which is not clearly 
                  experienced via the six sense doors. They are always feelings ABOUT 
                  something and their appearance is part of what leads to the creation of a
                   subject, an “I”, who is there to experience this apparent object, that 
                  which is perceived as “not I”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When there is no subject to be found, how is it that objects continue to be perceived?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What’s still implying that “you” have control over any of this experience called “life”?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What’s still hiding in the shadows, pretending it’s something other than it really 'is'?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you were to drop dead right now, what would actually change in the world?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a few things to consider if you're still interested in unraveling the knot...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There
                   is no subject whatsoever beyond it's imputation, whether genuine or 
                  otherwise. If you still experience ANY sort of sense of an observer or 
                  subject or even a body to whom this is happening, you're not done and 
                  there are still a LOT of knots to be unraveled.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I
                   write a blog called "Methods of Awakening" which may be of interest to 
                  some of you, I'm still in the process of finishing up about 10+ articles
                   to post so forgive the sparseness at present.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My focus
                   is on practical, down-to-earth, bullshit-free techniques and methods 
                  available, from various traditions, which can allow a person to develop 
                  further insight into their experience and free themselves from the 
                  ignorance which prevents us from seeing clearly. I'm not a teacher or 
                  any sort of expert, what I write about is from empirical experimentation
                   and personal experience over several years, so please don't take my 
                  opinion as any sort of authority. I just figured some people may find 
                  some use in this particular article.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apperception,
                   depending on the context it's used in, could be described as being 
                  direct perception of that instant of sense contact before the mind 
                  develops a feeling (positive, negative or neutral) about some stimuli 
                  and then subsequently labels/conceptualizes it. What you're describing 
                  as "direct experience" here, particularly the mention of "realness" and 
                  the completely different way of experiencing, sounds to me like you've 
                  probably encountered apperception. That way of experiencing becomes the 
                  baseline at one stage in practice and is such a hugely different, not to
                   mention freeing, way to live that it's literally beyond imagination, 
                  purely because to apperceive a 'thing' can't be imagined, only 
                  experienced directly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the
                   initial realization of anatta (not-self, rather than no-self), may 
                  bring about a period of apperception, normal perception tends to return,
                   albeit different in some way, due to the still existent subject/object 
                  split. Apperception in the sense I'm using it is entirely devoid of ANY 
                  sense of "me" even existing AT ALL, not simply the recognition of "my" 
                  illusory nature. When apperception is occurring, there is literally no 
                  sense whatsoever of anyone who sees, or hears, or thinks. While you've 
                  had a glimpse of what that's like, the actual experience of it as the 
                  baseline of functioning is very different, much clearer, self-luminous 
                  and so, so immediate and direct. I don't think that "apperception" is 
                  being discovered at LU to be honest, although that's not to say that 
                  people aren't perhaps encountering it to some degree, but I'm pretty 
                  certain that no one so far who's come to this via LU has penetrated that
                   far...yet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's a fair 
                  point, and thank you for your honesty. I do tend to question people 
                  quite openly about this, calling people out on what they're saying and 
                  taking a more upfront approach than what's common within the whole 
                  'spiritual' thing, but that's because having people call me out on my 
                  own bullshit in the past has led to major re-evaluations of fundamental 
                  misunderstandings which I'd neglected to investigate. Don't get me 
                  wrong, I'm not accusing anyone of bullshitting or making false claims, 
                  it's just that things can get very, very confusing at times and there 
                  are lots of time-wasting 'wrong-turns' one can make. Obviously there's a
                   lot to be said for going off the beaten track, I'm not disregarding the
                   importance of excursions along the way, but, to me at least, this 
                  process can be approached much more efficiently with good 
                  techniques/methods, discipline and strong intent. Either way, I'll make 
                  it quite clear that I NEVER ever post with any ill-will or with the 
                  intent to harm another in any way.</p>
