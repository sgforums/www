Its aim being to produce in every man a thorough internal transforming by self-conquest, how can it have recourse to might or money or even persuasion for effecting conversion? The Buddha has only shown the way to salvation, and it is left to each individual to decide for himself if he would follow it.<br><br>- Prof. Lakshmi Narasu, "The Essence of Buddhism"</span><br><br><blockquote>Buddhism is about "fate"... if you are fated (karma, rebirths) to become a Buddhist or receive Buddhist instruction or Dharma; you are truly "fortunate" (according to them)</blockquote>I need to correct this part. Karma is NOT predeterminism. It is about conditionality. I will post a topic on it soon.<br><br>But this, I have posted before:<br><br><a href="http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/karma_thanisaro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/karma_thanisaro.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">For the early Buddhists, karma was non-linear. Other Indian schools believed that karma operated in a straight line, with actions from the past influencing the present, and present actions influencing the future. As a result, they saw little room for free will.<br><br>Buddhists, however, saw that karma acts in feedback loops, with the present moment being shaped both by past and by present actions; present actions shape not only the future but also the present.<br><br>This constant opening for present input into the causal process makes free will possible.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Thus, from a Buddhist point of view, our present mental, moral intellectual and temperamental differences are, for the most part, due to our own actions and tendencies, both past and present.<br><br>Although Buddhism attributes this variation to Karma, as being the chief cause among a variety, it does not, however, assert that everything is due to Karma. The law of Karma, important as it is, is only one of the twenty-four conditions described in Buddhist Philosophy.<br><br><strong>Refuting the erroneous view that "whatsoever fortune or misfortune experienced is all due to some previous action", the Buddha said:<br><br>"So, then, according to this view, owing to previous action men will become murderers, thieves, unchaste, liars, slanderers, covetous, malicious and perverts. Thus, for those who fall back on the former deeds as the essential reason, there is neither the desire to do, nor effort to do, nor necessity to do this deed, or abstain from this deed."</strong><br><br>It was this important text, which states the belief that all physical circumstances and mental attitudes spring solely from past Karma that Buddha contradicted. If the present life is totally conditioned or wholly controlled by our past actions, then certainly Karma is tantamount to fatalism or determinism or predestination. If this were true, free will would be an absurdity. Life would be purely mechanistic, not much different from a machine. Being created by an Almighty God who controls our destinies and predetermines our future, or being produced by an irresistible Karma that completely determines our fate and controls our lifeÂ’s course, independent of any free action on our part, is essentially the same. The only difference lies in the two words God and Karma. One could easily be substituted for the other, because the ultimate operation of both forces would be identical.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such a fatalistic doctrine is not the Buddhist law of Karma.</span></strong></span><br><br>But most people's idea, and the general western idea of free will is also extreme and the term free will could be misinterpreted to mean that there is a controller of events. It is not so.<br><br>Here is a more balanced view:<br><br><a href="http://www.thinkbuddha.org/article/173/life-without-free-will" rel="nofollow">http://www.thinkbuddha.org/article/173/life-without-free-will</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In other words, nirvana is the concrete realization of Â“no free will.Â” It is also the concrete realization of Â“no determinism.Â” For in order for something to be determined, it must be determined by something OUTSIDE itself. But if there is ultimately nothing outside us to force us to choose what we do, then we are no more determined to make the choices we do than we are free to make them. They simply Â“arise of themselves in relation to circumstances.Â”</span></div>

I did not comment on whether this is a singular incident or not. I am saying that a religious extremist justifies his acts of extremism <strong>with</strong> religion, while a 'run-of-the-mill' extremist does not.
