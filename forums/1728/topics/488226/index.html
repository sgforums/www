              sights in Sri Lanka, where the doctrine of the Buddha has been venerated for
              over 2,000 years. During the early 1980s, however, a different type of monk could
              often be seen walking the island’s streets. Foreigners, they carried a
              flat-faced drum in one hand and a stick in the other, which they used to beat
              the drum as they went along. And while they also wore saffron robes, these were
              different in style. Thus, the curious general public slowly became aware of a
              school of Buddhism that had been absent in Sri Lanka since the period of the
              Anuradhapura kingdom (377 BCE–1017 CE). Its existence came as something of a
              revelation. Eventually, people learned that the foreigners were Mahayana
              Buddhist monks, and that they had come to Sri Lanka from Japan.</span></p>

              commenced in Sri Lanka, saw some of the greatest Sri Lankan kings, along with
              the emergence of some of the foremost archaeological structures to be built in
              ancient Ceylon. The era saw the dawn of the two great schools of Buddhism in
              Sri Lanka: the Mahavihara and the Abhayagiriya, named after the respective
              monasteries where they flourished. It is well known that while the Mahavihara
              became the epicenter of the Theravada tradition, the Abhayagiriya Vihara
              eventually became the home of the Mahayana, or more accurately, an offshoot
              known as Vaitulyawada. In 410, the Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian (337–422), who
              traveled on foot to Sri Lanka, noted in his travelogue that the pro-Mahayana
              Abhayagiriya Vihara housed as many as over 5,000 monks (Beal 1869, 151). This
              clearly shows that, while the great Sri Lankan chronicle, the <em>Mahavamsa</em>,
              downplays the significance of the Mahayana tradition in Sri Lanka, it was in
              fact a well-accepted school of Buddhism, and one which also attracted royal
              patronage.</span></p>

              Vattagamini (r. 89–77 BCE) during a time in which Theravada popularity was at
              its height. It is generally accepted that the Mahayana was brought to Sri Lanka
              soon after it was made popular in the Indian subcontinent by Nagarjuna in the
              2nd century. However, the arrival of the Mahayana tradition did not stand
              favorably with the orthodox practice of Buddhism that had existed on the island
              since Venerable Mahinda arrived there from India in the 3rd century BCE. By the
              9th century, during the reign of King Sena I (846–66), Vajrayana had also been
              introduced to Sri Lanka from eastern India, perhaps through the goodwill of the
              Abhayagiriya Vihara monks. Although both were important for the successful
              establishment of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, the <em>Mahavamsa</em> omits the
              activities of the Vajrayana and Mahayana schools to a great extent, while
              recording almost all the important activities relating to the orthodox
              Theravada tradition. Nor does the <em>Mahavamsa</em> make mention of the
              existence, much less the construction, of such colossal archaeological sites as
              the Mahayana temple Buduruwagala in the south, which features seven giant
              statues of bodhisattvas.</span></p>

              only a relatively brief existence in Sri Lanka. As the royal patronage and
              power of the Mahavihara increased, eventually the unorthodoxy was brought to a
              halt. Writing in the 13th century, Jayabahu Dharmakirti states in his <em>Nikayasamgrahaya</em> (Collection of writings on the books of the doctrine) that the acceptance of
              Vajrayana by King Sena I was like a “grasshopper reaching the flame thinking it
              is gold unaware of its danger” (Fernando 1908, 22). It is easy to understand
              the condemnation of the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions in what was otherwise
              a largely orthodox Theravada nation.</span></p>

              monk in Sri Lanka for over eight years. Well versed in the Buddhist doctrine,
              fluent in eight languages, and with a degree in psychology, he has some
              interesting insights into the current practice of Buddhism on the island.
              “There are so many characteristics of Vajrayana and Mahayana intermixed into
              the Theravada practices of Sri Lanka,” he told this author. “<em>Hewisi</em>  [the daily adoration of the Buddha using drums and horns] is specifically
              a Mahayana tradition. The inclusion of bodhisattva worship and their statues in
              temples is also a tradition that belongs to Mahayana, while we can also connect
              it to the worship of the 24 past Buddhas as well as the future Buddhas. We also
              have the practice of chanting mantras, which has a definite relationship with
              the Vajrayana practices of Tibet. I would like to state that, while the
              practice of the Theravada Vinaya [monastic discipline] is strong, the Mahayana
              Vinaya practice is more strenuous and applied, contrary to the belief of the
              Theravadins.”</span></p>

              Swarna have an understanding of Mahayana, most seem to be against its existence
              in Sri Lanka, in any form. On 25 September 2011, violent protests erupted at a
              Mahayana temple belonging to the Nichiren Shoshu sect in Colombo, with over 100
              Sri Lankan Theravada monks attacking it and refusing to let the practitioners
              leave. “The Buddhist monks forcibly entered the premises shouting out that we
              stop our prayer session. The monks said we should only have Theravada Buddhism
              in Sri Lanka and not Mahayana,” said one worshipper, according to a report in
              the Tamil Guardian. Another practitioner who visited the temple on the day
              reported that it took police nearly four hours to rescue the practitioners from
              the custody of the Theravada monks.</span></p>

              are still a few Mahayana temples and prayer groups operating throughout the
              country. HBS, or Honmon Butsuryu-shu, temple in Colombo has its roots in Nichiren
              Buddhism. Its chief prelate, Sri Lankan-born Ven. Dileepa Ryojun, smiled calmly
              when I asked him about their practice in Sri Lanka. “Initially, we also
              received a lot of resistance,” he revealed. “Yet, once a chief Theravada monk
              of a local temple invited me to visit him. After the meeting he understood that
              we pose no threat to Theravada Buddhism. Now we are very friendly with each
              other.” Ven. Dileepa disclosed that his temple has a membership of over 700
              families spread across the island. “People are very enthusiastic about learning
              our system of practice. We offer ‘primordial pure Buddhism’ and practices which
              create vibrant energy for the practitioner, which would help his spiritual
              well-being. We have a spacious, newly constructed temple where people are free
              to visit, practice, and change their lives in a positive way.”</span></p>

              orthodoxy in many aspects of life. Even today, we are known to be very
              traditional and resistant to change. But however much we value such attributes,
              they have not paved the way for society to change for the better. The present
              is as much divided as the past, the result being that our chances for peace,
              prosperity, and harmony are minimized. It is not the way of the Theravada that
              will give Sri Lanka what it needs—but we cannot say that Mahayana or Vajrayana
              will bring it forth, either. It is not the name of the tradition that will save
              the nation, but rather how well the practitioners of the various traditions
              conduct their spiritual life. As things currently stand, Sri Lanka is very far
              from achieving such spiritual equilibrium or freedom.</span></p>
