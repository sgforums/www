            <div class='col-md body'><p>Ngakpa Karma Lhundup Rinpoche was born in 1959 in Lowo Gekar located in upper<br>Mustang Kingdom at the sacred place of Mahaguru Padmasambhava on the auspicious<br>Dakini's day, 25th day of 10th Tibetan lunar calendar.Soon after his birth,<br>Karma's mother opened a sealed earthen jar of traditional 'Birth Beer' and a<br>blazing fire came out of the jar. This was understood to mean that the child<br>could be a reincarnation of a powerful yogi.<br><br>His parents and several nuns raised him with much love and affection. His mother<br>taught him to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha (the Three Jewels),<br>to generate good 'heart prayers,' and to recite the most sacred mantra for<br>generating compassion: 'Om mani peme hung.'<br>His father's name is Ngakpa Kalsang Tsering and his late mother's name was Karma<br>Tsewang, Karma has one younger sister and a younger brother.<br><br>Over the next seven years, out of respect for his family's lineage, Karma<br>studied Tantric practices at the Zilnon Kagyeling Monastery, which was<br>established by the late Ngakchang Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche, a well known personal<br>weather controller of H.H. Dalai Lama.<br>In Tibet, it is the responsibility of the eldest son to carry on his father's<br>trade; Karma's father is a traditional Tantric Lama, whose job is to heal and<br>perform rites and ceremonies for both the living and dying as well as after<br>death.During this time, Karma took part and successfully completed the 'Three<br>year, three months, three days' Kagye (the Nine Heruka practices) retreat in the<br>lineage of H.H. the great 5th Dalai Lama. During this time, Karma also studied<br>the practice of 'Troma Nagmo' also known as the 'Black Wrathful Vajra Yogini' up<br>to the level of 110-day 'Tsok' offering practices in the lineage of Kyabje<br>Dudjom Rinpoche. The chief retreat instructors were: Lama Lungtok Gyalton,<br>Ngakchang Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche and Kyabje Gaje Khamtul Jamyang Dondup Rinpoche.<br>While at the monastery, Karma also learned Dzogchen meditation, Chod practice,<br>chanting, how to make butter sculptures, how to play different Buddhist<br>religious musical instruments as well as many other ceremonial and ritual<br>practices.<br><br>On August 11 2000 Karma was officially recognised as the reincarnation of a 19th<br>century Tibetan Mahasiddha Yogi called Wariktsel Thokme by Kyabje Hungar Dorje<br>Rinpoche and his father Terton Kusum Lingpa Rinpoche. This recognition was based<br>on dreams, visions, spontaneous feelings and other ancient traditional tests.<br>Kyabje Hungar Dorje Rinpoche is recognised as the reincarnation of one of<br>Tibet's greatest and wildest Mahasiddha Yogis called Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje,<br>who himself was the body emanation of the 'all knowing Jikme Lingpa' Terton<br>Kusum Lingpa Rinpoche is a living treasure-revealer, who discovers the precious<br>hidden teachings of Mahaguru Padmasambhava and consort Lady Yeshe Tsogyal of the<br>8th century. Mahasiddha Wariktsel Thokme was one of the heart-sons or principle<br>students of Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje. His monastery is known as Maha Kilung Gonpa<br>in Golok region in Eastern Tibet.<br><br>On October 11, 2002 after receiving 13 day empowerments on the 'all knowing'<br>Jikme Lingpa's four part, inner-most spirituality (Nyingthik Yabshi), Karma was<br>formally enthroned as the unmistaken reincarnation of Mahasiddha Wariktsel<br>Thokme by and Kyabje Khenpo Chockok Rinpoche at the sacred place of Tso Pema<br>(lotus lake) in Northern India. Kyabje Khenpo Chockok Rinpoche is the chief<br>abbot of the respected Dza Patrul Rinpoche's monastery in Dzachukha, Kham in<br>Eastern Tibet.<br><br>Read more at : http://www.karmalhundup.org/bio/</p></div>
