Marriage is an individual choice. Furthermore, marriage is a very cultural thing. It differs from culture to culture. Buddha doesn't speak so much on these things. As for same sex marriage, this is another topic. Though Buddha never spoke about marriages, I do not think he encourages this. But we do not discriminate them.<br><blockquote>2) As a buddhist, should I tell myself not to get married cos I will be subjecting myself to another endless cycle of rebirth due to lust or craving?</blockquote>No. It is really your choice. You can get married. But of course, you must continue to practice the dharma. Unless you want to be a monk, then you shouldn't get married.<br><blockquote>3) As a buddhist, is it preferable to choose a future partner of the same faith, so that one, we can agree and practise together on many common aspects of the faith; two, we can help each other to prepare a proper Buddhist funeral when either one passes away?</blockquote>Ideally, yes. But if you all can maintain harmony inspite of religious difference, then it is good. There are lots of families with differences in religious views but they also live harmoniously. It all depends.<br><br>Please read: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no3c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no3c.htm</a></div>

Let me narrow it down though it's off-topic. When you want to marry a Muslim, you have to convert to Islam. A must. Same for Judaism, Sikhism and Hinduisim, I think (not sure though).<br><br>The last one is Christianity, which will include Catholics as well, for easy reference here. Though there's no commandment that tells Christians not to marry a non-believer, but there's no commandment that prohibits them for persuading their spouses at all times till they convert to Christianity.<br><br>It can be argued that since you are willing to marry a Christian spouse, you must have accepted to some significant degree, the concept of a creator God  and Christians see dating/marriage as one of those good chances to help you embrace Christ.<br><br>But from a Buddhist point of view, funeral preparations can become very sensitive and even quarrelsome affairs when the religious beliefs of both spouses are different. For example, when I die, can I reasonably expect my wife to chant the name of a Buddha or to do merits in my name by donating cash or donations in kind to a temple or the Sangha? Can I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trust</span> her not to try to bring a Reverend father to convert me to Christianity while I'm still breathing my last breath or has just passed away? Technically, she's not wrong, as she believes that she is doing all this for my own good, cos to her Christianity is the only good and true faith.<br><br>Though I perfectly understand my choice of a spouse is a personal one, I want as much information as possible from both laymen and Buddhists about this subject to help me choose wisely.<br><br>I don't believe in idealism, cos I can only dream of it. But yet, I have to admit I have been idealistic when it comes to human emotions. Haiz, such a failure. And in reality, people from different religions rarely form deep friendships, much less a strong marriage at that. The emphasis is on 'rarely', not saying that it's impossible.<br><br></div>

What if they are our friends, relatives or even parents? How should we as buddhists treat people who emotionally or sexually prefer members of the same sex?

Yes, of course, people who are not married, on the other hand, may have more leeway to satisy their urges and cravings of the flesh.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cycle:</div><div class="quote_body">3) Of cos parnters of the same ideology or interlectual level may form a better union, it somewhat shaped a person's character as well.

Erms...to each his own interpretation and personal experience, it would seem. But generally, for Muslim brides, you must convert to become a Muslim husband. For Christian wives, you will have to endure both her gentle and assertive ways of trying to get you to believe in Christ. If you think you can still maintain the marriage without having to convert to Christianity eventually, then good for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You have the best marriage and religious life most can only dream of.<br><br></div>
