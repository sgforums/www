                              represents spiritual purity, but also serves as a reminder that all beings are
                              capable of attaining enlightenment. According to the Buddhist teachings, just
                              as the lotus rises up from the depths of muddy ponds and lakes to blossom
                              immaculately above the water’s surface, so too can the human heart or mind
                              develop the virtues of the Buddha and transcend desire and attachment to reveal
                              its essentially pure nature. For this reason, this flower appears in every
                              aspect of Buddhist art in all Buddhist cultures, from the real lotus flowers in
                              temple gardens to the lotus thrones that support Buddhist deities in sculpture
                              and painting. The lotus is also prevalent throughout Buddhist Asia as a
                              decorative motif in textiles, ceramics, metalwork, bronzes, and lacquerware. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: grey; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt;">One of the most important representations of the lotus in Buddhist
                              art is the lotus throne. In painting and sculpture from most parts of Buddhist
                              Asia, figures of Buddhas and bodhisattvas and other major deities are typically
                              depicted either seated or standing on a lotus in full bloom. Because these
                              deities are considered enlightened beings, the lotus throne symbolizes their
                              divine manifestation and perfected spiritual state. In a variation of this
                              representation in Tibetan Buddhist imagery, the compassionate female deity
                              Green Tara is often represented seated on a lotus with her right leg extended,
                              symbolizing her readiness to leap into action to help beings: the foot is
                              typically depicted resting on a separate lotus. In both painting and
                              sculptures, the petals of the lotus are often arranged in layers to suggest the
                              unfolding of the flower as it opens, with each petal given linear texturing to
                              create volume and gilding to enhance its delicate beauty.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 16.8pt; color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt;">In the Mahayana vehicle of Buddhism in East Asia, with its rich
                              imagery and complex iconography, the lotus plays diverse roles. One of the most
                              widely practiced deities here is Avalokiteshvara, who is depicted in many
                              different forms, all of which hold a single lotus in one hand. This deity,
                              known in Tibetan as Chenrezig, in Chinese as Guanyin, and in Japanese as
                              Kannon, is the epitome of the compassion of the bodhisattvas—beings who have
                              postponed their own enlightenment in order to remain in this world to benefit
                              others. In images of this deity, the lotus flower represents the advanced
                              spiritual state and commitment to help beings realize their potential for
                              perfection. Avalokiteshvara is also the principal deity in the</span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 16.8pt; color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt;"> </span><em style="font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">Lotus Sutra</em><span style="font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 16.8pt; color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt;">, one of the
                              most widely followed Buddhist texts in East Asia. His consort is Tara, who
                              holds the stem of a lotus in one or both hands. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 16.8pt;">In Mahayana Buddhism, lotuses are also associated with the Buddha
                              Amitabha or Amitayus, one of the five transcendent Buddhas, who is believed to
                              reside in the Pure Land of Sukhavati, the “Land of Bliss,” a Buddhist paradise
                              in the West. In the Pure Land school of Mahayana, devotees aspire to be reborn
                              in this Western Pure Land by relying on Amitabha in the present life, and are
                              believed to be reborn in lotuses growing in a celestial pond. The more virtuous
                              devotees are said to be reborn in fully open lotuses and can immediately
                              receive Amitabha’s help in attaining enlightenment, while the less virtuous are
                              reborn in closed lotuses and must wait until the flower blooms before they can
                              receive Amitabha’s aid. In paintings, the Pure Land is typically depicted as a
                              celestial palace with a pond in front of it full of blooming lotuses. More
                              detailed versions of these paintings from China and Japan in particular feature
                              images of the reborn “souls,” which are depicted as babies, each sitting on an
                              individual lotus.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 16.8pt;">In esoteric Buddhism, the lotus not only represents the heart or
                              mind, but also the womb and the feminine universal principle, while the</span><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 16.8pt;"> </span><em style="font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">vajra</em><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 16.8pt;">, or
                              diamond/thunderbolt, symbolizes the masculine principle. In Japanese esoteric
                              Buddhism, a pair of mandalas known as the Mandalas of the Two Worlds is used in
                              meditational practice: the Womb World Mandala represents the feminine principle
                              while the Diamond World Mandala represents the masculine, and together they
                              represent the union of male and female, dark and light, wisdom and compassion.
                              In the Womb World Mandala, a lotus is found at the heart of the mandala,
                              representing the womb of the world, from which all things emerge. Denoting the
                              state of total mental purity or perfection, the lotus has eight petals, symbolizing
                              the Eightfold Path of Buddhism. Seated in the center is the Cosmic Buddha,
                              Vairochana, and in the eight petals are the eight principal Buddhas and
                              bodhisattvas, each also seated on lotuses. Around these central figures are
                              hundreds of other deities, again seated on lotuses and arranged in order of
                              their spiritual power. In certain initiation rituals, adepts are blindfolded
                              and asked to throw a flower onto the mandala. The place where it lands helps
                              them identify the Buddhist deity on which they should focus their practice.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> </p>

                              the lotus flower also features predominantly as a motif in Buddhist temple
                              architecture. The lotus bud finial is a common feature on railings and poles,
                              while stylized lotus flowers are often arranged artistically to decorate the
                              beams of corridor roofs. Many ritual vessels and containers crafted from
                              bronze, clay, and lacquer are created in the shape of lotuses or feature
                              lotuses scrolling across their surfaces, and in such Buddhist textiles as the
                              robes of priests and the silk brocade backing for paintings of deities, the
                              lotus is the most common of all decorative motifs, suggesting the purity and
                              spiritual power of the wearer or the deity depicted in the painting.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);"> </p>

                              architecture not only provides inspiration to followers of the Dharma so that
                              they, too, can rise from the mud of ignorance and become perfected beings—the
                              ever-present motif in Buddhist paintings, statuary, textiles, architecture, and
                              ritual objects is a daily, even hourly, reminder of the Buddha’s teaching about
                              this flower and what it represents in every moment of practice: “Like a lotus
                              flower that grows out of the mud and blossoms above the muddy water surface, we
                              can rise above our defilements and [the] sufferings of life.” (Buddhanet.net)</span></p>
