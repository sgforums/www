              <div class="thumb tright">One prominent Buddhist story tells of AvalokiteÅ›vara vowing never to rest until he had freed all sentient beings from <a class="mw-redirect" title="Samsara" href="/wiki/Samsara"><span style="color: #000000;">samsara</span></a>. Despite strenuous effort, he realizes that still many unhappy beings were yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, his head splits into eleven pieces. <a class="mw-redirect" title="Amitabha" href="/wiki/Amitabha"><span style="color: #000000;">Amitabha</span></a> Buddha, seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear the cries of the suffering. Upon hearing these cries and comprehending them, AvalokiteÅ›vara attempts to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amitabha comes to his aid and invests him with a thousand arms with which to aid the suffering multitudes.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></span></a></sup></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many Himalayan versions of the tale include eight arms with which AvalokiteÅ›vara skillfully upholds the <a title="Dharma" href="/wiki/Dharma"><span style="color: #000000;">dharma</span></a>, each possessing its own particular implement, while more Chinese-specific ones give varying accounts of this number.</p>

              <p><em>Avalokitasvara</em> with the ending <em>svara</em> ("sound, noise"), which means "sound perceiver", literally means "he who has perceived sound" (i.e., the cries of sentient beings who need his help.</p>

              <p>... this bodhisattva is the most popular figure in China and other East Asian countries. One of the most well-known forms of the bodhisattva is the one with a thousand eyes and a thousand hands. The thousand eyes allow the bodhisattva to see the suffering creatures in this world, and the thousand hands allow her to reach out to help them. Thus, this depiction is a popular symbol for the Tzu Chi Foundation, which tries to relieve the suffering in this world through the "thousand eyes and hands" of its volunteers.</p>
              <p>Actually, everyone can be a Kuan Yin. You may say that you don't have a thousand eyes or a thousand hands or that you lack magic powers, but it is your compassion that can transform you into a Kuan Yin. With your eyes and hands you can help others, and with your compassion you can bring peace and tranquility to this planet. "</p>

              <p><br>Yes, I agree. I chant æ™®é—¨å“� quite frequently at the temple. However, I don't always ask much from Kuan Yin Pusa unless is something serious. I believe in éš�ç¼˜, but things always work out nicely for me.</p>
              <p>Before I become a Buddhist, I pray to her by using joss sticks, I find it not so effective. May be it is because last time I did not put Buddha's teachings into practice. It is not easy to put Buddha's teachings into practice, needs  determination to change oneself.</p>
