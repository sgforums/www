                  4.5   The Tusita Realm
                  
                  The Tusita Realm is the fourth celestial realm of the Sense Sphere belonging to the States of Happiness.  Every aspect of this celestial realm such as physical appearance, position, sovereignty, sound, sight, and scent is more refined and elaborate than those in the first three celestial realms.  This celestial realm is extraordinary in that it is the dwelling of a vast number of confirmed and unconfirmed Bodhisattas, who will one day in the far future become enlightened as a Buddha.  It is also the dwelling of individuals that will in the far future become a Buddhaâ€™s Perfected Disciple.  This celestial realm is highly interesting and its details are given in the Tripitaka.
                  
                  
                  4.5.1   The Meaning of â€˜Tusitaâ€™
                  
                  The word â€˜Tusitaâ€™ means being devoid of anxiety, being filled with pleasure and cheerful joy.  Therefore, the Tusita Realm means the dwelling of celestial beings that are devoid of anxiety and filled with pleasure and cheerful joy.
                  
                  
                  4.5.2   Location and Characteristics of the Tusita Realm 
                  
                  The Tusita Realm is very vast.  It is governed by King Santusita, who has already attained the first stage of holiness as a Stream-Winner.  This realm is the dwelling of a great number of Bodhisattas.  It is located at a distance of about 670,000 kilometers above the Yama Realm.  There is no sunlight or moonlight in this realm.  Therefore, there is no shadow.  There are no dark corners anywhere because of the radiances of all things that exist there as well as those of its inhabitants.  Brightness comes from the radiances of celestial beings, celestial castles, gardens, parks, ponds, and the surroundings.  It has no need for sunlight.
                  
                  The Tusita Realm is not a round sphere like the earth but it is more like a round disk.  Looking up from the Yama Realm, one can see a soothing brightness emanating from the realm.  Looking down from the Tusita Realm, one can see the Yama Realm.  Looking up from the Tusita Realm, one can also see a soothing brightness emanating from the Nimmanarati Realm.  Looking down from the Tusita Realm, the Tavatimsa Realm appears very small by comparison, since the Tusita Realm is very vast.
                  
                  Next the student will learn about the structure of the Tusita Realm.  It has as its center the celestial castle of King Santusita.  The realm is then divided into four circular domains as follows: 
                  
                  The first circular domain surrounds the center of the realm and is the dwelling of holy individuals such as the Stream-Winners, and the Once-Returners.
                  
                  The second circular domain surrounds the first circular domain and forms a huge ring around it.  It is the dwelling of the confirmed Bodhisattas.  That is, they have been confirmed by a previous Buddha that they will one day far into the future definitely become enlightened as a Buddha. 
                  
                  The third circular domain forms a ring around the second domain.  It is the dwelling of the unconfirmed Bodhisattas.  That is, their future enlightenment as a Buddha has not yet been confirmed by a previous Buddha.  They still have to pursue their perfections for countless more existences.
                  
                  The fourth circular domain forms the outer ring of the Tusita Realm.  It is the dwelling of individuals that have amassed a vast amount of merit during their human existence.
                  
                  Within these four vast circular domains there are numerous celestial communities.  Each celestial community is made up of celestial estates owned by celestial beings of similar amount of merit.
                  
                  a)  Characteristics of Celestial Castles in the Tusita Realm
                  
                  A human beingâ€™s home is used to shelter him from the heat, the rain, the sun, and the wind.  Likewise, a celestial beingâ€™s home is the celestial estate, which contains the celestial castle.  Celestial castles come in different sizes depending on the ownerâ€™s level of merit.  There is mentioned in the Tripitaka celestial castles that are 480 kilometers high, 1,920 kilometers high, etc.
                  
                  There are three main types of celestial castles in this celestial realm:  crystal (diamond), silver, and gold.  They are arranged around King Santusitaâ€™s castle in a beautiful and orderly fashion.  They look like waves spreading from the center.  Celestial castles that are the closest to the kingâ€™s castle will have extremely bright radiances and are the most magnificent.  In terms of the magnificence and grandeur of celestial castles, there are gradations in descending order based on the distances from the center such that the least bright and magnificent castles are at the outer perimeter.  All celestial possessions and position depend on the level of each celestial beingâ€™s accumulated merit. 
                  
                  Celestial castles float in the air in loose clusters according to the merit level of the owners.  Some clusters are large, some are small.  The estates may look as though they adjoin one another but they actually are not.  They are however separated by empty spaces.  In the Celestial Realm there are no mountains, seas, and oceans that belong to the general public.  There are only private estates.  Within the estate, there are beautiful trees.  Celestial trees are not as crude as the trees on earth.  Mountains are made of gold or precious gems, and the ground is made of gold that feels soft to the touch and not slippery.  
                  
                  Each celestial estate is complete in itself like an entire city.  Its owner is like its king or queen with complete sovereignty.  That is, the owner is free to govern his /her own castle as he/she pleases.  The master/mistress of the estate is waited on by his/her retinue of attendants.  Each attendant has a specific duty.  If the estate owner possesses a vast amount of merit, he will have a retinue of attendants numbering in the hundreds of thousands, one million, or ten millions.  Each estate is like a personal statement that publicizes the ownerâ€™s social standing.  It is also used for various social activities.
                  
                  Celestial beings have different modes of transportation.  They may travel by a celestial vehicle or by a celestial animal.  They may travel on their own or with their attendants.  When a higher-ranking celestial beingâ€™s vehicle is passing by, vehicles of lower-ranking celestial beings must yield to it.  Celestial vehicles or celestial animals only travel through the spaces in between celestial estates and never directly above them.  This is a display of common courtesy.
                  
                  Besides the usual celestial activities of socializing, visiting the parks and other forms of entertainment, celestial beings of this celestial realm are engaged in the distinguished activities of conversing about and listening to the Dhamma.  The reason is celestial beings of the Tusita Realm do not live their lives recklessly.  They are all sages and look forward to their future accumulation of merit on earth.  They are doing everything they can for the purpose of being able to eventually rid themselves of all defilements.
                  
                  b)   The Structure of Celestial Castles
                  
                  Each castle arises and awaits the rebirth of its owner.  The structure of each castle is a result of how merit has been amassed through such wholesome deeds as alms-giving, Precepts observing, and meditation practice.  These deeds of merit provide the structure of each castle in three main parts as follows: 
                  
                  Part 1:  This is the ground part and is formed by the merit of alms-giving.  It does not consist of just one floor but it has many floors, one on top of another.  The distance between floors is very great, and has a rectangular shape.  If the alms-giving involves contributions made toward the building of a consecrated assembly hall, a shrine hall, a preaching hall, or a Cetiya, this part will be huge.
                  
                  Part 2:   This is the middle part and is formed by the merit of Precepts observing.  Its size is smaller than the first part.  It is round and consists of many floors, one on top of another.
                  
                  Part 3:   This is the top part of the castle.  It is formed by the merit of meditation practice.  It is round and consists of many floors.
                  
                  There is a wall surrounding the rectangular path that exists between the floors.  If the merit of alms-giving is great, the first part will be huge.  If the merit of Precepts observing is great, the second part will be huge.  If the merit of meditation practice is great, the third part will be huge.  The structure and appearance of the castle depends on the types of merit accumulated during its ownerâ€™s human existence.
                  
                  
                  4.5.3   The Birth and Consumption of Sensual Pleasures of Celestial Beings in the Tusita Realm 
                  
                  Rebirth in the Tusita Realm occurs via the Oppapatika mode or Spontaneous Rising.  The new arrival assumes the form of a lady or gentleman celestial being instantly.  A gentleman celestial being will be between 18-20 years old and a lady celestial being will be between 16-18 years old.  Celestial wealth in this realm is more refined and more elaborate that that in the Yama Realm.  The new arrival will be welcomed by the celestial official in the district of his domicile as well as other celestial neighbors depending on the level of the new arrivalâ€™s accumulated merit.  The celestial official will greet the newcomer at his/her celestial castle.  He will then inform him/her of all the celestial activities that he/she must attend.  There is a meeting to listen to the Dhamma on Buddhist Holy Days, etc.
                  Celestial beings of this celestial realm have glorious good looks.  They are all noble-minded Buddhists.  They have a very good understanding about merit and sin, and the Dhamma.  They are interested in keeping the company of the learned and the wise.  They are pleased to practice the Dhamma because they have been staunch merit-makers.  There are Bodhisattas that are well-versed in the Dhamma.  They take turn giving a sermon to the masses.  Although celestial beings in this realm enjoy celestial wealth that is far more refined and elaborate than that in the first three celestial realms, they do not live their lives recklessly.  Everyday there are discourses on the Dhamma attended by many celestial beings.  The reason is King Santusita is a very virtuous individual.  He is learnt and well-versed in the Dhamma and enjoys listening to and preaching the Dhamma.
                  
                  King Santusita regularly invites high-ranking celestial beings that possess great Dhamma wisdom to give a sermon at the assembly hall.
                  No sexual intercourse occurs in this celestial realm.  Romantic partners are content to give each other warm embraces like those given between friends.  The reason is celestial possessions in this realm are so refined and elaborate that they remove all interest in sexual intercourse from the inhabitants.  There is no pregnancy, no birth from the womb, no birth from the egg, and no birth from moisture in this celestial realm.  There is only one birth mode, which is â€˜Oppapatikaâ€™, just like it is in the Tavimsa and Yama Realms. 
                  
                  
                  4.5.4   The Lifespan of Celestial Beings in the Tusita Realm
                  
                  The lifespan of celestial beings in this celestial realm is given in the â€˜Vitathata Suttaâ€™.  One day and night in this celestial realm is equal to 400 earth years.  There are 30 celestial nights in one celestial month and there are 12 celestial months in one celestial year.  The average lifespan of celestial beings in the Tusita Realm is 4,000 celestial years, which is equal to 576 million earth years. Their lifespan is eight times longer than that of celestial beings in the Catummaharajika Realm.  Their lifespan is eight times longer than that of celestial beings in the Catummaharajika Realm.  
                  
                  
                  4.5.5   The Reasons the Tusita Realm is the Center of Knowers
                  
                  As mentioned earlier, the Tusita Realm is extraordinary compared to other celestial realms.  What makes it extraordinary is the fact that it is the dwelling of the confirmed Bodhisattas that will become enlightened as a Buddha one day far in the future.  It is also the dwelling of celestial beings that have been accumulating merit for the purpose of one day becoming the disciples of a Buddha.  One may ask why these Bodhisattas and all the learned sages desire to be reborn in the Tusita Realm in spite of the fact that the level of their accumulated merit makes it possible for them to choose to be reborn in any celestial realm.  There are at least three reasons for their preference.
                  
                  1.  The average lifespan in the Tusita Realm is neither too long nor too short.  It is just right.  If it is too long, it will cause these wise individuals to have to wait too long to be reborn as a human being for the purpose of accumulating more merit.
                  
                  2.  In this realm, the Bodhisattas can cease to be whenever they wish.  In general, celestial beings cease to be for different reasons.  It may be that their merit has been used up.  It may be that it is the end of their lifespan.  It may be caused by their anger.  But the Bodhisattas can choose to cease to be from the Tusita Realm to be reborn in the Human Realm for the express purpose of accumulating more merit or to become enlightened as a Buddha.  All they have to do is to go into a meditative state and wish for a rebirth.  This special privilege is above the law of nature. 
                  
                  3.  It is the place where Dhamma discussions among the virtuous sages take place.  This celestial realm is populated with sages and the Bodhisattas.  They are like-minded in that they have been working their ways toward enlightenment for countless lifetimes.  When they come together in a celestial assembly, Dhamma conversations bring them delight and pleasure.
                  
                  The student can by now appreciate why the Bodhisattas gather in the Tusita Realm, a realm more extraordinary than any other celestial realms.

Every aspect of this celestial realm such as physical appearance, position, sovereignty, sound, sight, and scent is more refined and elaborate than those in the first three celestial realms. This celestial realm is extraordinary in that it is the dwelling of a vast number of confirmed and unconfirmed Bodhisattas, who will one day in the far future become enlightened as a Buddha. It is also the dwelling of individuals that will in the far future become a Buddha’s Perfected Disciple. This celestial realm is highly interesting and its details are given in the Tripitaka. 4.5.1 The Meaning of ‘Tusita’ The word ‘Tusita’ means being devoid of anxiety, being filled with pleasure and cheerful joy.

The fourth circular domain forms the outer ring of the Tusita Realm. It is the dwelling of individuals that have amassed a vast amount of merit during their human existence. Within these four vast circular domains there are numerous celestial communities. Each celestial community is made up of celestial estates owned by celestial beings of similar amount of merit. a) Characteristics of Celestial Castles in the Tusita Realm A human being’s home is used to shelter him from the heat, the rain, the sun, and the wind. Likewise, a celestial being’s home is the celestial estate, which contains the celestial castle. Celestial castles come in different sizes depending on the owner’s level of merit. There is mentioned in the Tripitaka celestial castles that are 480 kilometers high, 1,920 kilometers high, etc. There are three main types of celestial castles in this celestial realm: crystal (diamond), silver, and gold. They are arranged around King Santusita’s castle in a beautiful and orderly fashion. They look like waves spreading from the center. Celestial castles that are the closest to the king’s castle will have extremely bright radiances and are the most magnificent. In terms of the magnificence and grandeur of celestial castles, there are gradations in descending order based on the distances from the center such that the least bright and magnificent castles are at the outer perimeter. All celestial possessions and position depend on the level of each celestial being’s accumulated merit. Celestial castles float in the air in loose clusters according to the merit level of the owners. Some clusters are large, some are small. The estates may look as though they adjoin one another but they actually are not. They are however separated by empty spaces. In the Celestial Realm there are no mountains, seas, and oceans that belong to the general public. There are only private estates. Within the estate, there are beautiful trees. Celestial trees are not as crude as the trees on earth. Mountains are made of gold or precious gems, and the ground is made of gold that feels soft to the touch and not slippery. Each celestial estate is complete in itself like an entire city. Its owner is like its king or queen with complete sovereignty. That is, the owner is free to govern his /her own castle as he/she pleases. The master/mistress of the estate is waited on by his/her retinue of attendants. Each attendant has a specific duty. If the estate owner possesses a vast amount of merit, he will have a retinue of attendants numbering in the hundreds of thousands, one million, or ten millions. Each estate is like a personal statement that publicizes the owner’s social standing. It is also used for various social activities. Celestial beings have different modes of transportation. They may travel by a celestial vehicle or by a celestial animal. They may travel on their own or with their attendants. When a higher-ranking celestial being’s vehicle is passing by, vehicles of lower-ranking celestial beings must yield to it. Celestial vehicles or celestial animals only travel through the spaces in between celestial estates and never directly above them. This is a display of common courtesy. Besides the usual celestial activities of socializing, visiting the parks and other forms of entertainment, celestial beings of this celestial realm are engaged in the distinguished activities of conversing about and listening to the Dhamma. The reason is celestial beings of the Tusita Realm do not live their lives recklessly. They are all sages and look forward to their future accumulation of merit on earth. They are doing everything they can for the purpose of being able to eventually rid themselves of all defilements. b) The Structure of Celestial Castles Each castle arises and awaits the rebirth of its owner. The structure of each castle is a result of how merit has been amassed through such wholesome deeds as alms-giving, Precepts observing, and meditation practice. These deeds of merit provide the structure of each castle in three main parts as follows: Part 1: This is the ground part and is formed by the merit of alms-giving. It does not consist of just one floor but it has many floors, one on top of another. The distance between floors is very great, and has a rectangular shape. If the alms-giving involves contributions made toward the building of a consecrated assembly hall, a shrine hall, a preaching hall, or a Cetiya, this part will be huge. Part 2: This is the middle part and is formed by the merit of Precepts observing. Its size is smaller than the first part. It is round and consists of many floors, one on top of another. Part 3: This is the top part of the castle. It is formed by the merit of meditation practice. It is round and consists of many floors. There is a wall surrounding the rectangular path that exists between the floors. If the merit of alms-giving is great, the first part will be huge. If the merit of Precepts observing is great, the second part will be huge. If the merit of meditation practice is great, the third part will be huge. The structure and appearance of the castle depends on the types of merit accumulated during its owner’s human existence. 4.5.3 The Birth and Consumption of Sensual Pleasures of Celestial Beings in the Tusita Realm Rebirth in the Tusita Realm occurs via the Oppapatika mode or Spontaneous Rising. The new arrival assumes the form of a lady or gentleman celestial being instantly. A gentleman celestial being will be between 18-20 years old and a lady celestial being will be between 16-18 years old. Celestial wealth in this realm is more refined and more elaborate that that in the Yama Realm. The new arrival will be welcomed by the celestial official in the district of his domicile as well as other celestial neighbors depending on the level of the new arrival’s accumulated merit. The celestial official will greet the newcomer at his/her celestial castle. He will then inform him/her of all the celestial activities that he/she must attend. There is a meeting to listen to the Dhamma on Buddhist Holy Days, etc. Celestial beings of this celestial realm have glorious good looks. They are all noble-minded Buddhists. They have a very good understanding about merit and sin, and the Dhamma. They are interested in keeping the company of the learned and the wise. They are pleased to practice the Dhamma because they have been staunch merit-makers. There are Bodhisattas that are well-versed in the Dhamma. They take turn giving a sermon to the masses. Although celestial beings in this realm enjoy celestial wealth that is far more refined and elaborate than that in the first three celestial realms, they do not live their lives recklessly. Everyday there are discourses on the Dhamma attended by many celestial beings. The reason is King Santusita is a very virtuous individual. He is learnt and well-versed in the Dhamma and enjoys listening to and preaching the Dhamma. King Santusita regularly invites high-ranking celestial beings that possess great Dhamma wisdom to give a sermon at the assembly hall. No sexual intercourse occurs in this celestial realm. Romantic partners are content to give each other warm embraces like those given between friends. The reason is celestial possessions in this realm are so refined and elaborate that they remove all interest in sexual intercourse from the inhabitants. There is no pregnancy, no birth from the womb, no birth from the egg, and no birth from moisture in this celestial realm. There is only one birth mode, which is ‘Oppapatika’, just like it is in the Tavimsa and Yama Realms. 4.5.4 The Lifespan of Celestial Beings in the Tusita Realm The lifespan of celestial beings in this celestial realm is given in the ‘Vitathata Sutta’. One day and night in this celestial realm is equal to 400 earth years. There are 30 celestial nights in one celestial month and there are 12 celestial months in one celestial year. The average lifespan of celestial beings in the Tusita Realm is 4,000 celestial years, which is equal to 576 million earth years. Their lifespan is eight times longer than that of celestial beings in the Catummaharajika Realm. Their lifespan is eight times longer than that of celestial beings in the Catummaharajika Realm. 4.5.5 The Reasons the Tusita Realm is the Center of Knowers As mentioned earlier, the Tusita Realm is extraordinary compared to other celestial realms. What makes it extraordinary is the fact that it is the dwelling of the confirmed Bodhisattas that will become enlightened as a Buddha one day far in the future. It is also the dwelling of celestial beings that have been accumulating merit for the purpose of one day becoming the disciples of a Buddha. One may ask why these Bodhisattas and all the learned sages desire to be reborn in the Tusita Realm in spite of the fact that the level of their accumulated merit makes it possible for them to choose to be reborn in any celestial realm. There are at least three reasons for their preference. 1. The average lifespan in the Tusita Realm is neither too long nor too short. It is just right. If it is too long, it will cause these wise individuals to have to wait too long to be reborn as a human being for the purpose of accumulating more merit. 2. In this realm, the Bodhisattas can cease to be whenever they wish. In general, celestial beings cease to be for different reasons. It may be that their merit has been used up. It may be that it is the end of their lifespan. It may be caused by their anger. But the Bodhisattas can choose to cease to be from the Tusita Realm to be reborn in the Human Realm for the express purpose of accumulating more merit or to become enlightened as a Buddha. All they have to do is to go into a meditative state and wish for a rebirth. This special privilege is above the law of nature. 3. It is the place where Dhamma discussions among the virtuous sages take place. This celestial realm is populated with sages and the Bodhisattas. They are like-minded in that they have been working their ways toward enlightenment for countless lifetimes. When they come together in a celestial assembly, Dhamma conversations bring them delight and pleasure. The student can by now appreciate why the Bodhisattas gather in the Tusita Realm, a realm more extraordinary than any other celestial realms.</p>

              <p>He met them quite a few times as in face to face. He faced alot of things in his practice. He even faced the evil maras, the kind who tried to stop Buddha from attaining enlightenment. He too met them before his enlightenment. He has also personally visited the deva realm a few times and the hells personally, and actually described them, though I can't remember the precise description. I do briefly remember him describing the particular deva realm he visited as full of majestic palaces and mentions which are entirely made of jewels and precious stones, imagine even the floor made of gold or precious stones. He even brought someone with him to visit that place.</p>
              <p>Anyway, not to get into all these while practicing... for my teacher it is fine because he already let go of all attachments to such things. But before enlightenment if we get attached to these things, it will stop us from progressing.</p>
