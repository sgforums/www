              <p>I believe karma exists.</p>
              <p>Karmic causes needs conditions to manifest and if someone did evil deeds they may not manifest into effect in the present lifetime. It may be the next or other future lifetimes that it manifests. If someone is very evil or killed many people etc it is likely he might be reborn in the 3 lower realms.</p>
              <p>Similarly, good people that end up having cancer or die terribly might be due to karma brought over from previous lifetimes, possibly several lifetimes ago. Those who can remember past lives and trace their karmic causes will know, as our moderator longchen has spoken before from personal experience.</p>

              <p>I see karma as newtons law ..the higher you throw a ball..the harder you fall..and i see it as albert estein...energy can only be transform and not destroy....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those who are doing bad karma this current life...they might have done thousands of good karma in their many previous life..but in this life...due to influences and the environmental effect over their mind...a wrong move...they have did some bad things which actually will diminish all their past good cumulative karma in this life...perhaps they live slightly longer..but the next life they might be in the hungry ghost releam or the animal releam for the next thousand life to come....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Karma will relate to past life and currently life..this are å�ŽæŠ¥...but remember whatever you do now...can actually lead to many chain effects coming up..in business concept its call multiplying effect....so guys take note on what you are doing daily...</p>

              <p>Oh, and one more thing, sometimes riches and power may not necessarily means that one is leading a happy, peaceful or even normal life. He may be mentally suferring from constantly worring about loosing what he has or may be leading a long physically painful life from uncurable illness in old age. To them , maybe its worst than kenna struck by lightning. Such sufferings can be so intense that its' equivalent to sufferings of the hell realm.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">There are causes for all human suffering, and there is a way, by which they may be ended, because everything in the world is the result of a vast concurrence of causes and conditions, and everything disappears as these causes and conditions change and pass away. Rain falls, winds blow, plants bloom, leaves mature and are blown away. These phenomena are all interrelated with causes and conditions, and are brought about by them, and disappear as the causes and conditions change. One if born through the conditions of parentage. His body is nourished by food: his spirit is nurtured by teaching and experience. Therefore both flesh and spirit are related to conditions and are changed as conditions change. As a net is made up by a series of knots, so everything in this world is connected by a series of knots. If anyone thinks that the mesh of net is an independent, isolated thing, he is mistaken. It is called a net because it is made up of a series of connected meshed, and each mesh has its place and responsibilities to other meshes. Blossoms come about because of series of conditions that lead to their blooming. Leaves are blown away because of a series of conditions lead up to it. Blossoms do not appear independently, nor does a leaf fall of itself, out of its season. So everything has its coming forth and passing away; nothing can be independent without any change. It is the everlasting and unchanging rule of this world that everything is created by a series of causes and conditions and everything disappears by the same rule; everything changes, nothing remains constant.</span></span></p>

              <p>Master also use a very good example. for example, few older boys bully a younger boy, the younger boy at that time is weak, hence unable to fight back. but as time goes by, the older boy become old and weak, while the younger boy grow stronger. but since there're too many of them, the younger boy have to pick the weaker first. it had nothing to do with first come first serve. some of them may be "more well-off" per se.</p>

              <p>I dun think Zarks means there is no karma, I think what he meant is we should be more focus on our doings, and do things whole heartly and not because of Karma and do the good action, these are more like thinking about oneself rather than showing compassion to others..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally I feel that karma exits in this world, but we should show compassion to others and not just because afriad being punish by karma and start doing all the good act...</p>

              <p>Here are some excerpts from a article by Ven. Fazhao published in Vaidurya vol.27 touching on Karma, hopes it can helps to clear some doubts.</p>
              <p><em>' 'Karma' is not necessarily something that happens in the future. A person with heavy karmic obscurations would have fear in his heart. A person filled with fear would naturally not be healthy physically. He may even have hallucinations resulting in terror. '</em></p>
              <p><em>'Karma arises from the mind. When karmic obscurations manifest, an illusion is produced which leads us to experience the fruition of karma. From past causes to present results; presents causes to future results, Buddhism studies the present thought and the development of future cause and effect. Not only does it study the future, but the way to transform past negative karma. People who know the law of cause and effect and put effort into making positive changes will be healthy both physically and emotionally.'</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>'From the Buddhist viewpoint, fame and gain, status and glory are the positive results of past virtuous activities. If one has not practised generosity in the past, even if one accquires wealth in this lifetime, it will not stay. Causes, conditions, fruition and results are not fatalistic but a message for all to put effort into practising virtue, wisdom and compassion.'</em></p>

              <p>I believe karma exists.</p>
              <p>Karmic causes needs conditions to manifest and if someone did evil deeds they may not manifest into effect in the present lifetime. It may be the next or other future lifetimes that it manifests. If someone is very evil or killed many people etc it is likely he might be reborn in the 3 lower realms.</p>
              <p>Similarly, good people that end up having cancer or die terribly might be due to karma brought over from previous lifetimes, possibly several lifetimes ago. Those who can remember past lives and trace their karmic causes will know, as our moderator longchen has spoken before from personal experience.</p>

              <p>I dun think Zarks means there is no karma, I think what he meant is we should be more focus on our doings, and do things whole heartly and not because of Karma and do the good action, these are more like thinking about oneself rather than showing compassion to others..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally I feel that karma exits in this world, but we should show compassion to others and not just because afriad being punish by karma and start doing all the good act...</p>
