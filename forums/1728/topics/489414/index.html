              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Few people have done
                      more for Tibet than Tenzin Delek Rinpoche. Born in Lithang, an eastern
                      Tibetan region famous for its fine horses and fearless warriors, Tenzin
                      Delek started off as an unknown lama of humble origins. But through
                      extensive social and humanitarian work, he established scores of clinics,
                      schools and orphanages. He built nunneries to educate women, and nursing
                      homes for the elderly. He settled long-simmering disputes between families.
                      Criminals who couldn't be tamed by multiple stints in prison were
                      miraculously subdued and reformed by Rinpoche.<br> <br> His profound impact on the community didn't stop there. He fought against
                      China's rampant deforestation in Tibet, and the alarming rate of
                      desertification. He battled mining companies - and sometimes succeeded in
                      keeping them out of the region. This angered local Chinese officials, who
                      were often in collusion with the extractive industries. <br> <br> Predictably, the authorities tried to arrest him in 1997 by connecting him
                      to pro-independence leaflets. Rinpoche fled to the mountains. The local
                      communities, staging risky protests, persuaded the authorities to leave
                      Rinpoche alone. When he returned to the village in 1998, thousands of
                      villagers gave him a hero's welcome.<br> <br> However, he was now a marked man. In 2002, Chinese authorities arrested him
                      and sentenced him to death for the false charge of "bombing."
                      Rinpoche was put to a sham trial whose foregone conclusion was to lock him
                      up. Following a sustained global campaign to save his life, his sentence
                      was commuted to life imprisonment. <br> <br> As a result of harsh prison conditions, Rinpoche's health quickly
                      deteriorated - for Tibetan political prisoners, torture and beatings are
                      routine and well documented. Despite repeated appeals by his family and
                      public expressions of concern from world leaders, China denied him medical
                      care. <br> <br> Though we knew Rinpoche was ill, his death shocked us all the same. But
                      what China did afterward took their cruelty to yet another level. <br> <br> For Tibetan Buddhists, if there is one thing more important than life, it
                      is the moment immediately following one's death, when the Tibetan Book of
                      the Dead is read out loud to guide the dead person's soul toward spiritual
                      liberation. In this period, one's consciousness passes through what
                      Buddhists call the "clear light moment," an opportunity to propel
                      one's consciousness into higher rebirth, even enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Rinpoche was denied
                      this opportunity, as his body lay in a high-security prison for days. Even
                      as thousands of Tibetans demanded the return of his body to give him the
                      traditional Buddhist final rites, a right provided by the Chinese
                      constitution, the prison authorities illegally withheld his body. In an
                      unforgivable act of insult against a whole nation and religion, the prison
                      guards secretly cremated Rinpoche's body. Last week, when his relatives
                      were carrying Rinpoche's ashes to his hometown, Chinese police stopped them
                      and forcibly seized the ashes. They then effectively abducted Rinpoche's
                      sister Dolkar Lhamo and her daughter, both of whom are still missing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In life, they robbed him of his freedom. In death, they robbed him of his
                      liberation. But there was one thing they could never take away from
                      Rinpoche: his dignity. He died undefeated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thanks to this brand of Tibetan dignity - and a stubborn hope against all
                      odds - even after sixty years of colonial occupation, Tibet remains
                      unconquered. Tibetans continue to see the exile government in Dharamsala,
                      not Beijing, as their true representative. Since 2009, </span><a href="http://www.savetibet.org/resources/fact-sheets/self-immolations-by-tibetans/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">roughly 150 Tibetans have
                      self-</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">immolated to protest Chinese
                      rule.<br> <br> Rinpoche's death, tragic as it was, will initiate yet another generation of
                      Tibetans into the freedom struggle. Instead of merely praising Tibetan
                      pacifism, world leaders must turn up the heat on China. Using economic
                      leverage, political pressure, and social activism, the world must support
                      the Tibetan people's nonviolent struggle to end Chinese rule and establish
                      a free and democratic Tibet.<br> </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>We only lived to kill Chinese,’ recalled one Tibetan veteran.</strong></em></span></p>
              <p>‘Our 
              hopes were high.’ One of the trainees, Gyato Wangdu (who would later 
              become the last commander of the <em>Chushi Gandrug</em>), asked CIA 
              operations officer Roger McCarthy for ‘a portable nuclear weapon of some
               kind…that the trainees might employ to destroy Chinese by the 
              hundreds.’ The CIA declined, but McCarthy noted that Wangdu ‘did take to
               demolition training with renewed enthusiasm’ and became quite taken 
              with bazookas and mortars.</p>
              <p>By fall of 1957, Tibetans who had 
              never seen a sky boat were jumping out of one in the cold light of a 
              full moon over Tibet. One of the first jumpers, Athar Norbu, remembered:
               ‘We could see the Tsangpo River below us gleaming in the dark. There 
              were no clouds. It was a clear night. Happiness surged through me…[as] 
              we went rattling out of the plane.’ In Lhasa, Athar Norbu and a fellow 
              guerrilla made contact with Gompo Tashi. This ultrasecret project was 
              code-named ‘ST Circus.’</p>
              <p>The CIA was now in the fight...</p>
