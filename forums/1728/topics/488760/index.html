              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">The Buddha was careful to
              classify questions according to how they should be answered, based on how
              helpful they were to gaining awakening. Some questions deserved a categorical
              answer, that is, one that holds true across the board. Some he answered
              analytically, redefining or refining the terms before answering. Some required
              counter-questioning, to clarify the issue in the questioner’s mind. But if the
              question was an obstacle on the path, the Buddha put it aside.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">When Vacchagotta the
              wanderer asked him point-blank whether or not there is a self, the Buddha
              remained silent, which means that the question has no helpful answer. As he
              later explained to Ananda, to respond either yes or no to this question would
              be to side with opposite extremes of wrong view (</span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Samyutta Nikaya</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; "> 44.10). Some have argued that the Buddha
              didn’t answer with “no” because Vacchagotta wouldn’t have understood the
              answer. But there’s another passage where the Buddha advises all the monks to
              avoid getting involved in questions such as “What am I?” “Do I exist?” “Do I
              not exist?” because they lead to answers like “I have a self” and “I have no
              self,” both of which are a “thicket of views, a writhing of views, a contortion
              of views” that get in the way of awakening (</span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Majjhima Nikaya</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; "> 2).</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">So how did we get the idea
              that the Buddha said that there is no self? The main culprit seems to be the
              debate culture of ancient India. Religious teachers often held public debates
              on the hot questions of the day, both to draw adherents and to angle for royal
              patronage. The Buddha warned his followers not to enter into these debates (</span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sutta Nipata</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; "> 4.8), partly because once the sponsor of a debate
              had set a question, the debaters couldn’t follow the Buddha’s policy of putting
              useless questions aside.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">Later generations of monks
              forgot the warning and soon found themselves in debates where they had to
              devise a Buddhist answer to the question of whether there is or isn’t a self.
              The </span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Kathavatthu</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">, an Abhidhamma text
              attributed to the time of King Ashoka, contains the earliest extant version of
              the answer “no.” Two popular literary works, the </span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhacharita</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; "> and </span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Milinda
              Panha</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">,
              both from around the first century CE, place this “no” at the center of the
              Buddha’s message. Later texts, like the </span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Abhidharmakosha
              Bhashya</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">,
              provide analytical answers to the question of whether there is a self, saying
              that there’s no personal self but that each person has a “dharma-self” composed
              of five aggregates: material form, feelings, perceptions, mental fabrications,
              and consciousness. At present we have our own analytical answers to the
              question, such as the teaching that although we have no separate self, we do
              have a cosmic self—a teaching, by the way, that the Buddha singled out for
              special ridicule (</span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">MN</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; "> 22).</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">“There is no self” is the
              granddaddy of fake Buddhist quotes. It has survived so long because of its
              superficial resemblance to the teaching on </span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">anatta</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">, or not-self, which was one of the Buddha’s tools for putting an end to
              clinging. Even though he neither affirmed nor denied the existence of a self,
              he did talk of the process by which the mind creates many senses of self—what
              he called “I-making” and “my-making”—as it pursues its desires.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">In other words, he focused
              on the karma of selfing. Because clinging lies at the heart of suffering, and because
              there’s clinging in each sense of self, he advised using the perception of
              not-self as a strategy to dismantle that clinging. Whenever you see yourself
              identifying with anything stressful and inconstant, you remind yourself that
              it’s not-self: not worth clinging to, not worth calling your self (</span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">SN</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; "> 22.59). This helps you let go of it. When you do
              this thoroughly enough, it can lead to awakening. In this way, the not-self
              teaching is an answer—not to the question of whether there’s a self, but to the
              question that the Buddha said lies at the heart of discernment: “What, when I
              do it, will lead to my long-term welfare and happiness?” (</span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">MN</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; "> 135). You find true happiness by letting go.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">Some ways of selfing, the
              Buddha and his disciples found, are useful along the path, as when you develop
              a sense of self that’s heedful and responsible, confident that you can manage
              the practice (</span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Anguttara Nikaya</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; "> 4.159). While you’re on
              the path, you apply the perception of not-self to anything that would pull you
              astray. Only at the end do you apply that perception to the path itself. As for
              the goal, it’s possible to develop a sense of clinging around the experience of
              the deathless, so the Buddha advises that you regard even the deathless as
              not-self (</span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">AN</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; "> 9.36). But when there’s no
              more clinging, you have no need for perceptions either of self or not-self. You
              see no point in answering the question of whether there is or isn’t a self
              because you’ve found the ultimate happiness.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">The belief that there is no
              self can actually get in the way of awakening. As the Buddha noted, the
              contemplation of not-self can lead to an experience of nothingness (</span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">MN</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; "> 106). If your purpose in practicing is to disprove
              the self—perhaps from wanting to escape the responsibilities of having a
              self—you can easily interpret the experience of nothingness as the proof you’re
              looking for: a sign you’ve reached the end of the path. Yet the Buddha warned
              that subtle clinging can persist in that experience. If you think you’ve
              reached awakening, you won’t look for the clinging. But if you learn to keep
              looking for clinging, even in the experience of nothingness, you’ll have a
              chance of finding it. Only when you find it can you then let it go.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="p12" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">So it’s important to
              remember which questions the not-self teaching was meant to answer and which
              ones it wasn’t. Getting clear on this point can mean the difference between a
              false awakening and the real thing. </span></p>

              <p>robertk:<br><br>This is an old post from ven. Dhammanando that i liked<br>http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index. ... 3364&amp;st=60<br>Citing
               the relevant suttas is unlikely to be persuasive to those who have 
              fallen for Thanissaro's mystical drivel, for Thanissaro would simply 
              interpret them differently or else would translate them differently so 
              as to make them support his view. A good example of this is the 
              following passage from the AlagaddÅ«pamasutta, which is one of the 
              starkest and most uncompromising assertions of the non-existence of 
              self.... until Thanissaro gets his hands on it:<br><br>attani ca attaniye ca saccato thetato anupalabbhamÄ�ne<br>(MN. 22; also cited in the KathÄ�vatthu's debate on the puggalavÄ�da, Kvu. 68)<br><br>And here are some extracts from an old article of mine discussing this phrase...<br><br>First I cite seven translations of it:<br><br><br>Dhammanando:<br>"...since in truth and reality there obtains neither self nor what belongs to self..."<br><br>ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli/Bodhi:<br>"...since a self and what belongs to a self are not apprehended as true and established..."<br><br>Thanissaro:<br>"...where a self or what belongs to self are not pinned down as a truth or reality..."<br><br>B.C. Law:<br>"...But both soul and that which belongs to soul being in truth, and forever, impossible to be known..."<br><br>I.B. Horner:<br>"But if Self and what belongs to Self, although actually existing are incomprehensible..."<br><br>MahÄ�makut Tipiá¹­aka:<br>"...meua attÄ� lae borikhÄ�n neuang duai attÄ� bukkhon theu ao mai dai, doey khwÄ�m pen khong jing, doey khwÄ�m pen khong thae..."<br><br>MahÄ�chulalongkorn Tipiá¹­aka:<br>"...meua thang ton lae khong thii neuang kap ton ja yang hen mai dai, doey khwÄ�m pen khong jing, doey khwÄ�m pen khong thae..."<br><br><br>Then my comments:<br><br>Of
               the seven renderings above, those of Horner and Law are completely off 
              the map, while the remaining five are more or less defensible so far as 
              purely philological considerations go.<br><br>There are two key terms in
               the passage that give rise to disagreement: firstly, the participle 
              "anupalabbhamÄ�ne"; secondly, the phrase "saccato thetato". How one 
              conceives the meaning of these will determine how one interprets the 
              passage; and how one interprets the passage will determine how one goes 
              about translating it. The problem, of course, is that every translator's
               interpretation of the above phrases will be determined - or at least 
              influenced - by his prior assumptions about the Buddha's teaching.<br><br>Let's
               start with anupalabbhamÄ�ne. This is the present participle of the 
              passive form of the verb upalabhati, inflected in the locative case. In 
              front of it is placed the negative particle na ('not'), which changes to
               an- in accordance with the rules of euphonic junction.<br><br>Upalabhati means to obtain, get or find. So in the passive voice it 
              would mean to be obtained, gotten or found. With the addition of the 
              negative particle 'na' the meaning would be "not to be found."<br><br>Here's one familiar example of the verb, to be found in every Indian logic textbook:<br><br>vañjhÄ�ya putto na upalabbhati.<br>"A son of a barren woman is not to be found."<br><br>(Or
               as western philosophers would phrase it, " 'Son of a barren woman' does
               not obtain."). Elsewhere the same will be predicated of "horns of a 
              hare", "flowers in the sky", etc.<br><br>And here arises the first point
               of controversy among translators and interpreters of this sutta: does 
              the phrase "not to be obtained" mean the same as "not exist"? ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli, 
              Bodhi and myself would answer yes. A mystically-inclined monk like 
              Thanissaro would answer no. Unsurprisingly Thanissaro has chosen a 
              rendering ("not pinned down") that stresses the epistemic or cognitive, 
              and would tend to imply that a self does (or at least might) exist, but 
              one that is too inscrutable to say anything about.<br><br>To continue, 
              when the verb na upalabbhati is made into a present participle, the 
              meaning would be "non-obtaining" (or more precisely, a 
              "not-being-obtained-ness"). When this present participle is inflected in
               the locative case, then various meanings are possible, and here arises 
              the second point of controversy. What function does the locative have in
               this context? There are three possibilities:<br><br>Spatial or situational stipulative: "Where there is a non-obtaining of self..."<br>Temporal stipulative: "When there is a non-obtaining of self...."<br>Causative: "Because there is a non-obtaining of self..."<br><br>ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli,
               Bodhi and I of course favour the causative, for the other two would 
              leave a loophole that there might be some time or place where self does 
              obtain. Thanissaro of course favours a reading that will leave his 
              mysticism intact. So here too it's a case of our prior assumptions 
              determining how we translate.<br><br>Now for "saccato thetato". Sacca 
              means true or a truth; theta means sure, firm, or reliable, or something
               that has these features. Adding the suffix -to turns these words into 
              adverbs. Here I'm not really sure about the relative merits of the above
               translations, or even if there is a difference between "X does not 
              obtain as a truth" or "X does not in truth obtain." Not that this 
              matters greatly; the crux of the matter is obviously the word 
              anupalabbhamÄ�ne. The difference between my old rendering and the 
              ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli/Bodhi one is that I had taken saccato thetato to be an 
              adverbial qualification of anupalabbhamÄ�ne, whereas ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli and Bodhi 
              make it more like an adjectival qualification of "self and what belongs 
              to self." I now think that their rendering is more likely to be correct.
               At least it seems to accord better with the á¹¬Ä«kÄ� to this sutta.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Dhammanando Bhikkhu</p>

               Kyle stated, the salient point is to understand that the so called 
              "self" is merely labelled self. By this I do not mean "it's just a 
              concept", but rather that it's a concept imputed dependent on the parts,
               causes and conditions, an</span></span><span><span><span>d
               designating consciousness -- without any intrinsic existence of its 
              own. The point is not just the conceptual nature of self, but how it is a
               dependently designated self and hence 'self' is empty of its own 
              intrinsic existence... we have mistakenly thought that functionality 
              requires an essence or entity as I mentioned in the other thread.</span><br><br><span>It's
               just like "weather". Is "weather" a thing existing somewhere? Nope, 
              instead, it's a placeholder, a designation, for the conglomerate of 
              everchanging clouds, wind blowing, rain falling, the sounds and sights 
              which we designate as "weather".</span><br><br><span>And
               likewise for the "self". In truth, there is no inherently existing self
               within or transcending those aggregates, but "self" is merely a 
              nominally designated self. Even things like "Awareness", "Buddha-Nature"
               is seen this way in the Dharma.</span><br><br><span>Toni Packer puts it well (also her book "The Wonder of Presence" is a good read):</span><br><br><a dir="ltr" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/10/what-is-me.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/.../what-is-me.html</a><br><br><span>"
               A somber day, isn't it? Dark, cloudy, cool, moist and windy. Amazing, 
              this whole affair of "the weather!" We call it "weather," but what is it
               really? Wind. Rain. Clouds slowly parting. Not the words spoken about 
              it, but just this darkening, blowing, pounding, wetting, and then 
              lightening up, blue sky appearing amidst darkness, and sunshine 
              sparkling on wet grasses and leaves. In a little while there'll be 
              frost, snow and ice-covers. And then warming again, melting, oozing 
              water everywhere. On an early spring day the dirt road sparkles with 
              streams of wet silver. So — what is "weather" other than this incessant 
              change of earthly conditions and all the human thoughts, feelings, and 
              undertakings influenced by it? Like and dislike. Depression and elation.
               Creation and destruction. An ongoing, ever changing stream of 
              happenings abiding nowhere. No entity "weather" to be found except in 
              thinking and talking about it.</span><br><br><span>Now
               — is there such an entity as "me," "I," "myself?" Or is it just like 
              the "weather" — an ongoing, ever changing stream of ideas, images, 
              memories, projections, likes and dislikes, creations and destructions, 
              which thought keeps calling "I," "me," "Toni," and thereby solidifying 
              what is evanescent? What am I really, truly, and what do I think and 
              believe I am? Are we interested in exploring this amazing affair of 
              "myself" from moment to moment? Is this, maybe, the essence of retreat 
              work? Exploring ourselves minutely beyond the peace and quiet that we 
              are seeking and maybe finding. Coming upon clarity about this deep sense
               of separation which we call "me," and "other people," without any need 
              to condemn or overcome.</span><br><br><span>Most
               human beings take it totally for granted that I am "me," and that "me" 
              is this body, this mind, this knowledge and sense about myself which so 
              obviously feels separate from other people. The language in which we 
              talk to ourselves and to each other inevitably implies separate "me's," 
              and "you's" all the time. All of us talk "I" and "you" talk, we think 
              it, write it, read it, and dream it with rarely any pause. There is 
              incessant reinforcement of the sense of "I," "me," separate from others.
               Isolated. Insulated. Not understood. How is one to come upon the truth 
              if separation is taken so much for granted, feels so common sense? "<br><br>...<br></span></span></span></span></span></span>

               the issue of apparent consistency of behaviours give rise to the sense 
              of having a "personality". Like someone with a personality talks in a 
              certain style, walks with a certain style, etc... in fact after a 
              certain age, a person's personality is </span></span><span><span><span>sort of "hardened" for the rest of their life and usually don't change.</span><br><br><span>Even
               so, in terms of Dharma we are taught not to see solidity in 
              consistency, rather, we see them as habitual tendencies, as action, as 
              activity, as karma. And rebirth is truly an activity of a tendency 
              rather than the continuation of a solid personality or entity from 
              moment to moment and lifetime to lifetime. That core tendency driving 
              rebirth is the conceit of "I Am", along with the "I shall become" which 
              leads to rebirth in samsara.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div>
