              Buddhist nuns is trapped in the city of Katmandu, living in sukkot.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Not the beautifully decorated, religiously
              infused sukkot — or “dwellings” — erected as part of the Jewish High Holy Days.
              Not the kind in which delicious meals are served, songs are sung, and ushpizin
              — privileged guests — are invited to share in the harvest holiday bounty. Nor
              are they the romantic honeymoon-suite-with-God sukkot that allow Jews and their
              creator to spend just a few more intimate moments together before the holy days
              season closes. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The Nepalese shelters occupied by the nuns
              are something entirely different: stuffy, unsanitary, overcrowded. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">After the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that
              struck the country last April, followed by another, equally devastating 7.3
              quake two weeks later, 8 million Nepalese from all castes of society were
              plunged into a primitive nightmare. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">More than 8,800 people lost their lives;
              another 10,000 were injured. Much of the country’s infrastructure was
              demolished, including 600,000 homes, countless roads and many UNESCO World
              Heritage sites that were reduced to rubble. The destruction displaced 2.8
              million people, and according to the United Nations, more than half a million
              households have spent the last five months languishing in temporary tent cities
              or shelters. There, it is not z’man simchateinu — a season of joy — but rather
              a season of survival. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The Tibetan Buddhist nuns are among the
              country’s most marginalized groups, with few legal protections offered by the
              Nepali government. A lot of this is due to Chinese animosity toward Tibetan
              Buddhists and the power China has to exert its will over Nepali authorities. Before
              the earthquake struck, 200 of these nuns had been living in a nunnery on a
              remote but idyllic mountaintop with a view of Tibet. Many had come there as
              children, sent from poor families who knew it was the only way their daughters
              could be fed and clothed. Lives that began in desperation became, over time,
              lives of devotion, and the nuns passed their days simply, in solitude,
              meditation and prayer. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But all that ended last April. Homes were
              destroyed; but perhaps worse, food and supplies were mostly cut off after the
              only access point, a 15-mile road leading to the mountaintop, disintegrated. It
              was then that 120 or so of the more able-bodied nuns made a two-day trek down
              the mountain to the nearest road, where they were transported by bus to
              Katmandu, where aid awaited. But many sisters were left behind: Nuns who were
              too elderly, sick or disabled to make the trek remained on the mountain, living
              under plastic tarps. Life in the city was hardly better: Spiritual beings used
              to the space and solitude of the monastic life were forced to share small,
              ill-equipped tents, living virtually on top of one another. Many got
              sick. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“These women have never lived in such
              close quarters; they’ve never lived in a city before, and they’ve never been so
              hot,” Samantha Wolthuis, director of Disaster Response and International
              Operations for American Jewish World Service (AJWS), said in an interview from
              Nepal.   </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“They’re used to being in a quiet,
              peaceful environment where their primary purpose is meditation and devotion to
              Buddhism, and now, they’re living in a very congested city, on top of each
              other. The trauma is pretty significant.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wolthuis was among the first
              emergency-response workers to travel to Nepal after the earthquake and spent
              two weeks on the ground there providing immediate relief. She returned for the
              second time in late September to begin mapping out longer-term projects, and
              what she found was disheartening. Rebuilding had been seriously stymied by the
              summer monsoon season, which brought torrential rains and dangerous
              mudslides. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Although some fear Nepal may become the
              next Haiti, where “yesterday’s temporary shelters have become today’s permanent
              slums,” according to Haitian-born Nixon Boumba, AJWS’ in-country consultant in
              Nepal, Wolthuis insists that the Nepalese people are resilient and that
              progress is being made, little by little. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One promising trend was started by the
              Himalayan Climate Initiative, a Nepal-based nongovernmental organization that
              AJWS supports, which assembled a team of architects and engineers to create the
              Resilient Homes project, an effort to rebuild communities with durable,
              lightweight, easy-to-assemble homes that are “climate-smart and earthquake
              resistant.” Each building uses locally sourced materials, including from debris,
              and offers locals a chance to build the walls with whatever materials they can
              procure — whether mud, brick or bamboo.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So far, 254 homes have been built this
              way, and the prototype could easily be replicated at the nunnery, offering
              reliable protection from the high-altitude elements. But Wolthuis said that the
              nuns’ dream of returning to their mountain is a long way off.  </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“They think it will take a minimum of a
              couple of years to be able to rebuild the nunnery and go back to the
              mountains,” she said. “It’s an incredibly sad situation. The rebuilding is very
              complicated, because it’s expensive and it’s incredibly hard to get to the
              community, because there are 15 miles of road and trails that need to be
              repaired before any rebuilding can happen.” </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The nuns are hoping for government
              intervention, but Wolthuis said that is highly unlikely. In addition to all the
              other needed rebuilding, the Chinese government has long pressured Nepali
              authorities to marginalize the Tibetan Buddhists. Plus, Nepal recently passed a
              new constitution that is roiling trade with India and further precluding
              recovery. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In the meantime, AJWS is providing the
              nuns, among other local groups, with health care and psychosocial support. They
              also are looking to help with rebuilding efforts once the nunnery road has been
              repaired. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wolthuis said the Jewish response to the
              earthquake was especially robust — perhaps because of a spiritual connection to
              Nepal, or because it remains a popular tourist destination for Israelis getting
              out of the army — enabling the creation of a $2.3 million fund to support both
              immediate relief and long-term rebuilding. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Asked if it was difficult for her to
              conjure the joy of Sukkot in a place of devastation, Wolthuis said, “There is
              no place I would rather be. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 26.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“If you know [something terrible] is
              happening, not to be doing anything or working on it is really, really
              challenging for me. So I feel very lucky [to do this work]. It’s festive in a
              very, very different way.”</span></p>
