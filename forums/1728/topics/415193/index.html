              <p>Good article. Thanks :)</p>
              <p>Buddha's wisdom really takes time and refining of insights to appreciate.</p>
              <p>Sadly, there are some people who always like to say that Buddhism at this current age is flawed... without even firstly experiencing and knowing how the insights gradually can liberate one's psychological suffering.</p>

              <p>i feel its really not easy... to both point out the path to others whom we see are suffering from their life experiences, and to at the same time keep reapplying the practice again and again in my own daily interactions.</p>
              <p>like Dean writes in this article, it points to a constant letting go..</p>

              <p>I agree with you. Recently,  had some breakthrough... but will take time to stabilise.</p>
              <p>That is, i chose to liberate myself first and not engage in pointing out to others...unnecessarily.  When i try to point out to someone (in a reactive way), the one that is suffering is myself.

              <p>Until Right View is fully stabilised in the moment, our pointing out to others is already out of right view.</p>
              <p>There will come a point of realising that there is utterly no one out there. ... and it is liberating !</p>

              <p>Geis, thanks for sharing the article... very well written! Indeed... having insight is far from an end, it is just the beginning. Still much work to be done... even though there will never be a point where it is 'done' - <em style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>As we learn to sustain the view the mindfulness in the present moment
               we awaken to the ongoing and endless changing moment of which we are a 
              part </strong>and</em><em><strong> at the same time it's utter wholeness and completeness.  There is no "done" because there was never any "undone".</strong></em></p>
              <p>The past few weeks have made me more aware of my own 'momentum and conditioning' as well.</p>

              <p>Although in the previous post, i say to chose to liberate myself first and not engage in unnecessary 'preaching'..., there are 'merits' in telling people about the teaching especially the 3 characteristics.

              <p>Also, in my experience, the time that we are not in right view are also the times that we are giving ourselve excuses that 'this thing on hand is more important than anything else'. We have already got suck into the 'spell'.</p>
              <p>The duration in Right View will get longer and longer.... the times that we get kicked out of it are the times when reactive karmic habits (or sankaras) has overtaken and pulled one's (attention) into a spell. More often that not, they are the same few habits that we have taken for granted.</p>

              <p>Yes good point...</p>
              <p>Reminds me of something I posted before:</p>
              <p><em>I remember years ago (in fact even today) Thusness would have me
                                      explain the dharma to people from various forums. One time many
                                      years ago I thought it would be better if Thusness explained by
                                      himself to the others, so I told Thusness why don't you post
                                      yourself or something like that. Thusness suddenly appeared serious
                                      (he seldom talk in this tone) and asked me so are you going to do
                                      this or not? Then he told me the reason (not exact words now but
                                      along this line) he had me to do this was because I was lacking in
                                      merits to gain enlightenment. And then he said something like...
                                      you think I'm joking? Suddenly at that moment I realized why he was
                                      always taking the trouble and instructing me to do all those
                                      things... when he could have done it himself.</em></p>
              <p><em>Not long later I had a meditation experience... he informed me
                                      it is due to my merits ripening due to explaining the dharma to
                                      someone some time ago. He informed me there is a direct causal
                                      relation. When asked how does he know that merits is important for
                                      experience and realization, he simply says this is his experience.
                                      He says it may not make a lot of sense to a dualistic mind, but
                                      this is how it (dependent origination) works.</em></p>

              <p>Indeed... we should have the thought to cause all living beings to awaken and liberate, and yet if we try to 'save the world' thinking that there is a self and others, then we are not true bodhisattvas.</p>
              <p><strong>Diamond Sutra:</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br> The Buddha told Subhuti, "All Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas, should 
                                subdue their minds thus: 'I must cause all living beings--those 
                                born from eggs, wombs, moisture, by transformation; those with form, 
                                those without form, those with thought, those without thought, those 
                                not totally endowed with thought, and those not totally without 
                                thought--to enter Nirvana without residue and be taken across to 
                                Cessation. Yet of the immeasurable, numberless, boundless numbers 
                                of living beings thus taken across to Cessation, there is actually 
                                no living being taken across to Cessation.' Why? Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva 
                                has an appearance of self, others, living beings, or a life, he 
                                is not a Bodhisattva."</strong></p>

              <p>thanks guys for all the valuable sharings. </p>
              <p>sharing the dharma and being compassionate to all beings does progress one's practice, and makes one's physical life better as well</p>
              <p>lately, by almost doing nothing, i had an opportunity in work which i can say  was presented on my table. this opportunity helped reset my career as well as wiped clean all the financial deficits i had accumulated in the past. the only thing i did in this whole excercise was to be honest with my co-workers and watch the events as they unfold. along the way, there were occasions that pushed me to react, but glad that i was able to spot them and let them rest, thus stopping the auto spiral.</p>
              <p>experiences of insights is still conditional in nature, but its these conditional experiences that points to that which is unconditional. reading the article and contemplating over it, i realize the habitual momentum of the mind to even cling to insights is something that is so subtle yet so strong, that really constant mindfulness is required. i thank Dean for bringing this to awareness, and also to all in this forum. u guys are my long distance teachers haha. </p>
