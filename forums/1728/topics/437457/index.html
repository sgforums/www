              <p>I have just read online that Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche has just passed away at his monastery at Sitapaila outside Kathmandu.<br><br>The
               following days and weeks are an important time for all of his students and those who have a connection and who have received teachings from him in S'pore
              to practice as much as possible, to think of him and to merge their 
              minds with his.</p>
              <p>==================================</p>
              <p>Kyabjé Trulshik Rinpoche was born at Yardrok Taklung in <a title="Central Tibet" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Central_Tibet">Central Tibet</a> in 1923. He was recognized in early childhood as the immediate re-embodiment of <a title="Trulshik Dongak Lingpa" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Trulshik_Dongak_Lingpa">Tertön Dongak Lingpa</a> (Kunzang Thongdrol Dorje) a famous <a title="Tertön" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Tert%C3%B6n">discoverer of spiritual treasures</a> and is also considered as being the manifestaion of Lord Buddha’s disciple <a title="Ananda" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Ananda">Ananda</a>, as well as of <a title="Aryadeva" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Aryadeva">Aryadeva</a>, <a title="Thönmi Sambhota" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Th%C3%B6nmi_Sambhota">Thönmi Sambhota</a>, the abbot <a title="Shantarakshita" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Shantarakshita">Shantarakshita</a>, the translator <a title="Vairotsana" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Vairotsana">Vairotsana</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Rechungpa" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Rechungpa">Rechung Dorje Trakpa</a>.</p>
              <p>He received his early education from his predecessor's foremost disciple, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ngawang Tendzin Norbu" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Ngawang_Tendzin_Norbu">Ngawang Tendzin Norbu</a> (1867-1942), who was known as the Buddha of Dza Rongphuk after his 
              place of retreat and the monastery that he established on the northern 
              slopes of Mount Everest. After Ngawang Tendzin Norbu passed away, 
              Trulshik Rinpoche became the abbot of the monastic community, and 
              following the tragic events of 1959 moved with his followers to safe 
              haven in the valleys to the south of the Mount Everest area, among the 
              Sherpa people of northeastern Nepal. <a title="Thupten Chöling" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Thupten_Ch%C3%B6ling">Thupten Chöling</a>, the monastery that he founded there, is today renowned as a foremost centre for the monastic traditions of the <a title="Nyingma" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Nyingma">Nyingma</a> School of <a title="Tibetan Buddhism" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Tibetan_Buddhism">Tibetan Buddhism</a>. Since he came out of Tibet, Rinpoche has ordained nearly ten thousand monks and nuns.</p>

              <p>Besides his root-guru, Trulshik Rinpoche's teachers have included <a title="Minling Chung Rinpoche" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Minling_Chung_Rinpoche">Minling Chung Rinpoche</a> and Dordzin Rinpoche, <a title="Dudjom Rinpoche" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Dudjom_Rinpoche">Dudjom Rinpoche</a>, <a title="Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Jamyang_Khyentse_Ch%C3%B6kyi_Lodr%C3%B6">Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö</a> and especially <a title="Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Dilgo_Khyentse_Rinpoche">Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche</a> of whom he was like a heart-son. Altogether he had some fifty masters 
              representing all of the major lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. Over the 
              years, he has also been offering many rare Nyingma teachings to His 
              Holiness the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Dalai Lama" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Dalai_Lama">Dalai Lama</a>.</p>
              <p>Trulshik Rinpoche is also the unique heir to some of Tibet's 
              rarer traditions, for instance that of the "Pacification of Suffering" 
              (Tib. <a title="Shyijé" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Shyij%C3%A9">Shyijé</a>), first introduced in Tibet during the 11th century by the Indian yogin <a title="Padampa Sangye" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Padampa_Sangye">Padampa Sangye</a>.
               As the present embodiment of a line of treasure-discoverers, he 
              continues his predecessor's teachings, especially those in relations to 
              the great master <a title="Padmasambhava" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Padmasambhava">Padmasambhava</a> and the meditational teachings of the Great Perfection or <a title="Dzogchen" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Dzogchen">Dzogchen</a>.
               Trulshik Rinpoche's unusually clear and spontaneous style of teaching 
              is reflected in his accomplishments as a poet and master of all aspects 
              of the monastic arts. His direction of the annual Mani Rimdu festival of
               masked dance-drama is documented in Richard Kohn's film <em>Lord of the Dance, Destroyer of Illusion</em> (1986), the title of which  is in part derived from his name, Trulshik Rinpoche, "the Precious Destroyer of Illusion."</p>
              <p>Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche accepted in 2010 the position of the new head of the Nyingma school. The previous head, Kyabje <a title="Minling Trichen Rinpoche" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Minling_Trichen_Rinpoche">Minling Trichen Rinpoche</a>, passed away in 2008.</p>
              <p>He entered parinirvana on 2nd September 2011 and remained in <a title="Tukdam" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Tukdam">tukdam</a> for three days in his monastery in Kathmandu, Nepal.</p>

              <p>Kyabje Trulshik Ngawang Chokyi Lodro was born in 1923, in Yardrok 
              Taklung, in central Tibet. He was recognised as a youth to be the 
              reincarnation of Trulshik Dongak Lingpa. His first master was Dzatrul 
              Dorje Chang, who was one of the three main disciples of Trulshik Dongak 
              Lingpa.<br><br>His first master was Dzatrul Dorje Chang, who was one of 
              the three main disciples of Trulshik Dongak Lingpa. One day, Dzatrul 
              Dorje Chang, after the passing away of his guru, witnessed two flying 
              sparks which he perceived to be coming from the Copper Colored Mountain.
               One landed in a village near the seat of his master and the other one 
              landed in his very own lap. The obvious meaning<br>to him was that there
               would be two incarnations of Trulshik Dongak Lingpa. One would be found
               in that village and the other would be found by him and would be under 
              his care. This is what transpired.<br><br>The spark in the village 
              became extinguished after only a short time, unlike the spark that came 
              to him. Later, he understood that this was a foreshadowing that 
              indicated that the incarnation in the village would not live long, 
              because that is how things took place. Whereas, the incarnation which 
              came to his care, that of Trulshik Rinpoche, had a long life, indicated 
              by the bright, long-lasting light of the direct message from the Copper 
              Colored Mountain. <br><br>Seventeen of
               Trulshig Rinpoche's previous incarnations were in Tibet, including 
              Rechungpa. Rechungpa, was one of the main disciples of the great poet 
              and mystic, Milarepa. Trulshig Rinpoche, also appeared as Lalung Palgi 
              Dorje, who ended the reign of terror of the evil king, Langdarma. 
              Langdarma, systematically killed all religious practitioners in Tibet. 
              Lalung Palgi Dorje performed the Black Hat dance for the king, 
              concealing an arrow in the wide sleeve of his<br>robe. Out of 
              compassion, both for the victims and for the king, who in future 
              incarnations would suffer the pain he now inflicted on others, the monk 
              drew the hidden arrow from his sleeve and killed the king.</p>

               one believes it or not, when you have met a great, authentic and 
              enlightened guru and when you are able to use your life to practise 
              honestly for the sake of all beings, your life is truly a 
              wish-fulfilling gem. The Guru will take care of everything, he or she is
               everywhere and you are looked after in the spiritual and mundane sense,
               so long as you have complete confidence in your guru.</p>
              <p>Sadly, even after having met the Guru with the most enlightened 
              qualities or one that is completely enlightened like the Vajradhara, 
              most of us are not that fortunate to be able to understand, realise and 
              appreciate such kind of rare connection. The Guru may give some 
              hardships and may put you in a situation that may seem impossible or 
              ridiculous, but if you carry out all the instructions, no matter how 
              stupid, unthinkable or illogical they are, everything seems to work very
               well. Obstacles are there but you will somehow manage to cross over 
              them, sometimes with small injuries, sometimes without any scratches. 
              But you will always be a better person. If Marpa didn't give Milarepa 
              that much hardship, he wouldn't have become enlightened, all his 
              negative karma due to killing his enemies would not have been purified. 
              No way! But if Marpa is here today, giving us the same kind of training,
               I think he would be left with no students, no followers and no 
              devotees, he would have no one to pass the lineage to.</p>
              <p>I sometimes feel that I am not such a great practitioner. I have a 
              lot of downfalls and I don't seem to be fulfilling the wishes of my 
              Gurus in terms of my practice and my activities to benefit all beings, 
              because like many of the people these days, I have all sorts of 
              priorities. I am fortunate that I have met some of the greatest Gurus of
               the last and the present centuries. A few of them are still around, 
              actively guiding me to realise the nature of my mind.</p>
              <p><a title="With my Guru and my dad, having a great time" rel="lytebox[gallery]" href="http://www.drukpa.org/images/stories/news/2011/110529-heart/1992.jpg"><img src="http://www.drukpa.org/images/stories/news/2011/110529-heart/1992_small.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="left"></a>As
               I told you last time, I was in a relatively short retreat. Just when I 
              was about to end the retreat at around 3pm, my attendant kept knocking 
              on my door saying that my Guru's attendant had brought a scarf for me. I
               have kept this retreat a private affair, so except for my close 
              attendants, no one knew that I was in a retreat, most people thought 
              that I was not in town. It was impossible that my Guru and his entourage
               would have known about it, unless they had a CCTV around me. Although 
              this retreat had a time commitment, I myself did not keep track of the 
              time. After my Guru's attendant came that day at 3pm to hand over the 
              scarf to me, I found out that it was the exact time that my commitment 
              to the retreat had just ended.</p>
              <p>This shows that all the enlightened Gurus have the omniscient mind 
              that works like a modern-day CCTV, following us everywhere and this 
              means that if we have complete confidence in them, whenever we need 
              their attention and their help, they are right there with us. Lama 
              Khyenno!</p>
              <p>I immediately went to pay homage to my beloved Guru who has not been 
              very well for quite a while. When he met me, he literally jumped with 
              joy and was so thrilled to meet me. I had not been seeing him as I was 
              afraid to disturb his peace. Of course, we do not need to connect 
              physically, we have our own ways to communicate. But seeing him in his 
              physical presence really moved me, especially he was thanking me for 
              doing a great job, before I could even tell him that I was in a retreat.
               That means if a disciple does an effective practice with pure 
              motivation to benefit all beings, the Guru knows and receives that as a 
              great wish-fulfilling happiness. What more can a disciple ask, other 
              than to please his or her Guru this way. This has to happen naturally 
              and absolutely without any expectation, without any fabrication. In any 
              sort of spiritual practice, if you have any doubt, expectation, hope and
               fear, this will create great obstacles in your life. I myself have 
              missed many of these great opportunities because of hope and fear. This 
              is why the Buddha says that the greatest offering is the offering of 
              your own practice and your own enlightenment. I was moved to tears when I
               saw my Guru being so happy and appreciative of the little retreat that I
               had completed.</p>
              <p>My Guru's attendant told me that my Guru had not been smiling and 
              laughing for a long time, perhaps due to his frail health. He kept 
              thanking me for meeting our Guru and making him so happy. I really wish I
               can do a lot more than what I am doing now. Those of us who are 
              fortunate to have met genuine Gurus who are enlightened should not waste
               our lives.</p>
              <p>Whenever I watch National Geographic or Discovery channels, 
              especially whenever they show the food chain of one kind of animals 
              killing other animals, I really feel that we are so fortunate to have 
              this human body. Lions, tigers, crocodiles, pyranas and all the 
              predatory species do not have our privilege as human beings to 
              understand the universal law of karma, so they are always dragged by 
              their killing habits or their foolish habits. Some animals like zebras 
              and elephants have to migrate from north to the south, and everytime 
              they have to cross a river full of crocodiles, many lose their lives 
              while crossing the river. But next year, they do the same thing again 
              because of habitual imprints, I would say. The sad stories happen over 
              and over again, the chain cannot be broken, because the poor animals do 
              not have a solution to stop this cyclic existence.</p>
              <p>We as human beings have the intelligence and cognitive function to 
              understand universal law of karma, to stop this cyclic existence and 
              become enlightened, especially those of us who have the great 
              opportunities to meet so many wonderful and honest spiritual masters, 
              who sacrifice their own comfort to come to our world to teach us. Some 
              of us get very soft treatments, some of us get very hard treatments, but
               we all have this ONE opportunity in THIS VERY LIFE.</p>
              <p>I am sharing this with you as a part of my small experience. To end 
              this message, I am making a strong supplication to all the enlightened 
              Gurus in this universe from the depth of my heart, may they live long, 
              happily and heathily!</p>
