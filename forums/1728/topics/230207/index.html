            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that one can be happy always if he don't easily see situations as 'problems'.. thus problems are most of the time perspectives of the human mind.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>All Problems Are Illusions Of The Mind</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It feels as if a heavy burden has been lifted. A sense of lightness. I feel clear... but my problems are still there waiting for me, aren't they? They haven't been solved. Am I not just temporarily evading them?</span><br><br>If you found yourself in paradise, it wouldn't be long before your mind would say "yes, but...."<br><br>Ultimately, this is not about solving your problems. It's about realizing that there <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> no problems. Only situations - to be dealt with now, or to be left alone and accepted as part of the "isness" of the present moment until they change or <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> be dealt with. Problems are mind-made and need time to survive. They cannot survive in the actuality of the Now.<br><br>Focus your attention on the Now and tell me what problem you have at this moment.<br><br>[Pause and meditate]<br><br>I am not getting any answer because it is impossible to have a problem when your attention is fully in the Now. A situation that needs to be either dealt with or accepted - yes. Why make it into a problem? Why make anything into a problem? Isn't lifechallenging enough as it is? What do you need problems for? The mind unconsciously loves problems because they give you an identity of sorts. This is normal, and it is insane. "Problem" means that you are dwelling on a situation mentally without there being a true intention or possibility of taking action now and that you are unconsciously making it part of your sense of self. You become so overwhelmed by your life situation that you lose your sense of life, of Being. Or you are carrying in your mind the insane burden of a hundred things that you will or may have to do in the future instead of focusing your attention on the one thing that you can do now.<br><br>When you create a problem, you create pain. All it takes is a simple choice, a simple decision: no matter what happens, I will create no more pain for myself. I will create no more problems. Although it is a simple choice, it is also very radical. You won' t make that choice unless you are truly fed up with suffering, unless you have truly had enough. And you won't be able to go through with it unless you access the power of the Now. If you create no more pain for yourself, then you create no more pain for others. You also no longer contaminate the beautiful Earth, your inner space, and the collective human psyche with the negativity of problem-making.<br><br>[Pause and meditate]<br><br>If you have ever been in a life-or-death emergency situation, you will know that it wasn't a problem. The mind didn't have time to fool around and make it into a problem. In a true emergency, the mind stops; you become totally present in the Now, and something infinitely more powerful takes over. This is why there are many reports of ordinary people suddenly becoming capable of incredibly courageous deeds. In any emergency, either you survive or you don't. Either way, it is not a problem.<br><br>Some people get angry when they hear me say that problems are illusions. I am threatening to take away their sense of who they are. They have invested much time in a false sense of self. For many years, they have unconsciously defined their whole identity in terms of' their problems or their suffering. Who would they be without it?<br><br>A great deal of what people say, think, or do is actually motivated by fear, which of course is always linked with having your focus on the future and being out of touch with the Now. As there are no problems in the Now, there is no fear either.<br><br>Should a situation arise that you need to deal with now, your action will be clear and incisive if it arises out of present-moment awareness. It is also more likely to be effective. It will not be a reaction coming from the past conditioning of your mind but an intuitive response to the situation. In other instances, when the time-bound mind would have reacted, you will find it more effective to do nothing - just stay centered in the Now.<br><br>~ Eckhart Tolle, The Power of Now</blockquote></div>
