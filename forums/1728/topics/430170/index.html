              <p>...
               Another school, the Jains, accepted the Vedic premise that one's  
              actions shaped one's experience of the cosmos, but they differed from  
              the Vedas in the way they conceived of action. All action, according to 
               them, was a form of violence. The more violent the act, the more it  
              produced effluents, conceived as sticky substances that bound the soul  
              to the round of rebirth. Thus they rejected the Vedic assertion that  
              ritual sacrifice produced good kamma, for the violence involved in  
              killing the sacrificial animals was actually a form of very sticky bad  
              kamma. In their eyes, the only way to true happiness was to try to  
              escape the round of kamma entirely. This was to be done by violence  
              against themselves: various forms of self-torture that were supposed to 
               burn away the effluents (asava), the "heat" (tapa) of pain being a sign
               that the  effluents were burning. At the same time, they tried to 
              create as little  new kamma as possible. This practice would culminate 
              in total  abstinence from physical action, resulting in suicide by 
              starvation, the  theory being that if old kamma were completely burned 
              away, and no new  kamma created, there would be no more effluents to 
              bind the soul to the  cosmos. Thus the soul would be released.</p>
              <p>Despite
               the differences between the Vedic and Jain views of action,  they 
              shared some important similarities: Both believed that the physical  
              performance of an action, rather than the mental attitude behind it,  
              determined its kammic result. And, both saw <em>kamma as acting under  
              deterministic, linear laws. Kamma performed in the present would not  
              bear fruit until the future, and the relationship between a particular  
              action and its result was predictable and fixed.</em></p>
              <p>These 
              divergent viewpoints on the nature of action formed the  backdrop for 
              the Bodhisatta's quest for ultimate happiness. On the one  side stood 
              the Ajivakas and Lokayatans, who insisted for various reasons  that 
              human action was ineffective: either non-existent, chaotic, or  totally 
              pre-determined. On the other side stood the Vedic and Jain  thinkers, 
              who taught that physical action was effective, but that it was  subject 
              to deterministic and linear laws, and could not lead to true  happiness 
              beyond the round of rebirth. The Buddha's position on kamma  broke from 
              both sides of the issue, largely because he approached the  question 
              from a radically new direction.</p>
              <p>... To begin with, every act has 
              repercussions in the present moment  together with reverberations 
              extending into the future. Depending on the  intensity of the act, these
               reverberations can last for a very short or  a very long time. Thus 
              every event takes place in a context determined  by the combined effects
               of past events coming from a wide range in time,  together with the 
              effects of present acts. These effects can intensify  one another, can 
              coexist with little interaction, or can cancel one  another out. Thus, <em>even
               though it is possible to predict that a certain  type of act will tend 
              to give a certain type of result — for example,  acting on anger will 
              lead to pain — there is no way to predict when or  where that result 
              will make itself felt. </em></p>
              <p>The complexity of the system is 
              further enhanced by the fact that  both causal principles meet at the 
              mind. Through its views and  intentions, the mind keeps both principles 
              active. Through its sensory  powers, it is affected by the results of 
              the causes it has set in  motion. This allows for the causal principles 
              to feed back into  themselves, as the mind reacts to the results of its 
              own actions. These  reactions can form positive feedback loops, 
              intensifying the original  input and its results, much like the howl in a
               speaker placed next to  the microphone feeding into it. They can also 
              create negative feedback  loops, counteracting the original input, in 
              the same way that a  thermostat turns off a heater when the temperature 
              in a room is too  high, and turns it on again when it gets too low. 
              Because the results of  actions can be immediate, and the mind can react
               to them immediately,  these feedback loops can sometimes quickly spin 
              out of control; at other  times, they may provide skillful checks on 
              one's behavior. For example,  a man may act out of anger, which gives 
              him an immediate sense of  dis-ease to which he may react with further 
              anger, thus creating a  snowballing effect. On the other hand, he may 
              come to understand that  the anger is causing his dis-ease, and so 
              immediately attempt to stop  it. However, there can also be times when 
              the results of his past  actions may obscure his present dis-ease, so 
              that he doesn't immediately  react to it at all. This means that, <strong>although there are general  patterns relating habitual acts to their results, there is no set <span class=" fbUnderline"> one-for-one, tit-for-tat, relationship</span> between a particular action and  its results.</strong> Instead, the results are determined by the entire context  of the act, 
              shaped by the actions that preceded or followed it, and by  one's state 
              of mind at the time of acting or experiencing the result.</p>
              <p>In this 
              way, the combination of two causal principles — influences  from the 
              past interacting with those in the immediate present — accounts  for the
               complexity of causal relationships on the level of immediate  
              experience. However, the combination of the two principles also opens  
              the possibility for finding a systematic way to break the causal web. <em>If
                causes and effects were entirely linear, the cosmos would be totally  
              deterministic, and nothing could be done to escape from the machinations
                of the causal process.</em> If they were entirely synchronic, there 
              would be  no relationship from one moment to the next, and all events 
              would be  arbitrary. The web could break down totally or reform 
              spontaneously for  no reason at all. However, with the two modes working
               together, one can  learn from causal patterns observed from the past 
              and apply one's  insights to disentangling the same causal patterns 
              acting in the  present. If one's insights are true, one can then gain 
              freedom from  those patterns. This allows for escape from the cycle of 
              kamma  altogether by developing kamma at a heightened level of skill by 
               pursuing the noble eightfold path.</p>

              <p>THe problem of this is that , Southern school aka Theravada school do not understand Emptiness ,which is central to the Mahayana Buddhism and Vajrayana .</p>
              <p>In Mind-only school , its not the actions ,its the seeds in the mind-field (alaya-vijnanas) that with the right conditions ,initiated revenge and all this</p>
              <p>One does not necessary cause harm to the other person , like cursing someone , without even effecting any actual physical contact with the other person , but the karma which brings about suffering is there</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It just like an Projector .A projector display a image of someone you hate the most and you generate illwill ,malice towards that person .Did the person suffer ?unless you have spernatural power to made that person suffer , else its the projection on your mind that u seeded a heavy karma .The result is that you created an negative aura(modern day i denoted it as outlook) that made people despised you.</p>
              <p>If you couldnt understand what this teaching is ,Ven hai tao have spoken before on the action create opposing force (fan zhuo yong li).Not to the action you create , but your subsequent undertaking </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to make it simple ,if you on the way to job interview and you accidentally stepped onto a snail and cause it death .You filled with malice to despise the carcasses .This becomes a very heavy karma ,which caused you to have unsmooth Job interview or glitches on the way.However ,you feel remorse for this accidental action which caused death of the snail , the outlook of you changes which change the outcome of the job interview , and you may get the job .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such workings of Karma is a very lengthy discussion which is found in the Yogacara teachings .That is why in Pureland teaching expounded by Ven Master Chin Kung</p>
              <p>to harbour Good Intention , so your setback will be reduced to the minimal impact .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For a very interesting discussion , do feel free to ask the central teachings of Yogacara</p>

              <p>According to Walpola Rahula, all the elements of the Yogacara 
              store-consciousness (alaya-vijnana) are already found in the Pali 
              Canon.[26] He writes that the three layers of the mind (citta, called 
              "luminous" in the passage discussed above, manas, and vijnana) as 
              presented by Asanga are also used in the Pali Canon: "Thus we can see 
              that Vijnana represents the simple reaction or response of the sense 
              organs when they come in contact with external objects. This is the 
              uppermost or superficial aspect or layer of the Vijnanaskanda. Manas 
              represents the aspect of its mental functioning, thinking, reasoning, 
              conceiving ideas, etc. Citta which is here called Alayavijnana, 
              represents the deepest, finest and subtlest aspect or layer of the 
              Aggregate of consciousness. It contains all the traces or impressions of
               the past actions and all good and bad future possibilities."[27]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the teaching of bhavanga which acts as a storehouse of continuum of imprints and latent tendencies is taught in theravada</p>
