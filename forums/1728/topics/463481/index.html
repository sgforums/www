              <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Huiyuan thus became a monk, though a Ch’an monk, but later gained permission from his Abbott to set up his own movement devoted to attaining freedom from suffering in the Pure Land.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Although the Pratyutpanna Sutra (which describes a fairly advanced form of Pure Land practice) came to China from India sometime in the first century of the Common Era, it was not until some four hundred years later that Pure Land Buddhism became a focus of attention due to the intense interest of a monk Hui Yuan, the first Pure Land Patriarch. Huiyuan was originally a Taoist scholar who sought immortality. Of course, he sadly found that nobody he knew lived over the age of eighty!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> <br><br>We cannot be absolutely sure how Huiyuan came across the Pure Land Sutras nonetheless they ignited his interest as they spoke of another transcendence that was beyond just physical mortality. They spoke of a transcendence of all suffering, an ending of the not-so-merry-go-round of birth and death, and a life after this mortal life of ours in a place called the Land of Ultimate Bliss. It is in this land that one could progress towards Nirvana without having to come back in human or animal form again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The principle practice of Pure Land Buddhism is the meditation on the figure and name of Amidha Buddha, the Buddha of never ending Life and Light and on the oral reciting or chanting of the Buddha’s name – in Chinese <em>Amituo Fo.</em> The Pure Land practice parallels Zen Buddhism in that its aim is to empty the mind of all thought and attain awakening and union with pure being, <em>Thusness. </em></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However, perhaps the major sticking point for many newcomers to Pure Land Buddhism is the belief in the existence of another place called Pure Land. Is it nothing more than just a Buddhist Heaven, similar to the Christian 'heaven'? Was the Lord Buddha speaking only figuratively when he described in great and minute detail the landscape of Pure Land as is recorded in the Visualization Sutra and the Amitabha Sutra? Many Pure Land practitioners today tend to stay clear of ‘the Pure Land exists’ idea and settle for Pure Land being in one’s own mind. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I’m not sure I agree. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Shakyamuni Buddha was a careful and precise teacher and was not prone to speaking figuratively. If he were speaking only in these terms then how much more of the Sutras do we need to reshape? Do we need to reinvent Buddhism for our modern era? It was not long ago in our world history that the world was considered to be flat. Many suffered torture for believing otherwise. My own mother was ridiculed by her friends when she used to “dream” of human beings one day going to the moon. I recall dearly the day as the world sat glued to their TV screens to watch that momentous event of man landing on the moon and small tears rolling down my mother’s eyes and my father holding her, deeply apologizing for having laughed at her years before. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In recent world history we have placed a probe on Mars and there is the likelihood of life form on this planet. We have begun to punch into the outer reaches of our galaxy and it is more than possible that there be other planets containing life form similar to ours. Who would be the first to deny this? </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I would like to explore, what this means for our understanding of a “Pure Land”.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The eyes and ears of sentient beings are limited in their scope and we have very limited knowledge. Moreover, many Pure Land practitioners have witnessed scenes of the Pure Land whilst in Samadhi, and attained awakening. I recently spoke to a very devout Chinese lady who can neither read nor write and had not even heard of the Pure Land Sutras yet described the Pure Land of her Samadhi exactly as it is recorded!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Of course by speaking of an actual place we are speaking of ‘form’. However as the Zen Master Chu Huang of the 16<sup>th</sup> century wrote: <em>“Mind equals object: there is no mind beyond objects. Since objects are wholly mind why must we cling to mind and dismiss objects? Those who dismiss objects when they talk of mind have not comprehended mind.”</em></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Pure Land practice is not just about being re-born in a lotus bud in the Land of Ultimate Bliss to live happily ever after. One will have missed the point completely. The cycle of birth and death is an extremely heavy burden. “Life is suffering” spoke the Buddha. Even if, in this lifetime, you are living at ease and have comfort of body and mind, is this not because of causes previously set in motion by your merits attained from good deeds and a pure mind? One must be careful as if one does not continue to plant the seeds of pure karma then the merits will become exhausted and one retrogresses back into the cycle; one gets back on the not-so-merry-go-round of birth and death.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Buddha knew it was extremely difficult to eliminate all impure karma in this lifetime. It is like putting a bucket under the roof as we do at our temple to catch the rainwater. There always seems to be dust and dirt at the bottom of the bucket even though full of pure rainwater. So it is with our life. Therefore the Buddha spoke to us of Amida Buddha and his powerful vows that whosoever recites his name with a pure concentrated heart-mind is able attain rebirth in the Pure Land. Indeed even as we meditate or recite with one-pointed concentration we are in that moment in Pure Land. Pure Land is but one breath away. Once reborn in the Pure Land we are able to progress in the Dharma and eventually attain Nirvana as Buddhas. Pure Land is not the final destination but one crucial and vital step along the way.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Between us and the Ultimate Bliss of Nirvana and Buddhahood is a fast flowing river with strong currents and counter currents. If we have the strength, perseverance and tenacity to reach the other side we may be able to swim across. In the world we live in the crosscurrents are extremely powerful and the likelihood is we will not make it across. Amidha Buddha and Pure Land is like a powered motorboat that is able to break through the swirl and arrive to meet our Buddha nature.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The last time I went across a fast flowing river here in China I did not ask myself “Do I believe that this boat exists?” I had faith that it did and faith that it would take me across. My motivation to cross the river fuelled my faith; so I got on board. Faith, Vows and Practice become the tri-pod upon which Pure Land Buddhism stands. Our practice is staying on the boat. Does the other side exist? I think I will trust the great Pure Land Masters who have gone before me and continue the journey in practice. Doubt only serves to unsettle the boat and we could get tossed into the river. Firm resolve is a sure way to attain ultimate happiness for ourselves and for all sentient beings. </span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Are the Mind-only Pure Land and the Self-nature Amitabha the same as or different from the Western Pure Land and Amitabha in the Pure Land?</strong></p>
              <p>It is because the Mind-only Pure Land exists that we are reborn in the Pure Land of the West. If the mind is not pure, it is impossible to achieve rebirth in the Pure Land. Even when those who have committed cardinal transgressions achieve rebirth through ten recitations, such rebirth is due to their reciting the Buddha’s name with a pure mind, thus eliciting a response from Amitabha Buddha. Ordinary people generally think that if the Pure Land is Mind-Only, then it does not exist. This is the understanding of demons and externalists. Such a deluded view, which appears correct but is in reality wrong, affects more than half of all people and causes practitioners to forfeit true benefits.</p>
              <p>It is precisely because of the Self-Nature Amitabha that the practitioner must recite the name of Buddha Amitabha of the West seeking rebirth in the Pure Land – so as to achieve the Self-Nature Amitabha through gradual cultivation. If he merely grasps at the Self-Nature Amitabha but does not recite the name of Buddha Amitabha of the West, he cannot achieve immediate escape from Birth and death – not even if he is truly awakened, much less if (like most people who ask this question) he is pretentious and just indulges in empty talk without engaging in practice.</p>
              <p>Thus the answer to your question [are the mind-Only Pure Land and the Self-Nature Amitabha the same as or different from the Western Pure Land and Amitabha in the Pure Land?] is that they are one yet two before Buddhahood is attained, two yet one after Buddhahood is attained.</p>

              <p><strong>Are the Mind-only Pure Land and the Self-nature Amitabha
              the same as or different from the Western Pure Land and Amitabha in
              the Pure Land?</strong></p>
              <p>It is because the Mind-only Pure Land exists that we are reborn
              in the Pure Land of the West. If the mind is not pure, it is
              impossible to achieve rebirth in the Pure Land. Even when those who
              have committed cardinal transgressions achieve rebirth through ten
              recitations, such rebirth is due to their reciting the Buddha’s
              name with a pure mind, thus eliciting a response from Amitabha
              Buddha. Ordinary people generally think that if the Pure Land is
              Mind-Only, then it does not exist. This is the understanding of
              demons and externalists. Such a deluded view, which appears correct
              but is in reality wrong, affects more than half of all people and
              causes practitioners to forfeit true benefits.</p>
              <p>It is precisely because of the Self-Nature Amitabha that the
              practitioner must recite the name of Buddha Amitabha of the West
              seeking rebirth in the Pure Land – so as to achieve the Self-Nature
              Amitabha through gradual cultivation. If he merely grasps at the
              Self-Nature Amitabha but does not recite the name of Buddha
              Amitabha of the West, he cannot achieve immediate escape from Birth
              and death – not even if he is truly awakened, much less if (like
              most people who ask this question) he is pretentious and just
              indulges in empty talk without engaging in practice.</p>
              <p>Thus the answer to your question [are the mind-Only Pure Land
              and the Self-Nature Amitabha the same as or different from the
              Western Pure Land and Amitabha in the Pure Land?] is that they are
              one yet two before Buddhahood is attained, two yet one after
              Buddhahood is attained.</p>

              <p>Yes, you are correct. I read this somewhere. This is an important message to all Pureland practitioners : <span style="color: #ff0000;">I<span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">t is precisely because of the Self-Nature Amitabha that the practitioner must recite the name of Buddha Amitabha of the West seeking rebirth in the Pure Land – so as to achieve the Self-Nature Amitabha through gradual cultivation.
