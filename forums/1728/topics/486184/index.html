              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Much-hyped therapy can reduce relapses
              into depression – but it can have troubling side effects</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">In a first floor room above a gridlocked London
              street, 20 strangers shuffle on to mats and cushions. There's an advertising
              executive, a personnel manager, a student and a pensioner. A gong sounds softly
              and a session of sitting <a title="More from the Guardian on Meditation" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/meditation">meditation</a> begins. This is one
              of more than 1,000 mindfulness courses proliferating across the UK as more and
              more people struggling with anxiety, <a title="More from the Guardian on Depression" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/depression">depression</a> and stress turn
              towards a practice adapted from a 2,400-year-old Buddhist tradition.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">Enthusiasm is booming for such mindfulness-based
              cognitive therapy (MBCT) courses, which an <a href="http://oxfordmindfulness.org/wp-content/uploads/jccp-paper-021213.pdf">Oxford University study</a> has found can reduce relapses into
              depression by 44%. It is, say the researchers, as effective as taking
              antidepressants. It involves sitting still, focusing on your breath, noticing
              when your attention drifts and bringing it back to your breath – and it is
              surprisingly challenging.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">Lifestyle magazines brim with mindfulness features
              and the global advertising giant JWT <a href="http://www.jwt.com/blog/consumer_insights/10-trends-that-will-shape-our-world-in-2014-and-beyond/">listed mindful living</a> as one of its 10 trends to shape the world
              in 2014 as consumers develop "a quasi-Zen desire to experience everything
              in a more present, conscious way".</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">But psychiatrists have now sounded a warning that
              as well as bringing benefits, mindfulness meditation can have troubling
              side-effects. Evidence is also emerging of underqualified teachers presenting
              themselves as mindfulness experts, including through the <a title="More from the Guardian on NHS" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs">NHS</a>.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">The concern comes not from critics of mindfulness
              but from supporters, such as Dr Florian Ruths, consultant psychiatrist at the
              Maudsley hospital in south London. He has launched an investigation into
              adverse reactions to MBCT, which have included rare cases of "depersonalisation",
              where people feel like they are watching themselves in a film.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">"There is a lot of enthusiasm for
              mindfulness-based therapies and they are very powerful interventions,"
              Ruths said. "But they can also have side-effects. Mindfulness is delivered
              to potentially vulnerable people with mental illness, including depression and
              anxiety, so it needs to be taught by people who know the basics about those
              illnesses, and when to refer people for specialist help."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">His inquiry follows the <a href="http://cheetahhouse.org/">"dark night" project </a>at
              Brown University in the US, which has catalogued how some Buddhist meditators
              have been assailed by traumatic memories. Problems recorded by Professor
              Willoughby Britton, the lead psychiatrist, include "cognitive, perceptual
              and sensory aberrations", changes in their sense of self and impairment in
              social relationships. One Buddhist monk, Shinzen Young, has <a href="http://shinzenyoung.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/dark-night.html">described
              the "dark night" phenomenon as</a> an "irreversible insight into
              emptiness" and "enlightenment's evil twin".</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">Mindfulness experts say such extreme adverse
              reactions are rare and are most likely to follow prolonged periods of
              meditation, such as weeks on a silent retreat. But the studies represent a new
              strain of critical thinking about mindfulness meditation amid an avalanche of
              hype.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">MBCT is commonly taught in groups in an eight-week
              programme and courses sell out fast. Ed Halliwell, who teaches in London and
              West Sussex, said some of his courses fill up within 48 hours of their being
              announced.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">"You can sometimes get the impression from
              the enthusiasm that is being shown about it helping with depression and anxiety
              that mindfulness is a magic pill you can apply without effort," he said.
              "You start watching your breath and all your problems are solved. It is
              not like that at all. You are working with the heart of your experiences,
              learning to turn towards them, and that is difficult and can be
              uncomfortable."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">Mindfulness is spreading fast into village halls,
              schools and hospitals and even the offices of banks and internet giants such as
              Google. The online meditation app Headspace now has 523,000 users in the UK, a
              threefold increase in 12 months. But mounting public interest means more
              teachers are urgently needed and concern is growing about the adequacy of
              training. Several sources have told the Guardian that some NHS trusts are
              asking health professionals to teach mindfulness after only having completed a
              basic eight-week beginners' course.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">"It is worrying," said Rebecca Crane,
              director of <a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/mindfulness/">the Centre
              for Mindfulness Research and Practice in Bangor</a>, which has trained 2,500
              teachers in the past five years. "People come along to our week-long
              teacher training retreat and then are put under pressure to get teaching very
              quickly."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">Exeter University has launched an inquiry into how
              43 NHS trusts across the UK are meeting the ballooning demand for MBCT.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">Marie Johansson, clinical lead at <a href="http://oxfordmindfulness.org/">Oxford University's mindfulness
              centre</a>, stressed the need for proper training of at least a year until
              health professionals can teach meditation, partly because on rare occasions it
              can throw up "extremely distressing experiences".</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">"Taking the course is quite
              challenging," she said. "You need to be reasonably stable and well.
              Noticing what is going on in your mind and body may be completely new and you
              may discover that there are patterns of thinking and acting and behaving that
              no longer serve you well. There might be patterns that interfere with living a
              healthy life and seeing those patterns can bring up lots of reactions and it
              can be too much to deal with. Unless it is handled well, the person could close
              down, go away with an increase in self-criticism and feeling they have
              failed."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">Finding the right teacher is often difficult for
              people approaching mindfulness for the first time. Leading mindfulness teaching
              organisations, including the universities of Oxford, Bangor and Exeter, are now
              considering establishing a register of course leaders who meet good practice
              guidelines. They expect mindfulness teachers to train for at least a year and
              to remain under supervision. Some Buddhists have opposed the idea, arguing it
              is unreasonable to regulate a practice rooted in a religion.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">Lokhadi, <a href="http://www.mindfulnesstherapy.co.uk/mindfulness-courses-london/mindfulness-cbt-courses-london">a mindfulness meditation teacher in London</a> for the past nine
              years, has regular experience of some of the difficulties mindfulness
              meditation can throw up.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">"While mindfulness meditation doesn't change
              people's experience, things can feel worse before they feel better," she
              said. "As awareness increases, your sensitivity to experiences increases.
              If someone is feeling vulnerable or is not well supported, it can be quite
              daunting. It can bring up grief and all kinds of emotions, which need to be
              capably held by an experienced and suitably trained teacher.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN">"When choosing a course you need to have a
              sense of the training of the teacher, whether they are supervised and whether
              they themselves practise meditation. Most reputable teacher training courses
              require a minimum of two years' meditation practice and ensure that teachers
              meet other important criteria."</span></p>
