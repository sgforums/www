Is stress physical or mental?</div></blockquote>Again... i can only post from my understanding as i have yet to complete the path.<br><br>All suffering is mental... because it is felt in the mind. Suffering is simply the intense desire to have certain condition that is not reflective of the present moment condition. The mind simply do not want the present condition and this is suffering.<br><br>Many types of suffering are so unconscious/unknown to the person that they present as background moods of dissatisfaction. For example... restlessness is such a form of suffering. As one goes further along the path, more and more of these unknowns are discovered and dissolves away.<br><br>The answer may be more complex than this... because human life and need is complex with physical needs linking to mental ones and vice versa.<br><br>One must be flexible and nimble on the spiritual path. Don't fixate on any idea. Dynamics are much more complex than mere summarisation.</div>
