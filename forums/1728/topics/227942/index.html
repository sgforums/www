For a non-dual experiencer, u<strong> must also feel light and radiance bright</strong> with ever renewing joy.  If the 'sensation' is felt in its raw state with the practice of mindfulness, it can be very strong as if beaming out from no where to everywhere.  They are the 7 factors of enlightenment.  For now only the first 4 factors will be quite vivid.  Do read about it.<br><br>You may want to read about non-dual and karmic patterns by longchen.<br><a href="http://buddhisim.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=225462" rel="nofollow">http://buddhisim.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=225462</a><br><br><blockquote>The contraction that is the separate sense of self is the cause of this.</blockquote>Indirectly.  It is due more to the breaking lose of the an illusionary bond of 'self' at the pre-coscious level.  There are few other such bonds that are equally strong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

How Presence is being mistaken as the Â“Eternal WitnessÂ” and the eventual realization that Â“The sense of self (me, I) is not the doer of any actionÂ” cannot be underemphasized.  The depth of insight and experience of a person having Â“Eternal WitnessÂ” to the experience of Â“The sense of self (me, I) is not the doer of any actionÂ” is of different dimension.  This condition has profound implication that led to the eventual realisation of non-duality.<br><br>For Buddhists:<br>Perhaps (in my opinion), this is the condition that triggered the Blessed One to teach about the Tatagathagarba doctrines in Mahayana Buddhism.  A teaching that sounded so much like the Atman in Hinduism.  Obviously many practitioners are unable to have the deep insight into the truth of Anatta (no-self) that lead one to the realisation that all being the One Reality; otherwise the teachings of Tatagathagarba would be deemed redundant.<br><br><blockquote><br>Also, this progressive non-duality will lead to a stage where the mystery of the world/existence is revealed. <strong>It is like psychology unknowingly leading one towards understanding the mystery about existence</strong>.<br></blockquote>Well put!<br></div>

Because the body and all of its functional relations are still there.<br><br>If 'all is an illusion', the moment that this is realised... the body should go 'poof' and disappear into thin air.
