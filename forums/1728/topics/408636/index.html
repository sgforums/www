              <p>The pilgrimage destinations of Yeshe Tsogyal's life story are
              intimately connected with the renowned spiritual hermitages of the
              Tibetan heartlands — from her birthplace at Drakda Latso, to the
              sanctuaries of Yamalung, Chimphu, and Zhoto Tidro where she perfected
              her practices; to the Crystal Cave of Yarlung Sheldrak, one of her
              foremost repositories of hidden teachings (terma), and finally to the
              remote hermitage of Zabbulung in Western Tibet where she attained the
              supreme transformation of the rainbow body.</p>
              <p>Along the way,
              the pilgrimage also visits places and temples associated with the
              Nyingma lineage and the life of His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche such as
              Mindroling, Dorje Drak, Longchenpa's hermitage of Gangri Tokar, Draksum
              Tsodzong, and Lamaling.</p>
              <p>The concept for this pilgrimage was developed by Lama Dechen Yeshe
              Wangmo. After careful research and planning with Dr. Gyurme Dorje of
              Trans Himalaya, the first pilgrimage took place in May, 2009. Free of
              major obstacles and filled with blessings, we discovered that
              pilgrimage begins the moment you decide to go and after that, it never
              ends--your experiences and the blessings of those sacred places remain
              with you forever, inspiring and guiding you to the culmination of the
              Vajrayana path. During the pilgrimage, there is time for touring and
              hiking as well as teachings, meditation, and other Dharma activities.</p>

              Western China and an important economic center. On arrival at the
              international airport, each person will be met by a Trans Himalaya
              staff member.Our hotel is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Zen Buddha Hotel</span> adjacent to the famous thousands-year old Wenshuyuan Buddhist Temple.
              Zen Buddha offers vegetarian cuisine and affordable spa services. There
              will be a Welcome Dinner.</span></p>

              of Eastern Tibet and the mighty river gorges of the Yangtze, Mekong and
              Salween. 1 hour 45 minutes; tickets arranged by Trans Himalaya. </span></p>

              <p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drakda Tsogyal Latso</span>:
              In the Seu valley of  Drak adjoining the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river,
              near the small village of Drakda, Yeshe Tsogyal was born amid several
              miraculous signs. Amid a grove of tall silver oaks, we will find the
              Tsogyal Latso, spring-fed pond which manifested at the time of
              Tsogyal’s birth. It is regarded as her talismanic or life-energy lake
              and considered to be prophetic, revealing the secrets of past and
              future events. During the Cultural Revolution, much was destroyed here
              and the Latso itself was used as a cess pool. The Latso has been
              cleaned several times and the whole area is being restoration. Nearby,
              is the birthplace of Nubchen Sangye Yeshe, one of the foremost
              disciples of Guru Rinpoche and custodian of the Anuyoga teachings in
              Tibet.  </span></p>
              <p><span>Next to the Latso, the Life-Energy lake of Yeshe Tsogyal, is
              Kazhima Lhakhang, a small temple containing images of Guru Rinpoche,
              Vajrayogini, and Yeshe Tsogyal,  as well as several Yeshe Tsogyal stone
              imprints of her hands. The temple serves as the focal point for a small
              group of twelve nuns. Nearby, a newly restored stupa commemorates Yeshe
              Tsogyal’s birth, and next to the stupa, there is tree believed to be
              Tsogyal’s energy life-force tree offered to her at the time of her
              birth by the nagas. There is also a large uterine shaped spring
              bubbling with the secret breast milk of Yeshe Tsogyal.</span>Camping in a scenic and beautiful valley.<strong><span> </span></strong></p>

              Shantaraksita to commemorate the place where King Drison Detsen first
              met Guru Rinpoche. There are five resplendent stupas representing the
              Five Lineages of Enlightenment.</span></p>

              <p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yamalung, 13,400 feet:</span> This
              is an important place for Guru Rinpoche, Bairotsana and Yeshe Tsogyal
              that we did not visit last year. It is here, when Tsogyal was 16 years
              old, that Guru Rinpoche taught her the Tripitaka, the basics of
              Buddhism, and bestowed the first tantric empowerments along with the 
              sacred commitments. Afterwards, Tsogyal meditated here, assimilated the
              teachings, and achieved a high degree of understanding. The goddess
              Saraswasti appeared to her in a vision and graced her with complete
              retention of what ever she was taught. Guru Rinpoche concealed many
              treasures (terma).</span></p>
              <p><span>Reflecting on her experiences at Yamalung, Yeshe Tsogyal said,
              "I received all the teachings as if the contents of one vessel were
              being transferred into another".  At the end of this period, Tsogyal
              returned to Samye and then journeyed to Zhoto Tidro which was to become
              her principal place of practice. She returned to Yamalung several times
              and hides secret treasures.We spend our second night at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Samye Monastery Hotel.</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span>Friday, Oct 15:</span></strong></p>
              <p><span><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://yeshetsogyal.squarespace.com/storage/itinerary-photos/samye-aerial.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1272851055759" alt=""></span><span class="thumbnail-caption" style="width: 200px;"></span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Samye Mandala:</span> This was the first Buddhist monastery built in Tibet during the reign
              of King Trisong Detsen (8th century). The complex is a representation
              of the Buddhist universe with the main temple and its surrounding
              branch temples representing Mt. Meru and the continents that surround
              it. The original buildings have been re-constructed throughout the
              centuries. Today there are four gates, four stupas, the central temple
              and several secondary temples.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>We have the entire day to visit the temples, circumambulate,
              and visit Hepori Hill, revered throughout Tibet as an important
              geomantic power-place, from which Guru Rinpoche brought the inimical
              forces under allegiance to Buddhism at the time of the monastery’s
              original construction. Climbing to the summit of Hepori offers a bird’s
              eye view of the entire Samye complex. Hepori is where a Bon queen
              attempted to poison Tsogyal.</span></p>
              <p><span>When King Trisong Detsen, an emanation of Manjushri, rescued
              Yeshe Tsogyal from her suitors, he brought her to his court at Samye.
              Then he invited Guru Rinpoche who had appeared in the hills above Samye
              to come to his court. On this occasion, both he King and Yeshe Tsogyal
              became disciples of Guru Rinpoche. Yeshe Tsogyal returned to Samye many
              times to play an active role in the politics of her day and as such
              contributed significantly to transforming Tibet into a Buddhist
              country. One of her most outstanding feats occured at the Great Debate,
              during which she performed miracles surpassing those of her the
              non-Buddhists. The temple of the Great Debate can be visited.We will spend our third night at the new <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Samye Monastery Hotel</span>. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chimphu Hermitage</span>:
              This mountain retreat above Samye is revered as the sacred place of
              Guru Rinpoche’s speech. This is where he taught the Twenty-Five
              Disciples and where numerous disciples had profound realizations.
              Today, there are a hundred or more yogis, men and women, living there
              in retreat. As we hike through Chimphu, there are many occasions to
              meet with them and make personal offerings.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://yeshetsogyal.squarespace.com/storage/itinerary-photos/chimphu.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1269548920856" alt=""></span><span class="thumbnail-caption" style="width: 200px;">Chimphu view from Tsogyal's hermitage</span></span>The
              topography of Chimphu has a profound outer, inner, and secret meaning
              in Vajrayana. It boasts many significant sites, such as a 15 meter-high
              Copper-Coloured Mountain rock, rock-impressions of Guru Rinpoche's hat
              and Yeshe Tsogyal's foot. The cave of Drakmar Keutsang is where Guru
              Rinpoche bestowed the first Vajrayana empowerment to his eight
              disciples including Yeshe Tsogyal. It is also here that Jigme Lingpa,
              through a series of visions, received the Longchen Nying-thik
              transmission in the 18th century.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the upper reaches of Chimphu, one finds Longchenpa’s cave
              and Tsogyal Zimpuk where Tsogyal practiced with her consort, Atsara
              Sale. On the descent, we pass the funerary stupa marking the place
              where Longchen Rabjampa passed away in 1365.</span></p>
              <p><span>Yeshe Tsogyal took her first Buddhist vows at Chimphu in the
              presence of Guru Rinpoche and returned there many times throughout her
              life. We will visit her southern cave where she spent twelve years in
              retreat. Later in her life, after concealing countless treasures all
              over the Himalayan region, she returned  to Chimphu, teaching and
              bestowing empowerments. While she was there, she invoked Guru Rinpoche
              who appeared from the southwest in the midst of a brilliant light and
              predicted Tibet's future as well as Tsogyal's passing from the world. </span></p>

              Leaving Chimphu, we drive to Tsetang on the south bank of the Yarlung
              Tsangpo River. Tsetang was the fourteenth and fifteenth century capital
              of Tibet. Today it is the fourth largest city in Tibet and the
              springboard for visiting the sacred sites of the Yarlung Valley.Our hotel is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yarlung River Hotel.</span></span></p>

              <p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sheldrak Crystal Cave 14,750 feet:</span> Leaving Tsetang on the way to Sheldrak, we will circumambulate the
              stupa called Tsechu Bumpa, Vessel of Longevity Water, one of the three
              sacred stupas of Yarlung. It is said to have at its core, a
              rock-crystal Buddha image from India, which was presented to King
              Trisong Detsen. Some believe it contains the armour of King Songtsen
              Gampo. On full moon days the stupa is said to exude the water of life.
              Circumambulation of this stupa has long marked the beginning or end of
              a pilgrimage to Sheldrak</span></p>

              <p>Sheldrak
              is the sacred place of Guru Rinpoche’s attributes, nestled high in the
              craggy summits. Founded in the 14th century by the treasure-finder
              Sangye Lingpa, it contains images of Guru Rinpoche with his two
              foremost consorts, the Eight Manifestations, and Karmapa Rangjung
              Dorje. The crystal  of this site is a highly polished blackish green
              rock onthe cave floor. Above the temple, there are three important cave
              hermitages: the main one is Sheldrak Drubpuk, the first of Guru
              Rinpoche’s meditation caves in Tibet, from where the indigenous hostile
              forces and demons were bound under an oath of allegiance to Buddhism.</p>

              hermitage here offers a panoramic view of the entire Yarlung valley,
              with the sacred snow peak of Mount Yarlha Shampo in the distance.
              Nearby is Pema Shelpuk, the celebrated site where Orgyen Lingpa
              revealed Yeshe Tsogyal’s biography of Guru Rinpoche, <em>Pema Katang</em>,
              and the spring containing water of accomplishment reputedly brought
              forth by Nyak Jnanakumara, one of the Twenty-Five disciples. Tsogyel
              Sangpuk, a secret meditation cave of Yeshe Tsogyal, is identified by a
              distant prayer flag to the south. Tsogyal hid five sky treasures at
              Sheldrak and meditated here for thirteen months.</p>

              in Tibet, founded in 1670 by Terdak Lingpa who authored the well known
              verse of Pure Vision. His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche spent much time at
              Mindroling. He practiced the ritual tradition of Mindroling, famed for
              its sacred art and quality incense. Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche also

              Rinpoche is said to have consecrated five entire valleys for Buddhist
              practice in each of the four cardinal directions and one at their
              centre. Zabbulung valley (15, 000 ft.) lies in the middle of this grand
              design, and as such is the most revered power place of Western
              Tibet. The topography of Zabbulung is said to have twelve special
              features which represent the Master, the King and so forth. Jnanasukha
              is now translating the Pilgrimage Guide to Zabbulung, so we will know
              even more about this wonderful place this year that we did last year.</span></p>

              came here after Guru Rinpoche left this world, initially for a
              twelve-month period to hide treasures. Later, she returned with her
              disciples, meditated here for another ten years to complete her Ati
              Great Perfection training, and then left this world for Guru
              Rinpoche's  Copper-Coloured Mountain from the peak of Zabbu. The main
              temple provides easy access to the extraordinary hands-in-prayer-mudra
              cave in which both Yeshe Tsogyal and Atsara Sale attained the rainbow

              <p><span>The inner sanctum of the temple houses a “speaking” image of
              Guru Rinpoche (Guru Sungjonma), which in the 18thcentury is said to
              have advised the hermits to flee and escape death at the hands of the
              zealous Mongols. Throughout history, important Nyingmapa masters have
              undergone profound spiritual experiences here: Dorje Lingpa (1346-1405)
              and Lhatsun Namka Jigme (b 1597) among them. Currently there are
              about sixty yogis in residence at Zabbulung.Camping in view of the temple and the Copper-Colored Rock.</span></p>

              century when King Songtsen Gampo moved his capital from the Yarlung

              sanctuary of Zhoto Tidro, also known as Terdrom, among the most favored
              of YesheTsogyal’s hermitages—the place where she secretly hid with Guru
              Rinpoche in order to escape banishment from the kingdom, the place
              where she received most of her empowerments and instructions and then
              practised the yoga of the inner heart and naked austerities for many
              years. She also practiced here with Atsara Sale.</span></p>

              there is a large nunnery with their abbess, the elderly Khandroma, an
              emanation of Yeshe Tsogyal.  Nearby there are medicinal hot-springs
              created by Guru Rinpoche. The average temperature of the water is 40°C.</span></p>
              <p><span>An arduous hike which takes about 10-12 hours for a round
              trip, takes one to Kiri Yangdzong, an immense cavern with active
              hermitages and important meditation caves, the most significant being
              the Tsogyal Sangpuk, where Yeshe Tsogyel practiced and spent many years
              in retreat. This hike will be optional.</span></p>
              <p><span>Dramatically located in the cliff of two mountains with hot
              springs, this sacred site is known as a gathering place of dakinis.
              "Opened" by Guru Rinpoche, it is the chief place where Yeshe Tsogyal
              meditated and emerged a great siddha. She also concealed important
              treasures here. This is the most significant of all the sites
              associated with Yeshe Tsogyal whether in Tibet, Bhutan, or Nepal.</span></p>
              <p><span>Guru Rinpoche and Yeshe Tsogyal first came to Zhoto Tidro to
              escape the hostile political forces around Samye. In this protected
              safe-haven, Guru Rinpoche bestowed empowerments and teachings in what
              is called Tsogyal's secret cave, Kiri Yangdzong.</span></p>
              <p><span>Here, Tsogyal received the Khandro Nying Thig and was
              instructed in the outer and inner practices (Mahayoga and Anuyoga).
              During the empowerments, she underwent a series of exceptional
              experiential transformations and was given special names, such as
              Tsogyal of Great Bliss, to mark her purifications and transitions.</span></p>
              <p><span>Many years later, Tsogyal returned to Tidro for six more years
              just to practice the path of Atiyoga's Thogal. As predicted, at Tidro,
              she attained three of the four manifest appearances of this consummate
              path. Tsogyal's final training, taking on the suffering of others, also
              began at Tidro. According to her biography, this period was marked
              withmany examples of outstanding compassion, such as giving her knee
              caps to three beggars and making love with a lonely leper.</span></p>
              <p><span>Guru Rinpoche gave many prophecies at Tidro including that
              Tsogyal would have five incarnations and thirty times would prolong the
              existence of the Dharma in the world.We will be camping a short drive from the site.</span><strong><span> </span></strong></p>

              emerald alpine lake surrounded by 19,000 ft. mountains. Tsodzong (Lake
              Dharma Fortress) is the birthplace of the 14th century treasure
              revealer, Sangye Lingpa. There are many earlier associations with
              Padmasambhava, King Trisong Detsen, and Gesar of Ling. Many sacred
              artefacts still remain including images, self-manifest syllables, stone
              prints, and manuscripts. His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche taught at
              Tsodzong and his personal hermitage remains. Rinpoche restored the
              Tsodzong temple statues that were destroyed during the Cultural

              <p>The upcoming Jnanasukha pilgrimage in October is a rare and unique opportunity 
              to create a personal connection with our larger Sangha in Tibet, to whom we are 
              eternally grateful. Like all Buddhist practices, the power of pilgrimage depends 
              on faith. If we have faith, then certainly, participating in a pilgrimage in any 
              way, shape, or form brings great benefit to oneself and others. Our itinerary 
              brings us into close contact with lamas, hermit-yogins, and monastics at 
              Chimphu, Tsogyal Latso, Yarlung Sheldrak, Zabbulung, and Terdrom Zhoto Tidro. 
              These are isolated places where offerings are especially important and
              where individuals can greatly benefit from an offering of $15. In
              addition, we will be making offerings at Samye and other significant
              Nyingma temples such as Mindroling, Dorje Drak, and Lamaling, residence
              of His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche.<br><br> <a href="http://www.mynewsletterbuilder.com/email/newsletter/1410465091">http://www.mynewsletterbuilder.com/email/newsletter/1410465091</a></p>
