              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">Did the Dalai Lama prefer
              exile in Myanmar to India?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Bertil Lintner Chiang Mai,
              July 15, 2017 Asia Times</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That
              is what the Tibetan God King told Asia Times contributor Bertil Lintner in a
              1984 interview during ceremonies marking his then 25th year in exile </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Did
              the Dalai Lama, the Buddhist God King of Tibet, really want to go to Myanmar
              rather than India when he fled his homeland in 1959?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That’s
              at least what he told this writer and his photographer wife on March 6, 1984 we
              interviewed him at McLeod Ganj, the site of his government in exile in the
              foothills of the Indian Himalayas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              that had happened, today’s religious conflicts in Myanmar would have taken on
              an entirely new dimension as the Dalai Lama, the world’s leading Buddhist
              clergyman, has consistently and strongly spoken out in favor of equal rights
              for Muslim minorities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              occasion on which we first met the Dalai Lama was the 25th anniversary of a
              failed uprising against the Chinese occupation of Tibet and his subsequent
              flight to India. People from Tibet, as well as Tibetan refugees in India, had
              gathered to commemorate the event.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">My
              photographer wife and I had managed to convince a publicity officer from the
              Tibetan government in exile to allow us to meet the Dalai Lama. Because of his
              busy schedule, they granted us 30 minutes with His Holiness, as they
              respectfully called him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              when the Dalai Lama discovered that my wife came from Myanmar, then known as
              Burma, they immediately began comparing the Tibetan and Burmese languages,
              which belong to the same language family (Tibeto-Burman).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Much
              to the dismay of his minders, who kept looking nervously and with some
              annoyance into the room where we were sitting, we ended up spending an hour and
              a half with the Dalai Lama. It was during those discussions that he made the
              stunning revelation that he had actually intended to go into exile in Myanmar
              rather than India.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              said that to avoid creating a problem in India’s relations with China, he had
              wanted to settle in one of the ethnic Tibetan villages north of Putao in
              northern Kachin State. He also said he wanted to be among his own people and he
              thought Myanmar, a Buddhist country with a neutral stance in regional great
              power games, would respond positively to his presence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              the time of his flight feelers were sent out to Myanmar’s leaders, who,
              according to the Dalai Lama, replied that they would have loved to welcome him,
              but because they were involved in sensitive talks with China about their common
              border the timing was not appropriate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That
              was in March 1959. On October 1, 1960, Myanmar Prime Minister U Nu ratified a
              comprehensive Myanmar-China border treaty at a grand signing ceremony in
              Beijing. The entire length of the two sides’ 2,185-kilometer border was
              demarcated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              sitting in McLeod Ganj in 1984, the Dalai Lama was no doubt content with his
              chosen place of exile. After the military takeover in Myanmar in 1962, no
              political freedoms of any kind were tolerated. In India, the Tibetans are able
              run their own administration, their own schools and are free to publish
              religious as well as political literature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              the Dalai Lama had settled in the mountains north of Putao in 1959, Myanmar
              would no doubt have felt the wrath of Beijing in a way that could have been
              even more devastating than Chinese support for the Communist Party of Burma
              insurgency in the 1960s and 1970s.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              met the Dalai Lama again in February 1993, when he paid a brief visit to
              Bangkok while I served as president of the Foreign Correspondents Club of
              Thailand (FCCT).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              the time, eight Nobel Peace Prize laureates had come to Thailand to campaign
              for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, who was then still under military imposed
              house arrest in Yangon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Suu
              Kyi, then a pro-democracy advocate for political change through non-violence,
              had received the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize while imprisoned, hence the rather
              unusual gathering of prominent peace champions from around the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Predictably,
              the then ruling military junta in Myanmar sneered at the event to pressure them
              into releasing her.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              regime’s propaganda apparatus, then headed by the dreaded intelligence chief
              Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, even seized the opportunity to denounce the Dalai Lama as
              a “splittist” because he wanted independence for Tibet. Khin Nyunt and his men
              were firmly on China’s side in international politics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              fact that the Dalai Lama was among the eight Nobel laureates also caused a
              diplomatic stir in Thailand. The Chinese protested twice to the Thai government
              and the FCCT also felt the heat when, prior to the arrival of the Dalai Lama,
              Chinese embassy officials asked us to remove an old picture of him which had
              hung on the wall behind the podium for more than a year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              explained to the Chinese envoys that the photos decorating our walls were taken
              by FCCT members and were displayed because they were of media interest, not as
              icons of support for any partisan cause.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              also said that if then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping would be willing to come
              and address the FCCT, we would happily have a picture of him as well on our
              walls. The Chinese embassy officials were not amused but the protests stopped.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              event proceeded without a hitch, with the club house packed with people as I
              gave the Dalai Lama a framed photograph of Aung San Suu Kyi. I did not,
              however, find it prudent at the time to remind him of our conversation in 1984
              and his then stated desire to take up exile in Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Given
              the reason for the FCCT event as well as general developments in the region
              since 1959, I was certain that the Dalai Lama was more than pleased to have
              chosen McLeod Ganj over Putao.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              if he were in Myanmar today, no one knows how the most radical of the Buddhist
              groups threatening Muslim minorities would have reacted to His Holiness’
              appeals for communal harmony.</span></p>
