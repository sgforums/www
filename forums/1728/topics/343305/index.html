              medicine in 2009, treating bhuta illnesses is time consuming and

              treatments, and sadly, such people are often drugged with psyche meds
              putting them beyond the capacity to helped by traditional Indo-Tibetan
              medical methods. On the other hand, for most people, the alternative is
              worse, in some instances, the kind of treatment people receive for
              severe mental illnesses we would typify as being afflicted by bhutas
              could not find treatment for there problem simply do to the lack of
              practitioners of traditional Buddhist medicine. <br><br>N</em></p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p><em><br>Severe psychosis of various kinds, depression (which is often kapha
              affecting the heart) and so on, diagnosed through observation of
              behavior, pulse diagnosis and urine. <br><br>Thailand once had a
              system of medicine more or less the same as Indian Ayurveda and Tibetan
              Medicine (with some cultural differences of course) which the Thais,
              like the Tibetans, trace back to Jivak Kumara, the Buddha's physician.
              Unfortunately, the systems of Ayurveda as practiced in Southeast Asia
              was destroyed by European Colonialism. <br><br>The only remnant of the Thai system of Medicine remaining is Thai Massage. <br><br>Treatments
              for mental illnesses are a combination of herbs, diet, massage and
              bloodletting, as well as rituals. They are extremely effective and my
              teacher has a great deal of experience completely curing patients in
              Tibet who would wind up on severe psych meds here like Haldol and so on
              if they lived in this country. <br><br>Frankly, bhuta possession explains many chronic mental illnesses for which patients only receive palliative care in the West. <br><br>Generally
              in our diagnostic protocol, we treat first through diet, then medicine,
              then therapies such as moxabustion, bloodletting and acupuncture, and
              if these methods are found not to be effective, or of limited effect,
              we begin to search for bhuta involvement in an illness. <br><br>But we
              think that a large number of severe mental illnesses are left untreated
              because western medicine is unable to cope with bhuta possession. <br><br>Non-human
              beings cause many kinds of illnesses, not only mental illness. Many
              skin diseases that seem difficult to cure are caused by Naga attacks,

              <p>Even if it is mental illness caused by biological/brain damage or whatever, it will still trace back to the karma.<br>One of the reasons/karma is that in the past the person disturbed
              people who was doing meditation or disturb their concentration of doing
              auspicious things especially those related to dharma.</p>

              <p>The Buddha taught that all mental suffering, whether major or minor is due to our ignorance, attachment and aversion, and we need to tame our mind and see the reality as it is.</p>

              <p>The main thing is that we are not contented with simplicity (simple living) because the world teaches us the opposite, so we want more to live up to the world's standard which is based on commercialism and driving economy. When we don't get what we want or have things go our way as preferred, we become unhappy. Afflictive emotions arise due to attachment, aversion, craving and self-cherishing. With time, when it happens too many times, unhappiness becomes a strong habitual tendency in us and affects us mentally.</p>
              <p>What we need to do is to understand our suffering and the reality as it is as taught in the Dharma, learn to be contented with what we have, try to tame our mind, so that we control it instead of letting it controls us. Try to abandon bias perception and anything that gives rise to aversion, attachment and self-cherishing.</p>
              <p>It is easier said than done, but if we don't start somewhere, we will always be unhappy.</p>
              <p>A simple day to day exercise is to observe the suffering of others, understand it, reflect upon it and derive ways to counteract them if it happens to us, so that when it really happens to us, we are ready to tackle it in a more effective and efficient way.</p>
              <p>If we are already in the rut of mental suffering, then try looking at our suffering as a third party and understand it according to the Dharma point of view. In this way, we will be more able to come to terms with our suffering and have a more optimisstic outlook.</p>

              <p>'Are you sure?' -&gt; Sorry, I am not sure what you are referring to. If I have understood anything incorrectly, please kindly share your understanding. I am still a beginner and I share based on my limited understanding and experience at the present moment. I thought it could be useful since I always find what others have shared useful in triggering thoughts for further consideration and contemplation.</p>
              <p>'When a person feels pain as joy and happiness, is the pain truly suffering?'</p>
              <p>-&gt; I don't think pain can be felt as joy and happiness. Unless you are referring to the joy when one recognizes the pain (suffering) as beneficial in bringing spiritual happiness, that is, as a motivation to seek and practice the dharma for cessation of suffering and deter complacency. Is this what you meant? If not, please kindly share your understanding and experience.</p>
              <p>'How does one master Buddhism except comprehending the subject as it is and not by one's own biasness?'</p>
              <p>-&gt; The Buddha taught the Four Reliances that one could use as a guide to learn and recognize the dharma.</p>

              <p>From the four reliances, I think it is quite clear that there are possibilities of understanding, accepting and rejecting the teachings with biasness. Even with these guidelines given, I think it is still difficult to comprehend the dharma as it is. At least, this is for my case, since I am a deluded being with much defilements and mental obscurations.</p>
              <p>As to how to prevent incorrect understanding of the teachings, besides using the Four Reliances as a reminder, I also try to be mindful and always double check my understanding by continuous learning, contemplation, practice and investigation, something like the Plan-Do-Check-Action cycle of quality control, whenever opportunities arise. I find it very beneficial for me to have a highly realised dharma practitioner as my Root Guru and noble friends to guide me along the path as I learn and practice to discover for myself the truth about the dharma at my level of mental capacity and develop my aptitude further. Do you have anyway of doing this better that could be useful to me?</p>

              <p>What are the parameters of sanity ?  Buddha said that all of us are deluded and he was asked what he meant by delusion and he replied "when you saw a rope and thought that it was a snake."</p>
              <p>Personal experience. Once my former colleagues wanted to drive me crazy for the simple reason that they could not proved my dishonesty. They tried all manner of things to do it and everytime they did it I collected concrete evidences of their evil and malicious intentions. The reason they tried so hard to discredit me was that they were so afraid that I would exposed their lies and deceptions "in high places".  They manipulated my wife to help them and our marriage ended in divorce. Before the divorce my wife convinced me to see a counsellor. I presented my case with concrete evidences of the attempts at trying to make me appear as crazy.  The doctor finally concluded and reported it to my wife that I do not exhibit any evidences of delusions but I was still deluded as I was very clever at covering up my delusions. </p>
              <p>So even without any evidences he could see my delusions. Isn't that what buddha described as delusion ?   A year after my divorce someone concrete - not imagined - told me everything that my ex-wife and my colleagues did. Everything fell into place - the lies and the fabrication of events.  So I was seeing very clearly with evidences painfully and carefully collected to verify what I thought and my world view then.</p>
              <p>I brought this up to underline the danger of thinking or treating someone as mentally ill totally on the word of others. Some times people's motive are less than noble while telling you that they are doing it out of kindness of their heart.</p>
              <p>I remember once also while distributing food to an elderly, the elderly became very fearful and told me how the neighbour was trying to harm her. I asked her why she said what she said and she pulled me towards her toilet. In there she pointed me to some scratches on the floor that looked like a man. She said the neighbour had cast a spell and cause the man to appear in her toilet to harm her. I proceeded to pull her to her balcony and searched for a cloud I could use and fortunately there was one. I pointed to a cloud that looked like a person smiling benignly down on her and I asked her what she saw ?  She smiled and understood. I wanted to understand her condition and started asking her background. She was just like you and I but I felt her sense of loneliness and such sense of loneliness often made us - even amongst the best of us - to see and hear things.</p>
              <p>I brought this up to underline a very simple fact of life that even amongst the best of us, our delusions could be accentuated given the right circumstances,that could make our life hell on earth.</p>
              <p>All of us are deluded as defined by buddha but to every buddhist that I asked when I was in singapore NONE said that they were deluded. The best they could offer was that they were 'sometimes' deluded and could not see clearly.  Given that all of us due to karmic obscuration could not see clearly then up to what degree would we consider that such delusions become an illness ?  I would use harm as the criteria - harm to ourselves and to others.Even when we go around trying to malign others could be considered as such illness. Our delusions make us insensitive. Our clever rationalisations make us feel good with the bad that we do.</p>
              <p>Does buddhism with all its meditation, philosophy and teachings offer a way out of such intense and accentuated delusions ?  My brief answer is a no. These delusions have to be resolved at a deeper level. We can't use a dirty cloth (the mind) to clean the mind. Some energetic meditations can help but these were not taught by buddha.</p>
              <p>I believe chinese medicine do hold vital keys to helping the people resolve such difficulties.  Western medicine had failed miserably.(

              <p>Thank you kim123 and djhampa both for your responses.</p>
              <p>kim, what u have detailed in your posts have to do with the general mental suffering that human beings in general face as their experience in life, and not regarding those with neurological/mental disorders, e.g. obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar, schizophrenia, which i had originally wanted to bring into the subject of discussion on this thread.</p>

              <p>thanks djhampa for sharing these things, they are really meaningful.</p>
              <p>Those in your case there are some who wrongly refer to others as having mental illness, i am talking about real cases here, with the cause of their mental being more of physiological rather than psychological.</p>
              <p>I agree with you on your perceptive that all of humans are deluded and bounded with karmic obstructions. i dont really understand why the buddhists u questioned said they were not deluded. I as a buddhist would agree with u i am totally deluded, not to mention the delusion is made worse by my condition of neurological mental problem.</p>

              <p>I do not know how much of an extent buddhist meditation, philosophy and teachings offer a way out of intense and accentuated delusions u are talking about, in my opinion, and <em>especially</em> for those with mental illnesses, these methods are an impossibility. and i cant agree more with u that we cannot use the already deluded mind, to attempt to clean the mind and get out of this delusion. at least that is my belief in the present times, it is very difficult if not an impossibilty.</p>
              <p>You expressed that buddhism does not have a way to resolve this. my answer to this is pureland buddhism, and relying on the other-power of the Buddha, by buddha recitation, and I would recommend to read more into Jodo shu pureland buddhism, and teachings by Honen. www.purelandsect.org</p>
              <p>i also agree with u, that western medication drugs are unable to cure or heal the mental illness i have mentioned in question, these drugs only treat or cover up the symptoms while u are on them, but are unable to restore the mental health of the sufferer.</p>
              <p>i would think that in this respect chinese medicine has indeed more potential.</p>
              <p>I think i have more or less found my own answer of how to address and treat my obsessive compulsive disorder, and thanks for the responses.</p>

              <p><br>open mindedness also means not questioning and judging other's values with a touch of sarcasm and banging on pedantic things like just one question mark. neither is open mindedness questioning everything with skeptism.</p>
              <p>open mindedness also means not inferring and changing the meaning of my sentences(i never said u misinterpreted), and trying to correct others and bring open mindedness into the picture when it is not even the subject of discussion here.</p>

              <p><br>bcos you stated your stance with a question mark. Can a statement be a question or vice versa? Yes, open-mindedness is question everything you decide upon with skeptism but then again, one can never be sure of anything or everything.</p>
              <p>Did I make a statement about misinterpreting your views? I was questioning your personal values on this matter. Buddhism insist on maintaining an open mind yet maintaining a farce accepting science for arbitation.</p>
