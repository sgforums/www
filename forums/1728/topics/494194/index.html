              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">‘Dear Dharma Teacher, I enjoyed every moment of your lessons and learned a lot of Buddha Dharma. Your lessons are never dull and every word you spoke is practical Dharma. The lessons are linked to your various websites, which also supplement additional and detailed information of what you have taught us in class. I could not find any other Buddhist websites that provide detailed information about the Amitabha Buddha Pure Land practice in clear and simple English like yours. You are not only specialised in Pure Land teachings but also have wide knowledge on all schools of Buddhism. Please continue with all your good work so that more people can benefit from your teachings. May we cultivate wholeheartedly (I learned it in class) and meet together in future at Amitabha Buddha’s Pure Land. Amituofo!’ Yours sincerely,<strong> </strong><strong>Keng Chuan</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">‘This is one of the most interesting courses that I have attended. What we ought to know about preparation before and after death were well taught and touched on in great detail. I now have a better understanding and am more confident in handling death matters, and also to help others when approaching death to seek rebirth in Amitabha Buddha’s Pure Land. This is a “must attend” course for all Buddhists, for the benefit of oneself and others. Looking forward to receiving “The Pure Land Passport”! Thanks for your untiring efforts in propagating the Dharma to benefit all beings. Sadhu! Sadhu! Sadhu!’ Amituofo, <strong>Ivy</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Thank you for conducting the lessons. It is indeed an eye-opener’… Warmest Regards, <strong>Kim<br></strong><br>‘Thank you very much, Brother Shi’an, for preparing such an appropriate booklet, which is handy to carry, that is informative and creative as well. This course gave me deeper insights of how I should prepare for myself towards the end of life, as well as to help those that are close and dear to me. It also clears the many myths about what should and should not be done before, during and after one’s death as Buddhists. I would certainly want my friends to attend this course to clear away doubts and superstitions about funeral rites.’ With metta,<strong> Panna _/|\_<br></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Teacher Shi’an, thank you for the wonderful course. It has definitely helped me to understand and appreciate what need to be done to prepare for the journey to Pure Land – not only for ourselves but others as well.  You’ve made the lessons very interesting and inspiring, and I’m sure that many of us are motivated to participate in support-chanting to help others.  There was also valuable knowledge that you’ve taught us, on the state of mind of the deceased, and how we can play a critical role to help the dying and deceased’s journey to Pure Land.  I enjoyed thoroughly the course over the last 6 weeks, and these are perhaps of the most important lessons that I‘ve learnt in this life. Namo Amituofo.’ Regards, <strong>HB</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Last Saturday’s class was very interesting. I normally will fall asleep for all classes held on Saturday afternoons. Surprisingly, I was fully alert and focused throughout the two hours. Thank you for sharing with us such important knowledge to guide us to Pure land. Looking forward to this Saturday[‘s next lesson]. It is worth my flying back to Singapore every weekend. I hope to finish reading “The Pure Land Passport’. Also will be excited to see the full Chinese version.’ <strong>– Sing Beng</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Hi Teacher Shi’an, thank you for the notes and invaluable knowledge shared during the lessons.’ Amituofo, <strong>Jun Hong</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Dear Teacher Shi’an, thank you for sharing with us on Destination Pureland. It is indeed an interesting and informative course to learn, understand and prepare us for rebirth in Pureland… In English, it is a bonus for some of us who don’t really understand Mandarin well. I really enjoy your lectures. I have already registered for the next course on ‘Understanding Amituofo Via The Amitabha Sutra: Introduction to Pureland Buddhism’. Ganen. Amituofo.’ Best Regards, <strong>Alvin</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Dear Bro Shen, Dharma greetings! This may seem very random but I really want to share this experience with you. One of my good friend’s Mum had been struggling with ill health for the past few years. Pain (and even breathing) became extremely unbearable. However, her Mum seemed to be reluctant, fearful and undecided about her funeral arrangements, especially for the past two to three months. It dawned on me that “The Pure Land Passport” could be useful and I told my friend to try reading it to her. Two days after passing her the passport and upon full recitation, her Mum passed away peacefully the following morning. And my friend also felt peaceful with closure. [Her message: ‘Thanks for “The Pure Land Passport”. I managed to finish it yesterday. Everything was just so timely. I am in peace. My Mum is very blessed and so am I.’] Wanted to just share this with you. Keep planting Dharma seeds! Amituofo!’ <strong>Ju</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Great [first] session just now! Very energized teacher, and very responsive crowd, [as I] kept hearing laughter.’ –<strong> Joyce</strong></p>
              <div>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Hi Brother Shi’an, it was amazing that I’d gotten two books many years ago (Amitabha Sutra Book and Sam &amp; Sara) by you and now I’d attended your class… Many of the topics I had understood in your class were what my late Dad had shared with me during the last few months before his passing… During the whole course, it was simply amazing to better understand what he wanted to share (as I once was not of any faith)… Once again, thank you for conducting the class in English and the blessings you have for all of us.’ Yours sincerely, <strong>Kim</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘I recently attended the Destination Pureland sessions conducted by you and have found them very useful…’ Regards, <strong>Phoebe </strong><br><br>‘The teachings on Amituofo’s Pure Land practice in English are truly rare and precious. Sincerely grateful to Teacher Shen for his candid and inspirational sharings. After successfully attending this course, I am inspired to further strengthen the Three Provisions to be reborn in Amituofo’s Pure Land CONFIDENTLY.’ Amituofo, <strong>Rong Cheng</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘With an enormous turnout for the class, it goes to show how important the subject matter is to most. Let alone taught by a remarkable teacher who imparts teachings in an upbeat, insightful and inspiring way.’<strong> – Suyin</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Hi Teacher Shi’an, thank you  for the Pure Land course. I have gained much understanding from learning, which helped me to realise what I had practised was incorrect. Now that I’m aware, I will make efforts to practice correctly. I have already signed up for your next course. I look forward to more of your sharing… I  believe the course will help me to better understand Amituofo for practice in my daily Nianfo. Thank you once again for your teaching. Amituofo.’ Best regards, <strong>Pauline </strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘A million zillion thanks to Bro Shi’an for creating this sublime course to benefit all. We have indeed learnt so much, especially the important life skills in knowing how to help manage others’, as well as our own death skilfully. It’s so sad that many people feel death is a taboo subject and turn away from this really important skill set. But nevertheless, we shall strive to always do our best to put into practice what we have learnt.’ Amituofo, <strong>Eunice</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Hi Teacher Shi’an, thank you for conducting Destination Pureland at Penang. It was really wonderful to see my relatives talking about Amituofo and are showing interest. The people of Malaysia have benefited from the Pureland teachings, Amituofo!’ <strong>Audrey</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Dear Brother Shi’an, I am currently attending your classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Your lessons have given me a better understanding of Pure Land practice. I am grateful for the opportunity. Thank you, kind teacher!’ <strong>– Tze Chien</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Dear Teacher Shi’an, thanks for the additional notes and links on the Pure Land teachings. Also, thanks for your free Dharma course in Penang, which came with a free Pure Land Passport. Really appreciate everything that you have done for us. This is really a rare opportunity, to attend a Pure Land Dharma course in English in Penang. Your teaching clarified a number of my doubts and uncertainties surrounding the dos and don’ts, and reasons behind certain Chinese Buddhist funeral rites. Your passion and energetic delivery made the course come alive and engaging. I hope that you have enjoyed teaching us in Penang as much as we have enjoyed listening to you. Amituofo.’ Regards, <strong>Cheng Teik</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Dear Brother Shi’an, Amituofo. Thank you so much for sharing these valuable and insightful information about Pure Land Buddhism. Even though I have been learning Buddhism since 2008 but it’s a great shame that I am not progressing much from the the day I was introduced to this beautiful teaching. I attended your lecture in Penang Than Hsiang Temple on 24 Sept 2016 and I really learnt a lot from you. I must admit that I was overwhelmed by so much new yet important lessons about Nianfo, and the way you delivered it was amazingly marvellous. It was both candid and fun to sit through the entire session.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">There are many devotees in Penang, especially among the Chinese but there are also many self-proclaimed Buddhists who do not really know the real teachings of Buddha, including the Pure Land teachings. I am one of them. Hence, it would be great if you could make more frequent trips to Penang to expound the Pure Land teachings to us, so that we will be walking the right path towards enlightenment. The little Pure Land Passport is very useful and handy, so whenever I attend any chanting and meditation classes, I will bring it along to read before the sessions commence. A lot of my friends who are curious about this booklet would like to have a copy of it [too]. Thank you once again.’ With metta, <strong>Benjamin<br></strong><br>‘Your kind and wise words, clear and accurate teachings allowed me to have Faith again in the Pure Land teachings. Thank you for sharing the Pure Land teachings with everyone! Amituofo!’ <strong>– AA</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Bro. (Teacher) Shian, thanks a lot for the interesting, informative and inspiring sharing in the Destination Pureland course earlier.’ <strong>– Eng Kiang</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Hi Bro, thanks a lot for your class last night. It was very motivating and inspiring. This is my first time attending your class, and am very glad and contented with your teachings and sharings… In my opinion, “Destination Pureland” is indeed a must-know-course for all Buddhists. Learn how to deal with each individual’s death issues, and the necessary preparations for such ç»ˆç”Ÿå¤§äº‹, in order to have a better, or should I say…the Best Rebirth. Amituofo!’ <strong>– Ivan</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘It was a great course… Especially the last lesson, where I got lots of tips.’ : ) … This is one of the best Dharma courses that I have attended. I have seen how it has benefited my friend in managing his father’s passing on just after he has attended this course…  If you have questions like “What should I do immediately when I discover my loved one has passed on? “, “How can I help my loved ones for a better rebirth?”, “What do I have to do within the 49 days of passing? “, “How do I continue to give my love to my loved ones even after they have passed on? “, etc. then this is the course that will address these questions and many more.’  <strong>– Teng Leng</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Hi Teacher Shi’an… really appreciate that you always share the Dharma with everyone.’ <strong>– Audrey</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Thank you, and it was good. Keep it up.’ <strong>– Hui Ching</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Thank you for all your lessons. Your last answer to my questions have been very helpful to me. It clears a lot of nagging doubts.’<strong> – CH<br></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Amituofo. Teacher Shi’an, thank you for your sharing.’ With much metta and respect, <strong>Wai Cheng</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Hi Teacher Shi’an, thank you for the interesting Dharma teachings yesterday… It certainly helped clarify my thoughts and questions I asked you on the email earlier… Attending your talks helped me tremendously as it makes me more aware of my previous misconceptions, and I feel more alert and mindful of my thinking . Thank you also for enlightening me about seeking true Dharma.’ <strong>– Licheng </strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Dear Shi’an, I am glad to have attended the entire course of Destination Pureland, and your teaching has been inspiring.’ Amituofo, <strong>Veron</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">‘Please continue with your patient Dharma teachings. We are very fortunate to have the affinity to listen to your teachings in this lifetime. I’ve reassured my Mum, that I’m attending Teacher Shi’an’s lessons to help her journey to Amituofo’s Pure Land.

It is a well thought idea, to have a “documented passport”, so that all necessary steps are faithfully practised and followed. I would highly encourage all Buddhists to attend this course since death is certain, with no single escapee. Upon understanding and adopting the right practices to help the dying, we are exhibiting our inner Bodhisattva-nature to aid others in liberation from the vicious cycle of rebirth. If not, at least a better rebirth. Thanks once again for another great class! With Metta, <strong>Bro. Tuck Khuen</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">‘Dear Teacher Shi’an, thank you for the very informative course.’ <strong>– Jessica</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">‘The course though short, gave me better understanding on how to prepare myself and my family in times of crisis. There were many insights shared that I was not previously aware of. Most fear death, due to  not knowing where we go after death, and try to avoid discussing about it. Yet, death can come suddenly. However, if we have Faith and Aspiration, and practice wholeheartedly and diligently, we will reach Pure Land. Thank you, Bro, for your sharing. It is truly an amazing course. I will encourage more devotees and friends to attend it. I wish to attend more of such courses from you. Once again, thank you, Bro. Shi’an.’ Amituofo, <strong>Vivienne</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">‘I saw a beautiful poster titled “Destination Pureland”. As I am interested to know more about Pure Land practice, I decided to register. I called my sister, thinking it might be a useful course for her and her husband, for learning Nianfo. After attending the course, I found it well covered. We were given lots of beneficial notes. The course is applicable for both Pure Land practitioners and beginner Buddhists. We learnt that life is impermanent and death can strike suddenly, and how we can prepare to handle the dying moments – for ourselves, family, friends, acquaintances and even strangers. I gained a better understanding of accepting death. It is during the crucial moments before death that our right efforts can facilitate a smooth and blissful transition to a good rebirth – the best of which in Amituofo’s (AmitÄ�bha Buddha) Pure Land. I now have better understanding of Amituofo and how we can connect to him by Nianfo, and how he can share his blessings with us with his immeasurable compassion and wisdom… The knowledge I gained strengthened my faith in Amituofo.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We learnt the importance of the Three Provisions of unshakeable Faith in Amituofo, unwavering Aspiration to reach his Pure Land, and the utmost sincere Practice of being mindful of his name. I have a clearer concept now. Pure Land practice of being mindful of Amituofo is not only for our last moments, but for benefiting one and all in everyday life too. It is the fine-tuning of ourselves towards our Buddha-nature and the Buddha’s blessings, through which we naturally become attuned to the fuller avoidance of all evils, the greater doing of all good, and the more thorough purification of our minds. The Dharma teacher is sincere and earnest in delivering the course. He is a knowledgeable and good teacher. His lessons are interesting and lively, using clear and simple language, showing passion in his teaching.’ – Amituofo :] <strong>Sharol</strong></p>
