              Dhukka: Are They the Same?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Beliefnet Wesley Baines</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Explore
              the nature of sorrow as viewed through two of the world's most popular
              religions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There
              are common threads which run through many of the world’s major religions. These
              threads are often extraordinarily fine, as hard to spot as a human hair fallen
              on carpet—but they exist, nonetheless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One
              such may just connect two of the world’s most popular religions—Buddhism and
              Christianity. This thread lies in how the two belief systems define the cause
              of human suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Christian concept of sin and the Buddhist concept of dukkha—suffering caused by
              incorrect beliefs about the world— seem, on the surface, to be similar, perhaps
              even mirrors of one another.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Let’s
              take a closer look at these two concepts and see how deeply these similarities
              truly go.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Suffering in Christianity</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Christian theology, the root cause of suffering lies in alienation from God,
              caused by sin. The very essence of the Christian hell—the ultimate punishment—is,
              in fact, a permanent disconnection from the face of God.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Scripturally,
              from this disconnect arises entropy—the decline into disorder. In Genesis, Adam
              and Eve walk through the Garden of Eden alongside the very presence of God
              until their choice to sin caused them to be separated from Him. Since God’s
              nature is not only of love and mercy, but also of perfect justice, this
              separation was a necessity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This,
              of course, brought about the Biblical fall, and the introduction of entropy to
              all creation—the end result of which is human suffering as imperfect man
              struggles to survive in an imperfect world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Within
              Christianity, suffering is meaningful—God uses it to teach and guide. The
              Biblical book of Job deals with the problem of suffering, showing that it is
              directed by the wisdom of God, and although humankind may not be able to know
              the reasons behind their suffering, they must trust in that omnipotent wisdom.
              That trust is mankind’s answer to suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Suffering
              is also impermanent for those who submit to the will of God, ending when they
              pass into the afterlife, into heaven, and are reunited with God. This is the
              ultimate end of suffering for the Christian.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Suffering in Buddhism</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              first of the Buddhist Four Noble Truths is that “Life is dukkha”— the Buddhist
              concept of impermanence, dissatisfaction, and suffering. This is often
              translated as simply, “Life is suffering”. For Buddhists, suffering is without
              meaning, useless to the human condition, and so adherents see no value in it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              the Buddhist, the cause of suffering can be explained by the Second Noble
              Truth, which teaches that the cause of suffering is craving. In this worldview,
              people constantly search outside the self for something to make them happy. But
              the problem with that is no matter how much we find—success, fame, money, or
              love—we never stay satisfied.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Buddha wrote that this craving stems from an ignorance of the self, that we
              suffer because the world doesn’t work the in the ways we expect, and that our
              lives don’t conform to our expectations—our preconceived notions that don’t
              match reality are the true cause of suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Third Noble Truth teaches that we can put an end to suffering by addressing
              this craving, that we can escape from our state of constant dissatisfaction and
              enjoy the cessation of dukkha. This is achieved only through great
              difficulty—by letting go of the things that we think keep us happy, and
              learning to simply be happy with the way the world is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Fourth Noble Truth shows how to actually let those preconceived notions go.
              This is done by following the Buddhist Eightfold Path—eight areas of practice
              that affect all aspects of life. By following these eight ways to live
              correctly, an adherent can finally leave suffering behind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A Dichotomy of Sorrow</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              seems that, in both worldviews, suffering is caused by a yearning. In that
              light, are sin and dukkha the same?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              answer to this question lies in what that yearning is directed toward. The
              Christian concept of sin involves suffering, but suffering is not sin. Sin is
              alienation from God, and that alienation is the cause of suffering. In essence,
              suffering is the human yearning for God, and the inability to satisfy that
              yearning while on earth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              Buddhists, the cause of suffering is wholly different—it is based in the human
              rather than the divine. For them, suffering—dukkha—flows from the difference
              between human desires and what reality offers. Here, suffering is yearning,
              itself, and the answer is simply to stop yearning.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              answer is no—sin and dukkha are quite different. One worldview aims to save
              mankind from suffering by reconnection with God. The other, by transcending
              human desire.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              an adherent of Christianity and a practitioner of Buddhism have much to learn
              from one another.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A
              Christian can certainly apply the Four Noble Truths to their life in their
              quest to lessen their suffering, while still holding fast to the idea that the
              desire for God is the only craving that must remain untouched. The Eightfold
              Path, too, holds great potential as a path to living out the will of God, as it
              directs us to treat others and ourselves in a way that does not cause pain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A
              Buddhist, likewise, can learn from the Christian to see suffering as
              meaningful, rather than simply something to be escaped—when it is inescapable,
              realizing that it can have a purpose can do much for the ability to persevere.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              problem of pain is as old as humankind, itself—a problem that nearly every
              belief system attempts to address. Likewise, each of these belief systems contains
              wisdom, contains paths through which we might navigate the sorrows of life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Remain
              open to receiving this wisdom from worldviews that may not be your own—the mind
              that can hold strong to its own worldview while still taking these nuggets of
              truth from other, possibly opposing, worldviews, is a strong one, and one that
              will take its owner through even the worst of trials.</span></p>
