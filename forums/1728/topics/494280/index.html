              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Saturday
              marked the Buddhist Festival of Asalah Puja. Dr. Serena Nimityongskul joined us
              to talk about it this morning. Here’s a look at our conversation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Guest:
              Asalha Puja day marks the completion of the Triple Gem in Buddhism, which
              consists of the Buddha himself, his teachings or the dharma, and the sangha or
              monastic community that spreads his teachings. Asalha Puja day is the ‘Dharma
              Day.’ On this day the Buddha gave his first sermon after attaining
              Enlightenment to the 5 ascetics with whom he once trained. One of them ordained
              and became the first monk in Buddhism, Kondanna. Kondanna also attained
              Enlightenment after hearing this auspicious sermon known as the ‘Dhammajak’
              that Buddhists routinely chant.</span></p>

              <strong>How is it generally observed?</strong></span></p>

              Buddhists typically follow the Lord Buddha’s teachings on holy days. The heart
              of Buddhism is to do good, avoid evil and purify our minds. Buddhists will
              typically not sell alcohol on these days and instead go to the local temple to
              cultivate good deeds. We offer fine things such as food, necessities, and
              donations to practice generosity, we listen to sermons from the teaching monks,
              we chant the Dhammajak which is the 1st sermon that the Lord Buddha gave, and
              lastly, we purify our minds through meditation.</span></p>

              <strong>What separates it from different
              Buddhist observances?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Guest:
              Different Buddhist observances celebrate different aspects of the Buddha’s
              life. We have Vesak or Buddha Day, the day the Lord Buddha was born, became
              enlightened and passed away. The Dharma day, or Asalha puja day which was
              yesterday, when the Dharma was born, and the Sangha Day, or Maka Bucha when
              1250 enlightened Buddhist monks ordained by the Buddha himself gathered
              together to hear an important sermon. Each of these days honors a different
              part of the Buddhist Triple Gem. Without any one of these days Buddhism would
              not exist.</span></p>

              <strong>What is the significance of the Buddha’s
              first sermon?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Guest:
              The first sermon marked the Buddha’s great compassion to disseminate the truths
              that he learned to the world. Without his great compassion to teach others he
              would be a silent Buddha. Some enlightened Buddhas do not come out and teach
              publicly. Siddhartha choose to teach others and without his teachings, Buddhism
              would not exist, and the world might be a vastly different place. His teachings
              ultimately show you the way to Enlightenment. Just like it would be very
              difficult to drive to California if you didn’t know the way, it would be much
              more difficult to attain Enlightenment without the road map given to us by the
              Lord Buddha. The first sermon also laid down the 2 pillars of Buddhism, the 4
              noble truths, and the 8 fold path. The 4 noble truths are that: suffering
              exists, suffering is from attachment, there is a state where you can be free of
              suffering and the way out of suffering is the 8fold path. Without going into
              too much detail the 8 fold path is simply living your life in the right way, do
              good, think good and speak good.</span></p>

              <strong>What do you hope people learn or take
              away with this observance?</strong></span></p>

              The Buddha showed us the way but very importantly nobody can walk for you.
              Nobody but you can save yourself. So I hope that people will connect with the
              light within themselves and cultivate more goodness. Because the Buddha was a
              man just like you or I he was not a god and he taught that this great potential
              to reach the wise mind or ‘Buddha nature’ within exists inside all of us. But
              nobody can do the work for us. So I hope we all recommit ourselves to
              decreasing anger and negativity in our lives by being more mindful, commit to
              being more compassionate and kind to the people around us, and lastly, I hope
              that people will look inside to find the great happiness within. The Buddha
              showed us that all things are impermanent and when we attach our happiness to
              the outside world, the material things or circumstances around us that are
              always changing, we will ultimately suffer. So I hope people will start to look
              inside and see that we already have everything we need to be happy. We have
              more than we need to be happy actually. And that true happiness is based on
              non-attachment, on letting go and developing a peaceful mind and then sharing
              that peace and happiness with those around us. I hope people will be reminded
              of the light inside of them and cultivate it to shine more brightly so the
              world can be a more peaceful place for us all.</span></p>
