              Sufferers Provides Simulation of Normal Life </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">John Minor Buddhistdoor
              Global | 2016-07-07 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Most
              of us tell white lies at some point or another. In extreme cases, we find
              ourselves simulating normality for someone whose psychological state is not
              grounded in the everyday. A home for sufferers of extreme dementia in The
              Netherlands has done exactly this. In 2009, Hogewey Care Centre constructed
              “Hogeweyk” for dementia patients to enjoy their lives in simulated normality
              while avoiding the issues that would arise for them in the “normal” world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Hogeweyk
              is a specially designed community with 23 houses for 152 dementia-suffering
              seniors, deliberately constructed to function as a normal village. This
              “dementia village” tries to reduce conflict and confusion by providing a
              realistic yet “safe and non-threatening version of real life,” according to Hogewey
              information officer, Isabel van Zuthem. (Nodes of Ranvier)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">According
              to the Hogeweyk website, residents live in in homes of six to eight people
              based on lifestyle preference and engage in everyday activities (such as
              washing and cooking) with health workers in attendance, many of whom also live
              in the village. Like any normal village, Hogeweyk has streets, gardens, a park,
              and squares. The Hogeweyk supermarket offers groceries, and there is also a
              restaurant, a theater, and a bar. Marianne Cezza observed on her psychology
              blog, Nodes of Ranvier, that there are no nurses in the village, but the health
              workers assume fictional personas such as neighbors or shop workers to help the
              residents function and stay safe. “For instance, if someone were to forget to
              pay at the mini-market, shop assistants would simply fix the payment with the
              health workers at the residential apartments,” she explained.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              reasoning is that dementia patients understandably become confused, upset, and
              frustrated to be constantly told that their perception of the world is
              incorrect. Reminding a patient of the “truth” of their circumstances could
              actually do more harm than good. Hogewey prioritizes well-being over “the
              truth,” although the simulated normality does not mean that the village is fake
              or that everything is a prop, since the amenities are real and functional.
              (Nodes of Ranvier)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Hogeweyk
              features seven different lifestyle choices for residents, which correspondingly
              shape the aesthetic and atmosphere of the home they live in: urban, artisan,
              Indonesian, homey, Gooi (an imitation of a green, wealthy, and historic
              neighborhood around Hilversum), traditional cultural, and Christian. Related to
              this idea of simulated normality and personalized surroundings is “reminiscence
              therapy,” which aims to recreate former personal environments and aid dementia
              patients’ short-term memory by jogging their long-term memory through familiar
              music and objects, such as photographs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“It
              isn’t about lying to anyone. But if a patient says they have to go and catch a
              bus, we can sit [with them] at the bus stop and say: ‘Tell us about the buses
              you used to catch,’ ” said Chris Taylor of Grove Care, a nursing home inspired
              by Hogeweyk in Winterbourne, Bristol. (Nodes of Ranvier) In this sense
              reminiscence therapy is not about facilitating an illusion, but providing a
              therapeutic outlet for dementia patients who are unable to function in the
              world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Of
              course, this raises many ethical conundrums, not the least of which is whether
              it is moral to fake normality. Nodes of Ranvier asserts: “The idea is to view
              dementia differently, giving the 35 million people worldwide who suffer from
              dementia a chance to enjoy their current life more, rather than emphasis [sic]
              the life they no longer have and even increasing their distress and confusion.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Since
              its founding, Hogeweyk has won or been nominated for various awards due to its
              approach to caring for dementia patients, including its unique design as a
              village environment.</span></p>
