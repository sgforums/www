              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">13 September 2017 Yeshe
              Choesang, Tibet Post International </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dharamshala
              — Chinese authorities have apparently ramped up efforts to even further
              threaten freedom of information in China and Tibet, as authorities issued new regulations
              on Instant Social Media Networking on Thursday, September 7, warning group chat
              owners to take full responsibility for their activities and ordered them to:
              "Stay away from nine topics in online group chats" on WeChat, QQ or
              Baidu Tieba.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"In
              the past few days, many Tibetans have come into the focus of Chinese police
              attention, as Chinese authorities have ordered the crackdown of large parts of
              China made social media users in Tibet and Tibetan areas, where foreign
              journalists are still banned from visiting the region and where almost all
              Tibetan websites, blogs and forums run by Tibetans were permanently closed
              down," says Yeshe Choesang, editor of the Tibet Post International.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tibetans
              who participated in group chats ordered to leave groups and those who having
              photos/texts related to Tibet or His Holiness the Dalai Lama in their mobile
              phones were ordered to delete them from their mobiles— an extreme and
              counter-productive move. Intensifying control over freedom of speech activity
              presents a further threat to freedom of information in Tibet with the issuance
              of these new rules for group chats on WeChat, QQ and others forms of social
              media.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">After
              mobile tracking by Chinese authorities, Tibetans who had participated in group
              chats were called in to government offices and police stations and questioned
              about their involvements, with officials wanting to know which social media
              sites they had used, what software they had installed with cell phones, and
              with whom they had spoken. After careful investigation, police warned them,
              saying: "Stay away from nine topics in online group chats on WeChat, QQ or
              Baidu Tieba," among the apparently forbidden topics are Tibet and any sort
              of 'political dissidence.'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Group
              chats on WeChat, QQ or Baidu Tieba have become popular in recent years, not
              only among Chinese, but also among the Tibetan public, serving as online
              forums. However, Beijing is now taking action to tighten controls over the
              messaging apps.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) released a statement (in Chinese) on
              its website saying that the managers and owners of the group chats will have to
              be responsible for the management of the groups. Also, online chat providers
              must now verify the identities of the users and keep the blogs and logs of the group
              chats for at least six months.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Additionally,
              the rules also require the service providers to set up credit systems. Users
              who break the rules will have their credit score lowered, have their management
              rights suspended, and be reported to relevant government departments to keep
              them on file, said CAC on its website.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">CAC
              especially highlighted in its statement that "whoever sets up the group
              should be responsible," and that "whoever manages the group should be
              responsible."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              new regulations will cover platforms provided by the country's internet giants
              and budding startups, such as Baidu's Tieba, Alibaba's Alipay chat, Tencent's
              WeChat and QQ, Sina's Weibo, and the group chats in the rising dating app Momo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Self-censorship
              is kicking in fast on WeChat as China's new rules on message groups casts a
              chill among the 963 million users of Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s social network.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Regulations
              released Sept. 7 made creators of online groups responsible for managing
              information within their forums and the behavior of members. The prospect of
              punishment for the actions of others has led many administrators to disband
              groups while others circulate self-imposed rules discouraging the spreading of
              rumors or unauthorized information about Hong Kong and Taiwan. Some are turning
              to alternatives, such as encrypted messaging apps, to avoid government
              scrutiny. The regulations are the latest in a series of moves carried out by
              authorities, as China ramps up for the politically sensitive period of the 19th
              Communist Party congress.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              a follow-up to the new set of regulations (in Chinese) on online groups
              unveiled by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) last week, the
              country's Public Security Bureau issued an urgent warning (in Chinese) on
              September 11, declaring that online discussions on WeChat, the all-encompassing
              and most popular messaging platform in China, are subject to the new rules, and
              that a few group chat administrators had been detained as punishment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the statement, the police department reiterated the core message of the
              regulations that all group chat members, especially organizers and
              administrators, should be responsible for their comments in cyberspace. In
              addition, the police listed nine taboo topics that every online chat group user
              should steer clear of. What the most surprising thing about the new regulation
              is that Tibet considered as China's so called "most sensitive area",
              is excluded among the nine topics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Following
              are the banned topics in China, include Tibet, South Mongolia, East Turkestan
              and Manchuria:</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Chinese authorities also warned many across China, including Tibet and Tibetan
              areas. In one instance, many Tibetans from Qinghai and Sichuan Provinces,
              claiming discontented with being caught while investigating, spread insulting
              content against the police and consequently were held in detention for five
              days for creating a disturbance. In another instance, some local residents in
              the city of Qianjiang, in Hubei Province, were criticized and educated by the
              local police after being found circulating petitions in a WeChat group to
              oppose a local government's project. Although the group's owner wasn't involved
              in the dissemination of protest posts, he was approached by the police for not
              promptly stopping the group members' acts of expressing inappropriate content.</span></p>
