But if you enter certain state of samadhi, it is dangerous because in a state of samadhi you lose even the clarity aspect and enter into a state of absorption. Then if you drive your car, you will get into accidents.<br><br>So practise mindfulness in living, mindfulness can be practised at all moments - teaching, walking, talking, etc. Samadhi can wait for meditation.<br><br>But if the 'clarity' aspect is still there - then nothing wrong. You can lose track of your time, it's ok, just wear your watch. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mindfulness should be so clear that we "fully use our senses" like in Mindfulness of Breathing meditation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But there is no self involved, just like if you close ur eyes and feel anything...feel the hardness of the floor...like in mindfulness, is that 'hardness' urs or mine or the floor?<br><br>Actually it's not yours nor mine. So if you go beyond labels and become imageless, there will be arising. When one is not attached to the arising, one penetrates into the object and the heart of the object is consciousness.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">True freedom comes when you realise there is completely no self and no doer at all... all are spontaneously self-arising out of conditions, miraculously aware.</span><br><br>By the way I posted this in: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=200194" rel="nofollow">i need help</a><br><br>-----------------------<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cenarious:</div><div class="quote_body">also my head will shiver a bit after a while by itself neurotically periodically and this breaks my concentration i noticed this since young when going for haircuts</div></blockquote>Then be aware of that shivering, the practise of anapanasati/mindfulness of breathing is to practise awareness, and then in living, try to bring that awareness to our entire being while not only restricting to the breathe.<br><br>How to be aware... anapanasati is not just a form of focusing. There must be the quality of clarity... shi fu says... in practising the dharma, even the tiniest insect - perhaps a mosquito which flies past you, you will be aware. he also mentioned before, meditation in buddhism is not a form of concentration that is practised in other religions... in which he gave an example (not in exact words but along this line):<br><br><blockquote>At one time, a meditator exclaimed to the Buddha how great his meditative experience was. He said 500 vehicles passed by, he did not know any of it at all.<br><br>The Buddha replied: I also had great meditative experience. 500 Vehicles pass by, I am aware of every single one of them.</blockquote>500 vehicles passed by, Buddha wasnt disturbed. meditation isnt escaping from 6 sense experience, but be fully aware (and thus undisturbed).<br><br>So i believe the point is whether you are shivering or just breathing what matters most is the level of mindfulness.<br><br>In terms of anapanasati, we must be so closely aware of the breathing, we must know the sensation, the coldness or warmness of the air, the 'touch' of the air... sense it fully. is there effort required to bring awareness? no... when you drop all labels and wandering thoughts, the breathing itself knows... this is the function of the buddha nature. it takes no effort to see, smell, touch, it takes place by itself, it is awareness itself. no effort to control anything at all...<br><br>We are bound to get physical and mental disturbance in meditation especially when we are still not trained in them... it's ok, do not resist them, accept them as it is and be aware. ultimately you're not seeking some kind of great experience in meditation, good or bad doesn't matter, but to remain conscious throughout. if thoughts has been creeping up in your mind, ignore them, dont be interested in them and they will pass. Do not treat as if the thoughts have anything to do with you and they will just fall away.<br><br>Anyway good u're starting to meditate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Planning tomorrow's lessons can be a present thought also. When you are planning something, this thought actually consists of a lot of small small thoughts, like what is my objective, how fast they learn, what are the resources.<br><br>Concept of living in the present moment requires us to focus on the present thought, instead of chasing around the past and future thoughts.

Continuous sustainability of Presence all the time is the result of the awakening of our prajna wisdom that will lead to the experience of all phenomenon manifestation as unconditional spontaneous arising.  It is not the result of effort or the strength of habitual energy.<br><br>The beginning of clarity and stabilization starts when we begin to break loose a deeply held 'bond' in our consciousness -- A hypnotic bond that is like a magical spell bonding us to our thoughts, body and self.  Feel the power of this bond.  It is just a form of identification and nothing else yet it has such power over us.  Realizing this will help loosen the power of symbols over us, thus bringing us one step closer to the natural state.
