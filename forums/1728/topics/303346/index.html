            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Bhusuku (Shantideva)<br>(From the text "Caturasiti-siddha-pravrtti" {Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi'i lo rgyus}by Abhayadatta, translated by Keith Dowman)<br><br>The younger son of a royal family came to the famed monastic academy of Sri Nalanda to be ordained in the mahasanghika order. But he had been much pampered as a child, and he found it not only difficult but unreasonable to give up his former ways. While his fellow monks studied, he lazed in bed. While his fellow monks spent hours in meditation, he strolled about the gardens of the monastery for the sake of his digestion. His other greatest pleasure was mealtime, where he savored every grain of his five measures of rice.<br><br>His lazy ways irritated his peers beyond belief, and they took to calling him Bhusuku, "The Shiftless One". They gossiped about him remorselessly behind his back, said equally rude things to his face, and dearly hoped he would soon meet his comeuppance.<br><br>It was the custom at Nalanda that scriptures were read around the clock, morning, noon, and night, in every one season and out the other. To maintain this tradition, each monk took his turn sitting upon the temple throne under the monks' canopy reciting his memorized portion of the sutras. Every one took his turn, without exception, except of course Bhusuku. As he had managed to memorize nothing, he often missed his turn. The accumulated annoyance and enmity that arose from this was surprising in so holy as institution.<br><br>Finally, Bhusuku's scandalous behavior earned him a severe warning from the abbot. He was told that unless he mended his ways and took his turn on the rota like everyone else, he would be expelled from the monastery. Quite a number of monks smirked behind their hands at this, evidently hoping for the worst possible outcome.<br><br>"But I've broken no vow," Bhusuku argued in his own defense. "I'm simply a bad scholar. Is that any reason for expelling me?"<br><br>The abbot was adamant. Tomorrow morning bright and early his turn came up. If he missed his recitation this time, he was out on his ear. The monks were delighted, and a good deal of petty gossip flew about concerning the imminent downfall of a certain good-for-nothing lazybones.<br><br>Despite his warning, however, the abbot was a very kindly man, and he had a soft spot for the miscreant. That night, after everyone had gone to bed to dream of the glorious comedy to come on the morrow, the abbot came to Bhusuku's cell to give him some advice.<br><br>"Well, my son," said the abbot, "you've gotten yourself into a pretty pickle. You've spent so much time pandering to your stomach and being a slugbed, you've not managed to learn so much as half as a dozen lines of any one sutra. You will certainly fail tomorrow unless you follow my counsel."<br><br>Bhusuku prostrated himself at the abbot's feet and begged for his help. "Anything, sir. Just name it. I'll do it."<br><br>"Very well," said the abbot, adding sternly, "but it means you'll get no sleep tonight."<br><br>"Even that, sir," said the chastened monk.<br><br>"The only hope for you," said the abbot, "is to spend the night reciting the mantra of Manjusri, the Bodhisattva for Intellect. You must recite the arapacana mantra until cockcrow, and hope for the best." He then gave Bhusuku the secret precepts of Manjusri's sadhana, and the blessing of the mantra, and left the repentant one to his task.<br><br>Knowing his own weaknesses well, Bhusuku took the precaution of tying the collar of his robe to the ceiling by a stout cord lest he nod off during the night. And all night long he recited the mantra the abbot had taught him - over and over again until he was in a stupor of fatigue.<br><br>Just before the dawn, his cell was suddenly flooded with light. Bhusuku jerked awake and decided it must be sunup, and here he was, not one whit wiser than he'd been the night before. Just then, a great voice boomed from the ceiling, "What do you think you're doing?"<br><br>Looking up, the exhausted monk saw an enormous figure floating in the air above his head. "I am invoking the aid of Lord Manjusri to help me recite a sutra this very day, and I have learned none. But, who are you, and what do you want of me?"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"That's a foolish question," replied his unusual guest. "You've been invoking me half the night."<br><br>"Y-y-y-you are Manjusri himself!" stammered the startled monk.<br><br>"The very one. Now tell me what you want and let me get on about my business."<br><br>Bhusuku would have flung himself to the floor but he was still tied to the ceiling, so he pressed his palms together in the gesture of supplication, and begged, "Please, great lord, grant me the power and realization of every quality of perfect insight."<br><br>"Done!" said Manjusri. "Recite your sutra when you are called." And he vanished as suddenly as he had came.<br><br>Word was abroad that Bhusuku was about to make a fool of himself this very day, and King Devapala and his entire court came for the show. The altar was piled high with the fragrant offerings of flowers all the visitors had brought with them.<br><br>The audience tittered and whispered to each other when Bhusuku arrived in the great hall. They were amused as he walked confidently down the aisle and mounted the temple throne - all waited eagerly for him to fall flat on his face. Instead, he called for the monks' canopy and seated himself in the lotus position. He gazed out at his audience with great calm and waited patiently for quiet. When it became clear that he at last had everyone's attention, he levitated into the air above the throne, and his body began to blaze with a great radiance that pulsed throughout the great hall.<br><br>Those who had come to laugh were stricken dumb with amazement. They looked at each other in wonder.<br><br>Bhusuku greeted the king and asked, "Shall I recite a traditional sutra, your majesty, or would you prefer something of my own composition?"<br><br>The king began to smile. "I am told that your eating habits are highly unusual," he said, "and your sleeping and strolling habits are subjects of great wonder to your fellow monks. It seems only fitting that you would maintain your standards of originality and recite a sutra of your very own."<br><br>Whereupon Bhusuku began to compose and recite the sublime and profound discourse that came to be called the "Bodhicaryavatara", 'The Pathway to Enlightenment'. When he had completed the tenth and last chapter he rose into the sky to the height of seven palm trees, inspiring renewed faith in those who had assembled there that day.<br><br>"This is not Bhusuku, 'The Shiftless One'," exclaimed the king. "He is surely a great sage." And he renamed the monk Shantideva, "Divine Peace".<br><br>The people began to strew the places his feet had touched with flowers, and the pundits humbly requested a commentary on his discourse. Shantideva obliged them, but when the monks entreated him to become their abbot, he refused.<br><br>That night, he left his robes, his begging bowl, and all his sacred artifacts upon the altar as an offering, and departed secretly. Traveling from land to land, he finally arrived in Dhokiri, a town of some two hundred and fifty thousand households. There, he fashioned himself a handsome sword out of a piece of wood and painted it with some gold paint. The following day he made his way to the court, prostrated himself before the king, and requested a position as swordsman with the palace guard. The king decided he was a likely looking fellow and hired him on the spot at the handsome stipend of ten tolas of gold a day.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shantideva served the king faithfully for twelve years. By day he lived as any other soldier. By night he practiced his sadhana, constantly attentive to the ultimate nature of reality. Every autumn, the great festival of the Mother Goddess, Umadevi, he accompanied the guards to the temple just as though he, too, were a devotee.<br><br>No one was any the wiser about his true nature until one afternoon when everyone was in the armory polishing up their weapons and repairing their gear. One of the guards took a good look at Shantideva's sword. It seemed to be made of wood! Thinking to do himself a service, the guard went off immediately to report his findings to the king and expose the imposter. Shantideva was summoned to the throne room.<br><br>"Show me your sword," demanded the king.<br><br>"I would gladly do so, sir," said Shantideva, "but it will do you great harm if I obey."<br><br>"Do as I say!" commanded the king. "Let me worry about the results."<br><br>As Shantideva reached for the pommel, he pleaded, "At least cover one eye, sir."<br><br>Laughing among themselves, the king and all who were gathered there each covered one eye with a hand. Whereupon Shantideva unsheathed the sword of awareness. As he pointed it heavenward, a light as intense as ten suns filled the throne room, blinding each unprotected eye. Everyone there, including the king, fell upon his knees before Shantideva, entreating the yogin's forgiveness and mercy.<br><br>Shantideva went to each person in the room, beginning with the lowliest servant, and spitting on his forefinger, rubbed his healing saliva onto each injured eye, magically restoring the lost sight. The king begged him to remain as his palace priest, but Shantideva declined and departed Dhokiri that very day.<br><br>He took up residence in a cave in the mountain fastness and lived there practicing his sadhana for some time. But he was always an object of curiosity to the hunters and woodsmen who lived roundabout, and they kept an eye on his doings.<br><br>One day, a royal huntsman came to court with rare game for the king's table and let it be known that, with his own eyes, he had seen Shantideva hunting and killing deer and eating vension roasted upon a spit.<br><br>The king immediately set out for the mountains with a large entourage to investigate these serious charges. They came upon Shantideva sitting on a deerskin meditating in front of what appeared to be a blank rock wall.<br><br>The king told the yogin all that he had heard, adding, "You who taught the king of Nalanda to swallow his pride and who restored the sight of myself and all my court, why with such power at your command are you harming living beings?"<br><br>"I do not kill," said Shantideva, "I heal." Whereupon he waved his hand in the air and the rock face opened behind him revealing the entrance to his cave. Out sprang every imaginable sort of animal. As they went bounding off into the woods, they seemed to multiply before the amazed eyes of the king and his retinue until the creatures covered every hill and filled every vallery. And then they vanished as though they had never been.<br><br>"All elements of experience are merely dreams and illusions," explained Shantideva. "Understand that all things are but insubstantial figments of the imagination, projections of the mind. Enter the path of liberation." He then recited this verse:<br><br>The deer I took for vension<br>Never existed on this earth<br>Yet will never cease to be.<br>If there is no such thing as substance,<br>Then there can be no hunter, no hunted.<br>It is not I who am the lazy one here.<br><br>Whereupon Shantideva converted the king of Dhokiri, and set all his people upon the path of truth. He served them faithfully for one hundred years before ascending to the Paradise of the Dakinis.</div>
