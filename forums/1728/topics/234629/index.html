            <div class='col-md body'>I have posted this in Bohiruci's Ch'an, Dzogchen and Mahamudra forum before, but Wanderer requested that it be removed because it can cause confusion among beginners. However I believe many people in our forum will benefit from this, and already there are forummers who are at the level and capacity to intuitively understand the work by Padmasambhava, who is the very famous Master and founder of Tibetan Buddhism. (But the follow article applies to all traditions because it talks about the very core and essence of realising the nature of our mind, which is what every Buddhist seeks - awakening).<br><br>Also the reason why I am starting this thread again is because a friend of mine came upon this and shown it to Thusness, and Thusness commented that it is "the best of the best" -- combining both non duality and emptiness into one. This work is written with very deep clarity and insights into our true nature, which is rare to be found.<br><br>(p.s those that find this difficult that's fine, it is a little direct, 'advanced', and not everyone is of the capacity of instantaneous awakening, one must start from the basics of buddhism)<br><br>So here it is... I am posting part by part, slowly.

Instead, the second door of impermanence was introduced and it was introduced with the purpose to complement the no-self experience you had in order to give rise to this insight of Â“Self-LiberationÂ”.  The sole purpose of the practice of the second door of impermanence is for this insight to arise.<br><br>I was reading some commentaries about this work, I was disappointed; and with all due respect, I must say it is terribly distorted.  The commentator has transformed this great work of Padmasambhava to an Advaita or neo-Advaita teaching.  Self Liberating nature of our pristine nature is not to posit naked-awareness as a background where Â“all thoughts arise and subsideÂ’ and the background is not affected by this transient nature of thoughts, it remains constant, changeless and unmoved.  Â‘Self liberationÂ’ should never be taken to mean this.<br><br>There is no Awareness apart from the arising and ceasing of thoughts and yet thought spontaneously arise and subsides in its own accord (self-liberating).  It liberates at that very moment of Â‘passing awayÂ’ (the practice of second door) without the need of effort, simply so.  From moment to moment it is so.  Thus comes and thus goes.  This is its emptiness nature.  The emptiness nature liberates instantaneously.  By simply so, it is spontaneously self-perfected.<br><br>Sentient mind however posit a Â‘selfÂ’ and holds.  Whether the Â“thoughtÂ” is good or bad, it attempts to do something to change, whatever direction it goes either good or bad, all is Â‘doingÂ’ (karma) and prevents the liberating nature.  However without the experience of no-self (Buddhism non-duality not Adviata non-dual), one can never understand this intuitively.<br><br>Do read with a reverent heart.  Homage to Padmasambhava.<br><br><blockquote><br>How can you say that you cannot find your own mind?<br><br>The mind is just that which is thinking:<br>(My opinion is it should be translated to Â“The mind is just the thinkingÂ” but I do not have the original text.)<br><br>And yet, although you have searched (for the thinker), how can you say that you do not find him?<br><br>With respect to this, nowhere does there exist the one who is the cause of (mental) activity.<br><br>And yet, since activity exists, how can you say that such activity does not arise?<br><br>Since merely allowing (thoughts) to settle into their own condition, without trying to modify them in any way, is sufficient,<br><br>How can you say that you are not able to remain in a calm state?<br><br>Since allowing (thoughts) to be just as they are, with out trying to do anything about them, is sufficient,<br><br>How can you say that you are not able to do anything with regard to them?<br><br>Since clarity, awareness, and emptiness are inseparable and are spontaneously self-perfected,<br><br>How can you say that nothing is accomplished by your practice?<br><br>Since (intrinsic awareness) is self-originated and spontaneously self-perfected without any antecedent causes or conditions,<br><br>How can you say that you are not able to accomplish anything by your efforts?<br><br>Since the arising of discursive thoughts and their being liberated occur simultaneously,<br><br>How can you say that you are unable to apply an antidote?<br><br>Since your own immediate awareness is just this,<br><br>How can you say that you do not know anything with regard to it?<br></blockquote>And<br><br><blockquote><br>It is certain that all of the diverse characteristics of things are liberated into their own condition,<br><br>Like clouds in the atmosphere that are self-originated and self-liberated.<br><br>You should look at your own mind to see whether it is like that or not.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by longchen:<br>I do find the impermanence door very helpful. No-self is easier for me to be  now... however the self-liberation aspect is still quite tricky. ..for me.<br></blockquote>Yes, let the understanding takes its own course.  It is similar to the case of non-dual where there is a sudden 'insight' that there is really no-self and a sudden expansion of releasing takes place on its own accord.<br><br>In fact practice now becomes moment to moment of meeting conditions and let arise of whatever outcome.  There is no choosing and grasping.  The 'self-liberation is deeply felt and thoroughly understood, not just a glimpse of the truth.  I am still far from that.  It is a path for those with utmost sincerity.   Not as excuse to laze idle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><br>It is like what i have said before there is various depths to non-duality. There appears to be 2 distinct 'levels' of non-duality...to me.<br><br>In the first level, mental thoughts are still quite active. Here thoughts arises but there is no thinker. Here no subject-object split is clearly understood.<br></blockquote>At this level there is the Â‘insightÂ’ of no-self but momentum continues.  However momentum stops being re-enforced.<br><br><blockquote><br>And there is another distinct level that mental thoughts loses it attraction all together. In this level, there feels like cognitions have been de-constructed.<br></blockquote>There are several reasons:<br><br>1.  Here most of the propensities that resulted from holding to the illusion view of a background begin to subside.<br><br>2.  When background subsides, Natural awareness takes place and there is natural tendency to feel everything directly, the burden is being more equally distributed to the rest of the five senses instead of being skewed to just Â‘thinkingÂ’ alone.<br><br>3.  A subtle Â“insightÂ” is about to take place or has already taken place.  It is the Â‘insightÂ” that Â‘contentÂ’ is the problem of all problems.  It is what that conjured out all sorts of illusions, fears and worries.<br><br>4.  The practice of the second door is gaining strength at the pre-conscious level.<blockquote><br>This is a blissful level and it feels like resting on 'nothing'.<br></blockquote>It is resting on Â‘nothing of contentÂ’ but it is resting on Â‘peace, clarity, blissfulness, vitalityÂ’.  Here focus is gradually shifting from "content" of the mind to "qualities" of the mind.  The qualities of mind has nothing to do with "content".<br><br><blockquote><br>But without the first level non-duality, the second level cannot be moved into.<br></blockquote>This need not be the case.  The first level of Â‘insightÂ’ is more important from my point of view.  It is what that leads to Oneness.  A person that practices mindfulness may enter the second level u mentioned without first having that Â‘non-dualÂ’ insight of the first level, this in fact has been my case for many years.  It is due to the ability to sustain for a prolong period of bare attention or non-conceptuality.  The understanding of no-self here can still remain as 'no-personal self' or as a form of mirror bright clarity that is free of labels but the mirror still exist in a dualistic form.  In the second level, the sense of ego diminishes but the attachment of a background is still strong and insight into "non-dual" has not really aroused.</div>
