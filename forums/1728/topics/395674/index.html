              <p>Hi Ironfist,</p>
              <p>To err is human, to repent is divine, to forgive is also divine... hee hee</p>
              <p>I'm sure you can appreciate that one of the beauty in this world is that there is variety.  If everyone is the same, it would be a boring world.  Everyone has different taste, like some people like drinking milo, or tea, or coke etc.  So we can't really force people to drink the things we like only.  That is quite cruel, dun you think?</p>
              <p>Thanks for apologising.  You are a nice fella.</p>
              <p>Good luck on your spiritual path.</p>

Just like the Rony Tan saga. I dun think he is truly repentent and sincere as he still holds to the views that buddhism and taoism are false and satanic. I think TS still holds to the view of Rony Tan.  It's in the bible that other religions are false and satanic. if not why so many christians go zealously and tell people of other faith?</p></div>

              <p>there is a difference if you are being sincere apologising and apologising when you know it is the wrong thing to do but still remain unrepentent as you still hold the views.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you frankly, I may not know much about the bible but it will do your religion a favour from making many enemies like you are going to hell and that your religion is false and satanic or how about the comment like why pray to an idol made of gold, wood, clay etc. if your religion is true, there is no need to go around telling people these isnt it. if another religion were to tell you that your own religion is from the devil, how would you react and feel inside? your first reaction would be, its a load of rubbish isnt it.</p>
              <p>alot of people went to EH to comments cos they have had experiences of christians telling them their religion is false and satanic, me included. so to have backlash from so many people of other faiths and no religion didnt surprised one at all. you reaped what you have sowed goes the showing.</p>

              <p>Well, Buddhism is true or not is not up to you guys to think.</p>
              <p>To me, Buddhism is a proven religion based on what I personally saw (Buddha is right above us, in the sky) and what I experienced.</p>
