              <p>First off: regarding those images, I'm not sure, maybe Longchen can answer you better but as you have intuited one should let go of all these impressions. My understanding is that they are not necessarily our past lives, usually past life memories are only accessed in very deep state of concentration and clarity, or states of jhana and samadhi.</p>
              <p>As for whether breathing meditation is just basic meditation or something more: that would depend on which system of meditation you follow.</p>
              <p>In some systems especially in Theravada, the Anapanasati method is held in high esteem and is used to gain Nirvana. In other traditions like Vajrayana, it is often the case that it is only taught as a common shamatha to build a base of concentration and one-pointedness, before moving on to more advanced practice.</p>
              <p>That is why you need to tell me which system of meditation you are following first.</p>
              <p>As for whether Anapanasati alone can lead to enlightenment, the answer is that it can, but it depends on how you practice it.</p>
              <p>If we practice Anapanasati as a shamatha (concentration) method, it will lead to states of absorption, jhana, samadhi, but not enlightenment. Example of breathing-shamatha is counting breathe, concentrating on the in-and-out of breathing, etc.</p>
              <p>If we practice Anapanasati as a vipassana (insight meditation) method, it will lead to enlightenment and liberation. That means just bare awareness of the sensations, the coldness, warmness, softness, hardness, liquidity or cohesion, movement and vibration... just sense it in full clarity and vividness, observing its arising and ceasing and non self and disattisfactory nature.... this will lead to realisation.</p>
              <p>from another article <a href="http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Other/Anapana/anapana.html">http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Other/Anapana/anapana.html</a></p>
              <p><em>Then as to respiration meditation (anapanasati), in the
                                                  Visuddhimagga it is mentioned as samatha meditation, concentration
                                                  meditation. In the Mahasatipatthana Sutta it is mentioned as
                                                  vipassana meditation. Then how can we distinguish it between the
                                                  vipassana aspect of respiration and the samatha aspect of
                                                  respiration? <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If
                                                  we are mindful of the absolute reality of respiration, that will be
                                                  vipassana meditation. If we are mindful of the concept regarding
                                                  respiration, then it will be samatha
                                                  meditation.</span></strong><br><br> So the Visuddhimagga mentions the method of concentrating on the
                                                  touching sensation whenever you breathe in and breathe out. When
                                                  you concentrate your mind on the coming in and going out of the
                                                  breath, then it is samatha meditation because you have to
                                                  concentrate on the coming in and going out, not on the wind or air.
                                                  When it is coming in you note Â‘inÂ’; when it is going out you note,
                                                  Â‘outÂ’. Â‘In, out, in, outÂ’. Your mind is not on the breathing air
                                                  but on the Â‘coming-inÂ’ and the Â‘going-outÂ’. Â‘Coming-inÂ’ and
                                                  Â‘going-outÂ’ are not ultimate realities.<br><br> Say you come into the room through the door and go out of the room
                                                  through the door. We may ask, Â“What is this coming in and going
                                                  out?Â” it is neither you, nor a person. It is just Â‘coming-inÂ’ and
                                                  Â‘going-out.Â’ It is just concept. In the same way, when you
                                                  concentrate on the coming in and going out of the breath, it is
                                                  just a concept. Since concept is the object of meditation, it is
                                                  samatha meditation. <strong>You cannot realise any specific
                                                  characteristics or general characteristics of Â‘coming-inÂ’ and
                                                  Â‘going-outÂ’ because they are not realities, just concepts, so
                                                  thatÂ’s samatha meditation.</strong><br><br> However, if you focus your mind on the point where the breath
                                                  touches whenever it comes in or goes out, it touches the nostrils.
                                                  <strong>When you observe this touching sensation and are mindful of
                                                  it, then it is (ultimate) reality.</strong> <strong>That touching point is
                                                  composed of the four primary material elements: pathavÄ« dhatu, hard
                                                  or soft; apo dhatu, liquidity or cohesion; tejo dhatu, hot or cold;
                                                  vayo dhatu, movement or vibration. These four elements are there
                                                  whenever you focus your mind on the touching sensation. So the
                                                  object is absolute reality. What can we call it Â— samatha or
                                                  vipassana meditation? It is vipassana.</strong></em><em><br><br> That is what the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw wrote about the
                                                  distinction between the samatha and vipassana aspects of
                                                  respiration meditation. I appreciate it very much. So then we can
                                                  say respiration meditation is vipassana meditation in accordance
                                                  with the Mahasatipatthana Sutta. We can also say that respiration
                                                  meditation is samatha in accordance with the Visuddhimagga. It is
                                                  very subtle and profound to differentiate between these two aspects
                                                  of respiration meditation, but I think those who have practised
                                                  meditation very well can differentiate between these two
                                                  aspects.</em></p>

              <p>Also the Buddha gave assurance that breathing meditation (vipassana) leads to enlightenment and Nirvana:</p>

That means just bare awareness of the sensations, the coldness, warmness, softness, hardness, liquidity or cohesion, movement and vibration... just sense it in full clarity and vividness, observing its arising and ceasing and non self and disattisfactory nature.... this will lead to realisation.</p>
              <p>from another article <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Other/Anapana/anapana.html">http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Other/Anapana/anapana.html</a></p>
              <p><em>Then as to respiration meditation (anapanasati), in the Visuddhimagga it is mentioned as samatha meditation, concentration meditation. In the Mahasatipatthana Sutta it is mentioned as vipassana meditation. Then how can we distinguish it between the vipassana aspect of respiration and the samatha aspect of respiration? <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If we are mindful of the absolute reality of respiration, that will be vipassana meditation. If we are mindful of the concept regarding respiration, then it will be samatha meditation.</span></strong><br><br>So the Visuddhimagga mentions the method of concentrating on the touching sensation whenever you breathe in and breathe out. When you concentrate your mind on the coming in and going out of the breath, then it is samatha meditation because you have to concentrate on the coming in and going out, not on the wind or air. When it is coming in you note Â‘inÂ’; when it is going out you note, Â‘outÂ’. Â‘In, out, in, outÂ’. Your mind is not on the breathing air but on the Â‘coming-inÂ’ and the Â‘going-outÂ’. Â‘Coming-inÂ’ and Â‘going-outÂ’ are not ultimate realities.<br><br>Say you come into the room through the door and go out of the room through the door. We may ask, Â“What is this coming in and going out?Â” it is neither you, nor a person. It is just Â‘coming-inÂ’ and Â‘going-out.Â’ It is just concept. In the same way, when you concentrate on the coming in and going out of the breath, it is just a concept. Since concept is the object of meditation, it is samatha meditation. <strong>You cannot realise any specific characteristics or general characteristics of Â‘coming-inÂ’ and Â‘going-outÂ’ because they are not realities, just concepts, so thatÂ’s samatha meditation.</strong><br><br>However, if you focus your mind on the point where the breath touches whenever it comes in or goes out, it touches the nostrils. <strong>When you observe this touching sensation and are mindful of it, then it is (ultimate) reality.</strong> <strong>That touching point is composed of the four primary material elements: pathavÄ« dhatu, hard or soft; apo dhatu, liquidity or cohesion; tejo dhatu, hot or cold; vayo dhatu, movement or vibration. These four elements are there whenever you focus your mind on the touching sensation. So the object is absolute reality. What can we call it Â— samatha or vipassana meditation? It is vipassana.</strong></em><em><br><br>That is what the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw wrote about the distinction between the samatha and vipassana aspects of respiration meditation. I appreciate it very much. So then we can say respiration meditation is vipassana meditation in accordance with the Mahasatipatthana Sutta. We can also say that respiration meditation is samatha in accordance with the Visuddhimagga. It is very subtle and profound to differentiate between these two aspects of respiration meditation, but I think those who have practised meditation very well can differentiate between these two aspects.</em></p>

              <p>Also the Buddha gave assurance that breathing meditation (vipassana) leads to enlightenment and Nirvana:</p>

              <p>Thanks AEN. I remembered  the 3 days meditation course was organised by NUS Buddhist Society. I do not know it belongs to which tradition. Back then, I was not a practicing Buddhist yet, I learned meditation because I had serious insomnia and meditation helped me to sleep and I was cured quite some time ago and I stopped. I practice concentrating on the in and out of breathing.</p>
              <p>Now, I wish to pick up meditation again to curb my emotion as I am easily influence by what is happening around me. I have heard of meditation which concentrates on picture of Buddha or being compassionate while meditating (someone told me about compassion during meditating which I do not understand what she meant) which I assume is of higher stage than concentrating on breathing, is it so ?</p>

              <p>The images are most probably from the subconscious mind put into image-form.</p>
              <p>For meditation, it is better not to be bothered with them. Actually, it is not so ideal to tell a person what will happen and will be experienced... so i think i should not say too much here.</p>
              <p>I once had a Western Teacher (not from Buddhist Tradition) who taught me how to see and read those images in the meditation. I don't do those meditation now.</p>
              <p>Also, the concentrating on breathe method should not be underestimated. It can lead unto the first glimpse of pure awareness.</p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing. I was also told not to bother about those images during the meditation course. However, I was curious because some images appeared again and again. Some images appeared so suddenly during meditation that I was taken aback. Anyway, by knowing them does not help me, so be it.</p>

              <p>Accessing visions, subconscious impressions can happen quite easily for some people when they let go to a certain level. Best to just ignore them and continue being aware of the breathing.</p>
              <p>Anyway here's a good article on mindfulness practice, try to practice this on your breathing, and then extend it in daily lives as well. <a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe13.html">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe13.html</a></p>

              <p>Recollecting virtues of Buddha / focusing image of Buddha are one types of meditation that can help building one's foundation when they practise samatha and insight meditation.This method however will not directly lead to jhana stage.</p>
              <p>Usually one ignore whatever arise, include these images and just come back to the breathing..... Then you will slowly progress when you have stabilise your concentration correctly.</p>
              <p>Best to seek a teacher who can guide you well.</p>
