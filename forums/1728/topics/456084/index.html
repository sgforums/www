              <p>Künzang Gongpa Zangthal (<em>kun bzang dgongs pa zang thal</em>) 
                  is the highest Dzogchen teachings of the Northern Treasures tradition. 
                  Gongpa Zangthal is in five volumes and was concealed by Guru Rinpoche 
                  and later revealed by Rigzin Gödem (1337-1408), the master who founded 
                  the Jangter (Northern Trasures) tradition of the Nyingma school. Künzang
                   Gongpa Zangthal meaning 'Showing Directly the Realization of 
                  Samantabhadra' also contains the renowned 'Aspiration of Samantabhadra.'
                   Often referred to as Gongpa Zangthal (Unimpeded Realization), these 
                  teachings are said to be the heart teachings of Guru Padmasambhava. 
                  Gongpa Zangthal is renowned as one of the most sublime works on Dzogpa 
                  Chenpo among Padmasambhava’s vast body of teachings. Dudjom Rinpoche 
                  wrote in his History of the Nyingma School that the Northern Treasures 
                  were bestowed to help the king and his descendents but they subsequently
                   served all Tibetans like a faithful minister.</p>
              <p>The three foremost tertöns (treasure revealers) of Tibet 
                  who were the supreme body, speech and mind emanations of Guru Rinpoche 
                  himself were Nyang Rel Nyima Özer (body emanation), Guru Chökyi Wangchuk
                   (speech emanation) and Rigzin Gödem (mind emanation). The treasures 
                  discovered by Nyang Rel Nyima Özer and Guru Chöwang and the lineages 
                  that arose from them came to be known as Lhoter or the Southern 
                  Treasures since they were discovered south of the Tsangpo river. The 
                  treasures discovered by Rigzin Gödem and the lineage that arose from 
                  them are called Jangter or the Northern Treasures since they were 
                  discovered north of the Tsangpo river.</p>
              <p>Rigzin Gödem was the re-incarnation of Nanam Dorje Düdjom, one of 
                  the closest disciples of Padmasambhava. He was born in 1337 in a family 
                  renowned for holding profound Vajrakilaya transmissions.  In accordance 
                  with a prophecy, when he was young five protuberances looking like 
                  vulture feathers grew on his head. He thus became famous as Rigzin 
                  Gödem—the Vidyadhara with Vulture feathers on his head. Before departing
                   Tibet, Padmasambhava placed a number of texts and various sacred 
                  objects in a maroon leather casket and concealed them in a cave called 
                  Zangzang Lhadrak.  These were the Northern treasures. In 1366, 
                  Vidyadhara Gödem took the casket out of the cave of Zangzang Lhadrak.  
                  The casket had five containers made of various precious materials and 
                  each one in a different color.  These five containers with their 
                  contents later became known within the lineage as the Dzö Nga (<em>mdzod lnga</em>)
                   or Five Treasuries.  The central container was deep red and of leather.
                    The eastern container was white and made of conch shell.  The southern
                   container was golden and made of gold.  The western container was red 
                  and of copper.  The northern container was black and made of iron.  
                  These texts covered a great variety of topics: prayers such as Le'u 
                  Dünma (Prayer in Seven Chapters), sadhanas such as Jangter Kagyed, 
                  rituals, Dzogchen instructions and so on. Vidyadhara Gödem decoded the 
                  texts, had them transcribed, and then transmitted them to worthy 
                  students. Soon the teachings of the Northern Treasures spread to all 
                  regions of Tibet.</p>
              <p>The most remarkable feature of the Northern Treasures 
                  transmissions, the most famous and the most highly praised, is its 
                  Dzogchen section. It is within this section that the great collection of
                   Dzogchen instructions known as Künzang Gongpa Zangthal is found. It is a
                   complete system of teachings covering all aspects of Mahasandhi, from 
                  the first introductory levels to the highest secret instructions of 
                  thögal. Praised by many masters for its profundity and clarity, it has 
                  been the source of the highest realization for countless practitioners. 
                  It is in fact considered as one of the three supreme transmissions of 
                  Dzogchen, together with Nyingthig Yabzhi of Longchenpa and Ati Zabdön 
                  Nyingpo of Terdag Lingpa. It is said that the bare fact of receiving the
                   empowerment of Künzang Gongpa Zhangthal closes forever the door to the 
                  lower states of existence and is the unerring source of boundless 
                  benefit.</p>
              <p>The third incarnation of Rigzin Gödem, Ngagi Wangpo (1580-1639), 
                  established the great Monastery of Dorje Drak in Central Tibet, which 
                  quickly became renowned as one of the most important centers of study 
                  and practice of the Nyingma School. This Dorje Drak tradition of the 
                  Northern Treasures has been transmitted uninterruptedly up to the 
                  present day and today Kyabje Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche is its most 
                  revered lineage holder and one of the senior most living masters within 
                  the Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism. Kyabje Rinpoche bestowed the 
                  entire Kama transmissions (Oral Transmissions Lineage) in the 
                  Mindrolling Monastery to a vast assembly in 1997. <a href="http://lotusgardens.org/kunzanggongpazangthal/photoessay/Biography-KyabjeTsetrulRinpoche.cfm">Kyabje Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche</a> then transmitted the entire Rinchen Terdzöd to thousands of tulkus, 
                  khenpos, monks, nuns and practitioners in 2008-2009. It was an historic 
                  and most marvelous event benefitting countless sentient beings. We hope 
                  and pray that the Künzang Gongpa Zangthal transmissions will also bring 
                  similar blessings and benefit to the entire Buddhist world.</p>
