              <p>hi Aen,</p>
              <p>i need help regarding the koan/pointer ' before birth who am i'.</p>
              <p>what does this really means? though the actual practice (of following where the pointer is pointing to) is non-conceptual,i still couldn't comprehend how to follow the direction of it.</p>
              <p>is practising this koan means focussing in a direct/non-intellectual way on the ' when is the beginning point of my awareness/tracing one's awareness to the point when it 'is not'/b4 it's existence?</p>
              <p>pls elaborate</p>

              <p>As you stated yourself, those are assumptions. And assumptions are always prone to doubt.</p>
              <p>What you are trying to find out is an irrefutible fact <strong>not dependent on analysis, inference, or assumptions.

              <p>1 . <em>Who am I ?</em></p>
              <p>The gross body which is composed of the seven humours (dhatus), I am not;
                  the five cognitive sense organs, viz. the senses of hearing, touch, sight,
                  taste, and smell, which apprehend their respective objects, viz. sound, touch,
                  colour, taste, and odour, I am not; the five cognitive sense-organs, viz. the
                  organs of speech, locomotion, grasping, excretion, and procreation, which have
                  as their respective functions speaking, moving, grasping, excreting, and enjoying,
                  I am not; the five vital airs, prana, etc., which perform respectively the
                  five functions of in-breathing, etc., I am not; even the mind which thinks,
                  I am not; the nescience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions
                  of objects, and in which there are no objects and no functioning's, I am not.</p>
              <p>2. <em>If I am none of these, then who am I?</em></p>
              <p>After negating all of the above-mentioned as 'not this', 'not this', that
                  Awareness which alone remains - that I am.</p>
              <p>3. <em>What is the nature of Awareness?</em></p>
              <p><span class="left">The nature of Awareness is existence-consciousness-bliss</span></p>

              <p>It is just a vision... to discover your true nature, drop all thinking, imagination, analysis and ask yourself: Before birth, Who am I?</p>

              <p>i assumed 'before birth' means before physical bodily birth(when
                              consciousness hasn't manifested) .... and based on this
                              assumption,the practice means trying to 'imagine'/comprehend what
                              it feels when the i am(awareness) being born/manifested frm out of
                              nothing(i.e b4 birth).</p>
              <p>but isn't awareness is always present also an assumption?when im
                              busy in the distractions of daily life -work etc ... im not
                              always 'aware of awareness',and isn't this evident of lack of
                              presence of awareness?</p>

              <p>Here's a hint: before birth also means 'before imagination' since anything imaginable is 'after birth'. You can never figure it out in your mind... so give up that attempt and look into what you are before birth. You will discover it is an undeniable fact of Being that has nothing to do with imagination and 'figuring it out'. It is what undeniably IS, not what you think/imagine it is/should be based on inference and learned knowledge of what 'before birth' should be.</p>
              <p>Also, the fact that you know you were distracted means awareness is present in the distraction, otherwise you will never know it.</p>

              <h1>The Quest</h1>
              <p>The quest for enlightenment is the quest for truth or reality. It’s not a quest for ideas about truth—that’s philosophy. And it’s not a quest to realize your fantasies about truth—that’s fundamentalized religion. It’s a quest for truth on truth’s terms. It’s a quest for the underlying principle of life, the unifying element of existence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In your quiet moments of honesty, you know that you are not who you present yourself as, or who you pretend to be. Although you have changed identities many times, and changed them even in the course of a single day, none of them fit for long. They are all in a process of constant decay. One moment you’re a loving person, the next an angry one. One day you’re an indulgent, worldly person; the next a pure, spiritual lover of God. One moment you love your image of yourself, and the next you loathe it. On it goes, identified with one self-image after another, each as separate and false as the last.</p>
