            <div class='col-md body'>Liao-fan's Four Lessons is indeed a good and interesting read, unfortunately I have only read one section of it... I would find time to finish reading it. Highly recommended <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> BTW, 'fate' in Liao Fan's Four Lessons simply means Karmic effect. Everything, good or bad that happens to you in your life... can be said a karmic result due to a karmic seed you have planted in the past... and if the person is a good person (this life) and yet he still has a bad life, that has to do with his past life.<br><br>Definitely, men can change their destiny... but it is only by inner transformation that can bring out 'outer' transformation. And this is what Buddhism teaches. It is by applying Buddhist wisdom that we can truly change our lives. As for knowing how previous life is about, there is a saying "To know your previous life, see what is happening to you in this life. To know your future lives, see what you are doing with this life."<br><br>Regarding remembering previous lives, I believe it is not necessary for transforming your current life, but as long as you practise one day you will eventually remember your previous lives as many people I know have done that. What is most important is to practise well.</div>

In Buddhism, they know the conditions only. They don't have the seeds. What's the seeds? It's giving. You don't plant fu tian(field of merits) how to harvest fruitions?<br><br>Money got 2 kinds. One's physical, one is mental. Using money makes you happy. That happiness is mental money. Everytime u suffer hardship, you are actually cultivating mental money.  Training to be more strong in the mind. Ppl nowaday are too pamper. hence a little bit hardship, they cannot take. So it's good to train the mind.<br><br>/\<br></div>

Because you are not ignorant! Attachments/anger are rooted in ignorance. Good work... if you can take refuge in three treasures and become a Buddhist, cultivate everyday in the midst of our lives... we will still meet many things, good or bad, but gradually find that we are easily 'liberated' from them. This are small liberations... eventually we will reach Great Liberation/Enlightenment.</div>
