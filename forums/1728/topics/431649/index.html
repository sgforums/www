              <p>When
               you meditate it seems as though a lot of experiences arise. You see 
              this, you see that, and it seems to pass into and out of awareness, each
               experience followed by another.<br><br>And yet as meditation deepens, 
              the ability to clearly see 'things' or experiences fades away. This 
              isn't because your awareness is getting duller or you are losing your 
              ability to retain any clarity in meditation. On the contrary, it 
              actually happens as awareness and clarity deepen.<br><br>As your 
              meditation deepens you find that what formerly appeared as substantial 
              now no longer has such a distinct and demarcated identity. You 
              increasingly find it hard to see exactly where 'something' is, or where 
              it isn't.<br><br>There seems little doubt that something is occurring, 
              that something is arising. Yet you cannot in any way point to it, and 
              say 'this is this' or 'that is that'. <br><br>Do things arise? I really have no idea.<br><br>Do they cease? I don't know.<br><br>Do they appear to arise - it would seem so. Where are they, or where were they - I have no idea. And so it goes.<br><br>Such
               definites as 'it does exist' fade away. They simply don't hold. And 
              equally their negation - it doesn't exist' don't apply to what you 
              experience, what you know - at all.<br><br>Mind is as it is. Experience is as it is. And there's little that one can say about it.</p>

              <div class="post-header"></div>
              <blockquote>The wisdom dakini known as Nigupta, illustrious Narotapa's 
              sister, was a self-manifest yogini, a powerful lord bodhisattva on 
              awakening's tenth stage, who received direct instruction from Conqueror 
              Vajra Bearer. She sang these vajra verses of self-liberating Great Seal:<br><br>Nature of mind,<br>Wish-fulfilling jewel, to you I bow.<br><br>Wishing to attain perfect enlightenment,<br>Visualize your body clearly as the deity<br>To purify ordinary thoughts.<br>Develop a noble intention to help others<br>And pure devotion to your spiritual master.<br><br>Don't dwell on your spiritual master or the deity.<br>Don't bring anything to mind,<br>Be it real or imagined.<br>Rest uncontrived in the innate state.<br><br>Your own mind, uncontrived, is the body of ultimate enlightenment.<br>To remain undistracted within this is meditation's essential point.<br>Realize the great, boundless, expansive state.<br><br>Myriad thoughts of anger and desire<br>Propel you within the seas of existence.<br>Take the sharp sword of the unborn state<br>And cut through them to their lack of intrinsic nature.<br>When you cut a tree's root,<br>Its branches won't grow.<br><br>On a bright ocean,<br>Bubbles emerge then dissolve back into the water.<br>Likewise, thoughts are nothing but the nature of reality:<br>Don't regard them as faults. Relax.<br><br>When you have no clinging to what appears, what arises,<br>It frees itself within its own ground.<br><br>Appearances, sound, and phenomena are your own mind.<br>There are no phenomena apart from mind.<br>Mind is free from birth, cessation,<br>And formulation.<br><br>Those who know mind's nature<br>Enjoy the five senses' pleasures<br>But do not stray from the nature of reality.<br>On an island of gold,<br>You search in vain for earth and stones.<br><br>In the equanimity of the great absolute expanse,<br>There is no acceptance or rejection,<br>No states of meditation or postmeditation.<br><br>When you actualize that state,<br>It is spontaneously present,<br>Fulfilling beings' hopes<br>Like a wish-fulfilling jewel.<br><br>Persons of highest, middle and common levels of capability<br>Should learn this in stages suitable to their understanding.</blockquote>

               preliminary instructions, of maintaining vajra pride, bodhicitta and 
              guru devotion, Niguma's beautiful verses teach how to realise ordinary 
              mind through mahamudra, through the non-meditation, and the 
              self-liberation of all experiences.<br></p>
              <blockquote>Don't dwell on your spiritual master or the deity.<br>Don't bring anything to mind,<br>Be it real or imagined.<br>Rest contrived in the innate state.</blockquote>
              <p><br>There's
               no need to alter your mind in any way, to bring anything in particular 
              or special to mind. You can recognise how mind or experience is, how it 
              truly is, and how it appears, at any time, with any particular thought 
              or appearance present, or none at all.<br></p>
              <blockquote>Your own mind, uncontrived, is the body of ultimate enlightenment.<br>To remain undistracted within this is meditation's essential point.<br>Realize the great, boundless, expansive state.</blockquote>
              <p><br>Experience,
               just as it is, at any time, *is* the Dharmakaya. It is empty, it cannot
               be found. When I'm aware and rest in that awareness in how experience 
              is, it's clear it isn't anything. It isn't anywhere. It isn't anything 
              that a concept can tie up or encapsulate. Knowing mind's nature, mind is
               ungraspable and indescribable. This groundlessness *is* what the notion
               of Dharmakaya points to. <br><br>It's relatively easy to know this, to 
              experience this. But to rest in that knowing - *that* is much, much 
              harder to do. To remain undistracted in this resting, without falling 
              off into conceptual thought, or losing that groundlessness that one is 
              resting in .... like balancing on the tip of a needle, for one of 
              limited capacity as myself. It's also easy to get lost in 
              'understanding' this, rather than knowing it .... but what is the 
              relation between understanding concepts and direct experience?<br><br>Just
               as it's impossible to say where experience is, where mind is, just so 
              is it impossible to say that it's limited in any way. Experience appears
               to be boundless, without circumference, without limits. Empty, open and
               full is experience.<br></p>
              <blockquote>Myriad thoughts of anger and desire<br>Propel you within the seas of existence.<br>Take the sharp sword of the unborn state<br>And cut through them to their lack of intrinsic nature.<br>When you cut a tree's root,<br>Its branches won't grow.<br></blockquote>
              <p><br>The
               disturbing emotions create the six realms of existence for us. As they 
              arise, so too does the corresponding realm, and so too do we appear to 
              inhabit that realm, that aspect of samsaric conditioned existence, 
              without either knowing or freedom.<br><br>As such as anger or desire 
              arises, it's easy to lose knowing, to lose our resting in the knowing of
               the groundless, empty nature of experience, and to get sucked up into 
              'believing' in the solidity, the facticity, the reality of the emotion 
              that arises. As we lose that knowing, then we get lost in a world of 
              seemingly solidity that pushes and pulls away at us, driving us on and 
              on, and giving rise to a sense of 'me' as well as 'other' or 'things'. 
              These arise simultaneously with the loss of resting in knowing 
              emptiness. As Niguma says, we are propelled on ... a lovely choice of 
              word which describes so well how we are as if a runaway train, without 
              little ability to either steer or stop our course.<br><br>Yet as we come
               to knowing, as we realise our error, and being groundlessness back into
               view, that simple recollection cuts all the roots of this delusion, and
               the six realms dissolve from whence they came .. like dreams they melt 
              away in an instance. In meditation or postmeditation, when you rest in 
              minds nature, it's almost impossible to imagine how disturbing emotions 
              could ever arise again, or how you could ever ride the runaway train of 
              samsaric realms again. (and yet you do, time and time again!).<br></p>
              <blockquote>On a bright ocean,<br>Bubbles emerge then dissolve back into the water.<br>Likewise, thoughts are nothing but the nature of reality:<br>Don't regard them as faults. Relax.</blockquote>
              <p><br>How
               strongly I tried to get away from thoughts in my early days of 
              meditation, and attempt to quieten the mind through subduing this enemy!
               Myriad ways of working with thoughts, each more subtle than the last, 
              but each with the same end in mind - to get rid of thoughts from my 
              mind, and instill clarity, peacefulness and stillness.<br><br>It's funny
               that, how pushing a cork down into the water results in? ... results in
               the cork shooting up out of the waters surface ... reacting to the 
              effort, and triggering a new cycle of activity.<br><br>Regarding 
              thoughts as in any way problematic, or to be removed is 
              counterproductive. Thoughts are just what they are, seeming arisings in 
              mind, seeming appearances in experience. When aware of thoughts, what is
               known? They are empty in nature - you can't find a thought, you can't 
              hold it, you can't pin it down. It comes from where? .. we can't say ...
               they go to where? we can't say. And whilst seeming there ... are they 
              there? ... we can't say. Ungraspable and unfathomable are thoughts.<br><br>So
               thoughts reveal the nature of experience, when knowing is directed 
              there. Just like anything else, their nature is the same. Not different 
              from a still mind, not different from an 'enlightened' mind, not 
              different from any other experience at all. Thoughts are empty. Know 
              them, and you will not find them. Bizarre but true - the more clearly 
              you know, the less that's there to actually know!<br><br>Why on earth would you want to get rid of them, when they are precisely what you are looking for?<br><br>One
               of the most direct ways I can know the nature of mind is to cause a 
              thought to arise, and 'see' whether the nature of experience changes 
              before, during or after the thought is there. Or to see where it comes 
              from, abides at, and goes to. Etc. Resting in the response to those 
              allows me to know that mind/experience doesn't change in nature whether 
              thought is present or not. Empty, and groundless.<br><br>Of course, our 
              habitual patterns tend toward grasping onto ideas. Many of us find them 
              particularly alluring, and we buy into them as if they were 'fact', 
              rather than thought. Then we get lost. But as we practice the entrancing
               quality of thoughts lessens, and we can more easily know them as just 
              what they are, just another seeming appearance in mind.<br><br>As we 
              come to know the nature of thoughts, we can ask "what is going on at the
               story level" ... and rest in the gap or response that arises. Knowing 
              thoughts in this way, we see them as no other than mind's nature, as 
              empty arisings.<br><br>As we because less fearful of thoughts through no
               longer seeing them as the enemy of meditation, we can relax, and rest 
              in what is, whatever is, and know if for what it is.<br></p>
              <blockquote>When you have no clinging to what appears, what arises,<br>It frees itself within its own ground.</blockquote>
              <p><br>Without
               clinging to what arises, without pushing or pulling at it (with desire 
              or ill-will), without attempting to apply any antidote to it, just 
              allowing it to be, and resting in the knowing, thoughts naturally 
              self-liberate, they are empty in nature, and mind remains empty 
              throughout.<br></p>
              <blockquote>Appearances, sound, and phenomena are your own mind.<br>There are no phenomena apart from mind.<br>Mind is free from birth, cessation,<br>And formulation.</blockquote>
              <p><br>When
               an appearance arises, such as a sound, we can ask "where is this 
              thought"? The knowing that arises in the resting after this question 
              reveals the same answer as when we ask "where is mind"? Nowhere and yet 
              everywhere.<br><br>I can't find a difference when knowing mind and 
              knowing thought. I can't find a difference when knowing 'awareness' and 
              knowing 'what it is that awareness holds'. When I ask "what is this"? 
              ..... and direct knowing towards awareness itself ..... that is, when I 
              know 'mind' in Niguma's teaching .... and also when I ask "what is known
               by awareness?" when I direct awareness towards whatever seems to be 
              known or held by awareness ... I can't find anything that would allow me
               to say 'these are different.<br><br>There's different flavours to 
              directing one's attention to awareness or to what seems to arise in 
              awareness .... they seem to appeal to me at different times, and keep 
              practice fresh. But when I know either .... inseparable is the only way I
               can describe what is revealed.<br><br>When I rest in experience, it's 
              clear that experience is what there is. No phenomena are known to mind 
              beyond itself. There's nothing out there, and there's nothing in here. 
              There's nothing other than the endless unfolding of experience, nothing 
              other than mind itself. It's not saying that nothing exists outside of 
              'my' mind. It's simply that I know nothing of anything other than 
              experience. How could I? Nothing I know is untouched by awareness. 
              Nothing is known 'before' it touches experience or awareness or mind. 
              There is nothing beyond experience that can be known. The great 
              completeness. Innocence <br><br>When "where do appearances (of sight, 
              sound, pressure, etc) arise from"? And where do they go to? Where are 
              they when they are arisen? Do these 'things' actually happen at all? 
              Mind's nature remains the same, and untouched by all of this seeming 
              display. Not a jot more, or less, better or worse is the nature of 
              experience, regardless of whatever seems to arise.<br></p>

              <p>Yes, indeed emptiness is the freedom from all extreme views like existence and non-existence. Emptiness does not deny five skandhas, the reality as we observe it, as insight into anatta reveals all transient phenomena to be pristine awareness itself and thus utterly vivid, intimate, actual and seemingly real. But the further realisation of emptiness shows how all phenomena are void of inherent existence in and of itself, independent of conditions. There is the insight into how the entire experiential universe, the five skandhas as we experience it - is empty, void, coreless, substanceless - that it is like the magician's magic tricks, a magical apparition that is substanceless behind its appearance. being a magical luminous display that cannot be pinned down or located, it far transcends view of existence, nonexistence, birth, abiding, and death. the unborn nature of dharmas is realised.</p>
              <p>i wrote an email to thusness titled "the unborn dharma":</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In attempting to find and locate where thought comes from, reside, and go to, it is realised that thought is ungraspable, unfindable, unfathomable... A magicians magical apparition, like everything (the experiential universe) is... A wonderful display of luminous emptiness, dependent origination. Yet after this is seen, it is nothing resembling nihilism or non-existence... When someone lights up his lighter to burn an innocent ant, compassion just arise... A magical universe demands magical response and compassion from no one to no one</p>

              <p><br>:) yes, non-dual, almost there. still got one more level of no wandering thoughts. as still got this wandering thought of non-dual or middle way. :) it's also no "neither nihilism nor eternalism". that's true emptiness. Impermanent <em>is</em> permanent.</p>
              <p>Heart sutra:- Form <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IS</span> emptiness. Emptiness <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IS</span> form. Form doesn't negate emptiness. Emptiness doesn't negate form.</p>
              <p>"eternalism is nihilism, nihilism is eternalism. eternalism doesn't negate nihilism, nihilism doesn't negate eternalism. "</p>

              <p>all depends on conditions. <strong>ç¼˜èµ·æ€§ç©º.</strong> best in Mahayana to <em><strong>round</strong></em> things up.</p>
              <p>freedom from all extreme views is right. then one will go and <em>grasp</em> that extreme views is wrong? yet freedom from all extreme views also include "sticking" to "extreme views" in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">certain</span> situation to help break attachment of some sentient beings. but in truth, one is not really attached to that extreme, it's just pretending. and that's true freedom from all extreme views. :)</p>

              <p>there is one quote i like very much that i read before but it didnt made sense to me until i re read it yesterday:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lankavatara Sutra:</p>
              <p>Mahamati: How did the Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas abandon the view of an absolute arising, dwelling, or dissolving?</p>
              <p>[Buddha]: They abandoned it in this manner. They cognized that all phenomena are like an ephemeral illusion and dream, that they are detached from the duality of self and others, and that they are therefore unborn [emptiness.] They focused on the mind's manifestations and cognized external reality as unreal. By perceiving the unreality of phenomena, they brought about the cessation of the outflowing sensory consciousness. Because they cognized the unreality of their psychosomatic aggregates and the interacting conditions of the three planes of cosmic existence as originating from their deluded mind, they saw external and internal phenomena as devoid of any inherent nature and as transcending all concepts. Having abandoned the view of an absolute arising [of phenomena,] they realized the illusory nature and thereby attained insight into the unborn Dharma [expanse of emptiness.]</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes indeed. Want to add something about the extremes of existence and nonexistence....  The world is vividly apparent - sights, sounds, smells, a vivid luminous display. Yet is there truly an 'it' there, truly a 'tree' or a 'flower' out there... In examining those appaearances, no 'itness' can be pinned down, found, or located anywhere. Its nature is emptiness, is its unfindability, ungraspability and unfathomability. Since no 'it' can be found, how can we make the extreme statements of 'it exists' or 'it doesn't exist' when we don't even know what 'it' is? If no 'it' can be pinned down to begin with? How can we say 'flower exist' or 'flower don't exist' when we cannot even find the flowerness of flower? Realising emptiness thereby transcends all extremes.</div>
