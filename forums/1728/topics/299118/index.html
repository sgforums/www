All these assumes that there is an entity or objective reality out there that can exist, not exist, both, or neither. But this dualistic worldview is fundamentally delusional.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(BTW, the sound you are thinking of is produced when the vibrations hit the eardrums, producing what you then perceive as 'sound', which is the inseperability of hearing/sound.)</span><br><br>So: emptiness (the nature of reality) is empty of four extremes: existence, non-existence, both existence and non-existence, neither existence nor non-existence.<br><br>When reality is seen as it is -- it is seen to be non-dual, there being no perceiving subject (experiencer, doer, thinker, etc, i.e. a separate self/agent) separated from an objective world out there (something 'out there' that exists), i.e. the assumption that the 'objective world' and the 'sound of the explosions' truly have inherent existence.<br><br><strong>So the problem with seeing in a dualistic perspective is that one thinks that there is a 'perceiver' in here, of 'sounds of exploding' out there, -- whereas in reality there is only the act/arising of sounds of exploding which is inseperability of hearing/sound. In hearing sound, it is simply sound heard. No sound out there, no hearer in here. As a Zen Master became enlightened and said,<br><br>Â“When I heard the sound of<br>the bell ringing, there was no I,<br>and no bell, just the ringing.Â”<br><br>And why do sound arise? When causes and conditions meet, sound arises. All are dependent arising, all are conditions. The universe 'gives its best' for this moment of arising to arise.</strong><br><br>Whatever dualistic concepts we use cannot describe its ultimate nature, even though it is relatively useful. But we must not be confused by them.<br><br>I wrote this in another forum two weeks ago:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emptiness does not deny that appearances continue to arise vividly therefore it is definitely not 'nothingness' or 'voidness'. However, Emptiness denies any imputation of inherently existing attributes, objective reality to what is seen and felt. For example, there is no flower that is inherently red, because a human sees red, a dog sees black and white, a reptile may see something else, etc. 'Redness' has no objective reality 'out there'... they arise due to Conditions, as Dependent Arising, and are mere Appearances. That is why it is called 'empty'.</span><br><br>In fact, there is no objective reality of a 'flower' at all... in modern science it's said reality is 99.99999% space. If somehow Buddha grant you quantum glasses all you will see is vast space and a few 'balls' moving about... then you might wonder where is this 'flower' that I thought existed? Yet whatever it is seen, it is empty and mere dependent arising. So whatever it is, it is no more real than the mirage of the moon in the water, or the flower in the mirror, merely dependent arising, conditions but no graspable objective reality.<br><br>Yet our sense organs produce a very vividly real image, appearance, of a seemingly existing 'flower'. And that is empty, too. So no states are purer than any others, all appearances are fundamentally unborn and pure. But we must not stress the aspect of emptiness and overlook that it is the luminous expression of our true nature. The sound of keyboard typing... texts appearing on the screen... not what words can describe. And what is that? Conditions. Dependent arising. And which is our pristine awareness. Reality is just this entire luminous display/appearance arising spontaneously moment to moment. As real as it can be... and gone.</strong><br><br>p.s.. someone in another forum who had true experiences of what he's talking about wrote this... do contemplate --<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">....seeing colour<br>hearing sound<br>feeling feelings<br>smelling odours<br>tasting flavours<br>knowing/number/form/meaning<br><br>is instantaneous... is any 'gap' perceived between the 'event' and the perception of it...<br><br>any 'gap' is purely 'conceptual'...<br><br>seeing colours as simply 'colours seen'...<br>and hearing sounds as simply 'sounds heard'...<br>(and so for each of the senses and sensations)...<br>and knowing concepts as simply 'concepts known'...<br><br>this is like looking at a film and noticing the coloured patterns on the screen as simply 'coloured patterns'... without giving the images any meaning...<br><br>and knowing that the meaning attached to the images is purely conceptual... there are no 'people' or 'things' on the screen... it is just a play of light...<br><br>while the images are seen as being meaningfull themselves... it appears very difficult to see through the illusion...<br><br>but it is not difficult... it only appears to be difficult...

This moment must completely ceased<br>and serves as the CAUSE for the next moment to arise.<br>Therefore Self is a process of series Self1, Self2, Self3, Self4, Self5, Self6...etc<br>A fixed entity 'Self' does not exist, what really exists is a momentary Self.<br>Under deep meditation, one is able to observe and sense the karmic and mental factors from moment to moment,<br>it is these factors that are succeeded from moment to moment and life and life but not a fixed entity.<br>When the karmic and mental factors subsides, it is known as "The True and Only (and Inherently egoless) Conscious Light (Itself)".<br><br>- Thusness</span><br><br>Knowing this, existence is <strong>NOT</strong> fleeting. Why? Because there is no 'you' experiencing change, there is no 'you' that experiences time or 'fleeting time', and there is no 'you' that is born and die -- Birth arises -- only the act of birth, Death arises -- only the act of death, they are distinct, and there is no fixed self that is the perceiver of birth and death, there is no fixed self that is the SUBJECT of birth and death. No 'one' is born nor dies. Birth perceives itself, death perceives itself.<br><br>This is what Zen Master Dogen said in relation to Being-time, birth, and death -- in that now birth is no-birth because no ego-self is ever born: if no "I" is ever born then there is only the act of birth, but if there is only the act of birth then there is really no birth. Realising this, <strong>birth and death is Buddha Nature and Nirvana is none other than birth and death -- there is no "escape from", every arising appearance is already self-liberating in its own accord, only the correct insights are required.</strong><br><br>Dogen:<br><br><strong>Similarly, when human beings die, they cannot return to life; but in Buddhist teaching we never say life changes into death.... Likewise, death cannot change into life.... Life and death have absolute existence, like the relationship of winter and spring. But do not think of winter changing into spring or spring into summer.</strong></div>
