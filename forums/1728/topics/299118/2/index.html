Electromagnetic radiation is classified into types according to the frequency of the wave: these types include, in order of increasing frequency, radio waves, microwaves, terahertz radiation, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.<br><br>however... the 'light' itself is invisible... it is not possible to see 'light'... any more than it is possible to see 'radio waves'...<br><br>it is called Â‘the visible spectrumÂ’Â… or Â‘lightÂ’Â… simply because it results in a Â‘seeing responseÂ’ when incident on a healthy human eye connected to a healthy human brainÂ…<br><br>when the 'light energy' hits the 'retina' at the back of each eye... it ceases to be 'light'...<br><br>insteadÂ… it is 'absorbed' by 'chemicals' in the Â‘rodsÂ’ and Â‘conesÂ’ ('physical structures in the eye) and changed into a series of electro-chemical 'impulses'Â… the nature of these impulses depends upon the 'frequency' and 'intensity' of the light hitting the retina...<br><br>within the cones are three types of Â‘colour sensitive pigmentsÂ’Â… relating to Â‘redÂ’, Â‘greenÂ’ and Â‘blueÂ’Â… howeverÂ… these Â‘pigmentsÂ’ are not actual Â‘coloursÂ’Â… they are called by these names simply because each Â‘pigmentÂ’ responds to different wavelengths of light...<br><br>resulting in different 'electro-chemical impulses' inside the body... again... these 'impulses' are not 'colours'... they are just 'electro-chemical signals'...<br><br>these 'impulses' travel along the 'optic nerves' to the Â‘optic chasmÂ’ in the centre of the head, where the nerve fibres from the inside half of each retina cross to the other side of the brain, while the nerve fibres from the outside half of the retina stay on the same side of the brain...<br><br>once these Â‘electro-chemical signalsÂ’ reach the visual cortexÂ… they are said to be Â‘interpretedÂ’ as Â‘colourÂ’Â… but no 'scientist' knows what this meansÂ… or how it happensÂ…<br><br>the problem is not Â‘insufficient knowledge' (that will one day be rectified through further investigation)Â…<br><br>the problem is that Â‘seeing colourÂ’ cannot be reduced to anything elseÂ… it cannot be measured or quantifiedÂ… any Â‘quantitative descriptionÂ’ of Â‘colourÂ’Â… (in terms of Â‘light frequenciesÂ’ or Â‘pigmentsÂ’ or Â‘electro-chemical impulsesÂ’)Â… is not the Â‘experience of seeing colourÂ’Â…<br><br>like all sensationsÂ… Â‘coloursÂ’ can only be experiencedÂ…<br><br>according to scienceÂ… the first moment that Â‘actual coloursÂ’ appear (are experienced)Â… is in the Â‘visual cortexÂ’Â… not in the Â‘outside worldÂ’Â…<br><br>soÂ… what started out as Â‘invisible electro-magnetic radiationÂ’ reflected from the computer and emitted from the screenÂ… was changed into Â‘electro-chemical impulses' in the retinaÂ…<br><br>these impulses then flowed along the optic nerves and into the visual cortex Â…<br><br>to this point... there is no awareness at all of the whole processÂ… nor of any Â‘colourÂ’..<br><br>thenÂ… by some magicÂ… inside the visual cortexÂ… these 'impulses of electro-chemical energyÂ’ are suddenly changed into these apparent Â‘coloursÂ’Â…<br><br>even though, according to science... all that exists (in a 'real physical sense')... and all that is capable of 'scientific observation and measurement'... are the 'swirling atoms and electrons and energy fields' that make up the brain... all just following the 'laws of nature' in a 'mechanical' (though probabilistic) way...<br><br>it is only the 'subject' that can see colour directly...<br><br>the colours are not just seen as a 'patch of colours'... they are seen AS a Â‘computer screen with words from toombaru on it'...<br><br>nor is this image perceived as 'an image in my head'... instead... it is seen AS 'the actual computer in the Â‘outside worldÂ’Â… even though it is not...<br><br>all that is really seen is a 'coloured image'Â… having no substance or depthÂ… exactly the same as any Â‘dream imageÂ’Â…<br><br>according to science... this 'coloured image' appears onlyÂ… inside the visual cortexÂ… inside the headÂ…<br><br>the Â‘actual computer' remains Â‘unseenÂ’Â… outside the headÂ…<br><br>according to science... no 'colours' appear anywhere in the 'outside world'... the only place 'colours' appear is inside a 'healthy visual cortex'...<br><br>according to science... there is no Â‘little you' inside the headÂ… looking out along the optic nerves into the Â‘real worldÂ’Â… nor is there any 'little you' looking at a 'screen' (inside the visual cortex) that shows an image of the world Â‘outsideÂ’Â…<br><br>the image and the seeing of it are inseparableÂ…<br><br>in the moment it appears... 'you' are the image... and the seeing of it...<br><br>according to science... 'observer and observed are one'...<br><br>are we still together on this...?<br><br>Love<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>good... though as to the 'articulation'... that remains to be seen... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>all sensations are the same as colour... they are 'qualia'... irreducible... they cannot be verified by anyone but the 'subject'...<br><br>who... according to science... is the 'sensing/sensations' that arise in the instant....<br><br>together...<br><br>seeing inseparable from colour<br>hearing inseparable from sound<br>tasting inseparable from flavour<br>smelling inseparable from odour<br>feeling inseparable from feelings<br><br>is 'awareness'...<br><br>according to science... this 'witness witnessing' is a function of 'brain activity'... arising in a moment... and in a moment gone... as 'brain activity' is altered... in 'deep sleep' for example... or if the brain is damaged... or upon death of the brain...<br><br>is there anything missing from this description of 'awareness'... as proposed by science?<br><br>Love</div></blockquote></div>
