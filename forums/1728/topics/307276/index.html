              <p>I shall summarise all my doubts here:</p>
              <p>1.  I have posted this doubt as a separate post, so this is a just a re-cap. How should we interpret Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's vows not to achieve Buddhahood until hell is empty?</p>
              <p>1.1  Literally or figuratively? Is it a mere analogy, encouragment or reassurance of a superficial nature?</p>
              <p>1.2  Ksitgarbha Bodhisattvas has already gone through many countless aeons since he made that vow and started guiding and delivering sentient beings. <strong>So long that he could have attained Buddhahood long ago</strong>. This is mentioned clearly by Sakayamuni Buddha. [Most of us know Bodhisattvas need to go through at least <strong>3 great</strong> <span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><strong>asamkyeya kalpas (ä¸‰å¤§é˜¿åƒ§ç¥—åŠ«ï¼‰ </strong>to attain Buddhahood]</span></p>
              <p>Many Destruction eras had passed while the Bodhisattva is working hard on his cultivation and implementation of his vows. So this means there were countless periods where hells were destroyed in some worlds, but still existed in others. So hell beings in worlds experiencing the Destruction era would be reborn to suffer in the other worlds which do not have Destruction era yet. So hell in general had not once really been empty of suffering beings.</p>
              <p>Why particularly the 20th small kalpa of our present Destruction era for total and complete liberation to occur for all samsaric beings in all ten directions? </p>
              <p>Can I safely assume the vows cover all beings in all ten directions, from past, present and future?</p>
              <p>2. There are countless Bodhisattvas and Buddhas in all ten directions; each Bodhisattva and Buddhas can have countless manifestations and their vows to save sentient beings are essentially the same as Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, for compassion and wisdom is common for all of them.</p>
              <p>2.1 So why is Sakayamuni Buddha praising Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva so much? Why is he encouraging us to seek refuge in the Bodhisattva? (To recite his name, cultivate his virtues, etc) Other Bodhisattvas are just as well-qualified to help us, isn't it? For example, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (è§‚ä¸–éŸ³è�©è�¨).</p>
              <p>2.2 What have the other Bodhisattvas and Buddhas from all worlds and directions been doing during this period where Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is implementing his vows? Is it just to wait or to look at us suffer? Is it just to teach dharma to the Bodhisattvas, arahants and heavenly beings?</p>
              <p>If one Bodhisattva can have countless manifestations to teach countless beings in countless worlds in all ten directions from past/present/future, imagine what countless Bodhisattvas and Buddhas in all worlds and directions can do if they choose to appear in countless manifestations like Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva? Totally inconceivable! No sentient being would be lost, no sentient being would have to suffer for aeons in the 3 evil realms anymore.</p>
              <p>3. We have been taught in the sutra or teach others using the sutra to practise filial piety, to show eternal gratefulness and heartfelt appreciation towards our parents. But we have also been parents in our countless rebirths, and some of our children could be our parents now.</p>
              <p>3.1 If any of our children has attained enlightment, sainthood or even reborn as heavenly beings, they should/would have wanted very much to help us to be happy too. But yet we fall and fall for aeons without really having anyone compassionate and patient enough to guide us for countless lifetimes till we attained liberation like what Ksitigarbha or Sakayamuni Buddha does for everyone. Why? How can this happen?</p>
              <p>3.2 We often have to dedicate merits to all beings after doing any good deed, having good thoughts or reciting sutras, etc, and we are taught that our parents should be the first and main recipients of our merits. But is there any positive effect from our dedication?</p>
              <p>If my sons/daughers from previous lifetimes are now Buddhists, born in this Dharma-ending age and he/she dedicates merits to all parents from  countless lifetimes, then presumably all parents, including me should be able to receive the merit and benefit greatly from it. But do you feel anything? Do you see any change in you?</p>
              <p>As such I am very lost and doubtful as to what role does merit dedication (å›žå�‘) really play and what real benefits does it reap for all beings.</p>

              <p><strong>AEN:</strong></p>
              <p>Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's vows are not only real/literal but achievable. If it is not achievable then he wouldn't have phrased it that way.
                      Everyone's Buddha Nature is complete, everyone will attain Buddhahood
                      eventually, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva will also attain Buddhahood
                      eventually.</p>
              <p>If I'm not wrong, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's is working in this world system. In fact Sinweiy has said something like after Shakyamuni's dharma disappeared, and before Maitreya attains Buddhahood, in this period Ksitigarbha is our world's 'representative' of dharma, something like that.</p>
              <p>Hence, when the hell beings have become liberated in our world, Ksitigarbha attains Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>I think there are other Bodhisattvas like Ksitigarbha helping other world systems.</p>

              <p>Next is, every Bodhisattva will have their own vows. When they attain Buddhahood it is also different, due to their previous vows... like Amitabha vowed to make Sukhavati pure land, Shakyamuni vowed that his pure land is right here in samsara. They all have their own vows to help liberate sentient beings.</p>
              <p>Another point you must take note is, even if the Buddhas or
                      Bodhisattvas manifest to everyone, it is not going to be much help if
                      there is no 'yuan'... if you teach dharma to someone who doesn't have
                      'yuan', he won't listen or benefit.</p>

              <p>It certainly can help. But how do you know your children has become Buddhist and dedicate merits? These kind of things are difficult to know.</p>
              <p>You won't know if your children in past lives has become Buddhists and dedicate merits for you. How would you know? Unless you have psychic powers. But dedication of merits is real.</p>
              <p>Anyway as for your 3.1, you don't need children who have attained enlightenment to guide you... any enlightened beings if he has 'yuan' with you can help you, no need to be your children in recent lifetimes.</p>

              <p>Every bodhisattva vows to save all beings, so that is common. Remember the four unlimited mind (å››æ— é‡�å¿ƒï¼‰that is the basis for cultivating bodhicitta and atttaining Buddhahood.</p>

              <p>Does it mean that only Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva makes the vow to help all beings as a result of the suffering of his/her parents in previous lifetimes?</p>
              <p>What is 'yuan'? How you do establish 'yuan' with a sentient being? Why can't every Bodhisattva or Buddha establish 'yuan' with every sentient being?</p>
              <p>I remember Sakayamuni Buddha saying that those who recite or heard (with or without belief) the words "Namo Buddhaya" (but does not mention whether it applies to only those who have cultivated at all) will eventually be delivered by the future Maitreya Buddha.</p>
              <p>So can this mean that anyone who recites or has heard of the words "Namo Buddhaya" with or without any belief, will eventually form a 'yuan' with all Buddhas of past, present and future?</p>
              <p>I may not know if my children has become Buddhists and have started to dedicate merits, but I believe in possibilities that there are some who are not Buddhists exactly but believe in past lives, would remember fondly, would wish fondly for parents of past lifetimes to be free from suffering.</p>
              <p>I remember a story where an old woman went to see the Buddha and hugged him dearly. Venerable Ananda tried to stop, but the Buddha said it was ok. "This woman had been my mother during the past 500 lifetimes". The Buddha then continued to preach the dharmma to the old woman and she supposedly gained sainthood or something. I couldn't remember exactly.</p>
              <p>If there is a bond as close as this, it would be easier for any Bodhisattva or Buddha to approach any one of us as we would have been closely related and enjoyed close emotional bonds during past lifetimes.</p>
              <p>If my children are not Buddhists, but they could be heavenly beings. Surely they would care for their parents of previous lifetimes as they now have the ability to look at the past and future (but not as far as arahants, Bodhisattvas and Buddhas of course).</p>
              <p>People go to heaven mainly because they practise a high level of good deeds: The Five precepts are very well-maintained during their lifetimes and they do not get or stay angry easily, are not greedy or indulgent in unwholesome views. This is taught and revealed in the sutra of Ten wholesome deeds (ä½›è¯´å��å–„ä¸šé�“ç»�). One of them mentioned in many sutras is fillial piety.</p>
              <p>If fillial piety helps you to gain rebirth in the heavenly realm and that the degree to which you love and respect your parents allows you to gain certain heavenly luminance or powers greater than the rest, and when you use your divine powers to search for your parents of past and present, and you see them suffering, would you not do something for them?</p>
              <p>There are stories recorded in sutras that some heavenly beings upon their immediate rebirth into the heavenly being, come down to help their parents to overcome their grief or their stubborn evil ways.</p>
              <p>But that is only for some, not all heavenly beings do this though, and I wonder why.</p>

              <p>2.1 So why is Sakayamuni Buddha praising Ksitigarbha
              Bodhisattva so much? Why is he encouraging us to seek refuge in the
              Bodhisattva? (To recite his name, cultivate his virtues, etc) Other
              Bodhisattvas are just as well-qualified to help us, isn't it? For
              example, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (è§‚ä¸–éŸ³è�©è�¨).</p>
              <p>2.2 What have the other Bodhisattvas and Buddhas from
              all worlds and directions been doing during this period where
              Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is implementing his vows? Is it just to
              wait or to look at us suffer? Is it just to teach dharma to the
              Bodhisattvas, arahants and heavenly beings?</p>
              <p>If one Bodhisattva can have countless manifestations to teach
              countless beings in countless worlds in all ten directions from
              past/present/future, imagine what countless Bodhisattvas and
              Buddhas in all worlds and directions can do if they choose to
              appear in countless manifestations like Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva?
              Totally inconceivable! No sentient being would be lost, no sentient
              being would have to suffer for aeons in the 3 evil realms
              anymore.</p>
              <p>3. We have been taught in the sutra or teach others using the
              sutra to practise filial piety, to show eternal gratefulness and
              heartfelt appreciation towards our parents. But we have also
              been parents in our countless rebirths, and some of our children
              could be our parents now.</p>
              <p>3.1 If any of our children has attained enlightment, sainthood
              or even reborn as heavenly beings, they should/would have
              wanted very much to help us to be happy too. But yet we fall and
              fall for aeons without really having anyone compassionate and
              patient enough to guide us for countless lifetimes till we attained
              liberation like what Ksitigarbha or Sakayamuni Buddha does for
              everyone. Why? How can this happen?</p>
              <p>3.2 We often have to dedicate merits to all beings after doing
              any good deed, having good thoughts or reciting sutras, etc,
              and we are taught that our parents should be the
              first and main recipients of our merits. But is there any positive
              effect from our dedication?</p>
              <p>If my sons/daughers from previous lifetimes are
              now Buddhists, born in this Dharma-ending age and he/she
              dedicates merits to all parents from  countless
              lifetimes, then presumably all parents, including me should be able
              to receive the merit and benefit greatly from it. But do you feel
              anything? Do you see any change in you?</p>
              <p>As such I am very lost and doubtful as to what role does
              merit dedication (å›žå�‘) really play and what real benefits does
              it reap for all beings.</p>

              <p><br>The buddha and bodhisatva can appear right in front of us, but due to our negative karma, we can't see them. Even if we have the good karma and karmic affinity to see them, due to our ignorance, we may ignore them.<br>Imagine if buddha sakyamuni or guanyin bodhisatva appear as a human being in front of a evil person, the evil person may make bad speech that further increase his bad karma instead. To this kind of people, for their own sake, I'd rather not to tell him dharma though he was my past parents and children.<br><br>We can dedicate merit to all sentient beings, but the effect has a limit.<br>Likewise, all buddhas also give blessings to us. I don't know how many percent of the things that we have now is due to buddha's blessing. But seriously, we are fortunate enough to know dharma, without buddha, no matter how much merit you made you won't get to know dharma. But one can't just rely on them alone, if you don't accumulate enough merit, even if buddha or a bodhisatva live in the same town as you, your condition will make you not able to get to know him.</p>

              <p>Dear justdoit77, from what I understand, the only tough thing is to reborn as a human and be able to get the chance to hear the right form of Dhamma in one's lifetime.</p>
              <p>Going to heaven in that sense is not really easy cos you have to be a human at least to put the precepts into practice; you need five precepts plus no greed, no hatred/anger and no unwholesome views and all this has to be maintained till your last thought on your death bed before you can be reborn into a heavenly state. Or if you are born as an animal, some special behaviour has to be observed by you to gain rebirth into any heavenly realm.</p>
              <p>Pureland, it depends on which Pureland you are talking about. If you are talking about Maitreya Bodhisattva's Pureland at Tusita Heaven or Medicine's Buddha's Pureland, I agree with you that it is indeed hard, if not very hard for an average practitioner to get there.</p>
              <p>But for Amitabha Buddha's Pureland, all you need to do is recite his name wholeheartedly on your deathbed ten times or less, and you wish deeply to be reborn into his pureland, you will be received by the Buddha and his retinue of Bodhisattvas when you have breathed your last. But since many of us are still alive, many Masters practising Amitabha Buddha's name recitation tell us to recite the name out loud or silently in our hearts when we go about our daily activities which don't require analysing. Do this till your last breath, keep the wish to be reborn into Amitabha Buddha's Pureland strong and steadfast, and you will definitely be reborn into the extraordinary beautiful place with no suffering and not to mention, you are completely free from samsaric births and deaths ever since.</p>
              <p>No Buddha's vows of the past includes personally appearing to you and guiding you all the way to his Pureland upon death. Only Amitabha Buddha.</p>

              <p>The sutras are there - but without an enlightened person to guide you, you will not understand, and worse still you will misunderstand the teachings inside.</p>
              <p>It is also very important to have a teacher to teach you and guide you on proper practices. And when something goes wrong in your practice and you do not have a teacher, nobody is able to point it out to you.</p>
              <p>Also even if you understand the sutra theoretically but don't see your own nature, then it's useless. Sutras are only pointers to your true nature... and having a teacher to directly point out your true nature is important.</p>
              <p>You see, only someone who is enlightened to his true nature is able to comprehend what the sutra is talking about. Once he sees his own nature the entire essence of Tripitaka is within his grasp even if he did not study them. But other than that, you are only reading descriptions like the blind men touching the elephant and thinking what he felt is the entirety of the elephant. You need someone to point it out to you, someone who is enlightened.</p>

              <p><strong>To find a Buddha, you have to see your nature." Whoever sees his nature is a 
                                      Buddha. If you don’t see your nature, invoking Buddhas, reciting sutras, making 
                                      offerings, and keeping precepts are all useless. Invoking Buddhas results in good karma, reciting sutras results in a good memory; keeping precepts 
                                      results in a good rebirth, and making offerings results in future blessings-but 
                                      no buddha. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you don’t understand by yourself, you’ll have to find a teacher to 
                                      get to the bottom of life and death. But unless he sees his nature, such a 
                                      person isn’t a teacher. Even if he can recite the Twelvefold Canon he can’t 
                                      escape the Wheel of Birth and Death. He suffers in the three realms without hope 
                                      of release.</span> Long ago, the monk Good Star was able to recite the entire Canon. 
                                      But he didn’t escape the Wheel, because he didn’t see his nature. If this was 
                                      the case with Good Star, then people nowadays who recite a few sutras or 
                                      shastras and think it’s the Dharma are fools. Unless you see your mind, reciting 
                                      so much prose is useless.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>To find a Buddha all you have to do is see your nature. Your nature is the 
                                      Buddha. And the Buddha is the person who’s free: free of plans, free of cares. 
                                      If you don’t see your nature and run around all day looking somewhere else, 
                                      you’ll never find a buddha. The truth is there’s nothing to find. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But to reach 
                                      such an understanding you need a teacher and you need to struggle to make 
                                      yourself understand. </span>Life and death are important. Don’t suffer them in vain. </strong></p>
              <p>There’s no advantage in deceiving yourself. Even if you have mountains of 
                                      jewels and as many servants as there are grains of sand along the Ganges, you 
                                      see them when your eyes are open. But what about when your eyes are shut? You 
                                      should realize then that everything you see is like a dream or illusion.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you don’t find a teacher soon, you’ll live this life in vain. It’s true, 
                                      you have the buddha-nature. But the help of a teacher you’ll never know it. Only 
                                      one person in a million becomes enlightened without a teacher’s help.</span> If, 
                                      though, by the conjunction of conditions, someone understands what the Buddha 
                                      meant, that person doesn’t need a teacher. Such a person has a natural awareness 
                                      superior to anything taught. But unless you’re so blessed, study hard, and by 
                                      means of instruction you’ll understand.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>People who don’t understand and think they can do so without study are no 
                                      different from those deluded souls who can’t tell white from black." Falsely 
                                      proclaiming the Buddha-Dharma, such persons in fact blaspheme the Buddha and 
                                      subvert the Dharma. They preach as if they were bringing rain. But theirs is the 
                                      preaching of devils not of Buddhas. Their teacher is the King of Devils and 
                                      their disciples are the Devil’s minions. Deluded people who follow such 
                                      instruction unwittingly sink deeper in the Sea of Birth and Death. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unless they 
                                      see their nature, how can people call themselves Buddhas they’re liars who 
                                      deceive others into entering the realm of devils. Unless they see their nature, 
                                      their preaching of the Twelvefold Canon is nothing but the preaching of devils. 
                                      Their allegiance is to Mara, not to the Buddha. Unable to distinguish white from 
                                      black, how can they escape birth and death?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Whoever sees his nature is a Buddha; whoever doesn’t is a mortal. But if you 
                                      can find your buddha-nature apart from your mortal nature, where is it? Our 
                                      mortal nature is our Buddha nature. Beyond this nature there’s no Buddha. The 
                                      Buddha is our nature. There’s no Buddha besides this nature. And there’s no 
                                      nature besides the Buddha.</p>
              <p><em>But suppose I don’t see my nature, cant I still 
                                      attain enlightenment by invoking Buddhas, reciting sutras, making offerings, 
                                      observing precepts, Practicing devotions, or doing good works?</em></p>
              <p>No, you can’t. Why not?</p>
              <p>If you attain anything at all, it’s conditional, it’s karmic. It results in 
                                      retribution. It turns the Wheel. And as long as you’re subject to birth and 
                                      death, you’ll never attain enlightenment. To attain enlightenment you have to 
                                      see your nature. Unless you see your nature, all this talk about cause and 
                                      effect is nonsense. Buddhas don’t practice nonsense. A Buddha free of karma free 
                                      of cause and effect. To say he attains anything at all is to slander a Buddha. 
                                      What could he possibly attain? Even focusing on a mind, a power, an 
                                      understanding, or a view is impossible for a Buddha. A Buddha isn’t one sided. 
                                      The nature of his mind is basically empty, neither pure nor impure. He’s free of 
                                      practice and realization. He’s free of cause and effect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A Buddha doesn’t observe precepts. A Buddha doesn’t do good or evil. A Buddha 
              isn’t energetic or lazy. A Buddha is someone who does nothing, someone who can’t 
              even focus his mind on a Buddha. A Buddha isn’t a Buddha. Don’t think about 
              Buddhas. If you dont see what I’m talking about, you’ll ever know your own mind. 
              People who don’t see their nature and imagine they can practice thoughtlessness 
              all the time are lairs and fools. They fall into endless space. They’re like 
              drunks. They can’t tell good from evil. If you intend to cultivate such a 
              practice, you have to see your nature before you can put an end to rational 
              thought. To attain enlightenment without seeing your nature is impossible. Still 
              others commit all sorts of evil deeds, claiming karma doesn’t exist. They 
              erroneously maintain that since everything is empty committing evil isn’t wrong. 
              Such persons fall into a hell of endless darkness with no hope of release. Those 
              who are wise hold no such conception.</p>

              <p>You should see the context Bodhidharma is explaining from.</p>
              <p>There's another verse from the text:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Buddhas don’t save Buddhas. If you use your mind to look for a Buddha, you 
                      won’t see the Buddha. As long as you look for a Buddha somewhere else, you’ll 
                      never see that your own mind is the Buddha. Don’t use a Buddha to worship a 
                      Buddha. And don’t use the mind to invoke a Buddha." Buddhas don’t recite 
                      sutras." <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buddhas don’t keep precepts." And Buddhas don’t break precepts.</span> Buddhas 
                      don’t keep or break anything. Buddhas don’t do good or evil.</strong></p>
              <p>Hence we should not think that if Buddhas do not observe precepts, they 'break precepts' as a result.</p>
              <p>What Bodhidharma is trying to say is that the Buddha is natural in his life, he does not make an intention or effort to keep something, with the intention of gaining or attaining something. If his natural state/Buddha Nature already possess all virtues, why does he need superficial things like '5 precepts'? His actions are naturally wholesome, does he need to purposely 'practice the 10 wholesome deeds'? All his actions comes forth spontaneously as prajna, he does not cultivate things with 'cause and effect' in mind, or trying to gain or attain something out of it, which otherwise as Bodhidharma said, 
                      <strong><em>If you attain anything at all, it’s conditional, it’s karmic. It results in 
                      retribution. It turns the Wheel. </em></strong></p>
              <p>The Buddha of course won't kill or tell lies even if 5 precepts didn't exist. 5 Precepts are merely made for sentient beings like as skillful means to prevent us from falling into lower realms, so they are still very important, because if one cannot even keep the precepts he will most certainly fall into the 3 lower realms. But one who beholds the mind does not get affected, he does not 'turn the wheel', he does 'neither good nor evil' and yet his actions arise spontaneously, benefitting all sentient beings.</p>
              <p>If we go to the root, the Mind, there is no no need to try to prevent every bad leaves from coming out, because you treat the problem at its root. As Bodhidharma said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The mind is the root from which all things grow if you can understand the 
                      mind, everything else is included. It’s like the root of a tree. All a tree’s 
                      fruit and flowers, branches and leaves depend on its root. If you nourish its 
                      root, a tree multiplies. If you cut its root, it dies. Those who understand the 
                      mind reach enlightenment with minimal effort. Those who don’t understand the 
                      mind practice in vain. Everything good and bad comes from your own mind. To find 
                      something beyond the mind is impossible.</strong></p>
              <p>Lastly, 'Buddha' can be described, but all descriptions are just like pointers to the moon. But it is like describing colours to the blind person, it is useless because the blind can only imagine based on the descriptions, but he can't see or feel it. It must dawn to you as a crystal clear insight that your true nature is already Buddha.</p>
              <p>As Bodhidharma explains in the text,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Buddha is Sanskrit for what you call aware, miraculously aware. Responding, 
                      arching your brows blinking your eyes, moving your hands and feet, its all your 
                      miraculously aware nature. And this nature is the mind. And the mind is the 
                      Buddha. And the Buddha is the path. And the path is Zen. But the word Zen is one 
                      that remains a puzzle to both mortals and sages. Seeing your nature is Zen. 
                      Unless you see your nature, it’s not Zen.</em></p>

              <p><strong>To find a Buddha, you have to see your nature." Whoever sees his nature is a Buddha.

Invoking Buddhas results in good karma, reciting sutras results in a good memory; keeping precepts results in a good rebirth, and making offerings results in future blessings-but no buddha. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you don’t understand by yourself, you’ll have to find a teacher to get to the bottom of life and death. But unless he sees his nature, such a person isn’t a teacher. Even if he can recite the Twelvefold Canon he can’t escape the Wheel of Birth and Death. He suffers in the three realms without hope of release.</span> Long ago, the monk Good Star was able to recite the entire Canon. But he didn’t escape the Wheel, because he didn’t see his nature. If this was the case with Good Star, then people nowadays who recite a few sutras or shastras and think it’s the Dharma are fools. Unless you see your mind, reciting so much prose is useless.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>To find a Buddha all you have to do is see your nature. Your nature is the Buddha. And the Buddha is the person who’s free: free of plans, free of cares. If you don’t see your nature and run around all day looking somewhere else, you’ll never find a buddha. The truth is there’s nothing to find. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But to reach such an understanding you need a teacher and you need to struggle to make yourself understand.</span> Life and death are important. Don’t suffer them in vain.</strong></p>
              <p>There’s no advantage in deceiving yourself. Even if you have mountains of jewels and as many servants as there are grains of sand along the Ganges, you see them when your eyes are open. But what about when your eyes are shut? You should realize then that everything you see is like a dream or illusion.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you don’t find a teacher soon, you’ll live this life in vain. It’s true, you have the buddha-nature. But the help of a teacher you’ll never know it. Only one person in a million becomes enlightened without a teacher’s help.</span> If, though, by the conjunction of conditions, someone understands what the Buddha meant, that person doesn’t need a teacher. Such a person has a natural awareness superior to anything taught. But unless you’re so blessed, study hard, and by means of instruction you’ll understand.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>People who don’t understand and think they can do so without study are no different from those deluded souls who can’t tell white from black." Falsely proclaiming the Buddha-Dharma, such persons in fact blaspheme the Buddha and subvert the Dharma. They preach as if they were bringing rain. But theirs is the preaching of devils not of Buddhas. Their teacher is the King of Devils and their disciples are the Devil’s minions. Deluded people who follow such instruction unwittingly sink deeper in the Sea of Birth and Death. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unless they see their nature, how can people call themselves Buddhas they’re liars who deceive others into entering the realm of devils. Unless they see their nature, their preaching of the Twelvefold Canon is nothing but the preaching of devils. Their allegiance is to Mara, not to the Buddha. Unable to distinguish white from black, how can they escape birth and death?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Whoever sees his nature is a Buddha; whoever doesn’t is a mortal. But if you can find your buddha-nature apart from your mortal nature, where is it? Our mortal nature is our Buddha nature. Beyond this nature there’s no Buddha. The Buddha is our nature. There’s no Buddha besides this nature. And there’s no nature besides the Buddha.</p>
              <p><em>But suppose I don’t see my nature, cant I still attain enlightenment by invoking Buddhas, reciting sutras, making offerings, observing precepts, Practicing devotions, or doing good works?</em></p>
              <p>No, you can’t. Why not?</p>
              <p>If you attain anything at all, it’s conditional, it’s karmic. It results in retribution. It turns the Wheel. And as long as you’re subject to birth and death, you’ll never attain enlightenment. To attain enlightenment you have to see your nature. Unless you see your nature, all this talk about cause and effect is nonsense. Buddhas don’t practice nonsense. A Buddha free of karma free of cause and effect. To say he attains anything at all is to slander a Buddha. What could he possibly attain? Even focusing on a mind, a power, an understanding, or a view is impossible for a Buddha. A Buddha isn’t one sided. The nature of his mind is basically empty, neither pure nor impure. He’s free of practice and realization. He’s free of cause and effect.</p>

              <p><br>Dear knightlll, confusing or not, just need to remind yourself this fact: Buddha has mentioned in various sutras, that all Buddhas come to earth for one purpose, to show the way of the Buddhas to every sentient being, to help them gain quick and complete liberation from all suffering.</p>
              <p>There is no need to fret that you cannot or won't understand what Anatta or emptiness is about. I'm not trying to say you don't care or shut your ears, I'm saying just relax, believe in the compassion and wisdom of all Buddhas, believe that you can one day be like them.</p>
              <p>That's all you need to do for your daily cultivation while trying to understand emptiness and anatta.</p>
              <p>Take care. ^_^</p>

              <p>[JK] Answer is based on my own understanding of teachings from Master Chin Kung, trying my best to translate into English, if anything inappropriate, pls forgive and correct me</p>
              <p>1.  I have posted this doubt as a separate post, so this is
                                      a just a re-cap. How should we interpret Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's
                                      vows not to achieve Buddhahood until hell is empty?</p>
              <p>1.1  Literally or figuratively? Is it a mere analogy,
                                      encouragment or reassurance of a superficial nature?</p>
              <p>[JK] The focus is on self-sacrifice and compassion.</p>
              <p>1.2  Ksitgarbha Bodhisattvas has already gone through many
                                      countless aeons since he made that vow and started guiding and
                                      delivering sentient beings. <strong>So long that he could have
                                      attained Buddhahood long ago</strong>. This is mentioned clearly by
                                      Sakayamuni Buddha. [Most of us know Bodhisattvas need to go
                                      through at least <strong>3 great</strong> <span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><strong>asamkyeya kalpas
                                      (ä¸‰å¤§é˜¿åƒ§ç¥—åŠ«ï¼‰ </strong>to attain Buddhahood]</span></p>
              <p>[JK] In pureland buddhism, as long as one is reborn in Sukavathi, buddhahood can be achieved in a shorter time (10 kalpas).</p>
              <p>Many Destruction eras had passed while the Bodhisattva is
                                      working hard on his cultivation and implementation of his
                                      vows. So this means there were countless periods where hells
                                      were destroyed in some worlds, but still existed in others. So
                                      hell beings in worlds experiencing the Destruction era would be
                                      reborn to suffer in the other worlds which do not have Destruction
                                      era yet. So hell in general had not once really been
                                      empty of suffering beings.</p>
              <p>Why particularly the 20th small kalpa of our present Destruction
                                      era for total and complete liberation to occur for all samsaric
                                      beings in all ten directions? </p>
              <p>Can I safely assume the vows cover all beings in all
                                      ten directions, from past, present and future?</p>
              <p>2. There are countless Bodhisattvas and Buddhas in all ten
                                      directions; each Bodhisattva and Buddhas can have countless
                                      manifestations and their vows to save sentient beings are
                                      essentially the same as Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, for compassion and
                                      wisdom is common for all of them.</p>
              <p>2.1 So why is Sakayamuni Buddha praising Ksitigarbha
                                      Bodhisattva so much? Why is he encouraging us to seek refuge in the
                                      Bodhisattva? (To recite his name, cultivate his virtues, etc) Other
                                      Bodhisattvas are just as well-qualified to help us, isn't it? For
                                      example, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (è§‚ä¸–éŸ³è�©è�¨).</p>
              <p>[JK] According to Master Chin Kung, This is because fillial piety/respect for teachers/elders is a pre-requisite of  compassion. Ksitigarbha
                                      Bodhisattva is the symbol of fillial piety. The analogy is like Ksitigarbha
                                      teaches primary one, Avalokitesvara teaches primary two. Without fillial piety and respect for teachers as the foundation, how can compassion be taught?</p>
              <p>2.2 What have the other Bodhisattvas and Buddhas from
                                      all worlds and directions been doing during this period where
                                      Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is implementing his vows? Is it just to
                                      wait or to look at us suffer? Is it just to teach dharma to the
                                      Bodhisattvas, arahants and heavenly beings?</p>
              <p>If one Bodhisattva can have countless manifestations to teach
                                      countless beings in countless worlds in all ten directions from
                                      past/present/future, imagine what countless Bodhisattvas and
                                      Buddhas in all worlds and directions can do if they choose to
                                      appear in countless manifestations like Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva?
                                      Totally inconceivable! No sentient being would be lost, no sentient
                                      being would have to suffer for aeons in the 3 evil realms
                                      anymore.</p>
              <p>[JK] Of course they are also helping but Ksitigarbha and Avalokitesvara are special to our world (ç¼˜æ·±) as mentioned in the sutra. Another thing we must understand is that ä¼—ç”Ÿæœ‰æ„Ÿ,è�©è�¨æœ‰åº”. æ„Ÿåº” is not so simple to achieve if our mind is still full of money, fame, power everyday. If one prays for help from the Buddha/Bodhisattva, our mind must be pure at that moment of prayer (this is similar in other religions). Even in the pureland buddhism which places great emphasis on the external assistance from Amitabha buddha, it still requires great effort from within. In order to be reborn in Sukavathi, basic things like fillial piety, five precepts, recital of name of Amitabha budda with full concentration at the moment of death  are pre-requisites. Therefore, one must understand that Buddhism places great emphasis on self-improvement</p>
              <p>3. We have been taught in the sutra or teach others using the
                                      sutra to practise filial piety, to show eternal gratefulness and
                                      heartfelt appreciation towards our parents. But we have also
                                      been parents in our countless rebirths, and some of our children
                                      could be our parents now.</p>
              <p>3.1 If any of our children has attained enlightment, sainthood
                                      or even reborn as heavenly beings, they should/would have
                                      wanted very much to help us to be happy too. But yet we fall and
                                      fall for aeons without really having anyone compassionate and
                                      patient enough to guide us for countless lifetimes till we attained
                                      liberation like what Ksitigarbha or Sakayamuni Buddha does for
                                      everyone. Why? How can this happen?</p>
              <p>[JK]  I consider myself lucky that they are so many living masters today guiding us. One example is teaching from Dalai Lama at http://www.dalailama.com. Besides living masters, we have the guidance from the past masters too. Here is one from Master Yin Kuang:</p>

              <p>3.2 We often have to dedicate merits to all beings after doing
                                      any good deed, having good thoughts or reciting sutras, etc,
                                      and we are taught that our parents should be the
                                      first and main recipients of our merits. But is there any positive
                                      effect from our dedication?</p>
              <p>If my sons/daughers from previous lifetimes are
                                      now Buddhists, born in this Dharma-ending age and he/she
                                      dedicates merits to all parents from  countless
                                      lifetimes, then presumably all parents, including me should be able
                                      to receive the merit and benefit greatly from it. But do you feel
                                      anything? Do you see any change in you?</p>
              <p>As such I am very lost and doubtful as to what role does
                                      merit dedication (å›žå�‘) really play and what real benefits does
                                      it reap for all beings.</p>
              <p>[JK] Merit is always limited as we are clouded by wild thoughts, discrimination and attachment every day. In the sutra, it is mentioned that one can only dedicate 1/7 of merit to others.</p>
