He also mentioned about mosquitoes (but I can't remember well for that one). I will summarise a few points below.<br><br>Ants - put some Mei2 You2 near their home, they dislike the Mei2 You2 and will definitely move away from their home to somewhere else. To give the ants a sense of direction where to go you may put some food nearby, and they will go and live there. But don't put the food too far as it may be difficult for them to travel that far distance.<br><br>Co-ckroach - get some empty Wu3 Jia1 Pi2 Jiu3 (a type of Chinese traditional beer?). Co-ckroaches love to have a beer and will all go inside. Then you can throw the cans into a dirty place i.e trash can and let them live in their paradise. I don't know about other beers, you all could experiment yourself.<br><br>Mosquitoes - I can remember only he mentioend two ways - burning that mosquito 'incense', or using some kind of electronic device that could make them sterilised and not be able to reproduce babies.<br><br>So we do not necessarily need to kill them to get rid of the pests. Wisdom will be of good use.</blockquote><blockquote>My Master taught - to develope Great Compassion one must start by not harming, and protecting animals no matter how tiny they are.<br><br>Even though these animals may be tiny - if you can kill small animals, one day you might kill bigger animals, then killing humans no longer seem a difficult task to do.</blockquote><blockquote>by the way, found out that co-ckroaches also like staled beer and wines. so other alcoholic drinks should work</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, practising Loving Kindness will definitely help. We often hear that the Thai Forest monks don't get into trouble with wild animals because they practised metta.

The elephant stopped and knelt down before the Buddha - the third failed attempt by Devadatta to kill the Buddha.<br><br>On the other hand, we need to use a little wisdom. It is not that we have no ways to get rid of the insects without harming them. As from my previous post:<br><br><blockquote>Hello, my master Ven.

To give the ants a sense of direction where to go you may put some food nearby, and they will go and live there. But don't put the food too far as it may be difficult for them to travel that far distance.<br><br>Co-ckroach - get some empty Wu3 Jia1 Pi2 Jiu3 (a type of Chinese traditional beer?). Co-ckroaches love to have a beer and will all go inside. Then you can throw the cans into a dirty place i.e trash can and let them live in their paradise. I don't know about other beers, you all could experiment yourself.<br><br>Mosquitoes - I can remember only he mentioend two ways - burning that mosquito 'incense', or using some kind of electronic device that could make them sterilised and not be able to reproduce babies.<br><br>So we do not necessarily need to kill them to get rid of the pests. Wisdom will be of good use.</blockquote><blockquote>My Master taught - to develope Great Compassion one must start by not harming, and protecting animals no matter how tiny they are.<br><br>Even though these animals may be tiny - if you can kill small animals, one day you might kill bigger animals, then killing humans no longer seem a difficult task to do.</blockquote><blockquote>by the way, found out that co-ckroaches also like staled beer and wines. so other alcoholic drinks should work</blockquote>And lastly, if there is no choice but to kill the mosquitoes, it should be done out of wisdom as a skillful means, <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">But on another instance she also mentioned before, if for example, the dharma centre has a lot of mosquitoes (but anyway our dharma centre doesnt have a single insect and is on the 5th floor), she is willing to take up the karma to call the control pests or something, for the better good. If you want to kill the mosquito, you need to know that no matter for what reason, there will stil be negative karma involved.</span></strong>. As Buddhists we also do chant for these beings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What I am trying to say is, you don't kill needlessly. Like if you have a garden and there are ants living in the trees, then let them be. Don't kill them just because they happened to be living in a tree in your garden. Don't kill for the sake of killing. Even if they are just ants.<br><br>On the other hand, if there are good reasons, kill them rather then suffer the consequences of being irritated with ants crawling all over.<br><br>I was walking along under some tress with my sister a long time ago and on the path was a big worm. I took a leaf and scooped it up and then throw it back among the bushes.<br><br>My sister looked at me and said. People will just step on it and get it over with. Why did you do that?<br><br>I did not say anything. I am not a Buddhist but I have no wish to kill anything needlessly. If I did not scoop it up then I will walk around it.
