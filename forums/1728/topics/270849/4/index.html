All the adornment things, such as palaces and beautifully decorated clothing, the fragrant flowers, the banners and umbrellas, will come forth just as one has wished or one has needed for. If a man wishes to take food, the 7 precious bowls and containers, which contain hundred kinds of food and drinks that are of different tastes will naturally appear in front of him and are filled to the brim. After eating, the food, drinks and containers will all disappear and to appear again when it's time for lunch..."<br><br>P.S. People in the Pure Land possesses highly advanced scientific powers - so that they can create things out of energy if they need them and convert these things back to energy after they have used them.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Origin of Universe</span></strong>:<br><br><strong>NASA Astronomer, Dr Sten Odenwald said that</strong>:<br>"... when physicists said 'nothing', they were being playful with the English language because we often think of the vacuum as being empty or nothing. In fact, Physicists now know fully well that the vacuum is far from nothing... Before the time of formation of universe, there is even no time, space or vacuum. So, the primary state of pre-universe period is far from being the 'nothingness' we might have in mind... we don't have the full mathematical theory for describing this state yet but It was probably 'multi-dimensional'... The nothingness that gives rise to the present universe was not nothing but it was not anything like the kinds of something we can think of today. We now have no words to describe it. And the one that we borrow from the Oxford English Dictionary are based on the wrong physical insight... What this means to us may never be fully understood...'<br><br>P.S. Pre-universe state is still obscured and incomprehensible to us.<br><br><strong>The Buddha</strong> taught that the original state of the universe, referred to as the true self nature, neither come from somewhere nor goes anywhere; It is neither continuous nor separate; it is neither dirty nor clean; it neither increases nor decreases...<br><br><strong>The Buddha</strong> uses the terms, 'unthinkable' and 'inexpressible' to describe this state.<br>It can however be 'understood' through meditation and deep concentration without wandering thought. In deep concentration when there will be no obstacles. At this moment, the true nature of ourselves and universe come forth. This level is so-called the Pure State of Enlightenment.<br><br><strong>NASA Space Scientist</strong>:<br>The size of a universe when it was born, is 10 to the power of -33 centimeter or 0.0000000000000000000000000000000001 centimeter<br>Using an analogy, there are therefore 1 million of trillions of trillions of particles (which form a universe per particle) across the diameter of the smallest strand of our single human hair.<br><br><strong>The Buddha</strong> said that "... there is no difference between the infinite and the infinitesimal; incalculable number of universes can emerge from just 1 single pore..."<br><br><strong>NASA Space Scientist</strong>:<br>The speed of expansion from this tiny particle to a huge universe is incredibly high: 10 to the power of 59 times bigger in every second. That is within less than 1 thousandth of a second, the particle would have growth to a size bigger than our present solar system. Formation of our universe takes only 1 instant.<br><br><strong>The Buddha</strong> said that "... the formation and extinction of the universes take only an instant ...";<br>this tiny particle is actually one's smallest wandering thought rising from the Pure Mind and instantly, this wandering thought forms our entire universe..."<br><br><strong>When asked about our universe and other universes aside from ours, NASA Astronomer, Dr Sten Odenwald said that</strong>:<br>" ...according to General Relativity, our universe represents everything, including all space, time and galaxies; other universes are of totally different space and time completely outside our own space and time. Those universes do not now or ever will, in the future, have any physical contact with our universe. These other universes are laterally on the other side of eternity and infinity from our perspective ..."<br><br><strong>The Buddha</strong> said that, "... incalculable universes exist in numerous different dimensions, but we, human beings, are unable to see them because of our wandering thoughts, differentiation and attachments. These things block our vision. When we let go of our wandering thoughts, differentiation and attachments, we will be able to clearly observe the entire universe and all the other universes...

              <p>From 'The Power of Now', Eckhart Tolle<strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Christ: The Reality Of Your Divine Presence</strong></p>
              <p><br>Don't get attached to any one word. You can substitute "Christ" for presence, if that is more meaningful to you. Christ is your God essence or the Self, as it is sometimes called in the East. The only difference between Christ and presence is that Christ refers to your indwelling divinity regardless of whether you are conscious of it or not, whereas presence means your awakened divinity or God-essence.</p>
              <p><br>Many misunderstandings and false beliefs about Christ will clear if you realize that there is no past or future in Christ. To say that Christ was or will be is a contradiction in terms. Jesus was. He was a man who lived two thousand years ago and realized divine presence, his true nature. And so he said: "Before Abraham was, I am." He did not say: "I already existed before Abraham was born." That would have meant that he was still within. the dimension of time and form identity. The words I am used in a sentence that starts in the past tense indicate a radical shift, a discontinuity in the temporal dimension. It is a Zen-like statement of great profundity. Jesus attempted to convey directly, not through discursive thought, the meaning of presence, of self realization. He had gone beyond the consciousness dimension governed by time, into the realm of the timeless. The dimension of eternity had come into this world. Eternity, of course, does not mean endless time, but no time. Thus, the man Jesus became Christ, a vehicle for pure consciousness. And what is God's self-definition in the Bible? Did God say "I have always been, and I always will be?" Of course not.That would have given reality to past and future. God said: "I AM THAT I AM." No time here, just presence.</p>
              <p><br>The "second coming" of Christ is a transformation of human consciousness, a shift from time to presence, from thinking to pure consciousness, not the arrival of some man or woman. If "Christ" were to return tomorrow in some externalized form, what could he or she possibly say to you other than this: "I am the Truth. I am divine presence. I am eternal life. I am within you. I am here. I am Now."</p>
              <p><br>Never personalize Christ. Don't make Christ into a form identity. Avatars, divine mothers, enlightened masters, the very few that are real, are not special as persons. Without a false self to uphold, defend, and feed, they are more simple, more ordinary than the ordinary man or woman. Anyone with a strong ego would regard them as insignificant or, more likely, not see them at all.</p>
              <p><br>If you are drawn to an enlightened teacher, it is because there is already enough presence in you to recognize presence in another. There were many people who did not recognize Jesus or the Buddha, as there are and always have been many people who are drawn to false teachers. Egos are drawn to bigger egos. Darkness cannot rec-ognize light. Only light can recognize light. So don't believe that the light is outside you or that it can only come through one particular form. If only your master is an incarnation of God, then who are you? Any kind of exclusivity is identification with form, and identification with form means ego, no matter how well disguised.<br>Use the master's presence to reflect your own identity beyond name and form back to you and to become more intensely present yourself. You will soon realize that there is no "mine" or "yours" in presence. Presence is one.<br>Group work can also be helpful for intensifying the light of your presence. A group of people coming together in a state of presence generates a collective energy field of great intensity. It not only raises the degree of presence of each member of the group but also helps to free the collective human consciousness from its current state ofmind dominance. This will make the state of presence increasingly more accessible to individuals. However, unless at least one member of the group is already firmly established in it and thus can hold the energy frequency of that state, the egoic mind can easily reassert itself and sabotage the group's endeavors. Although group work is invaluable, it is not enough, and you must not come to depend on it. Nor must you come to depend on a teacher or a master, except during the transitional period, when you are learning the meaning and practice of presence.</p>

              <p>A major new survey presents perhaps the most detailed picture we've yet had of which religious groups Americans belong to. And its big message is: blink and they'll change. For the first time, a large-scale study has quantified what many experts suspect: there is a constant membership turnover among most American faiths. America's religious culture, which is best known for its high participation rates, may now be equally famous (or infamous) for what the new report dubs "churn."</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">"Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in
              ice," wrote the poet Robert Frost. Astronomers, it turns out, are in the
              former camp.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">A new calculation predicts that Earth will be <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/death_of_earth_000224.html">swallowed
              up</a> by the sun in 7.6 billion years, capping off a longstanding debate over
              whether the sun's gravitational pull will have weakened enough for Earth to
              escape final destruction or not.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Other theorists have predicted that our planet will fry as
              the sun expands in its old age. But the time estimates have varied by a couple
              billion years.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"Although people have looked at these problems before,
              we would claim this is the best attempt that's been made to date, and probably
              the most reliable," said astronomer Robert Smith, emeritus reader at the U.K.'s
              University of Sussex, who made the new calculations with astronomer Klaus-Peter
              Schroeder of the University of Guanajuato in Mexico. "What we've done is
              to refine existing models and to put the best calculations we can at each point
              in the model."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If 7.6 billion years doesn't sound like an urgent death
              sentence, don't relax yet. Regardless of whether Earth will ultimately be
              vaporized, as the <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/inside_sun_000330.html">sun</a> heats up, our planet will become too hot to live on before then.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"After a billion years or so you've got an Earth with no
              atmosphere, no water and a surface temperature of hundreds of degrees, way
              above the boiling point of water," Smith told <em>SPACE.com</em>. "The
              Earth will become dry basically. It will become completely impossible for life
              of any kind to exist. It's a pretty gloomy forecast."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Nonetheless, scientists are curious about the ultimate fate
              of our planet after we are gone (like all previous hominids and more than 99
              percent of all species that have lived on Earth, humans will probably go
              extinct, and it will likely happen sooner than a billion years).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Smith's earlier studies found that Earth would narrowly
              escape being engorged. As the sun ages and expands into a red giant star, it
              will shed its outer gaseous layers, thus losing mass and weakening its
              gravitational pull. Previous calculations found that this let-up would allow
              the Earth's orbit to shift outward, enabling the planet to slip free of the
              smoldering sun.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">But this scenario doesn't account for tidal forces, and the
              drag of the sun's outer layers. As the Earth orbits the sun, its smaller
              gravitational pull isn't completely negligible — it actually causes the side of
              the sun closest to our planet to hoard more mass and bulge out toward us.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"Just as the Earth is pulling on the sun's bulge, it's
              pulling on the Earth, and that causes the Earth to slow in its orbit,"
              Smith said. "It will spiral back and finally end up inside the sun."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In addition, the gas that the sun expels will also drag Earth
              inward toward its demise.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Smith's previous calculations had ignored these effects.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"We didn't think it mattered, but it turns out it
              does," he said. "You might say our previous models had a gap."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There may even be hope for Earth. Some scientists have
              proposed <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planetearth/earth_move_010207.html">a
              scheme</a> for down the road to use the gravity of a passing asteroid to budge
              Earth out of the way of the sun toward cooler territory, assuming there is life
              around at the time that is intelligent enough to engineer this solution.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"It sounds like science fiction, but there's a group of
              people who have quite seriously suggested that it might be possible,"
              Smith said. "If it's done right, that would just keep the Earth moving
              fast enough to keep it out of harm's way. Maybe life could go on for as much as
              7 billion years."</p>

                      of fire, water and wind will not occur simultaneously, but each will take 
                      its turn. At that time, balance in space will be lost, planets of all 
                      the worlds will leave their orbits, and looking from the earth, one will 
                      see seven suns appear in the sky at the same time. The suns' fiery heat 
                      will burn up all the worlds. The destruction will reach the farthest depths 
                      of the Hell of Ceaseless Suffering, including all the worlds of the Three 
                      Thousand Great Chilocosm World of Desires, and even the 1st Jhana of the 
                      World of Forms.</span></strong></p>

              decline, sentient beings in the six lower worlds from hell through the
              world of heavenly beings gradually disappearAt the beginning of the
              20th eon, the rain stops and all vegetation dies, the sun supernovas,
              and splits into two. Later a third sun forms, and all rivers and
              streams evaporate. A fourth sun forms, and large lakes dry up. A fifth
              sun forms, and oceans dry up. A sixth sun forms, and continents go up
              in smoke. A seventh sun forms, and the planet burns up, which also
              causes the first level of the form realm to burn up. There are other
              kalpas of destruction by wind or water. There are also minor
              destruction eons where inhabitants destroy the planet with weapons, etc.</p>
