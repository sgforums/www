              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;">In practice, we are always dealing with the tone and depth
                  of our awareness.</span><span style="background-color: white;">  </span><span style="background-color: white;">First, of
                  course, is the question: are we aware of what’s going on at all?</span><span style="background-color: white;">  </span><span style="background-color: white;">In the beginning, this requires quite a
                  bit of effort to bring the mind to the present.</span><span style="background-color: white;">  </span><span style="background-color: white;">We need to have reminders everywhere and different types of
                  techniques, to keep our mindfulness on target, which is Now!</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">Our ordinary minds are quite wild.  They are:</div>
              <div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="margin-left: 41.6pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">1.<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt;">     </span>Distractable with thoughts, emotions and sensory
                  distractions</div>
              <div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 41.6pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">2.<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt;">     </span>Discontinuous, jumping around, not continuously
                  present</div>
              <div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin-left: 41.6pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">3.<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt;">     </span>Reactive – reacting through the screen of our
                  like and dislikes which elaborate into attachment (grasping) and aversion
                  (hating)</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">In the beginning it requires quite a bit of focus to corral
                  our wandering-in-circles mind.  But
                  even within that effort there is a balance.  Our Practice needs a balanced tone of not-too-tight and
                  not-too-loose.  Practicing with
                  this balance, has you working on the edge of your capabilities.  This is the expression of Right Effort.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">We can use a metaphor of a rocket ship taking off to describe
                  learning to concentrate the mind. 
                  In the beginning, to get the space craft off the ground and out of
                  gravity there has to be a tremendous effort and energy expended.  They even have auxiliary boosters that
                  happen at different times in the ascent to sustain the effort against gravity.  The “gravity” in meditation is the very
                  strong habituated mind that keeps on proliferating.  On and On.  In
                  order to interrupt this strong flow of mind habit, we have to make a great
                  effort to interrupt it and bring the attention back to the object of
                  meditation.  Over and over.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">However, once the ship is out of the gravitational pull of
                  earth, you can’t use the same force. 
                  If you do, who knows where you’ll end up in the universe?  There’s no force pulling against
                  you.  When you are out of the pull
                  of gravity and you want to dock the ship into the space station, for example,
                  you would use very subtle, very slight beeps of energy to make the slightest
                  adjustment in positioning.  This is
                  very similar to the adjustments made in the subtle levels of concentration.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">At some point as your concentration practice develops, you
                  need to ease off and relax into concentration.  If you continue with “trying and efforting”, you are
                  actually reinforcing  the “I” that
                  you want to see released.  So,
                  Right Effort at this point, becomes non-effort.  Letting go or relaxing into what is, with no preferences at
                  all.  Our longing for something other
                  than what is, produces our suffering.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"> You can
                  experiment with this letting go of control (especially in meditation) by
                  investigating the phrase, “Don’t produce or suppress”.  If you don’t try to make something
                  happen or suppress something from happening, you end up being able to stay,
                  simply and clearly with what is.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">But if you relax too much, all of a sudden - no
                  concentration.  The mind is just
                  roaming around as usual, flooded with thought.   Right Effort in
                  our practice, in all our practice whether on the cushion or in activity,
                   is
                  investigating each situation to determine the amount of energy 
                  required.  Am I too loose or too tight?  Should I ease up or intensify 
                  my
                  effort?</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">This subtle modulation of effort continues throughout our day
                  and our life.  Through this
                  practice we build an awareness that has a vivid, sustainable tone.  This tone of awareness, neither too
                  tight or too loose, can ride us through the waves of our life.  As Reb Anderson once said, “Practice is
                  learning how to surf.”  To learn to
                  surf you need to know when to let go and when to hold on. </div>

              <p>As all is being the same microscopic powder mentioned in the Diamond Sutra, probably attested in the article on God particle, what is there seriously to hold firmly besides loving and caring one another. </p>
              <p>Diamond Sutra<br><span lang="en"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">
              </span></span></span></p><p>The lord Buddha resumed:</p>
              <p>"Subhuti, if any good person, either man or woman, were to take 3,000 
              galaxies and grind them into microscopic powder and blow it into space, 
              what do you think, would this powder have any individual existence?"</p>
              <p>"Subhuti replied, "Yes, lord, as a microscopic powder blown into space, 
              it might be said to have a relative existence, but as you use words, it 
              has no existence. The words are used only as a figure of speech. 
              Otherwise the words would imply a belief in the existence of matter as 
              an independent and self-existent thing, which it is not."</p>
              <p>"Furthermore, when the Most Honored One refers to the '3,000 galaxies,' 
              he could only do so as a figure of speech. Why? Because if the 3,000 
              galaxies really existed, their only reality would consist in their 
              cosmic unity. Whether as microscopic powder or as galaxies, what does it
               matter? Only in the sense of the cosmic unity of ultimate being can the
               Buddha rightfully refer to it."</p>
              <p>The lord Buddha was very pleased with this reply and said:</p>
              <p>"Subhuti, although ordinary people have always grasped after an 
              arbitrary conception of matter and galaxies, the concept has no true 
              basis; it is an illusion of the mortal mind. Even when it is referred to
               as 'cosmic unity' it is unthinkable and unknowable."
