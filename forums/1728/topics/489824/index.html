              of the mind like Alzheimer’s help us understand what it means to exist or,
              conversely, feel as if we don’t exist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.05pt; line-height: 1.231;">How do we know
              we exist? What is the self? These are some of the questions science writer Anil
              Ananthaswamy asks in his thought-provoking new book,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.05pt; line-height: 1.231;"> </span><a style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.05pt; line-height: 1.231; box-sizing: border-box; color: inherit;" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Man-Wasnt-There-Investigations/dp/0525954198"><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">The Man Who Wasn’t There: Investigations Into the Strange New Science of
              the Self</em></a><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.05pt; line-height: 1.231;">. The answers, he says, may lie in medical conditions
              like Cotard’s syndrome, Alzheimer’s or body integrity identity disorder, which
              causes some people to try and amputate their own limbs.</span></p>

              he explains why Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton fell victim to the
              doppelgänger effect; how neuroscience is rewriting our ideas about
              identity; and how a song by George Harrison of the Beatles offers a critique of
              the Western view of the self.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">You dedicate the book to “those of
              us who want to let go but wonder, who is letting go and of what?” Explain that
              statement.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">We always hear within popular
              culture that we have to “let go,” as a way of dealing with certain situations
              in our lives. And in some sense you have to wonder about that statement because
              the person or thing doing the letting go is also probably what has to<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">be</em><span> </span>let go. In the book, I am trying to
              get behind the whole issue of what the self is that has to do the letting go;
              and what aspects of the self have to be let go of.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">You start your book with<span> </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; color: inherit;" href="http://www.alz.org/"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Alzheimer’s</strong></a>.<strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Tell us about the origin of the condition and
              what it tells us about “the autobiographical self.”  </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">Alzheimer’s is a very severe
              condition, especially during the mid- to late stages, which starts robbing
              people of their ability to remember anything that’s happening to them. They
              also start forgetting the people they are close to.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">When you look at it from the
              perspective of the self, what Alzheimer’s is doing is eroding your narrative or
              autobiographical self. This is the story we tell others about who we are, and
              the story we tell ourselves. It’s not necessarily something we’re consciously
              thinking. It is a narrative built upon episodes that have happened in our
              lives.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">What Alzheimer’s does is make it
              well nigh impossible to have new memories, so your narrative stops forming. As
              Alzheimer’s progresses it then starts eating into existing memories and eroding
              your earlier narrative self.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">Several of your case studies are of
              extreme conditions shared by a small minority of people, like<span> </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; color: inherit;" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695744/"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Cotard’s syndrome</strong></a>.<span> </span><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Why
              should the rest of us care?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">They are extreme conditions,
              especially Cotard’s because there are only a few hundred cases recorded in
              medical literature. But it’s when things go awry that we get a peek into how
              certain processes in the brain work. If everything is going OK, we don’t get a
              handle on what is happening.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">For instance, the feeling of
              existence that we all have. We never question why we feel that we exist. It
              seems such an obvious thing to say, "I exist." Of course I do! But
              then you have a condition like Cotard’s, where a person is claiming, "I
              don’t exist."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">That instantly raises the question
              of what it means to say "I don’t exist." What are the processes in
              the brain that have gone wrong, which are making the person have such a strong
              conviction about not existing? Conversely, it tells us what it might mean to
              say, "I exist."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">How are advances in<span> </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; color: inherit;" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/02/150204-brain-science-neuroscience-split-brain-epilepsy-ngbooktalk/"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">neuroscience</strong></a><span><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;"> </strong></span><strong>changing our understanding
              of the self?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">They’re giving us a peek into the
              various processes that are going on in the brain and the body, and I want to
              keep emphasizing that it’s the brain<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">and<span> </span></em>body
              together. It’s giving us a sense that the self is not some monolithic thing
              sitting in the brain or outside the brain. It’s actually a whole set of
              neuro-processes, which need to work in concert for us to have a sense that we
              have a being, that we are an entity to whom things are happening and have a
              perspective on the world.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">We look out on the world from
              behind our eyes, and we have a sense that everything we perceive is somehow
              private to us.  So it’s shedding light on all these various aspects of the
              self.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">The chapter “The Man Who Didn’t
              Want His Leg” sounds like a Monty Python sketch. But there really are people
              who want to amputate their own limbs, aren’t there? Tell us about<span> </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; color: inherit;" href="http://cbc.ucsd.edu/pdf/apotem.pdf"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">apotemnophilia</strong></a><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">.  </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">Apotemnophilia was the name given
              to the condition when it was first written about in modern medical literature.
              Now it’s called<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; color: inherit;" href="http://www.biid.org/">body
              integrity identity disorder</a>, or<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; color: inherit;" href="http://phantomself.org/category/neuroscience/xenomelia/">xenomelia</a>, which means foreign limb. The fact
              that neuroscientists are still struggling to name it is an indication that they
              are still trying to understand what’s happening here.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">One of the best ways to get a
              handle on what might be happening is to think of the condition most people will
              be familiar with, which is phantom limb. Phantom limb is a situation where,
              when people have had an amputation, they continue to feel the presence of their
              limb. This raises the question as to what it is that you are perceiving. Why do
              you continue to feel a limb that is not there?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">One answer is that the brain
              creates “maps” of the body and what we perceive are these maps. In the case of
              phantom limbs, the map should have reorganized to reflect the current physical
              condition of the body. But it hasn’t and you continue to feel the old map.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">Now, imagine the inverse condition,
              where your body is functioning well but the way the brain has mapped some body
              part is not OK. That is body integrity identity disorder, where people feel a
              lack of ownership of some part of their body. The suffering can get so extreme
              that people will try and amputate a limb and in order to feel more “complete.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">You say we do not just receive sensations
              from the outside world but from inside the body. Explain that paradox.  </span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">The brain is basically an organ
              that monitors sensations that the body is getting from the outside through our
              ears, eyes, nose, and skin etc. But it also has to keep track of what’s
              happening<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">within</em><span> </span>the body. In fact, in some sense, its
              primary purpose is to keep the body in a favorable physiological state for
              survival. The way it does this is by having a lot of information coming into
              the brain from within the body, things like, how does the brain know what the
              blood pressure is or the temperature of the viscera?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">Receptors in our joints and tendons
              also tell the brain about the three-dimensional location of the various body
              parts in relation to one another, which helps the brain construct a sense of
              the bodily self.  If you close your eyes and don’t look at your body, you
              still have a sense of how your body is positioned in three-dimensional space.
              That is because of the information coming from within your body. The brain
              needs all of that to make sense of what the body is doing in its environment.</span></p>

              awareness of ourselves as entities spanning time, it would have made it easier
              to plan—knowing how things would unfold in the future, or how things had
              happened in the past. All of these would have been survival advantages.</span></p>

              Shackleton’s expedition. A large number of team members had already become
              stranded in the Antarctic ice, so Shackleton and three other team members tried
              to get help. They were extremely exhausted, and all the team members reported
              sensing the presence of another person alongside them. It is a condition that a
              lot of mountaineers talk about. It seems to be caused by some malfunctioning of
              the brain’s processes under extreme exhaustion and oxygen deprivation.</span></p>

              layers of the self. The “I” is the part that is at the core of being a self:
              the thing that is the subject of experiences and to which things are happening.
              Me and mine are extensions of that. You look at your body and say all of this
              is “me.” There are also aspects to the self that you appropriate, like your
              house or family or friends and those become “mine.” So the song is basically
              telling you about the progression of the way the self feels within us, and is
              probably constructed within us.</span></p>

              be called a psychedelic experience. The word "psychedelic" didn’t
              exist to describe what was happening, but he had an experience in which things
              that would otherwise have seemed ordinary, like a flower vase, became imbued
              with a sense of vividness and vitality. One very striking thing he describes is
              how his sense of time slowed down. In fact, he completely lost his sense of

              away with the sense that the debate over whether there is a self or whether
              there is no self is still ongoing but at a very subtle level. I think
              philosophers and neuroscientists agree that a lot of things we think make up
              the self are just neuro-processes in the brain, creating an impression of a
              seemingly solid entity. But actually these things can be disrupted, like your
              narrative self or even your sense of what your body is. The question of whether
              there is something at the very base of it all is an open question that neither
              philosophy nor neuroscience has answered.</span></p>

              answer these questions. It was more a way to write about a place where someone
              tried to answer these questions a long, long time ago and that was Buddha.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 23.4pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; letter-spacing: 0.05pt;"><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/">Cartesian dualism</a><span> </span>separated the mind and body, giving
              the mind a place apart from the body and placing it on a pedestal.
              Neuroscientists have walked away from that because it’s clear that the mind is
              not some separate entity that exists independent of the body. Body, brain, and
              mind are all interlinked. The basic</span></p>

              attachment to the self, to the things we think we are, and our unwillingness to
              let go, is the cause of suffering, because these are all constructed entities.
              An illusion.</span></p>
