              <p>but if you search tantra in google ,it will lead you to a lot of
              websites on sexual technique ,and kama sutra.</p>
              <p>and about the spelling ,i used to use karma sutra,or it should
              be kama sutra?</p>

              <p>Hi rokkie,</p>

              <p>sorry I keep harping on this( sorry to AEN for 'hijacking' this thread <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif">), but I just feel that there may be some beginners or non- Buddhists reading what u wrote on this particular topic in BWB and would get confused or led astray. It is dangerous as it is a fact that there are many out there who r interested in such practises and believed wrongly that Buddhism advocates this. I think if we r not sure  of certain important info or field, we should be mindful of what we write in a public forum like this.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is not against sexuality. Buddhism is not a cult. Through Buddhism practice, one could understand, among other things, what is sexuality and thus change one's life for the better. </p>
              <p>Speaking of ‘letting go’ ï¼Œthis is is a over-used phrase. Many of us don't really understand by what "letting go" actually means.</p>
              <p>When desires ( in this case, I think u refer to sexual desires) rises up, u said 'don't suppress it, just let it go.'  I think when we say don't suppress such thoughts, it means we should first be mindful or realise that this thought is coming up, then from where and by how this thought is coming; in the process of simply "seeing" this pattern of thought arising, we would be able to realise its insignificant and it would then subsides and we will natually let go. If we skip this awareness, then "leting go" becomes just a excuse to indulge in whatever we desire. è¿™æ˜¯çºµæ¬²ï¼Œä¸�æ˜¯æ”¾ä¸‹ï¼Œæ›´ä¸�æ˜¯éš�ç¼˜ã€‚       </p>

              <p>Drawing an analogy to point out what? I still don't understand what has your reply got to do with this topic.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Hinduism being a teaching of Eternalism (eternalism of of Atman/Brahman/Self), teaches reincarnation as being the continuation/persisting nature of the soul. The Hindu yogis too have memories of past lives, but because they have not realised no-self, they misinterprete that experience to be due to the continuation of an eternal atman. For Buddhists, the nature of past life memories are correctly understood without relating to the notion of an eternal soul.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, the teachings of Emptiness is the middle way beyond all extremes -- existence and non-existence, eternalism and nihilism, and so on. All extremes includes: "Whether it is the view of this personality/ego and when I die it's gone
                                                                  (nihilism) and the other extreme view, all there is, is this Atman, an
                                                                  eternal soul that is unchanging (eternalism)."</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, there is no separate self, for life is only a process of causal, interdependent, 'flickering' (subsides as it arises) moment-to-moment conditioned arisings of the 5 skhandas, and which no separate self can be found in or apart from it -- no experiencer is experiencing those manifestation, for all manifestation are empty and self-luminous, which means the knowingness is expressing itself through those conditioned (and hence empty) manifesting/appearing phenomenality in our field of experience and hence there is no persisting/existing center of experience which can persist/exist, as separate from the transiency of experienced. For in truth there is simply seeing/seen inseparable without seer, hearing/heard inseparable without hearer, thinking/thought inseparable without thinker, empty and self-luminous.</p>
              <p>Thus there is no self which can pass on even from one moment to the next, let alone for life after life, for there is no self, only empty (but vividly appearing) conditioned flickering manifestation. But this also has nothing to do with the view of nihilism that the "self" that we are annihilates upon death, as all along there is no "self", but when causes and conditions are present, manifestation/appearances (of the 12 interdependent links of origination) will arise (appear), including the <em>appearances</em> of birth and death though ultimately empty.</p>

              <p>Their destination is to attain eight lokiya-samapatti.After they pass away, they will</p>
              <p>go to one of the fine material world depending on level of Jhana.But Some hermit</p>
              <p>who attain the eight lokiya-samapatti and fourth jhana practice the another one of</p>
              <p>two methods . First method is to hate the body and find the fault in the body.</p>
              <p>Second method is to hate the mind or soul in the body and find the fault of mind or</p>
              <p>soul. After they pass away, they go to immaterial world.</p>
              <p>By continually fixing the mind with this neighbourhood concentration on the counterpart-image the mind reaches a state as if it sinks into the object and remains fixed in it. This state of fixedness and steadiness of mind is known as ‘appanÄ�-samÄ�dhi’ (attainment concentration). There are four kinds of this ‘appanÄ�-samÄ�dhi’ viz. (a) the first jhÄ�na, (b) the second jhÄ�na, (c) the third jhÄ�na, and (d) the fourth jhÄ�na.</p>
              <p>There are two types of meditation:–<br>1. Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na, and<br>2. VipassanÄ�-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na.<br>1. The practice of Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na will develop the mental states of<br>eight lokiya-samÄ�patti (mundane attainments) consisting of the four rÅ«pajhÄ�nas<br>and four rÅ«pa-jhÄ�nas. Repeated exercise of these jhÄ�nic states will bring<br>forth the following:–<br>a) Iddhividha-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to become manifold from being one, and<br>from being manifold to become one again. Power to pass without obstruction<br>through walls and mountains, just as if through the air. Power to walk on water<br>without sinking, as if on the earth. Power to dive into the earth and rise up again,<br>just as if in the water. Power to float cross-legged through the air, just as a<br>winged bird. Power to touch the sun and moon with the hand.<br>b) Dibbasota-abhiññÄ� â€• Celestial ear, the power to hear sounds both<br>heavenly and human, far and near.<br>c) Cetopariya-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to know the mind of others.<br>d) PubbenivÄ�sa-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to recollect the incidents of one's past<br>existences.<br>e) Dibbacakkhu-abhiññÄ� â€• Celestial eye, the power to see all material<br>forms and colours, whether far off or near, whether great or small.</p>
              <p>Yet the possession of these attributes will not bring freedom from the ills of<br>life:– old age, death etc. On death with the jhÄ�nic states remaining fully intact, a<br>person may be born in the relative plane of Brahma world where the life-span<br>lasts for one world-cycle or two, four, eight etc. as the case may be. At the end of<br>his life-span he will die and be reborn either in the deva or human world, where<br>he, just as others, suffers the ills of life of old age, death etc. Often owing to<br>unfavourable circumstances he may be reborn in one of the four lower worlds<br>and live in utmost suffering and misery. It is therefore evident that the practice<br>of Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na alone will not be a guarantee of absolute freedom<br>from the ills of life.</p>

              <p>There are two types of meditation:–<br> 1. Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na, and<br> 2. VipassanÄ�-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na.<br> 1. The practice of Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na will develop the mental

                                                      bring<br> forth the following:–<br> a) Iddhividha-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to become manifold from being one,

                                                      and rise up again,<br> just as if in the water. Power to float cross-legged through the
                                                      air, just as a<br> winged bird. Power to touch the sun and moon with the hand.<br> b) Dibbasota-abhiññÄ� â€• Celestial ear, the power to hear sounds
                                                      both<br> heavenly and human, far and near.<br> c) Cetopariya-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to know the mind of others.<br> d) PubbenivÄ�sa-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to recollect the incidents of one's
                                                      past<br> existences.<br> e) Dibbacakkhu-abhiññÄ� â€• Celestial eye, the power to see all
                                                      material<br> forms and colours, whether far off or near, whether great or
                                                      small.</p>
              <p>Yet the possession of these attributes will not bring freedom
                                                      from the ills of<br> life:– old age, death etc. On death with the jhÄ�nic states
                                                      remaining fully intact, a<br> person may be born in the relative plane of Brahma world where the
                                                      life-span<br> lasts for one world-cycle or two, four, eight etc. as the case may
                                                      be. At the end of<br> his life-span he will die and be reborn either in the deva or human
                                                      world, where<br> he, just as others, suffers the ills of life of old age, death etc.
                                                      Often owing to<br> unfavourable circumstances he may be reborn in one of the four
                                                      lower worlds<br> and live in utmost suffering and misery. It is therefore evident
                                                      that the practice<br> of Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na alone will not be a guarantee of absolute
                                                      freedom<br> from the ills of life.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't say that the way to the formless jhanas is through hating the body, because hating simply creates more mental resistance and mental noise. There are lots of people who don't like their body due to sickness, or other things (e.g. the body is too fat, etc), but it does not mean they are anywhere near a particular jhana. But 'finding faults with the body' if they help in lessening one's attachment to the body may help, as the Buddha himself have recommended on contemplating on the body's various impurities -- as long as it does not turn into a kind of negative resistance/aversion such as 'hatred for the body' which will then again be more mental disturbance than help.</p>
              <p>So it's not 'hating the body' that is the key to the 4 formless samatha jhanas, but rather diverting the focus of attention away from bodily sensations, into a particular formless quality as one's meditation object -- such as space, consciousness, nothingness, and neither perception nor non-perception. Taking these as their (formless) meditation objects, they solidify these objects and wholeheartedly focus/concentrate to the point of one-pointedness leading to complete absorption (jhana).</p>
              <p>BUT... as you have rightly said, samatha (which is found in most religions) by itself cannot lead to liberation, insight or enlightenment. They lead to prolonged altered states of consciousness or mental absorptions, sometimes immersed in long periods of bliss or certain profound mental qualities. But these states by itself does not bring about insights or awakening.</p>
              <p>What the Buddha taught however, the way of Insight (aka Vipassana/Vipashyana) is peculiar to Buddhism and brings about awakening, insights, enlightenment, liberation. That is through mindfulness/bare awareness of momentary experiences from the 6 senses and thus experiencing (and not merely labelling or concluding) and realising directly the true nature of these sensations. While Samatha is the meditation on a concept (a mental state or object solidified and fixated, thus illusory), Vipassana/Vipashyana/Insight-Practice is meditation on the ultimate reality of our direct experience. Hence we can see through the illusions of the duality of subject and object, the notion of a separate self/perceiver, experience and realise all sensations as self-luminous (the isness/suchness of all phenomenality, the expressions of 'knowingness', 'awareness' without a separate observer), flickering (subsiding as it arises), unsatisfactory, interdependent (dependently arisen), empty appearances.</p>

              <p>I see what you're saying... I don't think 'hatred' is the correct word, more like a relinquishing/abandoning/dropping and transcending of a previous state rather than delighting in them or clinging to them. One traverses the progressive stages of jhanas by abandoning the previous one. But I'm not sure what is the word Buddha used.</p>

It is dangerous as it is a fact that there are many out there who r interested in such practises and believed wrongly that Buddhism advocates this. I think if we r not sure  of certain important info or field, we should be mindful of what we write in a public forum like this.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is not against sexuality. Buddhism is not a cult. Through Buddhism practice, one could understand, among other things, what is sexuality and thus change one's life for the better. </p>
              <p>Speaking of ‘letting go’ ï¼Œthis is is a over-used phrase. Many of us don't really understand by what "letting go" actually means.</p>
              <p>When desires ( in this case, I think u refer to sexual desires) rises up, u said 'don't suppress it, just let it go.'  I think when we say don't suppress such thoughts, it means we should first be mindful or realise that this thought is coming up, then from where and by how this thought is coming; in the process of simply "seeing" this pattern of thought arising, we would be able to realise its insignificant and it would then subsides and we will natually let go. If we skip this awareness, then "leting go" becomes just a excuse to indulge in whatever we desire. è¿™æ˜¯çºµæ¬²ï¼Œä¸�æ˜¯æ”¾ä¸‹ï¼Œæ›´ä¸�æ˜¯éš�ç¼˜ã€‚       </p>

              <p><br>Hi rokkie,</p>

              <p>Your reply is actually unrelevant to what I had posted to u.</p>
              <p>I am absolutely not any better than you in Buddhdharma, but I think no matter how many concepts or knowlegde of dharma phrases or words we know, if we don't practise or study correctly enough from the revelant sources or teachers, they are just that:  merely words and phrases.  In fact, most of the time, we may even interpret them wrongly. This is dangerous. We may develope wrong views and wrong thoughts( é‚ªçŸ¥é‚ªè§�ï¼‰without knowing. In this case. I think u don't really understand what u r saying by using all these phrases of dharma.</p>
              <p> I believe you r not a Buddhist, so if u r really interested to understand Buddhadharma properly, it is better to seek the correct route by either joining dharma classes, consulting dharma teachers, or reading dharma materials with explanations by teachers or masters.</p>
              <p>But of cos, most probably u wld say that u r apt enough to read up and analyse by yourself ( which most ppl think so too, as many of us have very deep æˆ‘è§�<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png">), so just take it as a suggestion from a forum friend.

              <p>9th Jhana cannot come by pure samatha/concentration practice. For samatha, the most you can reach is 8th jhana.</p>
              <p>9th Jhana requires you to be at least an Anagami to achieve it. When you reach Anagami, you'll naturally experience nirodha samapatti.</p>
              <p>To be an Anagami, you must have realisation of ultimate reality, and this is only possible through Insights/Awakening brought about by Insight Practice, which Samatha cannot bring about.</p>
