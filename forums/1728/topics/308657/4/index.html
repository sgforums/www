              <p>You can never suppress your thoughts and experience, but you can gradually let go/drop these thoughts and experiences. The more you react to thoughts, the more you become affected and stirrs up the thoughts. It is through relaxing, not reacting to the thoughts, and letting the thoughts dissolve away by itself. No effort is needed just a mindful awareness of these thoughts and feelings and letting thoughts arise and dissolve away by itself without judgment, reaction, resistance/aversion. The nature of all experience is impermanence -- if we just let them be, they will dissolve/liberate by itself in itself.</p>
              <p>Also, the joy that Buddha teaches is very very different from worldly sensual joy. The joy that Buddha spoke of comes about only by totally letting go of attachments to all our thoughts and sense experience, which he says for example -- "There is the case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality,
                              withdrawn from unskillful qualities — enters and remains in the first
                              jhana: rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by
                              directed thought and evaluation. He permeates and pervades, suffuses
                              and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from
                              withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture
                              and pleasure born from withdrawal."</p>
              <p>When you have personally experienced such profound bliss and rapture that pervades your entire body (as I have experienced in meditation as well), you will know how a different mode of blissful experiencing is possible and you will gradually learn to drop all attachments to sense pleasures in your meditation.</p>
              <p>Withdrawal simply means letting go of all attachments to thoughts and sense perception, not being entangled by them. When you let go in such a way, you enter into a sublime state of bliss that is much more blissful than any worldly joy, or even sex. And that is merely the 1st jhana, the higher jhanas are more blissful. And even the jhanas are not ultimate, are mundane states -- and cannot be compared to the supramundane bliss of Nirvana, which the Buddha calls "the Highest Bliss."</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title"><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html">The Spell of Karmic Propensities</a></h3>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">The following
                  article is a summary (by me) of some of the conversations Thusness had
                  with me on the topic of Karmic Propensities/Karmic Momentum/Deep
                  Conditionings and how it blinds us and completely affects the way we
                  see phenomena.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Karmic
                  Propensities is what blinded us from seeing the ultimate reality. Our
                  entire mind is affected by karmic propensities such that our entire
                  system of enquiry, even when we want to inquire on reality, we cannot
                  know beyond "Who", "When", "What", "Where". Our mind is always thinking
                  dualistically, in terms of subject and object (an I and a Not-I/an
                  Observer apart from the Object of Observation, which cannot be found in
                  reality). It is a momentum that cannot be located, yet it can be
                  directly felt and experienced, and the momentum arises every moment and
                  affect the entire way we see things. When we are affected by momentum
                  the mind cannot know the ultimate reality (Emptiness).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">Because
                  our momentum is at work, we will always assume a subject-object
                  duality. That is, there is a Self, an Agent, and observer, doer,
                  thinker of thoughts. A self that persists in time in a connected way...
                  experiencing things... It blinds us into seeing self and objective
                  world as 'entities', as 'things' with inherent existence, as a separate
                  and permanent 'me'.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">So
                  when momentum is in action, we cannot help but react with our karmic
                  patterns. If we were to ask, "If you lost your shoe, are you still
                  you?" or "If you lost your hands, do you still exist?". It almost seems
                  certain to say "Yes, of course I am still I." because we always assumed
                  there is a truly existing "Self" experiencing changes. This momentum
                  can continue even after experiences of transcendental Presence, and
                  distorting the experience.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">Dharma
                  Dan calls the karmic propensities of seeing subject/object division, or
                  a separate Agent that is the observer, the "fundamental knot of
                  perception". (See: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/non-duality-models-of-enlightenment-by.html">The Non-Duality Models of Enlightenment by Dharma Dan</a>)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">Because
                  it is our habit energy that made us think that way, we are so used to
                  thinking in terms of subject object duality that it has become so
                  deeply part of us, deeply imprinted into our consciousness.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">If
                  we were to eliminate this bond, then we can begin to realise, there is
                  no "Self". In reality, there is only Self1, Self2, Self3, moment to
                  moment our mental and karmic factors arise spontaneously but not in a
                  connected way. We are not a permanent self, we are momentary selves and
                  nothing stays, everything is ever flowing. (Also see <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-is-self.html">What is Self?</a> and <a href="http://www.springwatercenter.org/teachers/packer/articles/whatisme/">What Is The "Me"?</a>)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">Without
                  seeing things as 'entities', we can begin to realise the nature of
                  Dependent Co-Arising, Conditionality, Interdependence, etc, i.e
                  Emptiness. The nature is always so, but our karmic propensities obscure
                  us from seeing the truth, distorting the way we see things, enquire
                  things, and perceive things. It is this bond that bonds us life after
                  life in Samsara.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">To
                  eliminate the bond we have to feel it, feel the power of the bond,
                  experience it. To eliminate the bond is a matter of insights, the
                  insight into our true nature, the insight into self-liberation, etc.
                  Not only must we eliminate the bond, we must be able to see how
                  "Propensities" blinds us, and that is through naked awareness.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">How can naked awareness lead to the insight of our "Propensities"?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">Space, time, life, death, in and out are all ‘deeply held’ impressions. <span> </span><strong>We
                  are seldom aware of the “deeply held” until we are able to rest
                  adequately in naked awareness. The nakedness creates the big contrast
                  that provides us the condition for the arising of the insight of the
                  'deeply held'. The insight into the full power of our ‘propensities’
                  and resting in naked awareness are both equally crucial in our
                  understanding of our non-dual (no subject-object duality, no separate
                  permanently existing self) and non-local (emptiness of locality) nature.<span><br></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><strong>To
                  consciousness 'propensities' (deep conditioning or imprints) are all
                  that matters. It is the only 'force' that blinds, bonds and prevents a
                  liberating experience. Once formed it remains latent and only surface
                  when conditions are riped for fruition. We are unable to get rid of it
                  by will. Therefore to know consciousness, it is also to know the impact
                  of deep conditioning, how it is formed and how it subsides. There is
                  really no 'why', it is just how consciousness works.<br><br>If we drop our body, we experience astral body.<br>If we drop our thoughts, we experience “I AM”.<br>If we drop ‘I’, we experience non-duality.<br><br>Every
                  major dropping results in a totally new experiential reality. Perhaps
                  that is why Lao Tze teaches us to eliminate until none to experience
                  Tao.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To drop the bondage/deep
                  conditionings, the mind MUST realise that another way of 'knowing' is
                  possible; an effortless, total sensing and experience of wholeness.
                  Next the experiences of the joy, bliss and clarity of wholeness.
                  Without the insight into the possiblity and the experience of the
                  positive factors, the mind will not release itself from holding.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Even
                  open pure and innocent inquiry is a deep conditioning. Makes the mind
                  chatters incessantly. Every what, when, where and why by itself is a
                  distancing from start.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Freeing itself from such mode of inquiry aka
                  'knowing', the mind rests. The joy of this resting must be experienced
                  for the 'willingness' to arise. :)</span><br><br>P.S. there are different types of meditative bliss/joy/rapture.<br></span><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Like
                  samatha meditation, each jhana state represents a stage of bliss
                  associated with certain level of concentration; the bliss experienced
                  from insight into our nature differs. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">The
                  happiness and pleasure experience by a dualistic mind is different from
                  that experienced by a practitioner. “I AMness” is a higher form of
                  happiness as compared to a dualistic mind that continuously chatters.
                  It is a level of bliss associated with a state of ‘transcendence’ – a
                  state of bliss resulting from the experience of “formlessness,
                  odorless, colorless, attributeless and thoughtlessness’.<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <div class="msg-body" style="font-family: arial;"><strong> No-self or non-dual is higher form of bliss resulted from the direct
                  experience of Oneness and no-separation. It is related to the dropping
                  of the ‘I’. When non-dual is free from perceptions, that bliss is a
                  form transcendence-one</strong><strong>ness.  It is what Thusness called transparency of non-duality.</strong></div>

              <p>I am absolutely not any better than you in Buddhdharma, but I think no matter how many concepts or knowlegde of dharma phrases or words we know, if we don't practise or study correctly enough from the revelant sources or teachers, they are just that:  merely words and phrases.  In fact, most of the time, we may even interpret them wrongly. This is dangerous. We may develope wrong views and wrong thoughts( é‚ªçŸ¥é‚ªè§�ï¼‰without knowing. In this case. I think u don't really understand what u r saying by using all these phrases of dharma.</p>
              <p> I believe you r not a Buddhist, so if u r really interested to understand Buddhadharma properly, it is better to seek the correct route by either joining dharma classes, consulting dharma teachers, or reading dharma materials with explanations by teachers or masters.</p>
              <p>But of cos, most probably u wld say that u r apt enough to read up and analyse by yourself ( which most ppl think so too, as many of us have very deep æˆ‘è§�<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png">), so just take it as a suggestion from a forum friend.

              <p>You can never suppress your thoughts and experience, but you can gradually let go/drop these thoughts and experiences. The more you react to thoughts, the more you become affected and stirrs up the thoughts. It is through relaxing, not reacting to the thoughts, and letting the thoughts dissolve away by itself. No effort is needed just a mindful awareness of these thoughts and feelings and letting thoughts arise and dissolve away by itself without judgment, reaction, resistance/aversion. The nature of all experience is impermanence -- if we just let them be, they will dissolve/liberate by itself in itself.</p>
              <p>Also, the joy that Buddha teaches is very very different from worldly sensual joy. The joy that Buddha spoke of comes about only by totally letting go of attachments to all our thoughts and sense experience, which he says for example -- "There is the case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities — enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal."</p>
              <p>When you have personally experienced such profound bliss and rapture that pervades your entire body (as I have experienced in meditation as well), you will know how a different mode of blissful experiencing is possible and you will gradually learn to drop all attachments to sense pleasures in your meditation.</p>
              <p>Withdrawal simply means letting go of all attachments to thoughts and sense perception, not being entangled by them. When you let go in such a way, you enter into a sublime state of bliss that is much more blissful than any worldly joy, or even sex. And that is merely the 1st jhana, the higher jhanas are more blissful. And even the jhanas are not ultimate, are mundane states -- and cannot be compared to the supramundane bliss of Nirvana, which the Buddha calls "the Highest Bliss."</p>

              <p>Yes.. and neither should we become conditioned by them or distracted
                          by the thoughts. To become conditioned by them, we are led to create various karma that leads to the transmigration in the 6 realms. But recognise them for their true condition -- the
                          activity of our true nature, clarity-emptiness in essence.</p>
              <p>---------------</p>
              <p>...The second consideration concerns the instructions for relaxing alertly with presence (lug-pa'i man-ngag). The usual term for being relaxed is glod-pa or lhod-pa. However, we can be relaxed and yet be drowsy. The term lhug-pa means being relaxed, but alert and present. Thus, being alertly relaxed (lhug-pa), <strong>whenever appearances arise, in whatever fashion they may arise, then without the mind making any corrections or modifications of them, they are seen to exist as mere ornaments or embellishments of that state itself (rgyan gyi ngang-nyid) which is the real condition of existence (chos-nyid).</strong> In the Dzogchen Upadsa, there is the practice of leaving vision just as it is (snang-ba'i co-bzhag). We do not enter into reasoning or into altering it with judgments. <strong>Thus, whenever appearances arise, they are left just as they are, and they in turn in no way condition the individual. </strong>These appearances (snang-ba) are like ornaments (rgyan) of the individual's energy (rtsal). The individual finds himself in the true condition of the mirror. Anything which arises as an appearance is like the rising of a reflection in a mirror. These reflections, whether beautiful or ugly, in no way condition the mirror. Therefore, whatever arises creates no problems for the individual. As the Master Phadampa said:<strong> "The individual is not conditioned by appearances but his attachment to appearances; this attachment originates within the individual and not in the object." Internally, there exists a state of pure presence (rig-pa), which is uncorrected, clear, vivid, and naked (ma bcos sal hrig rjen-ne-ba). It is uncorrected and unmodified (ma bcos-pa) because it is unconditioned by discursive thoughts or the working of the mind. "Naked" (rjen-ne-ba) means that, in the instant when thought arises, we relax them into their own condition such as it is in itself (de-bzhin-nyid du rang sar glod-pa).</strong></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>......<strong>When we are not in the state of Rigpa, the passions become poisons; since they interrupt and hinder our realization, they are called demons (bdud). They compel us to continue in transmigration. If we chase after a discursive thought and enter into mental activity, this thought may become a poison for us. In this way, we become a slave to our passion. But if we remain present, we will not be conditioned by our thoughts in any way and whatever arises will be merely like a reflection in a mirror. Thus, we need not apply some antidote to block the passion because the passion will self-liberate of itself. </strong>We are not even speaking here of <em>gcer-grol</em>, liberation through bare attention, that is to say, when we look into the face of a discursive thought which arises in the mind and it self-liberates. This procedure still involves some kind of effort. But this is not what we are speaking of here. <strong>The term<em> lhug-pa </em>means to relax with awareness. If we feel some passion arising, we then relax that passion without attempting to block it or trying to apply some antidote to it. We are not succumbing to the passion; it is simply that now the passion is governed by our awareness of presence (rig-pa). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With this relaxed presence, our passions themselves become merely the inherent qualities of our primordial state manifesting themselves.</span> This is the method for self-liberating the passions.</strong></p>

              <p>This is as Hui-Neng says, We should <strong>maintain awareness</strong> of the

              <p>Hi rokkie,</p>
              <p>Oh no, this is getting comical... I mean we r like a duck and a chicken talking to each other( é¸¡å�Œé¸­è®²ï¼‰ã€‚ Or should I say a duck and a chicken looking at each other, well, sheepishly.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>No lah, I'm not saying you are over( è¿‡ç�«ï¼Œè¿‡åˆ†ï¼‰ in your comments, I'm saying that I thought our exchanges was over, as in done, finished, the end, no more and move on(ç»“æ�Ÿï¼Œå®Œç»“).<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> </p>
              <p>I'm not a judge or a moral police. I just wish to point out that certain idea, phrase or words of dharma may have been used inappropriately  if we don't understand enough correctly, that's why I used Master Sheng yan article posted earlier. I'm not that wise to correct you in any way. I just hope you would go through the proper way of aquring Buddhadharma, which I feel is a pity if you don't as you r a smart young person. If you are well learned or better still, practise the way, you would be able to help more ppl in your cohort.</p>
