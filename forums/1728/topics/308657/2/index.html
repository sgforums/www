              <p>Hi Thusness,</p>
              <p>The way you write really ' yi zhen jian xue' (hit the target on the bull's eye) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Sexual desire is one aspect that i really hope to resolve eventually. I will honestly say that it is quite a problem for me. If anybody want to judge me for that is really their own problem..but it is really a problem for me.</p>
              <p>Contrary to popular notion, sexual desire actually increase with spiritual development. This is due to the body becoming more energised. Especially if one practice something like qi qong, the full qi will enhance desire and seek to find a release.</p>
              <p>The 'sense of self' fighting with the desire never really work. The solution, i feel lies with the dropping of the conscious portion in day to day interactions. But first one must 'enter' non-dual, and continue to 'drop' in all environments and situations. I have experience of the desire dissolving due to this dropping and i think this is the solution. I really hope to resolve this aspect soon. It does take a lot of practice and the willingness to 'enter' into more deconstructed 'level' even amidst interaction with the environment.</p>
              <p>At times now, experiences feels like rising and falling waves. The grasping/contracting sensation rise and if it does get caught up into deep engagement, it falls off on it own accord. I don't think this is self-liberation yet... but i hope it is getting closer!!</p>

              <p>Though I'm not a tantric practitioner, the practice of Tantra is not about techniques to enhance sex but to transform passion into wisdom.</p>
              <p>I won't comment on this practice because as I said I don't practice tantric. You may find out more from <strong>reliable</strong> websites on vajrayana tantra.</p>

              <p>Reminds me of an old post by Thusness one and a half years ago:</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/1728/topics/225462">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/225462</a></p>
              <p>...It is a matter of how deep the experience of non-dual has
                                      penetrated into our consciousness. At the coarser level of non-dual
                                      experience, we will only be able to experience it at the conscious
                                      level but not at the pre-conscious level. That is, the Â‘SelfÂ’
                                      consciousness does not surface that frequently and there are gaps
                                      in between experiences but the stronger afflictions are still
                                      there. The afflicted consciousness is the habitual propensities of
                                      Â‘selfÂ’ that is deeply rooted and works at the pre-conscious level.
                                      The experience of non-duality will not be able to overcome and
                                      eliminate these stronger afflictions until we have habituated
                                      ourselves to this understanding at the deeper level of our
                                      consciousness.</p>
              <p>At this juncture, a practitioner will experience the first 4
                                      factors of enlightenment quite clearly, that is, there will be
                                      mindfulness, investigative, joy and rapture but tranquility,
                                      concentration and equanimity isnÂ’t strong yet. The first 4 factors
                                      will result a sense of radiance bright, lightness, free, clear,
                                      vivid and energetic feeling but the settledness, sereneness and
                                      calmness will not be that obviously felt. It is here where one will
                                      experience the dark night of what Dharma Dan described.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Contrary to
                                      what that is being thought, one may even feel more lustful due to
                                      the new found energy. </strong></span>But somehow the non-dual experience also has
                                      the strength to pull us back from falling further (you may
                                      experienced it in some synchronic events that serve as reminders)
                                      and eventually lead us to the experience of equanimity. You may
                                      want to find out whyÂ…? <img title="Mr. Green" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green">...</p>

              <p>Regarding lust, dharma dan says energetic and powerful openings, kundalini, lust, sexual and spiritual dreams, ecstasy, intense clarity, visions of bright lights, fine shaking, decreased sleep needs, sexual issues/energy arising, and so on are all characters of the A&amp;P (arising and passing event) a.k.a the "4th nana" as described by Dharma Dan and the Visudhimagga. A practitioner tends to cycle through these Nanas throughout their daily experience.</p>
              <p>I have glimpses of the A&amp;P event but haven't experienced 'lust' yet. But I have heard other practitioners who described experiencing lust due to their practice.</p>

                      can easily lose yourself in them, become hypnotized into implicity
                      believing that when u have attached a word to something, you know

                      simple stone, and certainly a human being is ultimately unknowable.
                      This is becos it has unfathomable depth. All we can perceive,
                      experience, think about is the surface layer of reality, less than

                      HEAR THE MOUNTAIN STREAM?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;">A Zen
                      Master was walking in silence with one of his disciples along a mountain trail.
                      When they came to an ancient cedar tree, they sat down under it for a simple
                      meal of some rice and vegetables. After the meal, the disciple, a young monk
                      who had not yet found the key to the mystery of Zen, broke the silence by
                      asking the Master, "Master, how do I enter Zen?"</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"><span>     </span>He was, of course, inquiring how to enter
                      the state of consciousness which is Zen.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"><span>     </span>The Master remained silent. Almost five
                      minutes passed while the disciple anxiously waited for an answer. He was about
                      to ask another question when the Master suddenly spoke. "Do you hear the
                      sound of that mountain stream?"</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"><span>     </span>The disciple had not been aware of any
                      mountain stream. He had been too busy thinking about the meaning of Zen. Now as
                      he began to listen for the sound, his noisy mind subsided. At first he heard
                      nothing. Then, his thinking gave way to heightened alertness, and suddenly he
                      did hear the hardly perceptible murmur of a small stream in the far distance.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"><span>     </span>"Yes, I can hear it now," he
                      said.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"><span>     </span>The master raised his finger and, with a
                      look in his eyes that in some way was both fierce and gentle, said, "Enter
                      Zen from there."</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"><span>     </span>The disciple was stunned. It was his first
                      satori--a flash of enlightenment. He knew what Zen was without knowing what it
                      was that he knew!</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"><span>     </span>They continued on their journey in silence.
                      The disciple was amazed at the aliveness of the world around him. He
                      experienced everything as if for the first time. Gradually, however, he started
                      thinking again. The alert stillness became covered up again by mental noise,
                      and before long he had another question. "Master," he said, "I
                      have been thinking. What would you have said if I hadn't been able to hear the
                      mountain stream?" The master stopped, looked at him, raised his finger and
                      said, "Enter Zen from there."</span></strong></p>

                      THE GAPS</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;">Throughout
                      the day, there is a continuously changing succession of things that you see and
                      hear. In the first moment of seeing something or hearing a sound--and more so
                      if it is unfamiliar--before the mind names or interprets what your see or hear,
                      there is usually a gap of alert attention in which the perception occurs. That
                      is the inner space. Its duration differs from person to person. It is easy to
                      miss because in many people those spaces are extremely short, perhaps only a
                      second or less.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"><span>     </span>This is what happens: A new sight or sound
                      arises, and in the first moment of perception, there is a brief cessation in
                      the habitual stream of thinking. Consciousness is diverted away form thought
                      because it is required for sense perception. A very unusual sight or sound may
                      leave you "speechless"--even inside, that is to say, bring about a
                      longer gap.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"><span>     </span>The frequency and duration of those spaces
                      determine your ability to enjoy life, to feel an inner connectedness with other
                      human beings as well as nature. It also determines the degree to which you are
                      free of ego because ego implies complete unawareness of the dimension of space.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #9900ff;"><span>     </span>When you become conscious of these brief
                      spaces they happen naturally, they will lengthen, and as they do, you will
                      experience with increasing frequency the joy of perceiving with little or no
                      interference of thinking. The world around you then feels fresh, new, and
                      alive. The more you perceive life through a mental screen of abstraction and
                      conceptualization, the more lifeless and flat the world around you becomes.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Over the past few years, I have countless unpleasant experiences.... eg wife go for surgery, i lost more than $10K in a go,, got robbed at gun point overseas, contracted unexpected sicknesses, encounter demonic interferences, extremely busy work schedule and many things that i didn't even bother to remember.</p>
              <p>Are these considered as 'dark nights'? I do not really understand the definition of the dark night, but i do know that all these experience loosens the bond to the egoic mind.</p>

                                      comfortable with.</p>
              <p>In taoism there are lot of things about sexualties ,in chinese

              </div>
              <p>Though I'm not a tantric practitioner, the practice of Tantra is
                                      not about techniques to enhance sex but to transform passion into
                                      wisdom.</p>
              <p>I won't comment on this practice because as I said I don't
                                      practice tantric. You may find out more from

              <p>Suppressing sexual desires and other forms of desires will not work, but through gradual practice of letting go/dropping and insights into the deeper nature of our experience will allow such afflictions to gradually dissolve by itself.</p>
              <p>So we must practice hard, then we will realise its possibility.</p>

              <p>Though I'm not a tantric practitioner, the practice of Tantra is not about techniques to enhance sex but to transform passion into wisdom.</p>
              <p>I won't comment on this practice because as I said I don't practice tantric. You may find out more from <strong>reliable</strong> websites on vajrayana tantra.</p>

              <p>==============================</p>
              <p>i don't want debate about whether kama sutra is part of tantra,or part of hinduism.</p>
              <p>but if you search tantra in google ,it will lead you to a lot of websites on sexual technique ,and kama sutra.</p>
              <p>and about the spelling ,i used to use karma sutra,or it should be kama sutra?</p>
