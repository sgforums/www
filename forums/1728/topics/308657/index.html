              <p>Eckhart Tolle's books are now the topselling books #1, #2, #5, #10 and #22 in Amazon.com. And A New Earth has now entered Oprah's bookclub.</p>
              <p>I highly recommend people reading it if you haven't. They're transformative and practical. You can start with The Power of Now, then read A New Earth. Found in all major bookstores.</p>
              <p>Both The Power of Now (past) and A New Earth (current) have become New York Time Bestsellers #1.</p>

                      Teacher and author was born in Germany and educated at the Universities
                      of London and Cambridge.  At the age of twenty-nine a profound inner
                      transformation radically changed the course of his life.  The next few
                      years were devoted to understanding, integrating and deepening that
                      transformation, which marked the beginning of an intense inward
                      journey.  Later, he began to work in London with individuals and small
                      groups as a counselor and spiritual teacher. Since 1995 he has lived in
                      Vancouver, Canada.<br> <br> Eckhart Tolle is the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller <a href="http://eckharttolle.com/the_power_of_now"><em>The Power of Now</em></a> (translated into 33 languages) and the highly acclaimed follow-up <a href="http://eckharttolle.com/a_new_earth"><em>A New Earth</em></a>, which are widely regarded as two of the most influential spiritual books of our time. <br>   <br> Eckhart’s profound yet simple teachings have already helped countless
                      people throughout the world find inner peace and greater fulfillment in
                      their lives.  At the core of the teachings lies the transformation of
                      consciousness, a spiritual awakening that he sees as the next step in
                      human evolution.  An essential aspect of this awakening consists in
                      transcending our ego-based state of consciousness. This is a
                      prerequisite not only for personal happiness but also for the ending of
                      violent conflict endemic on our planet.<br> <br> Eckhart is a sought-after public speaker and teaches and travels
                      extensively throughout the world.  Many of his talks, intensives and
                      retreats are published on CD and DVD.  Most of the teachings are given
                      in English, but occasionally Eckhart also gives talks in German and
                      Spanish.  In addition to <a href="http://eckharttolle.com/the_power_of_now"><em>The Power of Now</em></a> and <a href="http://eckharttolle.com/a_new_earth"><em>A New Earth</em></a>, Eckhart has written a book designed for meditative reading entitled <a href="http://eckharttolle.com/stillness_speaks"><em>Stillness Speaks</em></a>.  A book consisting of selections from <a href="http://eckharttolle.com/the_power_of_now"><em>The Power of Now</em></a> is also available, entitled <a href="http://eckharttolle.com/practicing_the_power_of_now"><em>Practicing the Power of Now</em></a>.</span></span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><br> To make the journey into <em>The Power of Now</em> we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self,
                                                          the ego, behind. From the beginning of the first chapter we move
                                                          rapidly into a significantly higher altitude where one breathes a
                                                          lighter air, the air of the spiritual. Although the journey is
                                                          challenging, Eckhart Tolle offers simple language and a question and
                                                          answer format to guide us. The words themselves are the signposts.<br> <br> For many of us there are new discoveries to be made along the way: we
                                                          are not our mind; we can find our way out of psychological pain;
                                                          authentic human power is found by surrendering to the Now. We also find
                                                          out that the body is actually one of the keys to entry into a state of
                                                          inner peace, as are the silence and space all around us. Indeed, access
                                                          is everywhere available. These access points, or portals, can all be
                                                          used to bring us into the Now, the present moment, where problems do
                                                          not exist. It is here we find our joy and are able to embrace our true
                                                          selves. It is here we discover that we are already complete and perfect.<br> <br> Many of us will find that our biggest obstacle to this realization is
                                                          our relationships, especially our intimate relationships. But again, we
                                                          are in new territory and all is not what it had seemed before. We come
                                                          to see that our relationships are yet another doorway into spiritual
                                                          enlightenment if we use them wisely, meaning if we use them to become
                                                          more conscious and therefore more loving human beings. The result? Real
                                                          communion between self and others.<br> <br> If we are able to be fully present and take each step in the Now; if we
                                                          are able to feel the reality of such things as the inner-body,
                                                          surrender, forgiveness, and the Unmanifested, we will be opening
                                                          ourselves to the transforming experience of <em>The Power of Now</em>.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span><br> </span><br> </span><br> </span></span></p>

                                                          room, the distant noise of a passing train – everything felt so alien,
                                                          so hostile, and so utterly meaningless that it created in me a deep
                                                          loathing of the world. The most loathsome thing of all, however, was my
                                                          own existence. What was the point in continuing to live with this
                                                          burden of misery? Why carry on with this continuous struggle? I could
                                                          feel that a deep longing for annihilation, for nonexistence, was now
                                                          becoming much stronger than the instinctive desire to continue to live.<br> <br> ‘I cannot live with myself any longer.’ This was the thought that kept
                                                          repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a
                                                          peculiar thought it was. ‘Am I one or two? If I cannot live with
                                                          myself, there must be two of me: the ‘I’ and the ‘self’ that ‘I’ cannot
                                                          live with.’ ‘Maybe,’ I thought, ‘only one of them is real.’<br> <br> I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I
                                                          was fully conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn
                                                          into what seemed like a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at
                                                          first and then accelerated. I was gripped by an intense fear, and my
                                                          body started to shake. I heard the words ‘resist nothing,’ as if spoken
                                                          inside my chest. I could feel myself being sucked into a void. It felt
                                                          as if the void was inside myself rather than outside. Suddenly, there
                                                          was no more fear, and I let myself fall into that void. I have no
                                                          recollection of what happened after that.<br> <br> I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I had
                                                          never heard such a sound before. My eyes were still closed, and I saw
                                                          the image of a precious diamond. Yes, if a diamond could make a sound,
                                                          this is what it would be like. I opened my eyes. The first light of
                                                          dawn was filtering through the curtains. Without any thought, I felt, I
                                                          knew, that there is infinitely more to light than we realize. That soft
                                                          luminosity filtering through the curtains was love itself. Tears came
                                                          into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room. I recognized the
                                                          room, and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it before. Everything
                                                          was fresh and pristine, as if it had just come into existence. I picked
                                                          up things, a pencil, an empty bottle, marvelling at the beauty and
                                                          aliveness of it all. That day I walked around the city in utter
                                                          amazement at the miracle of life on earth, as if I had just been born
                                                          into this world.<br> <br>   <br> </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> For the next five
                                                          months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted deep peace and bliss. After
                                                          that, it diminished somewhat in intensity, or perhaps it just seemed to
                                                          because it became my natural state. I could still function in the
                                                          world, although I realized that nothing I ever did could possibly add
                                                          anything to what I already had.<br> <br> <br> </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> I knew, of course, that
                                                          something profoundly significant had happened to me, but I didn't
                                                          understand it at all. It wasn't until several years later, after I had
                                                          read spiritual texts and spent time with spiritual teachers, that I
                                                          realized that what everybody was looking for had already happened to
                                                          me. I understood that the intense pressure of suffering that night must
                                                          have forced my consciousness to withdraw from its identification with
                                                          the unhappy and deeply fearful self, which is ultimately a fiction of
                                                          the mind. This withdrawal must have been so complete that this false,
                                                          suffering self immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled
                                                          out of an inflatable toy. What was left then was my true nature as the
                                                          ever-present I am: consciousness in its pure state prior to
                                                          identification with form. Later I also learned to go into that inner
                                                          timeless and deathless realm that I had originally perceived as a void
                                                          and remain fully conscious. I dwelt in states of such indescribable
                                                          bliss and sacredness that even the original experience I just described
                                                          pales in comparison. A time came when, for a while, I was left with
                                                          nothing on the physical plane. I had no relationships, no job, no home,
                                                          no socially defined identity. I spent almost two years sitting on park
                                                          benches in a state of the most intense joy.<br> <br> But even the most beautiful experiences come and go. More fundamental,
                                                          perhaps, than any experience is the undercurrent of peace that has
                                                          never left me since then. Sometimes it is very strong, almost palpable,
                                                          and others can feel it too. At other times, it is somewhere in the
                                                          background, like a distant melody.<br>   <br> <br> </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"> Later, people would occasionally come up to me and say: ‘I want what
                                                          you have. Can you give it to me, or show me how to get it?’ And I would
                                                          say: ‘You have it already. You just can’t feel it because your mind is
                                                          making too much noise.’ That answer later grew into my book, ‘The Power
                                                          of Now’.</span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"><br> Building on the astonishing success of <em>The Power of Now</em>,
              Eckhart Tolle presents readers with an honest look at the current state
              of humanity: He implores us to see and accept that this state, which is
              based on an erroneous identification with the egoic mind, is one of
              dangerous insanity.<br> <br> Tolle tells us there is good news, however. There is an alternative to
              this potentially dire situation. Humanity now, perhaps more than in any
              previous time, has an opportunity to create a new, saner, more loving
              world. This will involve a radical inner leap from the current egoic
              consciousness to an entirely new one.<br> <br> In illuminating the nature of this shift in consciousness, Tolle
              describes in detail how our current ego-based state of consciousness
              operates. Then gently, and in very practical terms, he leads us into
              this new consciousness. We will come to experience who we truly
              are—which is something infinitely greater than anything we currently
              think we are—and learn to live and breathe freely. <br> <br> <br> </span></p>

              thing is needful.” (Luke 10:41)<br> <br> As I was writing A New Earth, people would sometimes ask me, “What is
              the new book about?”  And invariably, my answer would be, “I only ever
              write or speak about one thing.”  What is that one thing?  Spiritual
              awakening.  Can a person be awakened spiritually by a book?  Yes, if
              three conditions are met:<br> <br> Firstly, there must be a readiness on the part of the reader, an
              openness, a receptivity to spiritual truth, which is to say, a
              readiness to awaken.  For the first time in history of humanity, large
              numbers of people have reached that point of readiness, which explains
              why millions have responded so deeply to The Power of Now.<br> <br> Secondly, the text must have transformative power.  This means the
              words must have come out of the awakened consciousness rather than the
              accumulated knowledge of a person’s mind.  Only then will a text be
              charged with that power, a power that goes far beyond the informational
              value of the words.  That is why such a book can be read again and
              again and lose none of its aliveness.<br> <br> Thirdly, the terminology used needs to be as neutral as possible so
              that it transcends the confines of any one culture, religion, or
              spiritual tradition.  Only then will it be accessible to a broad range
              of readers world-wide, regardless of cultural background.<br> <br> All these conditions were met in The Power of Now, which is why the book has had such an impact on the collective consciousness.<br> <br> Why write another book?<br> <br> Since the publication of The Power of Now, I have given hundreds of
              talks and teaching sessions all over the world, and in the course of
              those seven years, the teaching evolved.  While the essence remained
              the same (The Truth is timeless.), new perspectives arose, new
              signposts, alternative approaches to the Truth, as well as an added
              sense of urgency.  A New Earth reflects this evolution and this urgency.<br> <br> If The Power of Now worked for you and changed your life – as it did
              for countless people all over the world – there is no need for you to
              read A New Earth (although you may enjoy reading it and may find some
              of it helpful in recognizing the ego and thus sustaining the state of
              Presence).<br> <br> My feeling is that A New Earth will make the teaching (the one thing)
              accessible to an even wider audience, including people who perhaps
              would not have dreamt of reading a “spiritual” book but have within
              them a hitherto unrecognized longing for spiritual awakening.<br> <br> A New Earth will also be extremely helpful for those who read The Power
              of Now, found it interesting, but somehow missed the essence of it.  It
              presents them with new perspectives on the same truth, new signposts,
              pointers towards Presence.  Different pointers work for different
              people.<br> <br> Millions are now ready to awaken because spiritual awakening is not an
              option anymore, but a necessity if humanity and the planet are to
              survive.  Everything is speeding up – the madness, the collective egoic
              dysfunction, as well as the arising of the new consciousness, the
              awakening.<br> <br> We are running out of time.  From the perspective of the ego, that’s
              bad news and will give rise to fear.  From a higher perspective, the
              running out of time is exactly what is needed for the new consciousness
              to come into this world.</span></td>

              <p>Yes they're good and highly recommendable.</p>
              <p>One thing that can be faulted is that there is a lack of insights into Buddhism's Non-Duality/No-Self and Emptiness, and the author mistakes our true nature to be a 'I AM'/'Eternal Witness'/'Pure Observer'/'I AM Everything', as reflected in the writings. (Stage 1 &amp; 2 of <a title="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a>) But these books are not meant to be a sutra on ultimate reality, and I think they are all very practical and worthy of reading.

              <h1><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000;">STILLNESS SPEAKS</span></strong></span></h1>
              <div>
              <h2><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">A book designed for meditative reading</span></strong></h2>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The essence of Eckhart
                  Tolle's message is easy to grasp: If we connect to the stillness
                  within, we move beyond our active minds and emotions and discover great
                  depths of lasting peace, contentment, and serenity. With his
                  bestselling first book, <em>The Power of Now</em>, his message has
                  reached millions of people worldwide. Now, in his much anticipated new
                  book, Tolle gives us the essence of his teaching in short, simple
                  pieces that anyone can easily understand.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Stillness Speaks is
                  organized into ten chapters whose subjects range from "Beyond the
                  Thinking Mind" to "Suffering and the End of Suffering." Each chapter is
                  a mosaic of individual entries, concise and complete in themselves, but
                  profoundly transformative when read as a whole.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Eckhart Tolle
                  understands the spiritual needs of our time. He draws from the essence
                  of all spiritual traditions, expressing these truths in startlingly
                  fresh new ways. The result is a book that is paradoxically both ancient
                  and contemporary, filled with timely and powerful messages. <em>Stillness Speaks</em> can be no less than an awakening for readers willing to give the words a chance to work their quiet magic.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Eckhart Tolle is a
                  contemporary spiritual teacher who is not aligned with any particular
                  religion or tradition. In his writing and seminars, he conveys a simple
                  yet profound message with the timeless and uncomplicated clarity of the
                  ancient spiritual masters: There is a way out of suffering and into
                  peace. Eckhart travels extensively, taking his teachings throughout the
                  world. He lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.</span></p>

                  human consciousness is no longer a luxury, so to speak, available only
                  to a few isolated individuals, but a necessity if humankind is not to
                  destroy itself.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> At the present time, the
                  dysfunction of the old consciousness and the arising of the new are
                  both accelerating. Paradoxically, things are getting worse and better
                  at the same time, although the worse is more apparent because it makes
                  so much ‘noise’.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> The book Stillness
                  Speaks, of course, uses words that in the act of reading become
                  thoughts in your mind. But those are not ordinary thoughts –
                  repetitive, noisy, self-serving, clamouring for attention. Just like
                  every true spiritual teacher, just like the ancient sutras, the
                  thoughts within this book don't say, ‘'Look at me',’ but ‘'Look beyond
                  me'.’ Because the thoughts came out of stillness, they have power – the
                  power to take you back into the same stillness from which they arose.
                  That stillness is also inner peace, and that stillness and peace is the
                  essence of your Being. It is inner stillness that will save and
                  transform the world.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Silence and stillness</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> When you lose touch with
                  inner stillness, you lose touch with yourself. When you lose touch with
                  yourself, you lose yourself in the world.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Your innermost sense of
                  self, of who you are, is inseparable from stillness. This is the I Am
                  that is deeper than name and form.<br> <br> </span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> * * * * *<br> <br> </span></strong> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Stillness is your
                  essential nature. What is stillness? The inner space or awareness in
                  which the words on this page are being perceived and become thoughts.
                  Without the awareness, there would be no perception, no thoughts, no
                  world.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> You are that awareness, disguised as a person.<br> <br> </span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> * * * * *<br> <br> </span></strong> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> The equivalent of external noise is the inner noise of thinking. The equivalent of external silence is inner stillness.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Whenever there is some
                  silence around you – listen to it. That means just notice it. Pay
                  attention to it. Listening to silence awakens the dimension of
                  stillness within yourself, because it is only through stillness that
                  you can be aware of silence.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> See that in the moment of noticing the silence around you, you are not thinking. You are aware, but not thinking.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><strong><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> * * * * *</span></strong><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> When you become aware of
                  silence, immediately there is that state of inner still alertness. You
                  are present. You have stepped out of thousands of years of collective
                  human conditioning.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><strong><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> * * * * *</span></strong><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;">   <br> <br> </span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Look
                  at a tree, a flower, a plant. Let your awareness rest upon it. How
                  still they are, how deeply rooted in Being. Allow nature to teach you
                  stillness.</span><br> <strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;">  <br> <br> </span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> * * * * *</span></strong><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> When you look at a tree
                  and perceive its stillness, you become still yourself. You connect with
                  it at a very deep level. You feel a oneness with whatever you perceive
                  in and through stillness. Feeling the oneness of yourself with all
                  things is true love.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><strong><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> * * * * *</span></strong><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Silence is helpful, but
                  you don't need it in order to find stillness. Even when there is noise,
                  you can be aware of the stillness underneath the noise, of the space in
                  which the noise arises. That is the inner space of pure awareness,
                  consciousness itself.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> You can become aware of
                  awareness as the background to all your sense perceptions, all your
                  thinking. Becoming aware of awareness is the arising of inner stillness.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> * * * * *</span></strong><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Any disturbing noise can
                  be as helpful as silence. How? By dropping your inner resistance to the
                  noise, by allowing it to be as it is, this acceptance also takes you
                  into that realm of inner peace that is stillness.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Whenever you deeply accept this moment as it is - no matter what form it takes - you are still, you are at peace.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;">* * * * *</span></strong><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Pay attention to the gap
                  - the gap between two thoughts, the brief, silent space between words
                  in a conversation, between the notes of a piano or flute, or the gap
                  between the in-breath and the out-breath.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> When you pay attention
                  to those gaps, awareness of ‘'something' becomes - just awareness. The
                  formless dimension of pure consciousness arises from within you and
                  replaces identification with form.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><br>  </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;">* * * * *</span></strong><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> True intelligence operates silently. Stillness is where creativity and solutions to problems are found.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;">* * * * *</span></strong><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Is stillness just the
                  absence of noise and content? No, it is intelligence itself - the
                  underlying consciousness out of which every form is born. And how could
                  that be separate from who you are?</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> The form that you think you are came out of that and is being sustained by it.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> It is the essence of all galaxies and blades of grass; of all flowers, trees, birds, and all other forms.</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><strong><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> * * * * *</span></strong><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Stillness is the only thing in this world that has no form.

                  that humanity needs most at this time?</span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> But what is wisdom and
                  where is it to be found? Wisdom comes with the ability to be still.
                  Just look and just listen. No more is needed. Being still, looking, and
                  listening activates the non-conceptual intelligence within you. Let

              <p> </p>
              <p>What's interesting about spiritual awakening is that's it's simply another aspect of the dream.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who is it who can awaken?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does anything really need to change from the way things are now?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Presence is a non-attainment.</p>
              <p>The more knowledge we gather, the more books about it that we read, the further we goes away from it. The egoic mind is constantly interpreting these knowledges (gathered) and sadly this 'covers' the recognition of Presence.</p>
              <p>After the reading of these books, there must be a phase of discharging 'them'.</p>
              <p>This is just one layer of covering of Presence. There are many more layers that cover Presence and a large part of our journey is about 'uncovering'. Some of these covering are at the mental level. Some of them are also at a bodily and biological level. There are many kinds of grasping ...mental, emotional and bodily level. Many of these impact on us constantly drawing us away from the recognition of Presence... hijacking 'it' with the experience that is collectively  known as the egoic mind.</p>
              <p>I am still uncovering more and more of these 'transparent' coverings. What i meant as transparent covering is that these 'grasping' and pulling into subject/object split is very subtle and automatic that they go unnoticed  most of the time. These can be consider our unconscious and subconscious aspects....part of our karmic conditioning.</p>

              <p>I agree because this is certainly the appearance of a story unfolding, of someone who needs to let go at various levels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I disagree because who is this story attached to?  Who is the person who needs to let go at emotional and other levels???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once that is seen clearly, who's unfolding is it after that???</p>

              <p>Seriously though, what Isis wrote above is correct.  "We" are constantly interpreting and making up the reality of this world through our grasping with the mind. </p>

              <p>Hi Jon,</p>
              <p>What you wrote is very true. Thanks for the sharing.</p>
              <p>Isis's post is very true too.</p>
              <p>The doing is not done by anyone. The '|' is simply the process of the doing. It is not the doer.</p>
              <p>One interesting thing that i have experienced is that even when there is no 'I' there is still transparent layer of grasping that are at a bodily level. For example, when there is no 'i', the body still automatically responds to something or a sensation. This is bodily level conditioning that is below the layer of the mental 'I'.</p>
              <p>For example if you are male, a pretty girl walks by... the body
              instinctly notice it. This is happening largely at a biological
              level... because the same woman that walk by will get a different
              response from say another women. The response of attraction is
              happening at a biological level that has been conditioned for eons for
              the survival of the species and is not cognited at the level of the
              mental 'I'. Perhaps, this is why, sexual desire is one of the last
              pattern to be resolved.</p>
              <p>These layer appears to constantly pull the awareness back towards the mental interpretation layer... which in turn will create the mental 'I'.</p>
              <p>BTW, Jon..</p>
              <p>"who cares' may be a type of grasping too. The very effort of 'can't care less' is the arising of the 'sense of self'. . As long as there is a 'pull', there is some kind of transparent grasping. The tricky part is that the 'pull' envelops an experience in it entirety... so much so that we believe it to be natural. But I am sure, you can tell the difference. 'Who care' that is the trick of the ego-mind feels like indifference. It is the 'desire' to reject the 'concept of self'. True presence is not indiferent but is a vivid spacious aliveness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi Longchen,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, I know what you mean when a pretty lady goes by, the eyes focus there, eye candy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This action or reaction is before thought, it's automatic, but it is always noticed now, watched, I'm always aware it is happening and having a good laugh when it does.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for who cares... caring is happening but no one doing it. Conditioning still arises but it seen for what it is, simply conditioning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes, the little voice in the head arises and is very angry at not being taken seriously anymore.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi Jon,</p>
              <p>What you wrote is very true. Thanks for the sharing.</p>
              <p>Isis's post is very true too.</p>
              <p>The doing is not done by anyone. The '|' is simply the process of the doing. It is not the doer.</p>
              <p>One interesting thing that i have experienced is that even when there is no 'I' there is still transparent layer of grasping that are at a bodily level. For example, when there is no 'i', the body still automatically responds to something or a sensation. This is bodily level conditioning that is below the layer of the mental 'I'.</p>
              <p>For example if you are male, a pretty girl walks by... the body instinctly notice it. This is happening largely at a biological level... because the same woman that walk by will get a different response from say another women. The response of attraction is happening at a biological level that has been conditioned for eons for the survival of the species and is not cognited at the level of the mental 'I'. Perhaps, this is why, sexual desire is one of the last pattern to be resolved.</p>
              <p>These layer appears to constantly pull the awareness back towards the mental interpretation layer... which in turn will create the mental 'I'.</p>
              <p>BTW, Jon..</p>
              <p>"who cares' may be a type of grasping too. The very effort of 'can't care less' is the arising of the 'sense of self'. . As long as there is a 'pull', there is some kind of transparent grasping. The tricky part is that the 'pull' envelops an experience in it entirety... so much so that we believe it to be natural. But I am sure, you can tell the difference. 'Who care' that is the trick of the ego-mind feels like indifference. It is the 'desire' to reject the 'concept of self'. True presence is not indiferent but is a vivid spacious aliveness.</p>

              <p>Indeed!  The bodily reaction will subside gradually if there is total willingness to give up the 'conscious portion'.  Drop drop and drop even that 'knowingness'.  'Fearlessly' enters total cessation!  That will help the bodily 'cells' from contracting and grasping. :)</p>

              <p>Hi Thusness,</p>
              <p>The way you write really ' yi zhen jian xue' (hit the target on the bull's eye) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Sexual desire is one aspect that i really hope to resolve eventually. I will honestly say that it is quite a problem for me. If anybody want to judge me for that is really their own problem..but it is really a problem for me.</p>
              <p>Contrary to popular notion, sexual desire actually increase with spiritual development. This is due to the body becoming more energised. Especially if one practice something like qi qong, the full qi will enhance desire and seek to find a release.</p>
              <p>The 'sense of self' fighting with the desire never really work. The solution, i feel lies with the dropping of the conscious portion in day to day interactions. But first one must 'enter' non-dual, and continue to 'drop' in all environments and situations. I have experience of the desire dissolving due to this dropping and i think this is the solution. I really hope to resolve this aspect soon. It does take a lot of practice and the willingness to 'enter' into more deconstructed 'level' even amidst interaction with the environment.</p>
              <p>At times now, experiences feels like rising and falling waves. The grasping/contracting sensation rise and if it does get caught up into deep engagement, it falls off on it own accord. I don't think this is self-liberation yet... but i hope it is getting closer!!</p>

              <p>ahha...It's alright and usual, so do not feel bad.  If you feel bad, it stays.  Though it may sound ironical but whatever done should not stay.  If possible, try to make it a habit to un-wind through meditating daily with non-dual crystal clear bare sensation.  Staying in naked awareness will prevent the deepening of imprints created.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In seeing, there is always just the seen.</p>
              <p>In hearing, there is always only sound.</p>
              <p>In thinking, there is always only thoughts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the most profound wisdom and the profundity is not in words.  We need many cycles of refining our insights of this truth.  Non-dual becomes effortless when the insight of this truth sinks into our inmost consciousness. </p>
