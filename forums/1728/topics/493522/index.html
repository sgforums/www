              beads are an important part of Buddhist practice and ritual throughout Asia and
              beyond. Although they are generally regarded primarily as tools to aid
              practitioners in counting their prayers, mantras, incantations, and repetitions
              of the names of deities, these strings of beads can be some of the most exquisitely
              crafted objects in the Buddhist artistic realm. Made of materials as diverse as
              wood, crystal, and precious gems, and strung together in varying sizes and
              quantities, Buddhist prayer beads, or rosaries, can be as beautiful as they are
              powerful. Symbolizing important Buddhist concepts, these beads not only serve a
              role in rituals, but also feature prominently in paintings and sculptures of
              Buddhist teachers and deities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Prayer
              beads, or mala in Sanskrit, were likely introduced into Buddhism early in its
              history from other proto-Hindu religious practices in South Asia. Some Buddhist
              rosaries are small, made to be worn around the wrist or held in the hand.
              Others, however, are long enough to be worn as necklaces by priests, typically
              in the esoteric traditions of Tibet and Japan. For priest and lay Buddhist
              alike, the beads are symbolic of the teachings of Buddhism in structure, the
              number of beads, and the material used. Before being knotted, the string is
              passed through a large central bead and two smaller beads. These three
              additional beads keep the others in place and indicate the completion of a
              cycle of telling. They are also said to symbolize the three jewels of
              Buddhism—the Buddha, the Dharma (his teachings), and the Sangha (the monastic
              order). The hidden string that passes through the beads symbolizes the
              penetrating power of all of the Buddhas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Traditionally,
              Buddhist rosaries have 108 beads, representing the number of earthly passions
              and desires that blind and delude us, entrapping us in the cycle of suffering
              and reincarnation, or samsara. The number also represents the 108 forms that
              the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara is able to assume in order to help devotees. It
              is also said that this number was chosen to enable worshippers to repeat the
              sacred name of the Buddha 100 times, the extra beads allowing for any omissions
              made through absent-mindedness in counting or for the loss or breakage of
              beads. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the smaller rosaries, the number of beads is generally divisible by three, for
              example 21, 42, or 54 beads. Many Chinese rosaries, or shu zhu, have only 18
              beads, one for each of the 18 Buddhist holy men, known as arhat in Sanskrit and
              luohan in Chinese. Sometimes very long rosaries are used in special rituals
              held in honor of particular deities. For example, every summer in Kyoto (and in
              some other areas of Japan), children participate in a ceremony to honor the
              bodhisattva Jizo (Sanskrit: Kshitigarbha), a guardian of children in Japanese
              Buddhist belief. The children sit in a circle and pass round a long string of
              prayer beads, known in Japanese as juzu, while priests chant prayers to the
              deity. By touching and passing along the beads (Japanese: juzu-kuri), the
              children symbolically receive the blessing and protection of Jizo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              beads are often made of wood, such as sandalwood or sacred wood from the Bodhi
              tree (Ficus religiosa), under which the Buddha attained enlightenment. Precious
              or semi-precious stones can also be used, including pearls, rubies, amber,
              coral, or jade, as well as gold and other precious metals. In Tibetan Buddhist
              practice, although malas made of wood or seeds from the Bodhi tree can be used
              for any type of mantra, certain mantras require specific beads related to their
              purpose. For pacifying mantras, clear beads such as shell or crystal are used
              since they are believed to help purify the mind and clear away obstacles such
              as illness, bad karma, and mental disturbances. However, very powerful mantras
              used for taming by forceful means and for subduing harmful energies, require great
              skill, compassion, and call for a string of 108 beads made from rudraksha seeds
              from Elaeocarpus trees (mainly Elaeocarpus ganitrus), or even human bones.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              key implements in Buddhist rituals and practice, beads are often represented in
              devotional images of deities and priests or Buddhist patriarchs. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Rosaries
              are also attributes of certain deities. The compassionate Buddha Amitabha is
              sometimes depicted holding a rosary, but it is the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara
              who most often holds prayer beads. In many paintings and sculptures, he is
              shown holding a lotus, a water sprinkler, and a rosary of 108 beads,
              representing his vow to help believers conquer the 108 passions and attain
              enlightenment, and the 108 forms he can assume to this end. In one of his esoteric
              forms, Cintamanichakra Avalokiteshvara (Avalokiteshvara of the Jewel and the
              Wheel), the deity has six arms, each representing a vow to save beings in one
              of the six realms of rebirth and holding a symbolic attribute; the hand holding
              a string of prayer beads represents the realm of beasts.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              with the prayer beads of many spiritual traditions worldwide, mala are among
              the most beautifully crafted objects used by Buddhist practitioners. They are
              also among the most intimate tools used in the spiritual practice of millions
              of Buddhists. Held in the hand and fondled with love and devotion by priest and
              lay practitioner alike, these strings of beads assist in one of the most
              challenging aspects of Buddhist practice—focusing the mind and reining it in
              during the chanting of prayers, mantras, and names of deities. By grasping the
              beads and accepting their guidance, the practitioner edges forward during every
              prayer and every practice on the long journey toward enlightenment.</span></p>
