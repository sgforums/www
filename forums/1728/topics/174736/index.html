Meaning dharma protectors. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In Chinese, the equivalent is the dragons, and the descriptions and appearance is also similar to the Indian Nagas. Dragons DO exist. Last time my master's monastery open, many many people witnessed dragons flying above the monastery. They are the dharma protectors. I also read in E-Sangha before, the same thing happened in another monastery in Singapore. Also many people witnessed nagas flying in the sky.<br><br>We cannot see nagas usually, nagas have the power not to appear or to appear to us, to become small or turn very big, etc.<br><br>The Nagas dwell in the celestial planes and in the sea. And although they are animals with the most blessings in the Animal Realm, they can still be preyed by a type of celestial bird called Garudas. That's how Garuda Airlines (the Indonesia airline) came about. (thanks sanarth for reminding me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">)</div>

(www.dajiyuan.com)<br><br>A photo of two peculiar dragon-shaped objects taken from a plane flying over TibetÂ’s Himalayas piqued many usersÂ’ interest when displayed on a Chinese website. The photographer is an amateur.<br><br>On June 22, 2004, the photographer went to TibetÂ’s Amdo region to attend the Qinghai-to-Xizang Railroad laying ceremony, and then took a plane from Lhasa to fly back inland. When flying over the Himalayas, he accidentally caught these two "dragons" in a picture that he took. He called these two objects "the Tibet dragons."<br><br>Looking at the photo, these two objects appear to have the characteristics of crawling creatures: The bodies seem to be covered by scales, the backs have spine-like protuberances, and also they have gradually thinning rear ends. Although the photo caught only a portion of the entire scene, it was sufficient to create the appearance of two gigantic dragons flying in the clouds.<br><br>This photo, shown on some websites such as post.baidu.com and other forums, aroused the website visitorsÂ’ curiosity. One person commented, Â“No wonder that China is the homeland of the dragon! Nature is truly mysterious and powerful, it can always produce spectacular sights beyond people's expectations.Â”<br><br>Â“Is it really true? Is it possible there is an ancient civilization that we donÂ’t know about preserved in places that are sparsely populated?Â”<br><br>Â“It really looks like the dragons in fables, and I really hope it is.Â”<br><br>Certainly, most website visitors hoped that someone could confirm the authenticity of the dragons in the photo.<br><br><img src="http://img.epochtimes.com/i6/508042832628.jpg"><br>Photo of dragons taken from an airplane above the Himalayas. (www.dajiyuan.com)<br><br>In Chinese fairy tales, the dragon is a kind of rare heavenly creature. Fables say that it can conceal or reveal itself. It ascends to heaven in the spring breeze and dives and hides in deep water in the autumn wind. It can promote clouds and bring about rain. It also became the symbol of imperial authority later on; all emperors of previous dynasties self-designated as dragons, utensils were also decorated with dragons.<br><br>Culturally, the dragon is the Chinese ancestors' totem. Nearly all races in China had fables and stories with dragons as the main subject, such as dragon boat races, the dragon lantern dance to celebrate holidays, sacrificial offerings to the dragons to implore timely wind and rain for good crops.<br><br>Whether this kind of creature really exists is still an unsolved riddle. In the previous dynasties in China, there had been many documents recording eyewitness accounts of magical dragons. The most amazing events are the various "falling dragons," dragons that suddenly fell to the ground under peculiar circumstances, and were witnessed by many. A relatively recent tale occurred in the puppet Manchuria regime in August, 1944. A black dragon fell to the ground at the Chen FamilyÂ’s Weizi Village, about 9.4 miles northwest of Zhaoyuan County, on the south shore of the Mudan River (the old name of a section of Songhua River) in Heilongjiang province. The black dragon was on the verge of death. The eyewitness said that this creature had a horn on its head, scales covering its body, and had a strong fishy smell that attracted numerous flies.<br><br>The records from previous dynasties also mentioned the connection between the emergence of these kinds of mysterious creatures, Â“dragons,Â” and the transition of dynasties on earth. The appearance of TibetÂ’s magical dragon invites our curiosity and imagination.</div>

In buddhist scriptures, that time Buddha was meditating in the forest with the 5 brahmin acestics. Naga King was so envious about Buddha's deep meditation and charisma...so naga king transform himself into a 9 giant headed serpent and sheltered Buddha away from rain and shine.<br><br>There is a saying that this Naga Buddha image is acting as a support backing oneself in face of problems and difficult situations. keke...<br><br>Rahul is an ancient indian astrological mystic demon whom is a planet eater. His feature is always appeared in the form of sharped teeth demon bitting onto a globe of planet with bottom body of a serpent.<br><br>Actually rahul has a story originated from a Hindu verdict....i need sometime to recall and share with u guys if u all interested...keke..<br><br>Rahul is very effective to help you to clear away your obstacles and serious life and death situations...It will helps you to "swallow" all the ill fate and bad luck caused by your astrological changes.<br><br>However, if your luck has changed better and start having a smooth sailing, you shouldn't wear Rahul again as it will "swallow" your good luck as well...<br><br>Anyway, if you wanna wear Rahul for long term...U shld wear it together with Narai (Jatukam) as Rahul is the servant of Narai...<br><br>Anyway, you can verify the above with any Long Phor in Wat Ananda (redhill) or Wat Palelai (bedok walk) if you really interested to find out more details.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you intersted, u can view the following website about Rahul and Jatukam consecration ceremony at Wat Kor Hom (Bangkok 2004)<br><br>http://www.uamulet.com/PNewAmuletBoardDetail.asp?qid=207<br><br></div>
