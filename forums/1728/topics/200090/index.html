They had fully transcended all existence, and were able to perfect the awesome deportment wherever they went.<br><br>They followed the Buddha in turning the wheel and were wonderfully worthy of the bequest.  Stern and pure in the Vinaya, they were great exemplars in the three realms.  Their numberless response-bodies took beings across and liberated them, extricating and rescuing those of the future so they could transcend the bonds of all mundane defilements.<br><br>The names of the leaders were: the Greatly Wise Shariputra, Maha Maudgalyayana, Mahakaushtila, Purnamaitreyaniputra, Subhuti, Upanishad, and others.<br><br>Moreover, numberless Pratyekabuddhas who were beyond learning and those of initial resolve came to where the Buddha was.  All the Bhikshus were there as well, having the Pravarana at the close of the summer retreat.<br><br>And there were also Bodhisattvas from the ten directions, who desired counsel in order to resolve their doubts.  All were respectful and obedient to the Awesome But Compassionate One as they prepared to seek the Secret Meaning.<br><br>Then the TathÃ¡gata arranged his seat, sat quietly and peacefully, and for the sake of everyone in the assembly, proclaimed the profound and mysterious.  At the banquet of Dharma, what the members of the pure assembly obtained was unprecedente<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The ImmortalÂ’s kalavinka-sound pervaded the worlds of the ten directions and Bodhisattvas as many as the GangeÂ’s sands gathered at the Way-place with Manjushri as their leader.<br><br>On the day of mourning, King Prasenajit, for the sake of his father, the former king, arranged a vegetarian feast and invited the Buddha to the side rooms of the palace.  He welcomed the TathÃ¡gata with a vast array of superb delicacies of unsurpassed, wonderful flavors and himself invited the Great Bodhisattvas, as well.<br><br>Elders and laypeople of the city were also prepared to provide meals for the Sangha at the same time, and they stood waiting for the Buddha to come and receive offerings.<br><br>The Buddha commanded Manjushri to assign the Bodhisattvas and Arhats to receive offerings from the various vegetarian hosts.<br><br>Only Ã�nanda, who had traveled far to accept a special invitation earlier, and had not yet returned, was late for the apportioning of the Sangha.  No senior Bhikshu or Acharya was with him, and so he was returning alone on the road.<br><br>On that day Ã�nanda had received no offerings, and so at the appropriate time he took up his alms bowl and, as he traveled through the city, received alms in sequential order.<br><br>As he set out to receive alms from the first to the last donors, his vegetarian hosts, he thought not to question whether they were pure or impure; whether they were kshatriyas of honorable name or chandalas.  While practicing equality and compassion he would not select merely the lowly but was determined to perfect all beingsÂ’ limitless merit and virtue.<br><br>Ã�nanda was aware that the TathÃ¡gata, the World Honored One, had admonished Subhuti and Mahakashyapa for being Arhats whose minds were not fair and equal.  He revered the TathÃ¡gataÂ’s instructions on impartiality for saving everyone from doubt and slander.<br><br>Having crossed the city moat; he walked slowly through the outer gates, his manner stern and proper as he strictly respected the rules for obtaining vegetarian food.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At that time, because Ã�nanda was receiving alms in sequential order, he passed by a house of prostitution and was waylaid by a powerful artifice.  On the strength of KapilaÂ’s mantra, which came from the Brahma Heaven, the daughter of Matangi drew him onto an impure mat.<br><br>With her licentious body she caressed him until he was on the verge of destroying the precept-substance.<br><br>The TathÃ¡gata, knowing Ã�nanda was being taken advantage of by an impure artifice, finished the meal and immediately returned to the Sublime Abode.  The king, great officials, elders, and laypeople followed along after the Buddha desiring to hear the essentials of the Dharma.<br><br>Then the World Honored One from his crown emitted hundreds of rays of jeweled light, which dispelled all fear.  Within the light appeared a thousand-petal jeweled lotus, upon which was seated a transformation-body Buddha in full-lotus posture, proclaiming a spiritual mantra.<br><br>Shakyamuni Buddha commanded Manjushri to take the mantra and go provide protection, and, when the evil mantra was dispelled, to support Ã�nanda and MatangiÂ’s daughter and encourage them to return to where the Buddha was.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shurangama Sutra<br>Volume 1, Part Two<br><br>Ã�nanda saw the Buddha, bowed, and wept sorrowfully, regretting that from time without beginning he had been preoccupied with erudition and had not yet perfected his strength in the Way.  He respectfully and repeatedly requested an explanation of the initial expedients of the wonderful shamatha, Samapatti, and Dhyana, by means of which the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions had realized Bodhi.<br>At that time Bodhisattvas as numerous as GangesÂ’ sands, great Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, and others from the ten directions, were also present. Pleased at the opportunity to listen, they withdrew quietly to their seats to receive the sagely instruction.<br>Then, in the midst of the great assembly, the World Honored One extended his golden arm, rubbed Ã�nandaÂ’s crown, and said to Ã�nanda and the great assembly, "There is a samÃ¡dhi called the King of the Foremost Shurangama at the Great BuddhaÂ’s Crown Replete with the Myriad Practices; it is a path wonderfully adorned and the single door through which the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions gained transcendence.  You should now listen attentively.Â”  Ã�nanda bowed down to receive the compassionate instruction humbly.<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "You and I are of the same family and share the affection of this natural relationship.  At the time of your initial resolve, what were the outstanding characteristics which you saw in my Dharma that caused you to suddenly cast aside the deep kindness and love found in the world?"  Ã�nanda said to the Buddha, "I saw the Thus Come OneÂ’s thirty-two hallmarks, which were so supremely wonderful and incomparable that his entire body had a shimmering translucence just like that of crystal.<br>"I often thought that those hallmarks could not have been born of desire and love.  Why?  The vapors of desire are course and murky.  From foul and putrid intercourse comes a turbid mixture of pus and blood, which cannot give off such a magnificent, pure, and brilliant concentration of purple-golden light.  And so I eagerly gazed upward, followed the Buddha, and let the hair fall from my head."<br>The Buddha said, "Very good, Ã�nanda.  You should know that from beginning less time all beings are continually born and continually die, simply because they do not know the everlasting true mind with its pure nature and bright substance.  Instead they engage in false thinking. These thoughts are not true, and so they lead to further transmigration<br></div>

Where is the Jeta Grove that you are gazing at?"<br>"World Honored One, this great many-storied pure lecture hall is in the Garden of the Benefactor of the Solitary.  At present the Jeta Grove is, in fact, outside the hall."<br>"Ã�nanda, as you are now in the hall, what do you see first?"<br>"World Honored One, here in the hall I first see the Thus Come One, next I see the great assembly, and from there, as I gaze outward, I see the grove and the garden."<br>"Ã�nanda, how are you able to see the grove and the garden."<br>"World Honored One, since the doors and windows of this great lecture hall have been thrown open wide, I can be in the hall and see into the distance."<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "It is as you say. When one is in the lecture hall and the doors and windows are open wide, one can see far into the garden and the grove. Could someone in the hall not see the Thus Come One and yet see outside the hall?"<br>Ã�nanda answered: "World Honored One, to be in the hall and not see the Thus Come One, and yet see the grove and fountains is impossible."<br>"Ã�nanda, you are like that too.<br><span style="color: blue;">"Your mind is capable of understanding everything thoroughly.  Now if your present mind, which thoroughly understands everything, were in your body, then you should first be aware of what is inside your body.

For example, a lamp lit in a room will certainly illumine the inside of the room first, and only then will its light stream through the doorway to reach the recesses of the hall.  BeingsÂ’ not being able to see within their bodies but only see outside them is analogous to having a lighted lamp placed outside the room, so that it cannot illumine the room.<br>"This principle is clear and beyond all doubt. It is identical with the BuddhaÂ’s complete meaning, isnÂ’t it?"<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "All these Bhikshus, who just followed me to the city of Shravasti to go on sequential alms rounds to obtain balls of food, have returned to the Jeta Grove. I have already finished eating. Observing the Bhikshus, do you think that by one person eating everyone gets full?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ã�nanda answered, "No, World Honored One.  Why?  Although these Bhikshus are Arhats, their physical bodies and lives differ.  How could one personÂ’s eating enable everyone to be full?"<br>The Buddha told Ã�nanda, "If your mind which is aware, knows, and sees were actually outside your body, your body and mind would be mutually exclusive and would have no relationship to one another.  The body would be unaware of what the mind perceives, and the mind would not perceive the awareness within the body.<br>"Now as I show you my hand which is soft like tula-cotton, does your mind distinguish it when your eyes see it?"<br>Ã�nanda answered, "Yes, World Honored One."<br>The Buddha told Ã�nanda, "If the two have a common perception, how can the mind be outside the body?<br>"Therefore you should know that declaring that the mind which knows, understands, and is aware is outside the body is an impossible statement."<br>Amanda said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, it is as the Buddha has said. Since I cannot see inside my body, my mind does not reside in the body.  Since my body and mind have a common awareness, they are not separate and so my mind does not dwell outside my body.  As I now consider the matter, I know exactly where my mind is."<br>The Buddha said: "So, where is it now?"<br>Ã�nanda said, "Since the mind which knows and understands does not perceive what is inside but can see outside, upon reflection I believe it is concealed in the organ of vision.<br>"This is analogous to a person placing crystal lenses over his eyes; the lenses would cover his eyes but would not obstruct his vision. The organ of vision would thus be able to see, and discriminations could be made accordingly.<br>"And so my mind is aware and knows, understands, and is aware does not see within because it resides in the organ: it can gaze outside clearly, without obstruction for the same reason: it is concealed in the organ."<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "Assuming that it is concealed in the organ, as you assert in your analogy of the crystals, if a person were to cover his eyes with the crystals and looks at the mountains and rivers, would he see the crystals as well?"<br>"Yes, World Honored One, if that person were to cover his eyes with the crystals, he would in fact see the crystals."<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "If your mind is analogous to the eyes covered with crystals, then when you see the mountains and rivers, why donÂ’t you see your eyes?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"If you could see your eyes, your eyes would be part of the external environment, but that is not the case.  If you cannot see them, why do you say that the aware and knowing mind is concealed in the organ of vision as eyes are covered by crystals?<br>"Therefore you should know that you state the impossible when you say that the mind which knows, understands, and is aware is concealed in the organ of vision in the way that the eyes are covered by crystals."<br>Ã�nanda said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, I now offer this reconsideration: viscera and bowels lie inside the bodies of living beings, while the apertures are outside.  There is darkness within where the bowels are and light at the apertures.<br>"Now, as I face the Buddha and open my eyes, I see light: that is seeing outside.  When I close my eyes and see darkness that is seeing within.  How does that principle sound?"<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "When you close your eyes and see darkness, does the darkness you experience lie before your eyes or not?  If it did lie before your eyes, then the darkness would be in front of your eyes.  How could that be said to be Â‘withinÂ’?<br>"If it were within, then when you were in a dark room without the light of sun, moon, or lamps, the darkness in the room would constitute your vital organs and viscera. If it were not before you, how could you see it?<br>"If you assert that there is an inward seeing that is distinct from seeing outside, then when you close your eyes and see darkness, your would be seeing inside your body.  Consequently, when you open your eyes and see light, why canÂ’t you see your own face?<br>"If you cannot see your face, then there can be no seeing within.  If you could see your face, then your mind, which is aware and knows and your organ of vision as well would have to be suspended in space.  How could they be inside?<br>"If they were in space, then they would not be part of your body.  Otherwise the Thus Come One who now sees your face should be part of your body as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"In that case, when your eyes perceived something, your body would remain unaware of it.  If you press the point and insist that the body and eyes each have awareness, then you should have two perceptions, and your one body should eventually become two Buddhas.<br>"Therefore you should know declaring that to see darkness is to see within is an impossible statement."<br>Ã�nanda said to the Buddha, "I have often heard the Buddha instruct the four assemblies that since the mind arises, every kind of dharma arises and that since dharmas arise, every kind of mind arises.<br>"As I now consider it, the substance of that very consideration is truly the nature of my mind.  Wherever it joins with things, the mind exists in response.<br>It does not exist in any of the three locations of inside, outside and in between."<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "Now you say that because dharmas arise, every kind of mind arises.  Wherever it joins with things, the mind exists in response.  But it has no substance; the mind cannot come together with anything.  If, having no substance, it could yet come together with things, that would constitute a nineteenth realm brought about by a union with the seventh defiling object. But there is no such principle.<br>"If it had substance, when you pinch your body with your fingers, would your mind which perceives it come out from the inside, or in from the outside?  If it came from the inside, then, once again, it should be able to see within your body.  If it came from outside, it should see your face first."<br>Ã�nanda said, "Seeing is done with the eyes; mental perception is not.  To call mental perception seeing doesnÂ’t make sense."<br>The Buddha said, "Supposing the eyes did the seeing. That would be like being in a room where the doors could see! Also, when a person has died but his eyes are still intact, his eyes should see things.  But how could one be dead if one can still see?<br>"Furthermore, Ã�nanda, if your aware and knowing mind in fact had substance, then would it be of a single substance or of many substances?  Would its substance perceive the body in which it resides or would it not perceive it?<br>"Supposing it were of a single substance, then when you pinched one limb with your fingers, the four limbs would be aware if it.  If they all were aware if it, the pinch could not be at any one place.  If the pinch is located in one place, then the single substance you propose could not exist.<br></div>

Which of those substances would be you?<br>"Supposing it were composed of a pervasive substance: the case would be the same as before in the instance of pinching. But supposing it were not pervasive; then when you touched your head and touched your foot simultaneously, the foot would not perceive being touched if the head did.  But that is not how you are.<br>"Therefore you should know that declaring that wherever it comes together with things, the mind exists in response is an impossible statement."<br>Ã�nanda said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, I also have heard the Buddha discuss reality with Manjushri and other disciples of the Dharma King.  The World Honored One also said, Â‘The mind is neither inside nor outside.Â’<br>"As I now consider it, it cannot be inside since it cannot see within, and it cannot be outside since in that case there would be no shared perception.  Since it cannot see inside, it cannot be inside; and since the body and mind do have shared perception, it does not make sense to say it is outside.  Therefore, since there is a shared perception and since there is no seeing within, it must be in the middle."<br>The Buddha said, "You say it is in the middle.  That middle must not be haphazard or without a fixed location.  Where is this middle that you propose?  Is it in an external place, or is it in the body?<br>"If it were in the body, the surface of the body cannot be counted as being the middle.  If it were in the middle of the body, that would be the same as being inside.  If it were in an external place, would there be some evidence of it, or not?  If there would not be any evidence of it, that amounts to it not existing at all.  If there were some evidence of it, then it would have no fixed location.<br>"Why not?  Suppose that middle were indicated by a marker.  When seen from the east, it would be to the west, and when seen from the south, it would be to the north.  Just as such a tangible marker would be unclear, so too the location of the mind would be chaotic."<br>Ã�nanda said, "The middle I speak of is neither one of those. As the World Honored One has said, the eyes and forms are the conditions, which create the eye-consciousness.  The eyes make discriminations; forms have no perception, but a consciousness is created between them: that is where my mind is."<br>The Buddha said, "If your mind were between the eyes and their object, would such a mindÂ’s substance combine with the two or not?<br>"If it did combine with the two, then objects and the mind-substance would form a chaotic mixture.  Since objects have no perception, while the substance has perception, the two would stand in opposition.  Where could the middle be? If it did not combine with the two, it would then be neither the perceiver nor the perceived. Since it would lack both substance and nature, what would such a middle be like?<br>"Therefore you should know that declaring the mind to be in the middle is an impossible statement."<br>Ã�nanda said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, when I have seen the Buddha turn the Dharma Wheel in the past with Mahamaudgalyayana, Subhuti, Purna, and Shariputra, four of the great disciples, he often said that the nature of the mind which is aware, perceives, and makes discriminations is located neither within nor outside nor in the middle; it is not located anywhere at all. That very non-attachment to everything is what is called the mind.  Therefore, is my non-attachment my mind?"<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "You say that the mind with its aware nature that perceives and makes discriminations is not located anywhere at all. Everything existing in the world consists of space, the waters, and the land, the creatures that fly and walk, and all external objects.  Would your non-attachment also exist?<br>"If it did not exist, it would be the same as fur on a tortoise or horns on a rabbit. Just what would that non-attachment be?<br>"If non-attachment did exist, it couldnÂ’t be described as a negation. The absence of attributes indicates negation. Anything not negated has attributes. Anything with attributes exists. How could that define non-attachment?<br>"Therefore you should know that to declare that the aware, knowing mind is non-attachment to anything is an impossible statement."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The BuddhaÂ’s awesome spirit caused all the realms to unite into a single one.<br>In these realms all the great Bodhisattvas, while remaining in their own countries, put their palms together, and listened.<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "From beginning less time onward, all living beings and in all kinds of upside down ways, have created seeds of karma which naturally run their course, like the aksha cluster.<br>"The reason that cultivators cannot accomplish unsurpassed Bodhi, but instead reach the level of Hearers or of those enlightened to conditions, or become accomplished in externalist ways as heaven-dwellers or as demon kings or as members of the demonsÂ’ retinues<br>is that they do not know the two fundamental roots and so are mistaken and confused in their cultivation. They are like one who cooks sand in the hope of creating savory delicacies.  They may do so for as many eons as there are motes of dust, but in the end they will not obtain what they want.<br>"What are the two?  Ã�nanda, the first is the root of beginning less birth and death, which is the mind that seizes upon conditions and that you and all living beings now make use of, taking it to be your own nature.<br>"The second is the primal pure substance of beginning less Bodhi Nirvana.  It is the primal bright essence of consciousness that can bring forth all conditions.  Due to these conditions, you consider it to be lost.<br>"Having lost sight of that original brightness, although beings use it to the end of their days, they are unaware of it, and unintentionally enter the various destinies.<br>"Ã�nanda, now you wish to know about the path of shamatha with the hope of quitting birth and death. I will now question you further."<br>Then the Thus Come One raised his golden-colored arm and bent his five webbed fingers as he asked Ã�nanda, "Do you see?"<br>Ã�nanda said, "I see."<br>The Buddha said, "What do you see?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ã�nanda said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, I am the BuddhaÂ’s favorite cousin.  It is because my mind loved the Buddha that I was led to leave the home life. With my mind I not only makes offerings to the Thus Come One, but also, in passing through lands as many as the grains of sand in the Ganges River to serve all Buddhas and good, wise advisors, and in marshalling great courage to practice every difficult aspect of the Dharma, I always use my mind. Even if I were to slander the Dharma and eternally sever my good roots, it would also be because of this mind. If this is not my mind, then I have no mind, and I am the same as a clod of earth or a piece of wood, because nothing exists apart from this awareness and knowing.<br>"Why does the Thus Come One say this is not my mind?  I am startled and frightened and not one member of the great assembly is without doubt. I only hope that the World Honored One will regard us with great compassion and instruct those who have not yet awakened."<br>Then the World Honored One gave instruction to Ã�nanda and the great assembly, wishing to cause their minds to enter the state of patience with the non-existence of beings and dharmas.<br>From the lionÂ’s seat he rubbed Ã�nandaÂ’s crown and said to him, "The Thus Come One has often said that all dharmas that arise are only manifestations of the mind.  All causes and effects, the worlds as many as fine motes of dust, take on substance because of the mind.<br>"Ã�nanda, if we regard all the things in the world, including blades of grass and strands of silk, examining them at their fundamental source, each is seen to have a nature, even empty space has a name and an appearance.<br></div>

Then who would be left to cultivate and attain patience with the non-existence of beings and dharmas?"<br>At that point Ã�nanda and everyone in the great assembly was speechless and at a total loss.<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "There are cultivators in the world who, although they realize the nine successive stages of samadhi, do not achieve the extinction of outflows or become Arhats, all because they are attached to birth and death and false thinking and mistake these for what is truly real.  That is why now, although you are highly erudite, you have not realized sage hood."<br>When Ã�nanda heard that, he again wept sorrowfully, placed his five limbs on the ground, knelt on both knees, put his palms together and said to the Buddha. "Since I followed the Buddha and left home, I have relied on the BuddhaÂ’s awesome spirit.  I have often thought, Â‘There is no reason for me to toil at cultivationÂ’ expecting that the Tathagata would bestow samadhi upon me.  I never realized that he could not stand in for me in body or mind.  Thus, I lost my original mind and although my body has left the home-life, my mind has not entered the Way.  I am like the poor son who renounced his father and roamed around.<br>Therefore, today I realize that although IÂ’m greatly learned, if I do not cultivate, it amounts to having not learned anything; just as someone who only speaks of food will never get full."<br>"World Honored one, now we all are bound by two obstructions and as a consequence do not perceive the still, eternal nature of the mind.  I only hope the TathÃ¡gata will empathize with us poor and destitute ones, disclose the wonderful bright mind, and open our Way-eyes."<br></div>

Try consulting a blind man on a street: Â‘What do you see?Â’ Any blind person will certainly answer, Â‘Now I see only darkness in front of my eyes.

How can that be called seeing?"<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "Is there any difference between the darkness seen by blind people, who do not have the use of their eyes, and the darkness seen by someone who has the use of his eyes when he is in a dark room?"<br>"Stated in that way, World Honored One, there is no difference between the two kinds of blackness, that seen by a person in a dark room and that seen by the blind."<br>"Ã�nanda, if the person without the use of his eyes who sees only darkness were suddenly to regain his sight and see all kinds of forms, and you say it is his eyes which see, then when a person in a dark room who sees only darkness suddenly sees all kinds of forms because a lamp is lit, you should say it is the lamp which sees.<br>"If the lamp did the seeing, it would be endowed with sight.
