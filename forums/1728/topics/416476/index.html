              <blockquote>
              <p>From these descriptions it is found natural for Mahayanists psychologically to deny the existence of an ego-soul or ego-substance in the Alaya, and ontologically to insist that the tragedy of life comes from believing in the substantiality or finality of an individual object. The former is technically called the doctrine of Pudgalanairatmya, egolessness of persons,<sup>1</sup> and the latter that of Dharmanairatmya, egolessness of things; the one denies the reality of an ego-soul and the other the ultimacy of an individual object.</p>

              <p>i think arahat attained selflessness of person, they achieve nirvana/enlightenment, sort of leave samsara already.  bodhisattva on the other hand need to stay in samsara to help beings, hence they postpone their nirvana/enlightenment. then to stay in samsara, they need selflessness of phenomena, to get them through the difficuties of suffering in samsara.</p>

The reason an Arahant is considered spiritually less advanced than a Bodhisattva by the Mahayanist, is on the ground that, as their spiritual cultivation is for self advancement only, there is still some residue of a ‘self’ in them. This is unlike a Bodhisattva, whose cultivation is based on the well-being of all sentient beings.</span></span></p>

              <p>make no mistake, the knowledge, perfections and skills gained by arhats and Bodhisatvva are vastly different. The Bodhisatvva has to practise many eons so that he is ready to be a Sammasam Buddha to reveal and teach the world when the time for him to be a Buddha.</p>
              <p>arhats no need to spend so many aeons practising perfections unlike the Bodhisatvva. However that is not to say arhats path is any easier. Buddha once remarked, when he saw a group of ants and said thus. A few Buddhas have come to this earth, they have been ants since.</p>

              <p><strong>THE WHOLE ONE </strong></p>
              <p>When master Du Shun was asked “Are everything exist?”, he answered “No, everything are empty, do not have their original nature, because everything arise depending on conditions”. Asked “So everything should be empty and not exist?”, answered “Also no, because everything have been existing ever since beginningless time”. Asked, “In this case, everything are exist and also empty?”, answered “No, [the exist] and [the empty] already become ONE, there is no dualistic appearance, just like gold and gold product are the same originally”. Asked, “So everything must be [not exist] and [not empty]?”, answered, “No, not like that, we can say that everything is exist and also empty, because of that, everything can exist simultaneously without interfering with one another”. Asked, “Everything that arise depending on conditions must be empty eventually?”, answered “Also no, because The Exist and The empty are mixed together, and all lose their own appearance, therefore everything do not exist anymore”.<br><br>The point for the above conversation is that master Du Shun always change his standpoint for answering the questions. We can say that master Du Shun does not have any standpoint, or he does not persist in his own opinions, or his answers are from the standpoint of the WHOLE ONE.<br><br>IF we think deeper for those all “NO” answers, the real intention of master Du Shun was trying to help [the questioner] to get rid of persisting in all kinds of passions. Because the “NO” is the sign for all negatives, the “NO” is also close to the “Empty’ too.<br><br>There was an old monk sitting in the room, doing nothing with one of his students standing behind him. Two of his students, student A and B were arguing about something outside the room, after a while, student A rushed into the room, giving the description of the argument to the old monk, and asking “Master, am I right?”, the old monk answering “You are right”, student A rushing to student B who is outside the room, few minutes later, student B also rushing to the room and giving his opinion about the argument to the old monk, and asking the same question “Master, am I right?”, the old monk answering “You are right”, student B so happy and leaving the room, in this moment the student behind the old monk asking the old monk with whispering voice “Master, if A is right, B must be wrong, if B is right, A must be wrong, how come they are all [right]?”, the old monk answering “You are right too”.<br><br>Because the old monk is already the WHOLE ONE, he can accept all kinds of opinions - he can also give negative answers to his students like “You are wrong”.<br><br>~Hank Fu</p>
