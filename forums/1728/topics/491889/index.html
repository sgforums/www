              by the West as part of a 21st century modern lifestyle, but in the East, youth
              are increasingly distancing themselves from their Buddhist heritage becoming
              “free thinkers” or even embracing Christianity from the West. A group of young
              Buddhist musicians from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have now come
              together to reverse this trend by using music to attract youth.</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>

              Buddhist musical show at the prestigious Esplanade arts centre here called
              “Sadhu for the Music” to mark the Vesak festival. The two shows on May 4 and 5
              were a sell-out filling up all four levels of the large concert hall’s

              recent conference here an academic has provided statistics, which showed declining
              interest in Buddhism in Singapore among the youth. “That caught my attention
              and I wanted to see how we can capture the interest of this younger generation
              as well as nominal Buddhists,” he explained. “Every youth today carry a mobile
              phone and they listen to music on it. Or watch movies. Probably we can use
              music as a starter to reach via the media they are closely associated with.”</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>

              President of BGFM agrees. “Before we can start telling people about Dhamma, our
              first challenge is to persuade them to come and listen,” he argues. “And good
              music certainly has the power of attraction.”</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>

              well aware of the power of Gospel Music that has helped to attract youth in the
              region to Christianity in large numbers. The production ‘Sadhu of the Music’
              had a great influence of this genre of music in its presentation style but the
              lyrics were well crafted with Buddhist ideas and even chants from the sutras
              (Buddha’s sermons).</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>

              kung fu and tai chi movements. None of the dancers or singers wore any batiks,

              admits that she has been profoundly influenced by Christian gospel music
              because her family in Malaysia was very musical and at the time of her
              childhood there was no Buddhist music for her to listen to. “I think gospel
              music has gone a long way … because of the nature of religion. Buddhists are
              more inward and Westerners and Christians are more expressive in their
              religious activity… they are well ahead of us,” she said.</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>

              renowned for their conservatism and many older monks still shun the use of
              music in propagating the religion, fearing that it will dilute the traditional
              monastic chanting culture mainly based on Pali language of the Buddha’s time,
              which no one speaks today.</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>

              of the first to pen Buddhist songs in the 1970s recalled in a message written
              for the concert program that when they started singing Buddhist songs at the
              Buddhist Mahavihare in Bricksfield, Kuala Lumpur, some temple elders had gone to
              the high priest and complained about them singing in the pagoda.</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>

              scolded by the late Chief (Venerable K Sri Dhammananda) who said that if they
              were not open to new ideas, the temple would soon be bereft of young people,”
              recalls Prof Wee.</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>

              because the world has changed, youth are very much connected with the world and
              they are exposed to high standards of music. “Their taste is different and if
              you want them to come and relate to religion you have to do it their way,” she argues.
              “My mission was given by the BFS to create a platform for youth to come and
              enjoy the music.”</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>

              program together Imee has “polished up some of the gems lying around,” some of
              these Buddhist compositions were written in the 1980s. “ The productions were
              not very professional as they did not have good facilities at the time and they
              were basically home made,” she notes. “I was given over hundred CDs to pick up
              good pieces and also lyrics to put up the show.”</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Ang says that not all
              monks are opposed to using music to propagate Buddhism. “We approach older
              venerables for advice and many of them gave us examples of how in older days
              music was part of the promotion of Buddhism. They were supportive, only a few
              were not receptive,” he said, adding: “Buddha used different vehicles to get
              the message across to different individuals … there is no one vehicle.”</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The show was put
              together in six chapters, each included about 4 songs and reflected a theme
              based on Buddha’s teaching, with the last chapter representing compassion with
              a wish “may you all be well and happy”.</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>“This is a very good
              platform for Buddhists of different countries to come together and experience
              Buddhism in a way that we don’t usually do,” said Kan Rong Hui, one of the
              Singaporean youth performers. “I also found out that Imee was involved and her
              standards are good. So I wanted to be part of it.”</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>“It’s not that we are
              backward compared to gospel music; it’s that we never saw music as a platform
              to spread the message,” argues Imee, who plans to transform the ancient sutras
              into songs. She says that there is a growing Buddhist musical movement across
              Asia and they need to start networking among themselves. “They are all
              disconnected,” she adds, “someone look at me and say oh Buddhist music has gone
              international.”</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>One of the biggest
              drawbacks Buddhist musicians face is that Asian Buddhists are not yet used to
              fund such cultural activities on a grand scale. They are more willing to fund
              building grand temples or huge Buddha statues.</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>“If it’s something
              physical you get money easily,” notes Ang. “When it’s something soft like
              Dhamma through music, (building) relationships is very important. That is why
              BFS team had to go to temples to establish relationships with abbots and
              businessmen. “We have to convince them that it’s important to reach out to the
              youth in a very contemporary manner … to give them a taste of the Dhamma and
              from there you can make progress,” he adds.</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>

              effective but we need to use (the idea) wisely,” Ang argues. “In propagating
              (the religion) we are pretty strong in meditation, eventually that is where we
              want people to get into learning the Dhamma and practicing meditation.”</span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Addressing those who
              have reservations about using music to propagate Buddhism, Prof Wee says that
              in his four decades of producing Buddhist songs and music “many of my friends
              who sang with me have remained Buddhist practitioners, some going on to become
              serious meditation practitioners, Dhamma teachers and Buddhist leaders.”</span></span></p>
