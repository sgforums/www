              <p>When we learn to be more patient, It isn't learnt by reading books or saying or talking about it, we need someone and a situation that provide us a condition to train in khanti. Whether you live in a rural village or modern city, each of the people have their own degree of suffering,and each for their own reasons. Someone's suffering allows one to practise compassion.</p>
              <p>One can be a happy poor man and another a unhappy rich man. A wise man knows how to appreciate what that they have.</p>

              <p><br>My friend, yeap. A good meditator can detect the many different type of subtle defilement in the mind. If im not wrong, there are 84000 mental defilement.</p>
              <p>Since the defilement comes and goes, it does not have inherent existence. Does it  exist in your mind before you start to feel angry or sorrowful etc ?</p>
              <p><em>Is goodness a thing? Is evil? Do happiness and suffering have a shape? No. Are they round or square? How short or long? Do you know? </em></p>
              <p>The mind that perceive the same thing could receive the same thing as pleasure while others could receive the same thing as sorrow. It is funny that for the same thing, different people perceive it differently. So what exactly is this thing? Shouldn't the thing be perceived as all should have perceived it as it is.. if it has inherent existence ?</p>
              <p>A bowl of noodles taste good or not so good but after you leave the bowl of noodle for a day. What will happen to it then? The noodle turns bad, smells bad and become soggy. What is the nature of this bowl of noodle ?<em> </em>Does it has a concrete and solid nature that does not change? Does it depends on other condition to preserve the noodles? </p>
              <p>Even if one lives in the city, does it means for one who live in the rural area does not have that particular defilement ? Since aeons of endless pastlife, all of us ( the unenlightened ones ) have committed bad karma primarily due to our ignorance, greed and ill-will intention .</p>
              <p>It is not because of you are poor that you have less craving. A poor person can crave for wealth and power because they want to get out of poverty. A rich person can be contented with what they have and does not crave. Craving does not applied just on wealth. Craving can occur when something pleasurable is lost or desired and we self-grasp for it.</p>
              <p>Since self-grasping is suffering brought by ourselves.</p>
              <p>Then the liberator is also ourselves.</p>
              <p>My few cents.</p>

              <p>Our ignorance yeah? Ignorance in the sense that is a fixed self and duality.</p>
              <p>Zen teacher John Daido Loori said,</p>
              <p><em><strong>A</strong>ccording to the Buddhist point of view, nonattachment is exactly the opposite of separation. You need two things in order to have attachment: the thing you’re attaching to, and the person who’s attaching. In nonattachment, on the other hand, there’s unity. There’s unity because there’s nothing to attach to. If you have unified with the whole universe, there’s nothing outside of you, so the notion of attachment becomes absurd. Who will attach to what?</em></p>
              <p>Once a fellow Zen student left a briefcase in a taxi. He began to worry about the briefcase, he said, and then he recognized that worrying is attachment. In order to worry, he had to conceptualize himself as a limited, finite being separated from something else, a briefcase. That's attachment, and it's also separation. <em>You can't attach to something unless you perceive yourself as separate from it</em>. &lt;!--more--&gt;</p>
              <p>(He got his briefcase back, by the way.)</p>

              <p>Yup. People feel sad and grief when something that they have treasured is damaged or taken away from them etc.</p>
              <p>In my opinion ( my few cents ), the attachment is due to our ignorance. I could say the car is merely a condition or an illusion for us to cling on. The car is just the car. For elightened beings, they realize the dharma, by awakening to impermance and non-self.</p>
