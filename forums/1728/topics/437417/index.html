              hi to all buddhist brother/sister here,
              
              i am planning to backpack to all the Buddhist temples, Taoist temples and Hindu Temples in China, Taiwan, Japan, Mynmar, Thailand, India and Tibet.
              
              i am starting to collect all the info to help me to backpack easier.  Will appreciate if anyone who has backpack to any of the country above to share with me your experiences.
              
              I can't find any backpacking forum here. I also need to start a blog to keep in touch with my family and friends who will worry for me when i am backpacking alone.
              
              1) anyone interested to join me for any backpack in any of the country above ?  
              
              2) please share information where is the best place to blog for backpacker.
              
              3) this is more like a pilgrimage travel for me and i will appreciate more info from experiencers.
              
              Plan to start one year later earliest.  Will complete one country slowly, one by one and will come back to Singapore to rest for a while before embaking on the next trip.
              So welcome any buddhist friend to backpack together.
              
              
              For the Japan,i hope to complete the famous 88 temples tour pilgrimage.

              hi aik , it is a committment , that's why i need to plan carefully to complete it.
              For China i can't go to all the temples, only the famous and ancient one, i guess.
              All will be a tall order. 
              
              i plan to start a blog and link here.  I am wondering is it safe to bring a galaxy tab for backpacking to update via internet.  
              
              How do i go on line when i am overseas? do i use the wifi only?
              
              is it safe to bring along an iphone5 to backpack?  will i be rob when i have these two hi tech gadgets with me.  How i keep my blog updated?  via internet cafe in overseas countries?

              <p>---------</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Internet
                           cafes should be quite easily found in the more touristy and urbanised 
                          areas of all the places you mentioned.  Sometimes, the guesthouse you 
                          stay in will have a terminal you can use.  <br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wifi
                           will not be available anywhere and everywhere.  In fact among the 
                          destinations you mentioned, I think only Japan and Taiwan are safe bets 
                          for Internet connectivity; and even so, it may not be Wifi.  Oh, and even if there is Wifi, it may not be free-of-charge to tap into either.</span> </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;">is it safe to bring along an iphone5 to backpack? will i be rob
                                                  when i have these two hi tech gadgets with me. </span></p>
              <p>---------</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">æœ€
                          å¥½è´¢ä¸�è¦�éœ²çœ¼ã€‚ Also consider how you are going to charge these gadgets.  If you
                           are staying in dormitory-style backpacker's accomodation, you may not 
                          always have the privacy, much less the power socket to do the charging. 
                           Front desk staff may be able to do it for you but do consider that 
                          guesthouse staff in some of these countries may not always be the most 
                          honest either.  I have had things quite obviously stolen by hotel staff 
                          from a <strong>locked</strong> luggage bag... in my room.  To them even a Giordano 
                          T-shirt is tempting enough to steal and don't assume they won't steal 
                          just because it is a Buddhist country.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Always
                           take precautions when you travel.  Don't keep all your credit 
                          cards/cash in one place.  That way, even if you get robbed, you still 
                          have back-up stashed away elsewhere. (sorry if I'm telling you the obvious, haha!)<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">With mobile phone networks, receptivity can sometimes be patchy also.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #000000;">I
                           would bring a phone (and/or galaxy tab), but use it only when I 
                          absolutely need to.  Internet cafes are good enough, and you can 
                          possibly meet up with other travellers there.</span></span></p>

              <p>Do you intend to go alone? I think it is dangerous for a lady to travel alone. In Buddhism, there are 4 famous Buddhist mountain (å››å¤§å��å±±ï¼‰ã€‚They are Putuo Shan (Guan Yin Pusa), Jiu Hua Shan (Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva), Er Mei Shan and Wu Tai Shan.</p>
              <p>I had been to Putuo Shan and Jiu Hua Shan with tour agency and you know what. We got cheated by  the China tour guide. We knew but we couldn't do anything because if we offended him, we would not be able to enjoy the trip. I went with a group of 6 people and it was a customised tour. So, I can't imagine if you go by yourself, you will sure encounter something worse than us. I still think that it is better to go by customised tour. Small group and you have the say where to go and how much time you wish to stay at one place rather than big group tour which you have no say on the timing.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I got back the money cheated by the tour guide because I came back and complained to the Singapore agency and they got back the money for me.</p>
              <p>I also wish to visit Tibet and India but I'll still go for customise tour but not back pack. By then, I'll ask you whether you are interested to join me.</p>

              <p>Yeah, agree with Dawnfirstlight.</p>
              <p>Among the countries you mentioned, I would say only Japan, Taiwan and possibly Thailand are OK to travel in as a single female traveller.  Even so, there may be some inconveniences and minor unpleasant incidents involving touts and people wanting to short-change you.  Japan is the safest (no touts, no cheats, no snatch thieves unless you're super unlucky). </p>

              oh dear , i am quite worried now. I was thinking if the other backpackers can do it, maybe i can too but........it doesn't sound safe.  I was thinking of taking some simple martial like kapap (close body martial) to have some protection on the road. 
              
              At least i can twist the robber's arm and throw him on the ground, then run...but i am not very sure of handling cheats, especially if it is a guide.
              
              A customised tour is more expensive than backpacking.  Main reason for backpacking is to see the countries in detail and yet budget not burst. 
              
              Dawnfirstlight, i am not loaded, so a customised tour to india and tibet is beyond my budget. Though i wish i can travel to these countries in comfort and with safe guidance.
              
              I have been to Taiwan and i am confidant i can sightsee Taiwan alone or with another backpacker.  Taiwan is relatively safe and easy to travel by their subway or train.
              
              Japan sounds perfect for backpacking too.  I will definitely backpack Japan since it sound safe.
              
              Thailand is not a difficult country to walk just that the temples are almost all the same there. 
              
              I think i will heed the advice to find companion.  Please drop me a line here if you want to backpack any buddhist country mentioned up there.  Itinerary can be plan and customised. 
              
              Is China that unsafe to backpack?

              China has the most number of ancient buddhist temples. 
              
              Will someone please advise where can i go to get more information on backpacker in Singapore. For eg, the camera we should use to take photos on the journey.   If i use my galaxy tab, the screen is too obvious but much easier to post on web. If i use a handphone, i need to connect to a proper notebook to post. Which will be heavier to carry than a tab.
              
              Can i find out more from Singapore Embassy in China how to travel on foot? Is there one in every major city in China?
              
              Thanks in advance.

              <p>Tripadvisor is not the only resource you can use, but it is one of the more widely used among travellers who plan their own itineraries.  Also try Googling 'backpack China'. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for Singapore consular representatives in Chinese cities, not every city will have.  Check out the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.sg/dipcon/singapore_mission_locator.html">Singapore Missions overseas on the MFA website</a>.  Not sure if they dispense advice on leisure travel though.</p>
              <p>Best is to research your trip well before leaving, make bookings and plan in advance as advised by Aik.  If you hope to land at a place and improvise, you will waste a lot of time and maybe even get nowhere.</p>

              <p>Lol, not so fraught with danger that you have to know martial arts...  More important would be to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stay alert</span> and keep your bags well strapped to your body.</p>
              <p>Just also be aware that there will be nusiance people who will try to approach you hoping to sell you overpriced services.  Or, people who demand payment after having done something for you that you originally thought was done as a favour.  Or, drivers who will overcharge you on arrival at the destination (so agree on prices beforehand or insist on using metres), etc. etc.   Just keep in mind that sometimes despite your best efforts to avoid being taken advantage of, one or two incidents may still happen.  Place more emphasis on being physically safe and just shrug off losing a couple of bucks because enjoying the trip is more important.  (Singaporeans tend to get shocked when such things happen.)</p>

              Hi,
              Regarding the internet thing. I went Tokyo alone last year Nov. My internet is from M1 using the thumbdrive wireless gadget and the plan is unlimited surfing - only in Singapore. Before I left for Tokyo, I check with M1 if I can bring the internet thumbdrive to Tokyo to surf on my laptop. They say better don't. The unlimited surfing is only in Singapore, but if I were to bring to Japan or any other country to surf, it might ran into thousands of Yen (Japan currency). Because the network in Japan is not the same as Singapore. The internet is meant for Singapore network only. Even if other countries have free wifi, might not be free or usable for our internet gadget too. 
              
              Just a suggestion, you bring along a normal digital camera, take in all the photos, come back to Singapore then upload into an album to show to your friends and likes.
              But of course during your trip, regularly you can use internet cafe to get in touch with your family and friends. 
              
              And since this is a religious trip to visit temple, perhaps just cast aside technology things like laptop, handphone, especially if you intend to go China PuTuo Shan, which is the mountain hill where Kwan Yin reside for many years there, then just enjoy the bliss without any technology. Meditate there without any laptop for surfing to lure you or distract you. But you can take photos from your camera, take already then spend some time to meditate there.

                       you really want to upload photos while enroute without having to lug 
                      along expensive gadgets like Galaxy Tabs and iphones, just use a digital
                       camera and bring along a memory card reader which should easily

              <p>Don't expect to be able

                      all you want to do at the end of the day is shower and go to sleep.  
                      Besides, free Wifi hotspots really aren't found everywhere in China 
                      (only in major cities) and like LavenderWu explained, using roaming can 
                      also rake up the bill. </p>
              <p>When travelling, I use my phone to send one SMS a day to let my family know I'm safe.  When I had
                       access to Internet cafes, I used online services to send SMSes (cheaper).</p>

              wow..thank you all for the information. I will get a digital camera with memory card reader and will not bring any hi-tech gadgets on the journey , this will also help to lessen my worry that i will be robbed.  
                          Thank you realization, i will go to the websites and read more. I can cycle well so i can cycle in China instead of just walking.
              Lavenderwu i plan to do just what you suggest, go to the four famous Buddhist mountains and spend more time meditating there and be so much nearer to all the Bodhisattvas.Joining a tour group is out for such personal time.  I hate to set alarm clock to wake up in time not to miss the coach driving off. 
                          Instead of Thailand, i will backpack Korea instead. Korea has many ancient buddhist temples and they are very strict. I know there are a few Korea temples that let people stay in to experience a temple 
                          Bhutan is also another country that i can backpack but the rule is so expensive and different for tourist there.  I wonder anybody ever backpack in Bhutan before ?
                  Realization, Singaporeans are too protected just like the Japanese who will get culture shock in France. That's even a term for that.   So Japan is a perfect place for Singaporeans to visit where things are proper and go by law, i guess. 
                  i am watching China programmes that showcast many China nationals are doing backpacking as a lifestyle.  They are much much more adventurous than us.I don't think there are many backpacking Singaporeans.
