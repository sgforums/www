              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #191919; font-size: small;">At around noon today, I received news from DPL (Gaden Shartse Drophenling) that one of my most respected gurus, His Eminence Kensur Kyabje Lati Rinpoche, has passed away early this morning at 5:25am, 12 April in Dharamsala India. Lati Rinpoche was 88 years old.</span></p>
              <p><a name="0.1_graphic02"></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fseHZVwmags/S8M_XJs3UoI/AAAAAAAAI7U/-nYEaoMuIVM/s1600/n773799036_1306084_5773.jpg"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/?name=d33be9805ff33117.jpg&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=vahi&amp;view=att&amp;th=127f5fde20613709" alt="Your browser may not support display of this image." width="1" height="1"></span></a>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #191919; font-size: small;"> <br>Rinpoche passed away peacefully in his residence unexpectedly. He was not hospitalized. This morning when Rinpoche woke up, he did his usual prayers and told his personal assistant, Sopon-la, he wanted to take his bath. This was unusual as Rinpoche normally had his breakfast before his bath each morning. Prior to that, he had also circumambulated His Holiness the Dalai Lama's temple</span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">His Eminence Kyabje Lati Rinpoche was born in the Kham region of Eastern Tibet in 1922. After the famous Gongkar Rinpoche (previous incarnation) identified and recognized Him as a reincarnation of a great practitioner, Rinpoche consequently embarked on the fulfillment of His destiny by joining the local monastery in Tibet - at the age of ten.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">By fifteen years old, Rinpoche was enrolled in Gaden Shartse Norling College, located in central Tibet. It is the most prestigious and renowned school in Tibet, and it was at Gaden Shartse Norling College where Rinpoche pursued his study of Buddhist scriptures, and eventually, earning Him the highest honours among the foremost scholars of His day. At that time, Rinpoche?s field of study included Pramana Vidya (Logic), Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wisdom), Madhyamika (Middle Philosophy), Abidharma (Treasure of Knowledge), Vinaya (Spiritual Rules and Moral Law).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">In 1959, after nineteen years of intensive study and training, Rinpoche sat for the Geshe Lharmapa examination. This major examination was held in the summer palace of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, located in the capital of Tibet, Lhasa. Candidates were various scholars and top students from the 3 main monasteries, and yet Rinpoche still managed to emerge 2nd overall. In the next year, H.E. was officially conferred as "Geshe Lharampa", a qualification which is equivalent to the PH.D. degree in the Indian universities. And in that same year, Rinpoche joined the tantric college in Lhasa, and started intensive study in Tantra since. In the following years, H.E. taught many young incarnate lamas, as well as gave dharma talks to the mass public. In 1964, Rinpoche arrived in Dharamsala, and was subsequently appointed as Spiritual Assistant to His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. Rinpoche serves His Holiness faithfully till today.</span> <br> </p>

              <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Yesterday 15 April, Lati Rinpoche's body has been brought back to Lati Ladrang in Gaden Shartse Monastery. Upon his arrival, pujas were conducted immediately and just completed this morning at 1am Singapore time. The second group of DPL members have also arrived safely in the Monastery. We await news of the  confirmed date of Rinpoche's  final rites and fire puja as Rinpoche's personal assistant, Sopon-la, is arranging for several checks and advice from the elders before deciding on the most auspicious date. </span></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Below is the obituary (English and Mandarin versions) published yesterday and today in both newspapers Straits Times and Zaobao. Many devotees and students who were still not aware about Rinpoche's passing into Nirvana, were saddened and distraught upon learning the news.<br><br></div>
              <div class="separator" style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fseHZVwmags/S8f4Tsj3ZGI/AAAAAAAAI_M/pOkk5iblCkY/s1600/26277_117788518237421_100000188191771_284969_1462110_n.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fseHZVwmags/S8f4Tsj3ZGI/AAAAAAAAI_M/pOkk5iblCkY/s640/26277_117788518237421_100000188191771_284969_1462110_n.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="411" height="640"></a></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Gaden Shartse Monastery in India will conduct daily prayers for Rinpoche's quick rebirth. Likewise DPL in Singapore will continue the Guru Puja &amp; Tsog Offerings every evening  from 12 April to 18 April at 7.30pm. If you would like to plant the seed of affinity with Lati Rinpoche and would like to pay your last respect to him, please join in the prayers. Please continue to pray for Rinpoche's swift return.</div>

              <br>To the uninitiated or those who are not familiar to Buddhism, they asked what do we mean when we said that Lati Rinpoche was in "clear light meditation" even though he has physically passed away on Monday 12 April 2010. Rinpoche’s body has retained its heat when he was in a meditative state, which in Tibetan is known as "thugdham". He was only out of thugdham on Wednesday 14 April, after about 56 hours.</div>
              <div style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;"><em></em></div>

              <div style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">In the Buddhist tradition, a lama (monk) may choose to die in a certain posture. The position of the body at death is believed to be very important as it affects the transfer of prana or life-force (consciousness) from the body. The posture plays a part in which chakra the prana will exit the body, and thereby, the six realms of rebirth will occur. Masters prefer to die in the lotus posture because this will aid them in transferring their prana through the crown chakra helping them to be reborn in the higher realms.</div>

              <br>Lati Rinpoche, like many great enlightened masters, passed away sitting in the lotus posture. Thugdham is a stage in which a highly learned lama or practitioner is able to meditate on the ‘Clear Light Stage’, an ultimate process of transferring his consciousness / enlightened intention to another realm. Lati Rinpoche, a high practitioner, while in thugdham, was able to control his body from decomposition and to maintain the internal body heat.<strong><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: small;"> </span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: teal; font-size: small;"><span class="txt"><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; color: #990000;">For a Realized master, this is the time of Nirvana: their entrance into the complete state of Enlightenment. During this time, realized masters are still powerfully connected with all his students</span><span style="color: #990000;">.</span></strong> </span></span></span>Usually the first 3 days, it is advisable not to touch the body. During this time, the lama went through the outer signs of dying including the cessation of both his breath and the beating of his heart, but remained in that meditative posture for 56 hours, in Rinpoche's case.  </div>
              <div style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">It is believed that lamas who passed away at their will (in thugdam) have miraculous powers, and a blessing from such a lama would be very beneficial.</div>
              <div style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Please come back soon, Lati Rinpoche!<br><br>
