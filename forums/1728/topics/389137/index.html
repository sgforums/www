              <td class="quote-text">Dear Scott,
                  <br> <br> I have thoroughly enjoyed reading your posts since joining the group a few weeks
                  <br> ago. I want to ask about stucturing a daily practice and am coming from the
                  <br> view that after a certain level of intellectual understanding is reached,
                  <br> perhaps it is time to focus on how to move beyond an intellectual (pointing)
                  <br> understanding.
                  <br> <br> I am currently meditating a couple of hours a day and the rest of the day, I am
                  <br> trying to be mindful of attachments that arise while trying to shift the
                  <br> emphasis of thinking away from my wants to being of help to others. During
                  <br> meditation, I alternate between focusing on the breath and a more open awareness
                  <br> with the breath more in the background.
                  <br> <br> I have been bouncing back and forth between what seems like a structured path
                  <br> (Tibetan Buddhism) and a path not quite as structured (Zen Buddhism). I have a
                  <br> strong desire to keep things simple and direct while sometimes like the guidance
                  <br> from a more structured or detail oriented practice. Any thoughts you have on
                  <br> structuring one's practice and putting into practice the concepts you have so
                  <br> wonderfully talked about here, will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
                  <br> <br> Dave</td>

              <td class="quote-text">Hi
                  Dave. What a great question. I love these types of questions because
                  they take this out of the theoretical and into the practical. Here are
                  a few tips:
                  <br> <br> 1. Just begin to notice whenever the mind goes into past and
                  future, especially involving issues about the self. In noticing those
                  thoughts, you have a choice right then and there to simply recognizing
                  non-conceptual awareness. This means to look at the present moment
                  without labels. Walk around your house or wherever you are for a moment
                  without labeling anything. Get more interested in just pure sensory
                  experiencingï¿½the feel of the floor on your feet, the sensation of air
                  against your body, the light in the room, etc. Taking these moments to
                  just rest as awareness can really help to just allow the body and mind
                  to relax "into the present moment" and reveal that your story, or
                  whatever was coming through, is not reality. It is just a story. As you
                  rest there for moments throughout the day, there comes this natural
                  return to awareness. The peace and freedom there just kind of call you
                  back, again and again. Little moments turn into longer moments. Pretty
                  soon, it feels more and more natural to just rest as present awareness
                  without having to figure anything out. You start noticing that thoughts
                  just arise on their own. And in just allowing each thought to be as it
                  is, you notice that it naturally comes to rest back into awareness. You
                  then don't have to stop thought anymore, it can be allowed to be as it
                  is, but keep your focus on present space until it's recognized that
                  this space is what you are and the thoughts are just appearances that
                  come and go within the space. <br> <br> 2. When emotions come through, just notice them. Notice any mental
                  stories around them. We often try to think ourselves out of feeling
                  bad. By noticing the thoughts that arise in conjunction with thoughts,
                  recognize the space around the emotion. Don't look at an emotion with a
                  label in your mind. Don't call it "anger." Don't say, "This should be
                  there." Just allow those thoughts to come to rest and allow the space
                  of what you are to allow that emotion to be exactly as it is, as raw
                  energy in the body. Notice any desire to push the emotion away, repress
                  it, explain it away. Allow all those thoughts to be as they are, and
                  gently come to rest back into awareness. Notice that as everything
                  appearsï¿½thoughts, emotions, states, sensations, and experiences---the
                  only constant factor is this present space that seems to allow all
                  these things to be.
                  <br> <br> 3. Allow the space within the inner body to be aware of itself,
                  from your head, to your chest and arms, to your toes. This is a famous
                  pointer from Eckhart Tolle. It was incredibly useful for me as it
                  withdraws energy from the constant need to analyze everything that is
                  happening. It provides a real sense of stability in times when there is
                  impatience, worry, anxiety, etc. And with your attention in the body,
                  awareness is there is see every emotion as it appears.
                  <br> <br> <br> Those are the basics. There are more advance pointers surrounding inseparability that I won't go into here. 
                  <br> <br> There are also other really good methods that may have usefulness
                  including Byron Katie's The Work, shadow work, and a host of others. <br> <br> No matter what method you use, make sure that the method is
                  designed to reveal presence, and not get you really busy seeking future
                  states.
