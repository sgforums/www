              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">Buddhism and Stoicism Are
              Closer Linked Than You'd Think</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> July 8, 2017 Scotty Hendricks Big Think</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Two
              of the world's oldest systems of thought, Buddhism and Stoicism, are at first
              sight as different as can be. Developed within a century or two of each other
              on separate continents, one was developed single handedly by an former royal
              family member while the other was devised by various Greek and Roman
              intellectuals from a wide range of social classes. Buddhism is commonly
              considered a religion, while stoicism is not. While there are three hundred
              million self proclaimed Buddhists in the world, it is harder to find a person
              who declares themselves to be a stoic in a philosophic sense.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">However, despite these differences, both
              philosophies share a great deal, to the point where their key ideas are
              fundamentally in agreement.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Those
              details begin with how both systems seek to reduce suffering by helping us to
              better understand the world and how we interact with it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              the stoic, all happiness is internal. The ideal stoic is just as happy with
              great wealth as they are in poverty. As the extremely wealthy Marcus Aurelius
              put it, <strong>“Almost nothing material is
              needed for a happy life, for he who understands existence”</strong>. The “goal” of
              stoic teachings is to help the individual move past reaction to external events
              and find true peace of mind. Stoic philosopher Epictetus even laid out a
              guide for practicing a stoic response to tragedy, saying we should imagine
              tragedies, such as the death of our loved ones, long before they occur. So we
              are prepared for it when it happens.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Likewise,
              <strong>Buddhism seeks to liberate the individual
              from suffering.</strong> This is done in many ways, as Buddhism has so many
              branches, but the basic principles are the same. Understanding that all beings
              move towards desire and away from pain- and that this method will fail in the
              long run. One must, instead, overcome desire and attachment, the causes of
              reaction when the world doesn't go our way, and then you will find
              enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              addition, both schools of thought are widely praised and practiced for their
              pragmatic aspects. Many athletes, including Apolo Ohno, turn <strong>to stoic ideas to help them focus on their
              performance rather than the outcomes.</strong> Likewise, Buddhism is often viewed as
              an extremely practical religion with a focus on how to live now rather than in
              the next world. Buddhism moreover preaches the value of meditation of
              various kinds. At heart one doesn't need to be a Buddhist to
              practice meditation, which can bring benefits that are well known.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              are a few major differences between the two schools that are worth mentioning.
              Many Buddhists believe in karma and reincarnation, the stoics did not; and saw <strong>acceptance of death as a key part of life.</strong> In Stoicism the solution to suffering is following reason to the end; Buddhism
              offers the solution of overcoming desire</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Would the renowned Roman stoic Marcus
              Aurelius be a Buddhist today?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> Perhaps
              not, as his worldview, while similar to the Buddhist outlook, was extremely
              grounded in Greco-Roman thought and experience. However, the similarities
              between the two schools brings to mind a familiar quote, “great minds think
              alike”. The two royal philosophers, Siddhartha Gautama and Marcus Aurelius,
              would find much room for agreement and would find the other quite virtuous.</span></p>
