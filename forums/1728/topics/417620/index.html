              <p>to buddhists, the last thought moment is very important. if you die unhappy or sad or angry, you will be reborn in a unhappy realm in your next life if you believe in rebirth.</p>

              <p><strong>DEATH AND DYING IN THE TIBETAN BUDDHIST TRADITION<br><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Compiled by: Ven. Pende Hawter </span></strong></p>
              <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/deathtib.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/deathtib.htm</a>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"><blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">
              <p>Death begins with the sequential dissolution of the winds associated with the four elements (earth, water, fire and air). "Earth" refers to the hard factors of the body such as bone, and the dissolution of the wind associated with it means that that wind is no longer capable of serving as a mount or basis for consciousness. As a consequence of its dissolution, the capacity of the wind associated with "water" (the fluid factors of the body) to act as a mount for consciousness becomes more manifest. The ceasing of this capacity in one element and its greater manifestation in another is called "dissolution" - it is not, therefore, a case of gross earth dissolving into water.</p>
              <p>Simultaneously with the dissolution of the earth element, four other factors dissolve (see Chart 1), accompanied by external signs (generally visible to others) and an internal sign (the inner experience of the dying person). The same is repeated in serial order for the other three elements (see Charts 2-4), with corresponding external and internal signs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>..........</p>
              
              <p>Upon the inception of the fifth cycle the mind begins to dissolve, in the sense that coarser types cease and subtler minds become manifest. First, conceptuality ceases, dissolving into a mind of white appearance. This subtler mind, to which only a vacuity filled by white light appears, is free from coarse conceptuality. It, in turn, dissolves into a heightened mind of red appearance, which then dissolves into a mind of black appearance. At this point all that appears is a vacuity filled by blackness, during which the person eventually becomes unconscious. In time this is cleared away, leaving a totally clear emptiness (the mind of clear light) free from the white, red and black appearances (see Chart 5). This is the final vision of death.</p>
              </span>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">This description of the various internal visions correlates closely with the literature on the near-death experience. People who have had a near-death experience often describe moving from darkness (for example a black tunnel) towards a brilliant, peaceful, loving light. A comprehensive study comparing death and near-death experiences of Tibetans and Euro-Americans has shown many similarities between the two (Carr, 1993). Care must be taken though in such comparisons because the near-death experience is not actual death, that is, the consciousness permanently leaving the body. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Since the outer breath ceased some time before (in the fourth cycle), from this point of view the point of actual death is related not to the cessation of the outer breath but to the appearance of the mind of clear light. A person can remain in this state of lucid vacuity for up to three days, after which (if the body has not been ravaged by illness) the external sign of drops of red or white liquid emerging from the nose and sexual organ occur, indicating the departure of consciousness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Other signs of the consciousness leaving the body are 1) when all heat has left the area of the heart centre (in the centre of the chest), 2) the body starts to smell or decompose, 3) a subtle awareness that the consciousness has left and the body has become like 'an empty shell', 4) a slumping of the body in a practitioner who has been sitting in meditation after the stopping of the breath. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buddhists generally prefer that the body not be removed for disposal before one or more of these signs occur, because until then the consciousness is still in the body and any violent handling of it may disturb the end processes of death.</span> A Buddhist monk or nun or friend should ideally be called in before the body is moved in order for the appropriate prayers and procedures to be carried out.</span></p>

              <p>There is no one standard answer for everyone. It really depends on how that person has led his entire life, that results in what he is thinking of during his final moments. Many people are so afraid of death and their afterlife, and are totally filled with fear in their final moments because of the terrible things they did, yet others feel so blissful and are so ready to move on.</p>
              <p>Most people fall in between, and simply feel sadness to leave their loved ones, as they don't want to die yet, again resulting in a form of fear of death. Very often, regrets will be felt, as people feel they have not done everything that they have wanted to, when they were well and alive.</p>

              <p><br> on the other side of the story, ordinary person can also "wishes"
              where to go, however their wish are much deluded.  </p>
              <p>there are 2 things that guide a person's next rebirth. one is
              karma ä¸šåŠ› and one is their wandering will or "wish" æ„¿åŠ›. for example
              what make a person want to be a doctor. it's their wanting or "vow"
              and that will guide them to that direction. so if a person keep
              thinking of becoming a monk, then one day they will become a monk.
              or if two person will themself to get together forever,
              then next life they will become together. this willing of
              the mind can be pretty powerful. and it's either if the vow/will is
              for good or for bad.</p>
              <p>the chinese word æ„¿ is not easily to translate in english. :p</p>
              <p>more is explain by Ven Jing Jie in chinese:-</p>

              <p>So if one wishes to go to pureland and keeps reciting the buddha's name, make vows and dedicate merits or virtues to go, they will be reborn there?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, I heard that it is helpful to visualise Amitabha Buddha often. Is that true?</p>

              <p><br>yes, helpful. it's the conviction of the mind that's very powerful. no matter what, don't have any bit of doubt that u cannot be reborn in pureland. like a tree leaning to the west, when the tree die and fall, it'll only fall to the west.</p>

              <p>i like the recently 2010 ones. more and more profound and in depth in term of practice.</p>
              <p>Strongly believe and stand in the stand point where u are <strong>originally</strong> free from wandering thoughts to destroy wandering thoughts.  </p>
              <p>Strongly believe and stand in the stand point where u are <strong>originally</strong> free from karma to destroy karma.  it'll be much easier this way rather than stand in the stand point where u think u are full of karma and affliction.</p>
