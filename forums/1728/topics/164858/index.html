But not being attached to yin yuan, because it is ever changing. Therefore, both.</div>

The story of the past life of AmbapÃ¢li is a good illustration of how the law of kamma works. There are many others in the Dhammapada Commentary and JÃ¢takas.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In a previous life, AmbapÃ¢li was a bhikkhunÃ®. One day the bhikkhunÃ®s visited a pagoda to pay homage. As they left the pagoda precincts, the senior bhikkhunÃ®, who was an Arahant, spat out a piece of phlegm onto the ground. The bhikkhunÃ® coming along behind, on seeing the phlegm on the ground, remarked, "What kind of whore would spit in a place like this?" Having lived out the remainder of her life as a bhikkhunÃ®, but without confessing any offence or asking for forgiveness from the nun she had insulted, she passed away, and suffered in samsÃ¢ra until the time of Gotama Buddha. At that time she was reborn as an unwanted daughter (perhaps of a prostitute or unmarried woman, the details are not given in the commentary), and abandoned under a mango tree in the king's garden. When the gardeners found the baby, they brought her to the king, who named her "AmbapÃ¢li" (guardian of the mangoes), and brought her up as a member of the royal household. When she came of age, she was very beautiful. All of the young nobles vied for her hand in marriage. They were ready to fight to the death to win her as a bride. The elders, not wishing blood to be spilt over this young woman, decided to establish her as a courtesan. Thereafter, the noble youths paid a high fee to spend a night with AmbapÃ¢li. Thus, for insulting an Arahant as a whore, she became a prostitute, but due to her long observance of the bhikkhunÃ® Vinaya, she was very beautiful.<br><br>From her business, she became very wealthy, and donated the AmbapÃ¢li grove to the Buddha and the Sangha. She bore a son who entered the Sangha and became an Arahant. When her beauty finally faded late in her life, she entered the Sangha and also became an Arahant bhikkhunÃ®.</span><br><br>that say husband and wife are <span style="font-style: italic;">yuan</span>, got good/shan yuan, got bad/er yuan. no yuan they don't meet.<br>And children are zai(dept), got collect depts, got return depts. no dept they don't come.<br><br>that say in order to be husband and wife, they must have about 500 previous lifes of affinities (ie acquaintance relationship). but it can be of revenge we never know. there was a case, a women was hypnotize for some reason and she saw that in her previous life she was killed by a guy, and that guy was her current boyfriend!<br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here's the full report:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dr. Weiss has published extensively in the area of psychotherapy and reincarnation. His top-selling books include Many Lives, Many Masters, Through Time Into Healing, Mirrors of Time: Using Regression for Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual Healing, etc.<br>This case discusses one of Dr. WeissÂ’ patients, Catherine, who was able to recall her past livesÂ’ traumas that appeared to hold the key to her anxiety attacks. Catherine remembered that she had 86 reincarnations on Earth. As a traditional psychotherapist, Dr. Brian Weiss had never believed in reincarnation before and was astonished and skeptical when he discovered CatherineÂ’s past livesÂ’ experiences. After careful validation, he confirmed the existence of reincarnation and published this case in his famous book Many Lives, Many Masters. Dr. Weiss states in the preface of the book that every word in this book is true.<br>Catherine worked as a laboratory technician in the hospital where Dr. Weiss was Chief of Psychiatry. Her religion was simple and unquestioned. She was raised to believe in traditional Catholic ideology and practices. She did not have very high education, and her mind was unsophisticated. She was not familiar with the concept of reincarnation and never believed it. At the time she met Dr. Weiss, she was only 29, and had a boyfriend whose name was Stuart. Catherine said that she was afraid of Stuart that somehow harm would come from him.  Catherine suffered panic attacks and anxiety.  Her life had always been burdened with fears. She feared water, fearing choking to the extent that she could not swallow pills. She feared airplanes, feared the dark and being closed in a narrow space. She was terrified of dying.  She always had recurrent nightmares and sometimes sleepwalking episodes.<br>Dr. Weiss decided to use hypnosis technique to help Catherine reduce her phobias and anxieties. Under Dr. WeissÂ’ instruction, Catherine entered a deep hypnotic trance. She began to describe what she was seeing. Â“I see white steps leading up to a big white building. There are no doorways. IÂ’m wearing a long dress. My name is ArondaÂ… I am 25. The year is 1863B.C.Â” That was almost 4000 years ago! We know that Aristotle lived 2300 years ago. Buddha Shakyamuni lived 3000 years ago.<br>Catherine continued, Â“We live in a valley. There is no water. The area is barren, hot, and sandy. I have a girl child whose name is CleastraÂ… SheÂ’s Rachel.Â” Rachel is presently her niece; they have always had an extremely close relationship. Such an affinity apparently had a root in their previous lives.<br>Â“A flood is devastating the village,Â” Catherine went on, Â“There are big waves knocking down trees. ThereÂ’s no place to run. The water is cold. I have to hold my baby tight. I drown; the water chokes me. I canÂ’t breathe, canÂ’t swallowÂ…salty water. My baby is torn out of my arms.Â” Catherine was gasping and having difficulty breathing. Dr. Weiss tried to comfort her: Â“The disaster is over. Relax!Â” Suddenly her body relaxed completely, and her breath became deep and even. After this session, CatherineÂ’s fear of water gradually disappeared.<br>In another session, Catherine entered the hypnotic trance and began to speak. Â“I am a boy, and my hair is blondÂ… strange hair. WeÂ’re somewhere in the Netherlands, around 1473Â… There are boats, like canoes, brightly painted. We have weapons, spears, slings, bows and arrows. It is dark. I am afraid. My people are killing the enemies, but I am not. I do not want to kill. My knife is in my hand.Â” Suddenly, she began to gurgle and gasp for breath. She reported later that an enemy fighter had grabbed her from behind, around the neck, and had slit her throat with his knife. She saw the face of her killer before she died. It was Stuart! He looked different then, but she knew it was he. As I mentioned earlier, Stuart was CatherineÂ’s boyfriend in her present life.</span><br><br>cont...<br><a href="http://www.business.uq.edu.au/staff/personal/zhong/reinc/reincarnation-English%20talk.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.business.uq.edu.au/staff/personal/zhong/reinc/reincarnation-English%20talk.doc</a><br><a href="http://www.business.uq.edu.au/staff/personal/zhong/reinc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.business.uq.edu.au/staff/personal/zhong/reinc/</a><br><br>/\<br></div>
