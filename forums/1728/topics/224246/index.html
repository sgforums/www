Please explain further.</div></blockquote>Oh yes.. the Buddha is omnipresent/all pervading in everywhere and everything and is our true nature.. called Buddha Nature. Even grass, trees, have this Dharma Nature (in inanimate things we call 'Dharma Nature', in animate things we call 'Buddha Nature'). It is the pristine awareness that is everpresent, everlasting, without which nothing would "exist".. it is like a mirror that never stops reflecting. Because our true nature is one with Buddhas, we, the universe, are one without separation, and there is no separation called 'you', 'me', etc. These are appearances due to dualistic discriminations.<br><br>Our Buddha Nature is also all-encompassing and space-like. For example when you pour water into a space in a cup, this space will not reject the water. At the same time this space is not diminished. Without Buddha Nature, Planet Earth cannot be in the space. Cars cannot works. Every thing is benefited by Buddha Nature. Enlightened people recognises it/lives in this reality all the time.<br><br>And this is not just a theory. It is not impossible to awaken to this truth intuively, directly, in fact, other than my dharma teachers and uncountable practitioners and masters in the world, quite a few people in this forum already has seen for himself that Buddha Nature is real, is our true essence. The goal of Buddhism is to 'ming xin jian xing' - to see one's true nature. If we practise earnestly, we will be able to 'achieve' that.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Buddha's body is always apparent,<br>Filling the entire cosmos,<br>Always intoning far-reaching sound<br>Shaking all lands in all quarters.<br><br>Buddha manifests bodily everywhere,<br>Entering into all worlds,<br>Revealing occult spiritual power<br>According to the inclinations of beings.<br><br>Buddha appears before all beings<br>In accordance with their minds;<br>What the sentient beings see<br>Is the Buddha's mystic power.<br><br>His radiance has no bounds<br>And his teaching too is infinite;<br>Buddha children enter and observe<br>According to their knowledge.<br><br>The Buddha's body has no birth<br>Yet can appear to be born.<br>The nature of reality is like space:<br>Therein do the Buddhas dwell.<br><br>No abiding, yet no departing:<br>Everywhere the Buddha's seen;<br>His light reaches everywhere,<br>His fame is heard afar.<br><br>No substance, no abode,<br>And no origin that can be found;<br>No signs, no form:<br>What appears is like reflections.<br><br>- Avatamsaka Sutra p. 164-165</div></blockquote></div>
