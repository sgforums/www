              <p>I think your friends need to mature.</p>
              <p>I can honestly say that I have more Christian close friends than Buddhist ones. I never debate religions with them. They are fine with my faith. They treat non-Christians and Christians equally.</p>
              <p>Anyway you can find Buddhist friends or at least friends who are open minded...</p>

              <p>so its important to know who are your true friends and who are not. when you are in trouble, thats the time to know who are your true friends and who are shallow friends.</p>
              <p>I am not asking you to dissociate from them, but remember they are not your true friends. a friend in need is a friend indeed. go and find out who are your true friends who will never abandon you no matter what. these people can be called friends, but note they are not your closest friends ok. I suggest you pay more attention to your cloest friends than friends who are not sincere and friendly.</p>
              <p>Yes friends should not convert you if you do not want to accept their religion. they should respect your wishes. good friends will never force you to do anything you dun like. open your eyes to see if they are such friends dude. as the saying goes, I have a lot of friends, but how many can be termed as true and close friends? not much I suppose, as a good friend like this is hard to come by these days. cherish them if you have such a friend.</p>

              <p>These evangelists will not stay with your friends for long. Once your friends have converted, they will move on to another group. Just watched.</p>
              <p>My relatives are mainly Christians, they also drifted away from me but I can't be bothered because  this life is only temporary. We meet only during festivals whereas I meet my friends (Christians and non Christians) more frequently than them. My relatives are very staunch Christians. Friends and relatives are only temporary, they are not going to die with us on the day we die. When you suffer, they will not suffer on your behalf.</p>
              <p>It won't bother me even if the whole world  drift away from me, I will just stick to the truth.</p>

              <p>I understand. äººç”Ÿå‡ºæ�¥å°±æ˜¯ä¸€ä¸ªäºº. I am just too emotional. To me what is treasure may not be a jewel in another's eye.</p>
              <p>Before this, we actually have a talk. and she ask about my views on them, coz we know them not too long. I told her my views, and i even make a prediction on what she is going to be like if she continue going out with them. (accurate) Then she ask me again my view abt religion, i told her to study the religion and compare. study both theirs and her own native religion then come back tell me. Apparently she didn't. She say she not interested in religion. But now is like opposite, FB status all write lord this lord tat...</p>
              <p>  you don't bother to know your own native religion, Then somebody came and tell you another story and you buy it. Its just sad to think of it. When i was younger in sec 2 &amp; 3, i also kena those ppl, my frens ask me to go check it out. I went ahead coz they say they welcome all ppl (yeah rite, provided we convert) then on the first CG meeting, i was converted by them. During the bible study the CG leader said something negative about other religion. and after a few more CG meeting, i cut off contact wif them coz i felt it was boring and $$$ wasting. I've been thru tat. And its the same church (famous for converting young ppl)</p>
              <p>But i think it doesn't matter now, what is gone is gone. Maybe as what Moka said: simply wait. Nothing is permanent. I just didn't expect it to be so fast, coz although we are classmate for years we only got to know each other during the last few month of secondary school life. I gt on very well wif her.</p>
              <p>Thanks for replying, i was feeling sad and angry when i started this topic. Now i am better.</p>

              <p>Glad that you æƒ³é€šäº†. Your friend is too naive. Do you know that Christians among their own cell group also can't get along with each other. Your friend has yet to experience that. It is her lost if she does not cherish your friendship with her.</p>
              <p>You still have a long way to go in life. Next time when you are married, you don't even have time for friends. Anyway I believe you will meet many nice friends in future.</p>
