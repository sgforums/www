              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>All human
                          activity can be viewed as an interplay between two contrary but equally
                          essential factors—vision and repetitive routine. Vision is the creative element
                          in activity, whose presence ensures that over and above the settled conditions
                          pressing down upon us from the past we still enjoy a margin of openness to the
                          future, a freedom to discern more meaningful ends and to discover more
                          efficient ways to achieve them. Repetitive routine, in contrast, provides the
                          conservative element in activity. It is the principle that accounts for the
                          persistence of the past in the present, and it enables the successful
                          achievements of the present to be preserved intact and faithfully transmitted
                          to the future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.7pt;">Although they pull in opposite directions—the one toward change, the
                          other toward stability—vision and routine mesh in a variety of ways, and every
                          course of action can be found to participate to some extent in both. For any
                          particular action to be both meaningful and effective, the attainment of a
                          healthy balance between the two is necessary. When one factor prevails at the
                          expense of the other, the consequences are often undesirable. If we are bound
                          to a repetitive cycle of work that deprives us of our freedom to inquire and
                          understand things for ourselves, we soon stagnate, crippled by the chains of
                          routine. If we are spurred to action by elevating ideals but lack the
                          discipline to implement them, we may eventually find ourselves wallowing in
                          idle dreams or exhausting our energies on frivolous pursuits. It is only when
                          accustomed routines are infused by vision that they become springboards to
                          discovery rather than deadening ruts. And it is only when inspired vision gives
                          birth to a course of repeatable actions that we can bring our ideals down from
                          the ethereal sphere of imagination to the somber realm of fact. It took a flash
                          of genius for Michelangelo to behold the figure of David invisible in a
                          shapeless block of stone, but it required years of training, and countless
                          blows with hammer and chisel, to work the miracle that would leave us a
                          masterpiece of art.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>These reflections concerning the relationship between vision and routine
                          are equally applicable to the practice of the Buddhist path. Like all other
                          human activities, the treading of the way to the cessation of suffering
                          requires that the intelligent grasp of new disclosures of truth be fused with
                          the patient and stabilizing discipline of repetition. The factor of vision
                          enters the path under the heading of right view—as the understanding of the
                          undistorted truths concerning our lives and as the continued penetration of
                          those same truths through deepening contemplation and reflection. The factor of
                          repetition enters the path as the onerous task imposed by the practice itself:
                          the need to undertake specific modes of training and to cultivate them
                          diligently in the prescribed sequence until they yield their fruit. The course
                          of spiritual growth along the Buddhist path might in fact be conceived as an
                          alternating succession of stages in which, during one phase, the element of
                          vision predominates, and during the next the element of routine. It is a flash
                          of vision that opens our inner eye to the essential meaning of the dharma,
                          gradual training that makes our insight secure, and again the urge for still
                          more vision that propels the practice forward to its culmination in final
                          knowledge.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Though the emphasis may alternate from phase to phase, ultimate success
                          in the development of the path always hinges upon balancing vision with routine
                          in such a way that each can make its optimal contribution. However, because our
                          minds are keyed to fix upon the new and distinctive, in our practice we are
                          prone to place a one-sided emphasis on vision at the expense of repetitive
                          routine. Thus we are elated by expectations concerning the stages of the path
                          far beyond our reach, while at the same time we tend to neglect the lower
                          stages—dull and drab, but far more urgent and immediate—lying just beneath our
                          feet. To adopt this attitude, however, is to forget the crucial fact that
                          vision always operates upon a groundwork of previously established routine and
                          must in turn give rise to new patterns of routine adequate to the attainment of
                          its intended aim. If we are to close the gap between ideal and
                          actuality—between the envisaged aim of striving and the lived experience of our
                          everyday lives—it is necessary for us to pay greater heed to the task of
                          repetition. Every wholesome thought, every pure intention, every effort to
                          train the mind represents a potential for growth along the Noble Eightfold
                          Path. But to be converted from a mere potential into an active power leading to
                          the end of suffering, the fleeting, wholesome thought formations must be
                          repeated, fostered, and cultivated, made into enduring qualities of our being.
                          Feeble in their individuality, when their forces are consolidated by repetition
                          they acquire a strength that is invincible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.7pt; text-align: justify;">The key to
                          development along the Buddhist path is repetitive routine guided by
                          inspirational vision. It is the insight into final freedom—the peace and purity
                          of a liberated mind—that uplifts us and impels us to overcome our limits. But
                          it is by repetition—the methodical cultivation of wholesome practices—that we
                          cover the distance separating us from the goal and draw ever closer to
                          awakening. </span></p>
