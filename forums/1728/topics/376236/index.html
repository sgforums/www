              <p>The Indians worship Brahma as a sort of creator God. Buddhism views this so called God as not a creator but a powerful being in the 1st Jhana planes. We can experience this realm in deep meditation and entering into a blissful absorption that is beyond worldly sensual pleasures.</p>
              <p>I just updated with a more complete version by Leigh Brasington, though I do not agree with his understanding that 'union with Brahma' is a metaphor for nibbana, rather in my understanding it refers to the 1st Jhana meditative absorption, or rebirth in the 1st Jhana plane.</p>
              <p>In this sutta the Buddha teaches the true way that leads to Brahma.•</p>
              <p><strong>Digha Nikaya 13<br> Tevijja Sutta<br> The Sutta (about those who have) the Knowledge of the Three (Vedas)</strong></p>
              <p>Adapted by <a href="http://leighb.com/">Leigh Brasington</a></p>
              <p><strong>Adapter's Introduction<br></strong> <a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#start">Skip Introduction</a></p>
              <p>This sutta was not translated by me. I just edited it. The method was as follows:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>I found a copy of the sutta at the <a href="http://metta.lk/">MettaNet - Lanka</a> public domain <a href="http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/index.html">Tipitaka</a> web site.
                  This is a wonderful resource, but the English translation was done by T. W. Rhys Davids in the 1890s which makes reading it a bit difficult. </li>
              <li>I then edited the sutta using material from similar suttas 
                  (there's lots of repetition - both within suttas and among suttas) at the
                  <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/index.html">Access to Insight</a> collection of <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta.html">suttas</a>.
                  I also consulted <a href="http://www.leighb.com/readlist.htm">other translations</a> by 
                  Bhikkhu Bodhi and Maurice Walshe. </li>
              <li>I made extensive use of Richard Gombrich's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Buddhism-Began-Conditioned-Comparative/dp/0485174170">How Buddhism Began</a>, Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd., 1997, and oral teaching from John Peacock (<a href="http://www.dharma.org/bcbs/">Barre Center for Buddhist Studies</a>, July 2009) to make clearer the Buddha's use of "Union with BrahmaÌ…" as a metaphor for Nibbana. <a name="BM1a"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n1a">[1a]</a> </li>
              <li>And of course I used my limited knowledge of Pali and of the Buddha's teachings to assist me in the editing. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>I have also left in Rhys Davids's footnotes
                  where I think they are applicable -- a few have been edited, some have
                  been removed -- that's why the footnote numbers are not consecutive. I
                  also added my own footnotes -- those are the ones that end in 'a'.</p>
              <p>Notice that this Sutta only discusses the graduated training up
                  thru the 1st Jhana. And that here the 1st Jhana is used as a basis from
                  which to generate The BrahmaÌ… Viharas - literally The Divine Abodes,
                  meaning the Four Supreme Emotions. The method would seem to be that the
                  "thinking and more thinking" (<em>vitakka</em> &amp; <em>vicara</em>)
                  of the 1st Jhana are intentionally made to become the BrahmaÌ… Viharas
                  practices -- that is one does not leave behind the "rapture and
                  happiness" (<em>piti</em> &amp; <em>sukha</em>) of the 1st jhana - one
                  continues sustaining it and intentionally directs the thinking to
                  pervading the universe with these divine emotions.</p>
              <p>By dwelling with a mind full of these emotions, one can acheive
                  Union with BrahmaÌ…. It's important to note that in this sutta, the
                  Buddha is using "Union with BrahmaÌ…" as a metaphor for Nibbana - a
                  point missed by the mainstream Theravadan tradition as well as by early
                  translators.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="start">Digha Nikaya 13</a><br> Tevijja Sutta<br> The Sutta (about those who have) the Knowledge of the Three (Vedas)</strong></p>
              <p>1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was journeying through Kosala with a company of about five hundred Bhikkhus. <a name="BM4a"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n4a">[4a]</a> He came to the Brahmin village in Kosala which is called Manasakata.
                  And there the Blessed One stayed in the mango grove, on the bank of the
                  river Aciravati, to the north of Manasakata.</p>
              <p>2. Now at that time many very distinguished and wealthy
                  Brahmins were staying at Manasakata; such as Kanki the Brahmin,
                  Tarukkha the Brahmin, Pokkharasadi the Brahmin, Janussoni the Brahmin,
                  Todeyya the Brahmin, and other very distinguished and wealthy Brahmins.
                  <a name="BM5"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n5">[5]</a></p>
              <p>3. Now a discussion arose between (the Brahmin students) VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha
                  and BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja -- while they were taking exercise (after their bath),
                  walking up and down in a thoughtful mood -- as to which was the true
                  path, and which the false. <a name="BM6"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n6">[6]</a></p>
              <p>4. The young Brahmin VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha said: 'This is the straight path, this
                  the direct way to salvation, and leads one who acts according to it to
                  the state of union with BrahmaÌ…. I mean that which has been taught by
                  the Brahmin Pokkharasadi.'</p>
              <p>5. The young Brahmin BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja said: 'This is the straight
                  path, this the direct way to salvation, and leads one who acts
                  according to it to the state of union with BrahmaÌ…. I mean that which
                  has been taught by the Brahmin Tarukkha.'</p>
              <p>6. But neither was the young Brahmin VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha able to
                  convince the young Brahmin BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja, nor was the young Brahmin
                  BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja able to convince the young Brahmin VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha.</p>
              <p>7. Then the young Brahmin VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha said to the young Brahmin BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja:</p>
              <p>'BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja, that recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyas, who
                  went forth from the Sakya clan to practice the spiritual life, is now
                  staying at Manasakata in the mango grove on the bank of the river
                  Aciravati, to the north of Manasakata. Now regarding the venerable
                  Gotama, this admirable report has been spread: "The Blessed One is an
                  Arahat, a worthy one, perfectly enlightened, endowed with clear
                  knowledge and conduct, accomplished, a knower of the world, unsurpassed
                  trainer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened
                  and exalted."</p>
              <p>Come then, BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja, let us go to the place where the
                  recluse Gotama is staying; and when we have come there, let us ask the
                  recluse Gotama about this matter. However the recluse Gotama will
                  answer us, let us keep that in mind. <a name="BM7"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n7">[7]</a></p>
              <p>'Very well, my friend!' said the young Brahmin BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja in assent to the young Brahmin VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha.</p>
              <p>8. Then the young Brahmin VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha and the young Brahmin
                  BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja went on to the place where the Blessed One was staying.
                  When they arived, they approached the Blessed One, paid homage and sat
                  to one side. While they were seated there the young Brahmin VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha
                  said to the Blessed One:</p>
              <p>'As we were taking exercise and walking up and down, Gotama, a
                  discussion arose between us on which was the true path, and which the
                  false. I said, "This is the straight path, this the direct way to
                  salvation, and leads one who acts according to it to the state of union
                  with BrahmaÌ…. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahmin
                  Pokkharasadi."</p>
              <p>'BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja said, "This is the straight path, this the direct
                  way to salvation, and leads one who acts according to it to the state
                  of union with BrahmaÌ…. I mean that which has been announced by the
                  Brahmin Tarukkha."</p>
              <p>'Regarding this matter, Gotama, there is a quarrel, a dispute, a difference of opinion between us.'</p>
              <p>9. 'So you say, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, that you said, "This is the
                  straight path, this the direct way to salvation, and leads one who acts
                  according to it to the state of union with BrahmaÌ…. I mean that which
                  has been announced by the Brahmin Pokkharasadi."</p>
              <p>'While BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja said, "This is the straight path, this the
                  direct way to salvation, and leads one who acts according to it to the
                  state of union with BrahmaÌ…. I mean that which has been announced by
                  the Brahmin Tarukkha."</p>
              <p>'So, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, what is the quarrel, dispute, difference of opinion between you?' <a name="BM8"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n8">[8]</a></p>
              <p>10. 'Concerning the true path and the false, Gotama. Various
                  Brahmins teach various paths. The Addhariya Brahmins, the Tittiriya
                  Brahmins, the Chandoka Brahmins, [the Chandava Brahmins], the Bavharija
                  Brahmins. <a name="BM9"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n9">[9]</a> Are all those paths to salvation? Are they all paths which will lead
                  one who acts according to them to the state of union with BrahmaÌ…?</p>
              <p>'Just as near a village or a town there are many and various paths, <a name="BM10"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n10">[10]</a> Gotama, yet they all meet together in the village -- just in that way
                  there are all the various paths taught by various Brahmins -- the
                  Addhariya Brahmins, the Tittiriya Brahmins, the Chandoka Brahmins, [the
                  Chandava Brahmins], the Bavharija Brahmins. Are all these paths to
                  salvation? Are they all paths which will lead one who acts according to
                  them to the state of union with BrahmaÌ…?'</p>
              <p>11. 'Do you say "they lead," VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha?'</p>
              <p>'I say so, Gotama.'</p>
              <p>'Do you really say "they lead," VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha?</p>
              <p>'So I say, Gotama.'</p>
              <p>12. 'But yet, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, is there a single one of the Brahmins
                  versed in the Three Vedas, who has ever seen BrahmaÌ…, face to face?'</p>
              <p>'No, indeed, Gotama.'</p>
              <p>'Or is there then, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, a single one of the teachers of
                  the Brahmins versed in the Three Vedas who has seen BrahmaÌ… face to
                  face?'</p>
              <p>'No, indeed, Gotama!'</p>
              <p>'Or is there then, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, a single one of the pupils of
                  the teachers of the Brahmins versed in the Three Vedas who has seen
                  BrahmaÌ… face to face?'</p>
              <p>'No, indeed, Gotama!'</p>
              <p>'Or is there then, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, a single one of the Brahmins up to the seventh generation who has seen BrahmaÌ… face to face?'</p>
              <p>'No, indeed, Gotama!'</p>
              <p>13. 'Well then, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, those ancient Rishis of the
                  Brahmins versed in the Three Vedas, the authors of the verses, the
                  expounders of the verses, whose ancient words the Brahmins of today
                  chant over again and repeat; intoning and reciting exactly as has been
                  intoned and recited -- those such as Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva,
                  Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, Kassapa,
                  and Bhagu <a name="BM11"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n11">[11]</a> --  did they speak thus, saying: "We know and see how, when and where BrahmaÌ… appears?"'</p>
              <p>'Not so, Gotama!'</p>
              <p>14. 'Then you say, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha that none of the Brahmins, nor their
                  teachers, nor their pupils, even up to the seventh generation, has ever
                  seen BrahmaÌ… face to face. And that even the Rishis of old, the authors
                  and expounders of the verses, of the ancient form of words which the
                  Brahmins of today so carefully intone and recite precisely as they have
                  been handed down -- even they did not pretend to know or to have seen
                  how, when and where BrahmaÌ… appears. <a name="BM12"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n12">[12]</a> So what the Brahmins versed in the Three Vedas have actually said is
                  "Regarding what we don't know, what we have not seen, we can show the
                  way to a state of union with that, and we can say: 'This Is the
                  straight path, this is the direct way to salvation, and leads one who
                  acts according to it to the state of union with BrahmaÌ…!'"</p>
              <p>'Now, what think you, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha? Does it not follow, this
                  being so, that the talk of the Brahmins, versed though they be in the
                  Three Vedas, turns out to be foolish talk?'</p>
              <p>'Certainly, Gotama, that being so, it follows that the talk of the Brahmins versed in the Three Vedas is foolish talk!'</p>
              <p>15. 'VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, that Brahmins versed in the Three Vedas should
                  be able to show the way to a state of union with that which they do not
                  know, neither have seen -- such a thing is impossible!</p>
              <p>'Just, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, as when a string of blind men are clinging one to the other <a name="BM13"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n13">[13]</a>,
                  the first one doesn't see, the middle one doesn't see, and the last one
                  doesn't see -- just so, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, the talk of the Brahmins versed in
                  the Three Vedas is but blind talk: the first doesn't see, the middle
                  one doesn't see, and the last one doesn't see. The talk then of these
                  Brahmins versed in the Three Vedas turns out to be ridiculous, mere
                  words, a vain and empty thing!</p>
              <p>16. 'Now what do you think, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha? Can the Brahmins
                  versed in the Three Vedas -- like other, ordinary, folk -- see the Moon
                  and the Sun as they pray to, praise, and worship them, turning round
                  with clasped hands towards the places where they rise and where they
                  set?'</p>
              <p>'Certainly, Gotama, they can<a name="BM14"></a>.' <a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n14">[14]</a></p>
              <p>17. 'Now what do you think, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha? The Brahmins versed in

              <p>'Certainly not, Gotama! And why? If the man had been born and
                  brought up in Manasakata, every road that leads to Manasakata would be
                  perfectly familiar to him.'</p>
              <p>38. 'That man, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, born and brought up in Manasakata,
                  if he were asked the way to Manasakata, might fall into doubt and
                  difficulty, but the Tathagata, when asked about the path which leads to
                  the world of BrahmaÌ…, has neither doubt nor difficulty. For BrahmaÌ…, I
                  know, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, and the world of BrahmaÌ…, and the path which leads
                  to it. Yes, I know it just as one who has entered the BrahmaÌ…-world,

              <p>39. At this, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, the young Brahmin, said to the Blessed One:
                  'Just as I have heard, Gotama, the recluse Gotama knows the way to the
                  state of union with BrahmaÌ…. Excellent! Let the venerable Gotama please
                  show us the way to the state of union with BrahmaÌ…, let the venerable
                  Gotama save the Brahmin race!' <a name="BM26"></a><a href="http://www.leighb.com/dn13.htm#n26">[26]</a></p>
              <p>'Listen then, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, and pay attention, I will speak!'</p>
              <p>'So be it, Lord!' said the young Brahmin VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha in assent to the Blessed One.</p>
              <p>40. Then the Blessed One spoke, and said:</p>
              <p>'Know, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, that (from time to time) a Tathagata arises in the
                  world, a worthy one, perfectly enlightened, endowed with clear
                  knowledge and conduct, accomplished, a knower of the world, unsurpassed
                  trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and
                  exalted. Having realized by his own direct knowledge this world with
                  its gods, its MaÌ…ras, and its BrahmaÌ…s, this generation with its
                  recluses and brahmins, its rulers and people, he makes it known to
                  others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in
                  the middle, and good in the end, possessing meaning and phrasing; he
                  reveals the holy life that is fully complete and purified.</p>
              <p>41. 'A householder (<em>gahapati</em>), or a householder's son,
                  or one born into some other family, hears the Dhamma. Having heard the
                  Dhamma, he gains faith in the Tathagata. Endowed with such faith, he
                  reflects: 'The household life is crowded, a path of dust. Going forth
                  is like the open air. It is not easy living at home to practice the
                  holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if
                  I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the saffron robes, and go
                  forth from the household life into homelessness?"</p>
              <p>'After some time he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it
                  large or small; he abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or
                  small; he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on saffron robes, and
                  goes forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>
              <p>42. 'When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the
                  rules of the monastic code, possessed of proper behavior and resort.
                  Having taken up the rules of training, he trains himself in them,
                  seeing danger in the slightest faults. He comes to be endowed with
                  wholesome bodily and verbal action, his livelihood is purified, and he
                  is possessed of good conduct. He guards the doors of his sense
                  faculties, is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension, and is
                  content.</p>

                  the taking of life, he abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with
                  his rod laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful,
                  compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. This is part of

                  the heart, that are polite, appealing and pleasing to people at large.
                  This, too, is part of good conduct.</p>

                  the Dhamma, and the Discipline. He speaks words worth treasuring,

              <p>he abstains from wrong livelihood, from lowly arts such as these. This, too, is part of good conduct.</p>
              <p>'Just as a head-anointed noble warrior who has defeated his enemies
                  sees no danger anywhere from his enemies, so the bhikkhu who is thus
                  possessed of good conduct sees no danger anywhere in regard to his
                  restraint by good conduct. Endowed with this noble aggregate of good
                  conduct, he experiences within himself a blameless happiness.</p>
              <p>  <strong><a name="guarding">Restraint of the Sense Faculties</a></strong></p>
              <p>'And how does a bhikkhu guard the doors of his senses? On seeing
                  a form with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which
                  -- if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye --
                  evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him.
                  On hearing a sound with the ear... On smelling an odor with the nose...
                  One tasting a flavor with the tongue... On touching a tactile sensation
                  with the body... On cognizing an idea with the intellect, he does not
                  grasp at any theme or details by which -- if he were to dwell without
                  restraint over the faculty of the intellect -- evil, unskillful
                  qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. Endowed with this
                  noble restraint over the sense faculties, he experiences within himself
                  an unblemished happiness. This is how a bhikkhu guards the doors of his
                  senses.</p>
              <p>  <strong><a name="mindfulness">Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension</a></strong></p>
              <p>'And how is a bhikkhu possessed of mindfulness and clear
                  comprehension? In going forward and returning, a bhikkhu acts with
                  clear comprehension. In looking ahead and looking aside, he acts with
                  clear comprehension. In bending and stretching his limbs, he acts with
                  clear comprehension. In wearing his robes and cloak and using his
                  almsbowl, he acts with clear comprehension. In eating, drinking,
                  chewing, and tasting, he acts with clear comprehension. In defecating
                  and urinating, he acts with clear comprehension. In walking, standing,
                  sitting, lying down, waking up, speaking, and remaining silent, he acts
                  with clear comprehension. This is how a bhikkhu is possessed of
                  mindfulness and clear comprehension.</p>
              <p>  <strong><a name="content">Contentment</a></strong></p>
              <p>'And how is a bhikkhu content? Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies
                  with its wings as its only burden; so too is he content with a set of
                  robes to provide for his body and almsfood to provide for his hunger.
                  Wherever he goes, he takes only his barest necessities along. This is
                  how a bhikkhu is content.</p>
              <p>  <strong><a name="hindrances">The Abandoning of the Hindrances</a></strong></p>
              <p>'Endowed with this noble aggregate of good conduct, this noble
                  restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and clear
                  comprehension, and this noble contentment, he resorts to a secluded
                  dwelling - a forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside
                  cave, a cremation ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap of
                  straw. After returning from his alms-round, following his meal, he sits
                  down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and sets up mindfulness
                  before him.</p>
              <p>'Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells
                  with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of
                  covetousness. Abandoning ill will and anger, he dwells with an
                  awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic with the welfare of all
                  living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger. Abandoning
                  sloth and drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and
                  drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind
                  of sloth and drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness and worry, he dwells
                  undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of
                  restlessness and worry. Abandoning doubt, he dwells having crossed over
                  doubt, with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities. He
                  cleanses his mind of doubt.</p>
              <p>'Suppose that a man, taking a loan, invests it in his business
                  affairs. His business affairs succeed. He repays his old debts and
                  there is extra left over for maintaining his wife. The thought would
                  occur to him, "Before, taking a loan, I invested it in my business
                  affairs. Now my business affairs have succeeded. I have repaid my old
                  debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife." Because of
                  that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>
              <p>'Now suppose that a man falls sick -- in pain and seriously ill. He
                  does not enjoy his meals, and there is no strength in his body. As time
                  passes, he eventually recovers from that sickness. He enjoys his meals
                  and there is strength in his body. The thought would occur to him,
                  "Before, I was sick... Now I am recovered from that sickness. I enjoy
                  my meals and there is strength in my body." Because of that he would
                  experience joy and happiness.</p>
              <p>'Now suppose that a man is bound in prison. As time passes, he
                  eventually is released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss
                  of property. The thought would occur to him, "Before, I was bound in
                  prison. Now I am released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no
                  loss of my property." Because of that he would experience joy and
                  happiness.</p>
              <p>'Now suppose that a man is a slave, subject to others, not subject to
                  himself, unable to go where he likes. As time passes, he eventually is
                  released from that slavery, subject to himself, not subject to others,
                  freed, able to go where he likes. The thought would occur to him,
                  "Before, I was a slave... Now I am released from that slavery, subject
                  to myself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where I like."
                  Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>
              <p>'Now suppose that a man, carrying money and goods, is traveling by a
                  road through desolate country. As time passes, he eventually emerges
                  from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of property.
                  The thought would occur to him, "Before, carrying money and goods, I
                  was traveling by a road through desolate country. Now I have emerged
                  from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of my
                  property." Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>
              <p>'In the same way, when these five hindrances are not abandoned in
                  himself, the bhikkhu regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison,
                  slavery, a road through desolate country. But when these five
                  hindrances are abandoned in himself, he regards it as unindebtedness,
                  good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of security. When he
                  sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself,
                  gladness arises. When he is gladdened, rapture arises. When his mind is
                  filled with rapture, his body becomes tranquil; tranquil in body, he
                  experiences happiness; being happy, his mind becomes concentrated.</p>

                  household and worldly cares, and that BrahmaÌ… is free from household

                  break up of the body, become united with BrahmaÌ…, who is the same --
                  such a thing is in every way possible!</p>

                  that BrahmaÌ… is free from anger, and free from malice, pure in mind,
                  and master of himself. Then certainly, VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha, that the Bhikkhu
                  who is free from anger, free from malice, pure in mind, and master of
                  himself should after death, at the break up of the body, become united

              <p>82. When the Lord had finished speaking, the young Brahmins VaÌ…setÌ£tÌ£ha and BhaÌ…radvaÌ…ja said to the Blessed One:</p>
              <p>'Magnificent, Lord! Magnificent! Just as if one were to place upright
                  what had been overturned, were to reveal what was hidden, were to show
                  the way to one who was lost, or were to hold up a lamp in the dark so
                  that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way the Blessed One
                  has -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. We go
                  to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of
                  Bhikkhus. May the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who have
                  gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life!'</p>
