            <div class='col-md body'>From experience, the disappearing 'I' is experienced in Oneness.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you all for your valuable input. Here is my understanding. I think first off we could do an analysis into what this 'I' is. If we think that 'I' is our body, then if your hand and legs are amputated, your 'I' would have disappeared, or amputated along with it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. But it is not. If you say, 'I can see', then what exactly is this 'I' you are refering to? If the 'eye' is part of 'you', if you are blinded, then does the 'I' disappears as well?<br><br>LinYu also made a good point that 'I' exists in attachment. In reality, 'I' does not exist, naturally car does not belong to 'I', then there is no attachment, only Mindfulness. From this we can see 'I' is the root of all perceptions, all craving, etc.<br><br>So eventually we conclude that 'I' is a form of mind consciousness, or egoic/self consciousness, is known as the 7th Consciousness [terms based on the Yogacara/Consciousness-Only school]... based on the illusion of a self of which does not exist. The 7th and 8th Consciousness is not found in the Theravada school, although 7th and 8th consciousness is the extension of the Mental Consciousness mentioned in Theravada. This 'self illusion' is the root of ignorance. it is also the root of countless discrimination, dualism, of 'I' and 'other'. Because this 7th consciousness is not our body, and is linked with our 8th consciousness [alaya storehouse consciousness] which Bodhiruci has pointed out, when we die our 7th consciousness, conviniently called the 'soul', carries along the karmic seeds of the 8th consciousness into rebirth. Whenever we do something with self-attachment [7th consciousness], we will plant a karmic imprint into the 8th consciousness, which is similar to a ever-recording tape recorder. To cease the cycle of rebirth is to cut off the root of ignorance, where the self illusion [7th consciousness] is dissolved. Bodhiruci states that only the 8th consciousness gets reincarnated. It is true, however the 8th consciousness gets reincarnated because of the 7th consciousness, of an egoic self. In Mahayana and Vajrayana, we know that there is an intermediate stage between death and rebirth, called the Zhong Ying Sheng, or antarabhava, bardo [zhong you]. When we die, our 6 sense organs and therefore 6 sense consciousness cease to exist, our 7th consciousness leaves our body in the form of Zhong Ying Sheng in search for the right conditions to be reborn. If we are liberated from that 7th consciousness, we will be part of Dharmakaya. In Tibetan terms, it is called the Clear Light. In Pure Land terms, it is called 'Ji Guang Jing Tu'. It is also commonly known as Nirvana. That is also your True Nature; Buddha Nature; True Self.<br><br>In Chinese we often hear of 'Da4 Chan2 Qi1' literally translated as Hit Chan Seven. It means hitting the 7th consciousness, making it cease its function.</div>

My dharma teacher used to have such visions of an empty Buddha Land - yet she was 100% certain it was Buddha Land! That was before meeting my master, and after meeting my master, my master told her she had practised in past life to enter such buddha land before... and somehow an impression has been planted into her 8th consciousness. Buddha land essentially is formless.<br><br>But then to ordinary beings, they will manifest in all the details as mentioned in Amitabha Sutra.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just like to add on to this.<br><br>Since there is no 'I', then what makes 'us'?<br><br>Conditioned arisings, interdependant origination [i.e we are made up of the 5 Skhandas]. Meaning all things are merely relativity to each other, therefore they are one - not two, not three, not existing independantly by itself. Thus there is no 'I' in the 5 skhandas. All things are conditioned arisings, and therefore have no inherent existences. Not only that, they are ever-changing, no two moments are the same. Out of ignorance based on the 7th and 8th consciousness, we always think that there is an 'I' which exists in continuation. Yet every moment is distinct and new.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Life (Self) is nothing other than the continuous flow of the Now Moment.<br>The Now Moment ceases as it arises. This moment must completely ceased<br>and serves as the CAUSE for the next moment to arise.<br>Therefore Self is a process of series Self1, Self2, Self3, Self4, Self5, Self6...etc<br>A fixed entity 'Self' does not exist, what really exists is a momentary Self.<br>Under deep meditation, one is able to observe and sense the karmic and mental factors from moment to moment,<br>it is these factors that are succeeded from moment to moment and life and life but not a fixed entity.<br>When the karmic and mental factors subsides, it is known as "The True and Only (and Inherently egoless) Conscious Light (Itself)".<br><br>- Thusness</span></div>
