            <div class='col-md body'>This post is from another forum I posted today:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All spirits and spirit-deities belong to the spirit realm. However, spirits also got many kinds, those with good karma may become spirit-deities and have spiritual powers. They can read your minds, know many things about you, etc. They themselves also have a large spiritual circle and therefore can communicate with other spirits. However, these spirits would get angry easily and develop hatred when their wishes are not fulfilled. A True Buddhist is not concerned about these superstitions, why in the first place do we have to rely on these spirits? Humans are the ones who can truly cultivate and attain Great Wisdom, it is better instead that we cultivate the dharma.<br><br>Also, Chenrezig, Tara, are NOT spirits. They are Bodhisattvas, Mahabodhisattvas transcend all samsaric realms. All these are ENLIGHTENED beings, and they have transcended all dualities, they also do not become angry like the spirit-deities.<br><br>I just posted in Sintua, in a thread where people say its possible to jump Di Zhang Wang, Guan Yin, Buddha, Bodhidharma, etc. This is untrue.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If only more people out there who has read the scriptures.....Buddha himself has saw this coming and have identified 50 false states to his disciplines in <a href="http://www.buddhistdoor.com/resources/sutras/shurangama/sources/contents.htm" rel="nofollow">Shurangama Sutra</a><br><br>Taken from Shurangama Sutra:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ananda, now that the practiser is free from anxiety, after his receptiveness has vanished, he finds himself in the state of perfect dhyÃ na and likes its pure brightness. But he may be tempted to concentrate on the one thought of skilfully advancing, thus submitting to the heavenly demon who immediately possesses another man (to harm the meditator).<br><br>This man, unaware that he is possessed will, as directed, preach the Dharma of the sÃ¥tras and think that he too has realized Supreme NirvÃ Ãµa. He will then come to the practiser's place and take the high seat (reserved for reputable monks) to teach him the Dharma. To show his skill, he will appear either as a monk, Indra, a woman or a nun, and his body will send out rays of light that illumine the dark bedroom. The practiser will mistake him for a Bodhisattva and will believe what he says; as a result, his mind will waver and he will break the rules and have desires.<br><br>The man will speak of weal and woe, of a Buddha appearing at a certain place, of scorching fire in the kalpa of destruction and of future fighting and wars to frighten and ruin other people. This is the Strange Ghost who has become a demon in his old age and who now comes to trouble the practiser. When he is weary of his misdeeds, he will leave the possessed man. Then both teacher (the possessed man) and pupil (the practiser) will suffer all the miseries inflicted by the royal law. You should first be clear about this temptation to avoid returning to saÃ¼sÃ ra, but if you are deluded and do not recognize it, you will fall into the unintermittent hell.</span></div>

He called all these things <strong>'low arts'.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"Whereas some religious men, while living off food provided by the faithful make their living by such low arts, such wrong means of livelihood as palmistry, divining by signs, interpreting dreams, bringing about good or bad luck, picking the lucky site for a building, the monk Gotama refrains from such low arts, such wrong means of livelihood". </strong></span><br><br>Because of <strong>greed, fear </strong>and<strong> ignorance</strong> people sometimes practise such things and believe in them. As soon as people understand the BuddhaÂ’s teachings, they realise that a <strong>pure heart</strong> can protect them much better than bits of paper, bits of metal and a few chanted words and they no longer rely on such things. In the teachings of the Buddha, it is <strong>honesty, kindness, understanding, patience, forgiveness, generosity, loyalty and other good qualities that truly protect you and give you true prosperity</strong><br></div>
