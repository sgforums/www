              </p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Paradox of Practice</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Brad Warner WINTER 2012 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The iconoclastic itinerant Soto Zen teacher “Homeless” Kodo
              Sawaki Roshi famously said, “Zazen is good for nothing!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">He wasn’t being facetious. He wasn’t employing some kind of
              “skillful means” by saying something he really didn’t believe. He wasn’t being
              mystical and saying it’s good (wink, wink) for nothing (nudge, nudge). Nope. He
              meant it. Zazen really is good for nothing. It’s useless. Absolutely useless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One of the hardest aspects of Zen practice is getting your
              head around the idea that zazen has no goal. No goal at all. You don’t do it
              for anything except itself. It doesn’t get you anywhere. It doesn’t gain you a
              damned thing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Part of the reason this goalless practice is hard to accept
              is that anyone who has ever done zazen or indeed any kind of meditation
              practice knows quite well that there are benefits. Some people can’t function
              without their morning coffee. I can’t function without my morning zazen. It
              makes me feel better, lighter, happier, more alive. If there were no benefits,
              why would anyone do such a ridiculous thing as sit and stare at a wall for half
              an hour or more every morning and night? Who has that kind of time to waste?
              There are plenty of folks working hard to determine and explain exactly what
              these benefits are and why they come about. There are a dozen books out right
              now that will tell you exactly what meditation is good for. And it ain’t nothing!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The weird thing is that the only way one really gets any of
              the most important benefits of meditation practice is by giving up on the
              notion that there are any benefits to meditation practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">People often get hung up on semantics. Isn’t the goal of having
              no goal just another goal? You can twist your mind around this one forever.
              Logically, it’s a perfect loop. You can define having no goal as a goal and
              nobody can argue with that on a linguistic level. But in actual practice not
              having a goal really isn’t a goal at all. It’s something different from having
              a goal. It’s not having a goal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Even so, this is much easier said than done. We’ve been
              taught since birth that the worst thing any activity can be is pointless.
              Understandably, we always want to know if something difficult we’re considering
              committing to is going to produce results. I think some of us look upon
              meditation the way we look at dieting. We want to choose a diet that has been
              proven to be effective. Otherwise we’d be starving ourselves for nothing. When
              it comes to meditation, we certainly don’t want to spend hours and hours
              sitting in some weird posture only to find we have nothing to show for it
              afterward.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We are deeply committed to the idea that for something to be
              worth doing, it needs to produce results. More than that, it needs to produce
              the results we desire. The diet that made me deny myself all those delicious
              desserts had better help me shed 20 pounds! And that meditation for which I had
              to give up all the time I could have spent playing video games or hanging out
              with friends had better fix what’s wrong in my life and bring me profound peace
              and contentment!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The problem is that goal-seeking activity is always the enemy
              of real peace and contentment. The idea that what is here and now is less
              valuable than what’s over there just past the finish line prevents us from ever
              being truly content and happy right where we are. No matter what your ultimate
              goal is, it’s always off in the distance. It’s never here. This goes for any
              goal at all, even the goal of attaining ultimate inner peace or saving all
              beings. It’s still a goal. It’s still over there, not here.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Part of striving for a goal is telling yourself that you’re
              not good enough, that you’ve got to push harder. If you tell yourself you’re
              not good enough over and over and over, what sort of effect is that going to
              have? How is that ever going to produce any kind of peace and contentment, even
              if your goal is peace and contentment? If you do accidentally achieve a little
              peace and contentment, you’ve set up a habit of telling yourself that you’re
              not peaceful and content enough.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In order to learn to be truly content here, you have to
              practice being truly content here. And that means giving up any notion that
              there’s something better just around the next bend. Even if what’s around the
              bend really is better.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It’s perfectly fine to just let your goals be as they are. I
              have personally found this to be a very useful approach. There’s no sense in
              beating yourself up over having a goal for your practice. That’s just another
              way of telling yourself you’re not good enough as you are. So have your goals.
              Have all the goals you want! Just leave them be and don’t take them too
              seriously. Like all other thoughts, they’ll drop away of their own accord if
              you stop feeding them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In a very real sense, when you start getting into that
              endless thought loop of trying to have a goal, but trying not to have a goal,
              but trying not to not to have a goal, while trying not to not to not to have a
              goal and on and on and on, you’re just playing a mind game with yourself. So
              treat yourself the way you would treat that annoying neighbor who tries to draw
              you into an argument that no one could ever possibly win. Refuse to be drawn
              in. Don’t respond. Just like you’d do with that annoying neighbor, let your
              inner voice talk and talk and talk until it’s so hoarse it has to shut up.
              Meanwhile, just keep doing your practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After doing this for a while you’ll see that your goal-driven
              thoughts have less and less power. They may still crop up. But you’ll find that
              you just don’t care about them anymore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And if that doesn’t happen, don’t worry about it. Just keep
              on sitting anyway. After all, who couldn’t use a few moments of pointless peace
              and quiet each day? Even if those moments are good for nothing!</span></p>
