            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>so to enhance the affinity wif buddha , what do u recommend?</blockquote>The main purpose of Taking refuge in Three Treasures (i.e Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) is to 'Jie Yuan' with the San Bao (three treasures). So if you want to 'enhance affinity' with Buddha, you must definitely take refuge in Three Treasures. Some people know some teachings of Buddhism, but they did not take refuge, also no affinity. Buddha clearly told that to become his disciple, the first thing is to Take Refuge in the Three Treasures. Taking refuge is also the first step towards Enlightenment.<br><br><blockquote>currently i hav been recitin 'great compassion mantra' coz i was once enlightened by 'Great compassion GUAN YIN' ( and i mean she reali appeared in my dream and tok to mi..). does tis mean i hav taken refuge by reciting?</blockquote>Yes, Da Bei Zhou is a powerful mantra so since you have affinity with Guan Yin you should chant Da Bei Zhou. It is a good practise. Both my dharma teacher and my mother have deep affinity with Guan Yin Pu Sa (many happenings before), in fact my dharma teacher told my mother that she was a student of Guan Yin before <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Just that unfortunately she has been lost in Samsara again. My mother could memorise the Da Bei Zhou in no time. Her sisters try to memorise Da Bei Zhou for a week also cannot.<br><br>However, chanting Da Bei Zhou does not mean you have taken refuge in Three Treasures, they are two different things.<br><br><blockquote>i dreamt of my past live too..but i dunno how true can it be.. </blockquote>My mother also said she used to be able to dream of past lives often. I think these things are hard to verify, but might be possible.<br><br><blockquote>does buddhist hav the practise of giving out omulet aka pic of buddha (in the public) during the 1st and the 15th of the month? </blockquote>Amulet or Omulet?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Omulet is a food made of eggs.<br><br>I do not know, maybe more in the Thai Buddhist tradition, my Buddhist tradition does not practise this. Where did you hear this from? (a Thai Buddhist?)<br><br><blockquote>i told him i no $(coz i experience this b4 and theres no free ting)..so i rejected . but then he assure mi tat its FREE!!but still i din take it ..<br><br>wats ur opinion on tis?</blockquote>Who is this person? Someone on the streets? Anyway I think it should be fine.<br><br><blockquote>and does monk hav the special ability (due to their cultivation) to c ppl aura. if im not wrong everyone has a certain pattern(colors) of aura and not b seen by naked eyes..</blockquote>Yes it is possible. My Taiwanese dharma teacher used to tell us to practise well.... whether or not we practise well, they will know because they can 'see' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> He said something like different people had different aura if I'm not wrong.<br><br>Not every monk, but some of them can.<br><br><blockquote>also.. how to tame a wandering mind and how to improve concentration?</blockquote>Practise the dharma. Not only sitting meditation, but every moment even in the midst of your life. Practise Mindfulness.<br><br><blockquote>vast knowledge out tere..but little i can absorb..sumtime i tink havin juz one 'practical' experience outweight tons of them..</blockquote>Exactly.<br><br><blockquote>be a little more sensitive..and use ur heart to c the world..u will hav different experience.. </blockquote>If you can use 'Guan Zi Zai' (read Heart Sutra) to see the world, then you will be a Bodhisattva. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Guan zi zai pu sa... xing shen puo re puo luo mi duo shi......</span></div>

It seems like your are still new to Buddhist teachings.<br><br>Take Refuge = Gui1 Yi1 in Chinese, Gui Yi San Bao means to return to the domain of the Three Treasures. Since the very beginning, everyone of us have perfect and complete Buddha Nature, however we have been in the cycle of rebirth in Samsara (world of sufferings) for uncountable aeons, and not realise our perfect and complete Buddha Nature. Because we have perfect and complete Buddha Nature, we are all able to attain Buddhahood. Therefore, the first step towards enlightenment is to return to the domain of the Three Treasures, that is Buddha (i.e Shakyamuni Buddha), Dharma (i.e all the scriptures of the Tripitaka), and Sangha (the monastic community). Using an analogy we will understand: an ignorant children has ran into dangerous grounds, and is in danger. The mother quickly asks the ignorant children to return. The idea of taking refuge is this.<br><br>After taking refuge in the Three Treasures, you become a true Buddhist and a true disciple of Buddha. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> That is not the end, it is the start of the path towards enlightenment.<br><br>And then what is Enlightenment? Picture this: you have been in totally dark room since uncountable aeon. Enlightenment is turning on the switch, and the whole room becomes totally bright. It is realising our Buddha Nature, and therefore become liberated from all sufferings, and being freed from birth and death. But first, we need to get rid of all the rubbish in our mind. That is called purification.<br><br><blockquote><br>ur mum is buddhist first then insights or vice versa?</blockquote>I don't think I said my mother had insights  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>haa..sorry..make a fool of myslf..</blockquote>No la, anyone who seeks Buddha and Dharma is not foolish. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>mindfulness = 24 hr alertness? awareness ? to everyting..?</blockquote>Awareness can be said 'knowing' or 'awakening'. Not aware would be 'ignorance'.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no2f.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no2f.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Awareness<br>By Venerable Shen-Kai<br><br>1. We need to maintain our awareness regardless of what we are doing or whoever we are dealing with, and regardless of the place and time.<br><br>2. Buddhism teaches humanity, and in fact all sentient beings in the six realms of transmigration, to have awareness and wisdom.<br><br>3. With awareness we know our every thought and action. We do not fumble because of ignorance or become superstitious.<br><br>4. With awareness we unfold and develop our wisdom to make wise judgements, and we understand the consequences of our actions.<br><br>5. We practise Buddhism because we want to sharpen our awareness; we seek enlightenment.</span><br><br><blockquote>how to go abt doin tis? ..i tink is not physically 'c' rite...its a heart 'see' heart kind of tings..?<br>purpose of recitin heart sutra?</blockquote>No, it is neither physically or mentally. Heart sutra teaches emptiness, so if you can perceive emptiness every moment, in all things. By always perceiving that all things arise due to Yin Yuan (cause and conditions), and cease due to Yin Yuan, it is without subtance and impermanent, therefore we do not become attached. Only remain aware. That is Guan Zi Zai. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>------------------------------<br>pardon mi for my ignorance...any idiot guide to buddhism..haa?</blockquote>This is a good webpage: <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/basic-guide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/basic-guide.htm</a><br><br></div>

But it is very very little. Because firstly, only you are chanting. The merits is limited. There is also a saying, if you chant for someone, 6 out of 7 parts go to yourself, only 1 part goes to the others. Secondly, even though you are chanting, they do not know the dharma, and continue to be trapped in samsara and sufferings. So there is a limit to what you can do... only when they their Yin Yuan ripen to learn and practise the dharma, will they be able to liberate themselves from sufferings.</div>

The highest level of attainment for cultivators of Hinayana Buddhism is the Arahat-hood.<br><br>(4) Middle Vehicle Buddhism or Pratyeka-Buddha Buddhism: This is slightly more advanced than the Small Vehicle Buddhism. The famous Lao-Zi of ancient China can be considered to be the best example of this category. Pratyeka-BuddhaÂ’s, are those who had taken refuge in the Buddha and became the BuddhaÂ’s disciple, in their previous existence of many *kalpas ago, and had personally heard the Buddha expounding on the The Nidanas or the twelve links in the chain of existence. But he did not attain enlightenment then. Latterly, when he was reborn as a human being again, his lifetime did not coincide with that of the Buddha nor was he able to encounter the Buddhist scriptures. However, he continues to cultivate as he had done so in his past life until he attains the state of a Pratyeka-Buddha. This is called the Pratyeka-Buddha Vehicle Buddhism. Since the level of attainment is slightly more advanced than the Small Vehicle Buddhism, it is therefore also called the Middle Vehicle Buddhism. Like those of the Small Vehicle Buddhism, practitioners of the Middle Vehicle Buddhism are not concerned about ferrying other sentient beings across the sea of suffering to the shore of enlightenment. They attain enlightenment through the observation of the "the flying flowers and the falling leaves", the natural changing of the seasons, the times, and the world, or witnessing the twelve links in the chain of existence.<br><br>(5) Greater Vehicle Buddhism or Mahayana Buddhism: As the name suggests, the Greater Vehicle is likened to a train or a ship which can ferry many passengers on a single trip; ferrying them across the sea of suffering to the shore of enlightenment. For this reason it is called the Greater Vehicle. The Small Vehicle is like a motorcycle or a bicycle which can carry only one or two persons at a time. This is different from the Mahayana Bodhisattvas, for example, Avalokitesvara or Kuan-Yin, Mahasthama, Manjusri, Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, and many others. They are all Mahayana Bodhisattvas. Not only do they ferry sentient beings of this world to the shore of enlightenment, they also do the same for sentient beings of the other realms, such as devas or celestial beings, animals, ghosts and hell. Thus, they are called the Bodhisattvas of the Greater Vehicle.</span>....</div>
