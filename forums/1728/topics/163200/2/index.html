Being aware and focused on breathing. As I have mentioned it is always best to learn it directly from a qualified teacher. Even chanting can help if you can concentrate well on the chanting. But if you can do meditation regularly it will be good.<br><br>Awareness/mindfulness is not about the mind or about the thoughts. It is about our innate awareness nature. If something is happening out there, or something bad is happening, but you can continue to remain simply aware and not led into wandering thoughts, then it is awareness. Even if you have wandering thoughts, you are completely aware (and therefore let go). If someone wishes to tempt you into something that is wrong, and you are aware, then you will not be tempted. If you are aware, you will not steal, get into fights/arguments etc. If you are not aware, you start to steal, you get into fight/arguments, that is called 'ignorance', not knowing. The word 'Buddha' actually means Awareness/Awaken. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Therefore it is important that we practise awakening/awareness.</div>

From the 1st list, other than the sutra on Amitayus which focuses more on other-power (but is also not lacking in self cultivation instructions), all other sutras were related to self-power, self cultivation. Seems like you have not read much yet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Second thing is the Mahayana canon is vast and includes all those scriptures in the Pali canon. Not all of them were listed in the list. Other than that - the Mahayana canon includes plenty of rich and sophisticated teachings and methods to enlightenment which are not found in the other canon.<br><br>All teachings are taught according to the conditions and needs of sentient beings as I mentioned... also depending on what kind of capacity the person is. If the person is suited to practise the Shravakayana, then the Buddha will teach him the teachings leading to self-liberation. If the Buddha sees that someone has the seeds of practising the Bodhisattvayana, the Buddha teaches the Bodhisattvayana (i.e Mahayana) teachings, which is to liberate himself and others and attain Anuttarasamyaksambodhi (the perfect and complete enlightenment), Buddhahood.<br><br>We must know that although the Buddha taught 84000 dharma doors to enlightenment, <strong>all dharmas are ultimately equal in nature</strong>. All teachings are Buddha's convinient means of conveying the truth to different people.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Subhuti asked, "With what esoteric implication do you say so?"<br><strong>"I say so because all dharmas are equal by nature."</strong><br>Subhuti asked, "If all dharmas are equal, where are such dharmas as the stages of Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas established?"<br>Manjusri answered, "As an illustration, consider the empty space in the ten directions. <strong>People speak of the eastern space, the southern space, the western space, the northern space, the four intermediate spaces, the space above, the space below, and so forth. Such distinctions are spoken of, although the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">empty space itself is devoid of distinctions.</span></strong> In like manner, virtuous one, the various stages are established in the ultimate emptiness of all things, although the emptiness itself is devoid of distinctions." </span></div>

Thus learnt from my dharma teacher.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> One time a monk asked Zhaozhou "Does a dog have Buddha-nature or not".<br>Zhouzhou answered, "No."<br>Another time a monk asked Zhaozhou "Does a dog have Buddha-nature or not".<br>Zhaozhou answered, "Yes."</span><br><br>Yet if we investigate the various teachings of the Buddha, they do not leave the 4 Dharma Seals - because these seals are the universal TRUTHS that Buddha realised and expounds.<br><br>See: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=158048" rel="nofollow">The Four Seals</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reason for the seeking of Rebirth in Buddhaland , is very simple .<br>Take a look at our this world ,<br>natural disaster and war separates families , destroy happiness<br>and we have no time to continue on practice in this (able to tolerate suffering)<br>saha world<br><br>every year ,many natural disaster just makes us feel life is so fragile , if we do not seek rebirth in western paradise and then come back when perfect ourselves , the overpowering nature of Shared Karma throws us deep and deep into suffering ,thereby committing heavy karma actions and not able to come back to the Buddha's path ..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there is no particular dharma door that is better than the other.... that which works for him is the best dharma. Also known as 'dui4 zhen4 xia4 yao4'.<br><br>It is true that the Pure Land practise is the indispensable practise in modern days. Even Chan masters also teach Pure Land method along with their Chan practises. My master also helped in delivering many people to Western Pure Land... it depends on what kind of 'yin yuan'. If a person can rely on zi-li (self power) then rely on self-power... if not practise ta-li (other power). My dharma teacher aims to help in delivering her parents to the Western Pure Land.</div>
