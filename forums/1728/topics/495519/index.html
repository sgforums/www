              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Phayul May 15 2018</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">DHARAMSHALA, MAY 15: The Chinese authorities of Driru County
              in Nagchu Prefecture have arrested 30 Tibetans with one reported missing
              following opposition to a mining project by local Tibetans from Markor, Wathang
              and Gochu in Driru County, Nagchu Prefecture, in eastern Tibet, on April 2,
              according to the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mining project at Sebtra Zagyen, a sacred mountain overlooking
              several villages located in Shakchu (Ch: Shaqu) Town faced vehement opposition
              from local Tibetans from Markor, Wathang and Gochu.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Karma, leader of Markor Village, was detained in late
              February for challenging an official order that forced all residents of Markor,
              Wathang and Gochu to sign a document allowing local authorities to conduct
              mining activities at Sebtra Zagyen. The villagers were warned that they would
              be branded as ‘separatists’ if they refused to sign the document. Karma had openly
              confronted government officials saying he would sign the document if it had
              approval from veteran party leaders such as Tenzin and Ragdi. As soon as news
              of Karma’s detention reached exile Tibetan sources, local authorities
              immediately called a meeting during which Tibetans suspected of involvement in
              sending the information out were detained on April 2. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Out of the 30 detained in early April, TCHRD has identified
              nine including two women. Khenrab, 36, is a government official in Shakchu Town
              and also a member of village cadre team. He was detained for engaging in
              “separatist activity” after he had lectured the villagers on the importance of
              environmental protection. His whereabouts remain unknown. He had earlier been
              detained in 2015 and held for six months at an undisclosed location on the
              charge of “maintaining contacts with separatists”. He was later released and
              reinstated to his post.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Rinchen Namdol, 39, and Tsultrim Gonpo, in his 50s, are monks
              from Drong Ngur Kagyu Phelgyeling Monastery in Wathang. Both monks had been
              imprisoned for a year in 2015 on the charge of engaging in “separatist
              activity”. The monastery has been under heightened surveillance for years. The
              authorities also detained the relatives of the six monks who had brought down
              the Chinese national flag from atop the monastery. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The head of the monastery, Rechung Rinpoche, 72, was
              subjected to severe repeated interrogations. Jangchup Ngodup, in his 60s, is a
              resident of Markor village.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Dhongye, 51, is a businessman and resident of Gochu village.
              He had won the ‘Clean Environment’ competition held at Sernye village in the
              past.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A doctor named Sogru Abhu, 39, from Lhegyen village, and
              Namsey, 39, from Dakra village in Shagchu Town were also among the detained.
              Sogru Abhu had earlier been jailed for two years’ after he was sentenced on
              charges of ‘separatism’ in 2009.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One of the two women detained is the daughter of a man called
              Tsangtsa Lamsang, according to the TCHRD. The identity of the other woman is
              unknown. The photo obtained by TCHRD shows both women but it is unclear which
              one is Lamsang’s daughter.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Local authorities had begun building roads at the foothills
              of Sebtra Zagyen by the end of last year to facilitate mining activities.
              Around 5 March, makeshift shelters for labourers started appearing around the
              mining site along with small Chinese national flags that were hoisted in and
              around the area. Local Tibetans are concerned that mining would destroy the
              sacred Sebtra Zagyen Mountain, which is also home to endangered animals such as
              Tsoe (Tibetan antelope), Nah (Blue Sheep) and Gowa (Tibetan gazelle). There are
              fears that mining would also cause landslides at another sacred mountain called
              Drakar that lies on the right of Sebtra Zagyen, which in turn would block the
              water supply to the local villagers. The Shakchu river and the Khechu river
              flow alongside Sebtra Zagyen,” TCHRD said. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Sebtra Zagyen, located on the north side of Diru County, is
              one of the three “secret, supreme places” made sacred by the spiritual practice
              of the first Drong Ngur Choje Gyalwa Gangpa Rinchen Woser who founded the Drong
              Ngur Kagyu Phelgyeling Monastery in 1248. Representing the Buddhist practice of
              taming the body, mind and speech, the Drong Ngur monastery is considered the
              supreme sacred place of body, followed by the secret, supreme place of speech
              of Drakar Mountain and the supreme sacred place of mind represented by Sebtra
              Zagen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy has
              demanded immediate and unconditional release of all Tibetans detained. It also
              demanded the whereabouts and condition of all 30 Tibetans as well as the
              village leader Karma be made available to their family members without further
              delay. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“As a party to international treaties, Chinese authorities
              have obligations and duties under international law to respect, protect and
              fulfil human rights of all Tibetans. Branding all acts of environmental
              activism as ‘separatist’ exposes the hollowness of current Chinese leadership’s
              claim to “promote ecological civilisation”.</span></p>
