            <div class='col-md body'>WHAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT? It is said that words cannot describe being Enlightened. It is said that to be Enlightened means to be free. Before one can be free, one must know what to be free from. What does it mean to be free from suffering? In the Buddhist sense, suffering means to be caught up in the karmic wheel of Samsara or the cycle of birth and rebirth. Every being on this earth is subject to the concept of impermanence by going through at least two of the four earthly stages of birth, old age, sickness and death. Beings are born into this and other planes of existence because of what they did in a past incarnation. The concept of reincarnation applies to this line of thinking. The being's karma determines whether re-incarnation will be pleasurable or painful. Whatever it may be, it doesn't last and the being gets reborn into another plane or the same one. And this cycle of suffering goes on and on. Enlightenment is freedom from this cyclic existence by being beyond karma. The Tibetan Buddhist tradition sites a place called Dewachen where Enlightened beings congregate. It is a sort of Heaven in the Tibetan tradition where all are spiritually accomplished and rest in bliss.But on a more simplistic note, the sufferings one 'tries' to be free from are the illusions the mind/ego present, illusions of greatness, hate, greed, guilt, jealousy, anger and all other disturbing and destructive emotions and states of mind. The concept of attachment is often used in Buddhist teachings. One can say that Enlightenment is to relinquish one's attachments to these disturbing states of mind. How does one get attached to disturbing emotions? Isn't it that disturbing emotions are what people try to avoid?<br><br>Feeling negative emotions is a very human characteristic and should not be suppressed when they arise, but to remain angry, hateful or depressed long after the reason for it has past, is what is known as being attached to the emotion. To be free from suffering in the Buddhist sense means to be beyond hate, anger, fear, and other negative emotions. Siddhartha Buddha was known as "The Compassionate One." Compassion is an indispensable part of being Enlightened. There are numerous tales of Siddhartha demonstrating acts of selfless compassion to others. The Buddhist concept of a Boddhisattva is an Enlightened saint who defers his/her entrance into Nirvana until all other sentient beings have entered Nirvana. Compassion in the Buddhist sense not only means compassion for others, but also for oneself. There are many tales of masters and monks who attained Enlightenment through acts of selfless compassion. It is said that in one of Siddhartha's past lives, he was an ox in one of the infernal hell planes. He and another ox were being tormented by a demon to pull a heavy load. In his ox incarnation he took pity on his suffering partner ox and told the demon that he would pull the cart himself saving his friend ox from further suffering. Enraged, the demon slew Siddhartha's ox incarnation which furthered his path to higher incarnations for Enlightenment. There are many teachings, sutras and meditation practices in the various schools of Buddhism that promote compassion. Compassion is an essential factor in attaining Enlightenment. In fact, other religion's central figures have been known to be an icon/symbol of unconditional, selfless compassion. Another description of Enlightenment is to give up the struggle of being caught up in the illusions of life. There is struggle everyday, everywhere, by everyone. There is the struggle for status, wealth, and acceptance. There is a struggle to achieve happiness. The reason why there is struggle is because one is looking outside of oneself for happiness, looking to materialism, and people for self worth. Giving up the struggle also means to look within oneself for happiness.<br><br>A sort of reflective attitude is encouraged to be free from the struggle. It is said that Ananda, Siddhartha's cousin and right-hand man, attained Enlightenment in one night by just giving up struggling, trying, for Enlightenment. It seemed that he was one of the first followers of Siddhartha but was one of the last of the original disciples to attain Enlightenment. By letting go, Enlightenment seems to be so simple yet so many are still struggling for happiness. Enlightenment has also been described as being beyond duality. Duality is the concept of separation where there exists an I, me, you, them, and other concepts of division via race, creed, nationality, economics etc. The preceding explanations are but a few attempts to explain what Enlightenment is. The Zen Buddhism school says that Enlightenment (Satori) is beyond form. But explaining Enlightenment in words, attempts to give it form. By attempting to give Enlightenment form though words, the essence is lost. To understand Enlightenment one must do the practice of meditation. This is an essential prerequisite<br><br>from : http://www.geocities.com/gotaro/<br><br>i just find it an interesting article...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to comment that Dewachen = Sukhavati = Amitabha Western Pure Land of Bliss, which is known not only to the Tibetan traditions but also the entire Mahayana in general. It is not only a place for enlightened beings - but ordinary beings as well (i think chinese is called fan sheng tong ju?) may seek deliverance from Amitabha and be borned in Pure Land. It is also very different from just 'heaven' or a place for enjoyment. The main purpose there is to learn from Amitabha &amp; attain Buddhahood.<br><br>Anyway interesting article <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Yes, its limited to describe enlightenment, we can only learn and practise the teachings of Buddha and see the truths ourselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>good question.<br><br>my take is that heavenly realm is associated with happiness, while pureland is associated with neither bliss nor suffering, a state of sublime quiescent. quite similar to the Contentment Heaven where Maitreya reside. But Maitreya lives in the Inner Court-yard where 'Buddhist activities' are also needed beside just state of contentment. Devas outside the courtyard are still enjoying themselves.<br><br>Different between happiness and true bliss:<br><br>Ordinally happiness when ended, suffering occur there after.<br>Know that suffering is real, and happiness is false. As suffering don't become happiness, but happiness can become suffering.<br>Example, when eating good food. Eating my favourite food is happiness. But, if were to continue to eat bowl after bowl of the same food, it becomes a suffering. This is how happiness become suffering. happiness if continue become suffering. But suffering if continue will not become happiness.<br>Example, when hungry, i am experiencing suffering. If continue to stay hungry for 7 days, i will experience more suffering, not happiness. So suffering is real, and happiness is false.<br><br>Now neither suffering nor happiness is a good experience/realm. But one cannot sustain this state as time waits for no man. Example when we are born, we are already walking towards the deathbed. Who can stop moving? Nobody.<br>But it's said that in the Land of Ulitmate Bliss, there's no all above three forms of sufferings. hence the word 'Ulitmate'.<br>In this samsara world there's duality in this and that. Suffering and happiness is Prejudiced view for one side or the other. If Land of Ulitmate Bliss has NO suffering, then happiness is also gone. As both are on the same side of the coin. One gone, the other will too have to go with it. It's when both suffering and happiness is ended that bring forth the Land of Ulitmate Bliss. Thus called True Bliss. If there happiness, then happiness is suffering and false. Land of Ulitmate Bliss is indeed inconcievable! Inconcievable mean cannot be said, nor cannot be think nor cannot be percieve.<br><br>/\<br></div>
