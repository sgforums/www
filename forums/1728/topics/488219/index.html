                      Europe were medieval cities, rich in shrines, palaces, markets and colour.
                      Their tight-knit urbanism recalled the intimacy of Tudor England. They were
                      part and parcel of Nepal’s cultural identity.</span></p>

                      that wiped out Europe’s old cities, it was the bulldozers and developers that
                      came in their wake. Such vultures circle over these disasters, paid not to
                      conserve but to relieve immediate suffering, with little care for the past or

                      the Nepal earthquake must be humanitarian. But populations can and do restore
                      themselves. The loss to a nation’s culture and identity – in Nepal’s case also
                      to its tourist economy – can be for ever. Such is the trauma of this loss that
                      its recovery can seem unimaginable. Asia currently faces threats to its
                      historic legacy that, were they in Europe, would be rated global cataclysms.

                      of European architecture's great works are reproductions, from Venice’s

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The cause in each case is
                      irrelevant, be it war or natural disaster. The remedy is what matters. The
                      answer to cultural destruction is restitution. There is no technical handicap.
                      Money can always be raised, as it was after the </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/dec/26/vasari-last-supper-reassembled">Florence
                      floods of 1966</a><span style="line-height: 1.231;">. The cost merely defines the value we place on that culture.
                      The arts of conservation have never been so skilled, or scholarship so
                      thorough. The job can be done.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">One dogma stands in the way of
                      restoring Nepal’s historic districts, the art-historical cult of the ruin.
                      Destruction is “the historical record”, it proclaims. What war or nature has
                      destroyed should be “conserved as found”, lest we stand condemned
                      by the great god, authenticity. If we want to know what the past
                      looked like, we should ask a professional consultant for an artist’s impression.
                      All else is pastiche, “Disneyfication”.</span></p>

                      ideological problem in restoring and if necessary reproducing the legacies of
                      their past. Most of the great works of European architecture are reproductions,
                      from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/apr/21/observer-archive-venice-campanile-rebuilt">Venice’s

                      Castle</a>. Kathmandu’s lofty Dharahara tower, now a pile of stones, was
                      actually the third erected on the site after earthquakes, most recently in
                      1934.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Yet the anti-restitution dogma
                      remains influential. It has gripped 12 years of Unesco wrangling over the
                      Bamiyan Buddhas. Some “experts” feel the holes should be left as a memorial to
                      Taliban iconoclasm, as part of the statues’ “authentic” history. Others argue
                      that the statues were already much restored, and the best counter to their
                      destruction is replacing them. Asians have no aesthetic hang-ups about
                      reproducing images of the Buddha. No one can decide.</span></p>

                      dimensions. They are potent in the imagination, which is why totalitarian
                      regimes so often seek to destroy them. Heritage sites remind people of who they

                      decide how far to go in restitution. But money, expertise and

                      should return to their former glory.
