              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I am a secular Buddhist. It has taken me years to
              fully “come out,” and I still feel a nagging tug of insecurity, a faint aura of
              betrayal in declaring myself in these terms. My practice as a secular Buddhist
              is concerned with responding as sincerely and urgently as possible to the
              suffering of life in our <em>saeculum</em>—this world, this age in which we find
              ourselves now and future generations will find themselves later. I see the aim
              of Buddhist practice to be not the attainment of a final nirvana but rather the
              moment-to-moment flourishing of human life within the ethical framework of the
              Eightfold Path here on earth. Given what is known about the biological
              evolution of human beings, the emergence of self-awareness and language, the
              sublime complexity of the brain, and the embeddedness of such creatures in the
              fragile biosphere that envelops this planet, I cannot understand how after
              physical death there can be continuity of any personal consciousness or self,
              propelled by the unrelenting force of acts (<em>karma</em>) committed in this or
              previous lives. For many—perhaps most—of my coreligionists, this admission
              might lead them to ask: “Why, then, if you don’t believe such things, do you
              still call yourself a ‘Buddhist’?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I was neither born a Buddhist nor raised in a
              Buddhist culture. I grew up in a broadly humanist environment, did not attend
              church, and was exempted from scripture classes, as they were then called, at
              grammar school in Watford. At the age of 18 I left England and traveled to
              India, where I settled in the Tibetan community around the Dalai Lama in
              Dharamsala. I became a Buddhist monk at the age of 21 and for ten years
              underwent a formal monastic education in Buddhist doctrine, philosophy, and
              meditation. Even in the wake of the 1960s this was considered a highly
              unconventional career path. Buddhism, when it was mentioned at all in those
              days, was dismissed by mainstream Western media as a marginal though benign
              spiritual preoccupation of ex- (or not so ex-) hippies and the occasional
              avant-garde psychiatrist. I would have dismissed as a fantasist anyone who told
              me that in 40 years meditation would be available in the U.K on the National
              Health Service, and a U.S. congressman (Tim Ryan) would publish a book called <em>A
              Mindful Nation: How a Simple Practice Can Help Us Reduce Stress, Improve
              Performance, and Recapture the American Spirit</em>.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Buddhism had its origins in 5th-century B.C.E.
              India and eventually spread throughout the whole of Asia, but it was not until
              the middle of the 19th century that Westerners had any inkling at all of what
              it taught and stood for. The abrupt discovery that Gotama Buddha was a
              historical figure every bit as real as Jesus Christ, and whose influence had
              spread just as far and wide, came as a shock to the imperial conceits of
              Victorian England. While a tiny handful of Europeans converted to Buddhism from
              the late 19th century onward, it was only in the late 1960s that the dharma
              started to go viral in the West. In contrast to Christianity, which slowly and
              painfully struggled to come to terms with the consequences of the Renaissance,
              the European enlightenment, natural science, democracy, and secularization,
              Buddhism was catapulted into modernity from deeply conservative, agrarian
              societies in Asia, which were either geographically remote or cut off from the
              rest of the world through political isolation. After a lifetime of work in
              Buddhist studies, the scholar and translator Edward Conze drew the conclusion
              that “Buddhism hasn’t had an original idea in a thousand years.” When Buddhist
              communities collided with modernity in the course of the 20th century, they
              were unprepared for the new kinds of questions and challenges their religion
              would face in a rapidly changing global and secular world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I suspect that a considerable part of the Western
              enthusiasm for things Buddhist may still be a Romantic projection of our
              yearnings for truth and holiness onto those distant places and peoples about
              which we know the least. I am sometimes alarmed at the uncritical willingness
              of Westerners to accept at face value whatever is uttered by a Tibetan lama or Burmese
              sayadaw, while they would be generally skeptical were something comparable said
              by a Christian bishop or Cambridge don. I do believe that Buddhist philosophy,
              ethics, and meditation have something to offer in helping us come to terms with
              many of the personal and social dilemmas of our world. But there are real
              challenges in translating Buddhist practices, values, and ideas into
              comprehensive forms of life that are more than just a set of skills acquired in
              courses on mindfulness-based stress-reduction and that can flourish just as
              well outside meditation retreat centers as within them. Buddhism might require
              some radical surgery if it is to get to grips with modernity and find a voice
              that can speak to the conditions of this <em>saeculum</em>.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So what sort of Buddhism does a self-declared
              secular Buddhist like myself advocate? For me, secular Buddhism is not just
              another modernist reconfiguration of a traditional form of Asian Buddhism. It
              is neither a reformed Theravada Buddhism (like the Vipassana movement), a
              reformed Tibetan tradition (like Shambhala Buddhism), a reformed Nichiren
              school (like the Soka Gakkai), a reformed Zen lineage (like the Order of
              Interbeing) nor a reformed hybrid of some or all of the above (like the
              Triratna Order, formerly the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order). It is more
              radical than any of these: it seeks to return to the roots of the Buddhist
              tradition and rethink Buddhism from the ground up.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In exploring such roots, secular Buddhists find
              themselves excavating two fields that have been opened up in the past century
              by modern translators and scholars. The first of these fields consists of the
              earliest discourses attributed to Siddhattha Gotama, which are primarily found
              in the Pali canon of the Theravada school. We are exceptionally fortunate as
              English speakers to have not only a complete translation of the Pali canon but
              one that is continually being improved—something that speakers of other
              European languages can still only dream of. The second of these fields is that
              of our increasingly detailed (though still disputed and incomplete)
              understanding of the historical, social, political, religious, and
              philosophical conditions that prevailed during the Buddha’s lifetime in
              5th-century B.C.E. India. Thanks to scholars like Richard Gombrich [</span><a href="http://www.tricycle.com/feature/what-buddha-thought"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: black;'>interviewed in this issue</span></a><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>], we are
              beginning to see more clearly the kind of world in which the Buddha taught.
              Together, these two fields provide a fertile soil for the project of
              rethinking—perhaps reimagining—the dharma from the ground up.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Yet this very wealth of material also raises
              serious difficulties in interpretation. The Pali canon is a complex tapestry of
              linguistic and rhetorical styles, shot through with conflicting ideas,
              doctrines, and images, all assembled and elaborated over about four centuries.
              The canon does not speak with a single voice. How then to distinguish between
              what is likely to have been the word of the Buddha as opposed to a
              well-intended “clarification” added by a later commentator? We are not yet—and
              may never be—at a point where such questions can be answered with certainty. Be
              that as it may, as a Buddhist practitioner I look to the Buddha’s discourses
              not just for scholarly knowledge but in order to help me come to terms with
              what the Chinese call the “great matter of birth and death.” It is in this
              sense that my secular Buddhism still has a <em>religious</em> quality to it,
              because it is the conscious expression of my “ultimate concern”—as the theologian
              Paul Tillich once defined “faith.” As one who feels an urgency about such
              concerns, I am bound, therefore, to risk choices of interpretation now that may
              or may not turn out to be viable later.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '> My starting point is to bracket anything
              attributed to the Buddha in the canon that could just as well have been said by
              a brahmin priest or Jain monk of the same period. So when the Buddha says that
              a certain action will produce a good or bad result in a future heaven or hell,
              or when he speaks of bringing to an end the repetitive cycle of rebirth and
              death in order to attain nirvana, I take such utterances to be determined by
              the common metaphysical outlook of that time rather than reflecting an
              intrinsic component of the dharma. I thus give central importance to those
              teachings in the Buddha’s dharma that <em>cannot</em> be derived from the Indian
              worldview of the 5th century B.C.E.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I would suggest tentatively that this “bracketing”
              of metaphysical views leaves us with four distinctive key ideas that do not
              appear to have direct precedents in Indian tradition. I call them the four P’s:
              <br> <br> 1. The principle of conditionality <br> 2. The process of four noble tasks (truths)<br> 3. The practice of mindful awareness <br> 4. The power of self-reliance <br> <br> Some time ago I realized that what I found most difficult to accept in Buddhism
              were those beliefs that it shared with its sister Indian religions Hinduism and
              Jainism. Yet when you bracket those beliefs, you are left not with a
              fragmentary and emasculated teaching but with an entirely adequate ethical,
              philosophical, and practical framework for living your life in <em>this</em> world. Thus what is truly original in the Buddha’s teaching, I discovered, was
              his <em>secular</em> outlook.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>And when you bracket the quasi-divine attributes
              that the figure of the Buddha is believed to possess—a fleshy
              head-protuberance, golden skin, and so forth—and focus on the episodes in the
              canon that recount his often fraught dealings with his contemporaries, then the
              humanity of Siddhattha Gotama begins to emerge with more clarity. All this
              supports what the British scholar Trevor Ling surmised nearly 50 years ago:
              that what we now know as “Buddhism” started life as an embryonic civilization
              or culture that then mutated into another organized Indian religion. Secular
              Buddhism, which seeks to articulate a way of practicing the dharma in this
              world and time, thus finds vindication through its critical return to canonical
              sources, and its attempts to recover a vision of Gotamas’s own <em>saeculum</em>.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Above all, secular Buddhism is something to do, not
              something to believe in. This pragmatism is evident in many of the classical
              parables: the poisoned arrow, the city, the raft—as well as in the Buddha’s
              presentation of his four “noble truths” as a range of tasks to be performed
              rather than a set of propositions to be affirmed. Instead of trying to justify
              the belief that “life is suffering” (the first noble truth), one seeks to
              embrace and deal wisely with suffering when it occurs. Instead of trying to
              convince oneself that “craving is the origin of suffering” (the second noble
              truth), one seeks to let go of and not get tangled up in craving whenever it
              rises up in one’s body or mind. From this perspective it is irrelevant whether
              the statements “life is suffering” or “craving is the origin of suffering” are
              true or false. Why? Because these four so-called “truths” are not propositions
              that one accepts as a believer or rejects as a nonbeliever. They are
              suggestions to do something that might make a difference in the world in which
              you coexist with others now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Awakening, therefore, is not a mystical insight
              into the true nature of mind or reality (which always, weirdly enough, accords
              with the established views of one’s brand of Buddhism) but rather the opening
              up of a way of being in this world that is no longer determined by one’s greed,
              hatred, fear, and selfishness. Thus awakening is not a state but a process: an
              ethical way of life and commitment that enables human flourishing. As such, it
              is no longer the exclusive preserve of enlightened teachers or accomplished
              yogis. Likewise, nirvana—the stopping of craving—is not the goal of the path
              but its very source. For human flourishing first stirs in that clear, bright,
              empty space where neurotic self-centredness realizes that it has no ground at
              all to stand on. One is then freed to pour forth like sunlight.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Such a view of the dharma fits well with the
              English theologian Don Cupitt’s vision of a “solar ethics.” In Room 33 of the
              British Museum you will find a small clay Gandharan bas-relief from the 2nd
              century C.E. that represents the Buddha as a stylized image of the sun placed
              on a seat beneath the Bodhi tree. In the Pali canon, Gotama describes himself
              as belonging to the “solar lineage” (<em>adiccagotta</em>), while others call him
              by the epithet “solar friend” (<em>adiccamitta</em>). A true friend (<em>kalyanamitta</em>),
              he remarks, is one who casts light on the path ahead just as the rising sun
              illuminates the earth. Yet as Buddhism grew into an organized Indian religion,
              it seemed to lose sight of its solar origins and turned lunar. Nirvana is often
              compared to the moon: cool, impassive, remote, and also—as they didn’t know
              then but we know now—a pale reflection of an extraordinary source of heat and
              light. Perhaps we have reached a time when we need to recover and practice
              again a solar dharma, one concerned with shedding its light (wisdom) and heat
              (compassion) onto and into this world, which, as far as we know, might be the
              only one that ever has been or ever will be.<span class="entry-date"></span></span></p>
