              needs to admit all radical roads lead back to Saudi Arabia</span></strong></p>

              McWilliams <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">23/03/2016<span>Â </span></span>Irish Independent</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231; text-align: justify;">Yesterday, few places felt more vulnerable than the Central
              Line, as I sat with my son, deep under London's streets. The train stopped
              suddenly around Queensway and we both looked at each other, indeed everyone
              looked at each other. No one needed to say anything; everyone understood what
              everyone else was thinking. This is what terrorism does, it terrorises; and, if
              not quite terrorise, it puts doubts in your head where there weren't any
              before. That's enough.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">London
              is full of mosques, the vast majority of them frequented by people who have no
              truck with those who murdered so callously in Brussels, but some people who go
              to some mosques obviously do. This is the only conclusion that you can draw.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Young
              men and young women become radicalised because someone else teaches them. It
              doesn't happen on its own. People who once were happy to be barmen don't turn
              into soldiers of Allah overnight. It is a process.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              you talk to Muslims, particularly older ones, they will tell you that this
              process of radicalisation is relatively new. It is the product of the past 30
              or 40 years. If this is the case, what has happened? What has happened is that
              after the revolution in Iran in 1979, the West decided that Iran was the enemy
              and that our new best friend, Saudi Arabia could do no wrong. Saudi Arabia was
              the strong counterbalance to Iran in the Middle East and, therefore, anything
              it did was sanctioned.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              looked the other way, so much that we didn't even bother to understand the
              extreme form of Islam that Saudi Arabia practised and, worse still, fomented
              abroad.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Saudi
              Arabia practises Wahhabism. If you want to understand the region, it's critical
              to understand this strain of Islam that is preferred by - and exported by -
              Saudi Arabia.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You
              can't understand Isil and those people that carried out yesterday's attacks
              without understanding Saudi Arabia's role in all of this. What drives Isil to
              blow up ancient Roman, Persian and Buddhist monuments is rooted in Wahhabism.
              Nor can you understand what perverted logic drives them to kill innocents
              without learning about this type of strict Islam.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              all begins a long time ago.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Muhammad
              ibn Abd al Wahhab was born not far from Riyadh in 1703. He trained as a holy
              man and was, like many religious people, constantly torn between a purist adherence
              to the original scriptures and a more tolerant accommodation of the word of God
              leavened with the reality of day-to-day living. This schism is not unusual. The
              fight between puritanism and pragmatism is, after all, at the heart of the
              great split in the western Christian Church too - what we called the
              Reformation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Al
              Wahhab called for the purification of Islam and a return to pristine Islam.
              When the young Imam called for the beheading of women in his local town for
              adultery, the people knew this guy meant business. However, it is likely that
              this form of extremism wouldn't have caught on in what was, by the standards of
              the time, a reasonably tolerant place had it not been for local insurrection
              against the unpopular Ottoman Empire which ran the Arabian Peninsula and taxed
              the locals mercilessly.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Possibly,
              in an effort to get God on his side in his fight against Istanbul, the local
              leader of a small oasis, Mohammad ibn Saud, threw his lot in with the renegade
              preacher, Al Wahhab, in 1745. The link between the House of Saud and Wahhabi
              was forged there and then; and they have been allies ever since.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              the time, Islam, like lots of religions, was a concoction of bits of other
              religions, beliefs and practices. These had been borrowed and customised along
              the way. Remember, this part of the world was the crucible of civilisation, the
              epicentre of the world's great trading routes and a place where the three main
              monotheist religions - Christianity, Judaism and Islam - had been founded;
              Judaism and Christianity literally a few yards from each other, Islam a few
              hundred miles down the road.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Al
              Wahhab objected to this evolutionary, almost 'hand-me-down' approach to Islam.
              As a purist, he wanted to go back to basics, to make pristine the religion.
              Possibly the most important tenet of Wahhabis is that they believe in what they
              call "the oneness of God". As a result, association with lesser gods,
              other gods, mysticism, shrines, temples, saints or holy men amounts to idolatry
              and must be stamped out.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              put Wahhabis on a collision course with the other strains of Islam, such as
              Shi'as or, even worse in the eyes of the Wahhabis, Sufism. Shi'as and Sufis
              were the enemy within and, of course, Judaism and Christianity were the enemies
              at the door. Wahhabis called for jihad against all these infidels.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              a century, the march, and reach, of the Wahhabis was limited to the Arabian
              Peninsula. Then the game changed, Saudi Arabia struck oil and the politics of
              the region altered forever, so too did geo-politics and Western economic
              expedience. Once the Saudis discovered oil, the West snuggled up to Riyadh, no
              questions asked.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Now
              the most extreme form of Islam was wedded to the richest country on earth and
              the Saudis have set about exporting not just oil, but a radical, intolerant
              form of Islam which drives Isil and various other jihadi groups. Saudi Arabia
              has spent some of its vast oil wealth on financing madrassas from Malaysia to
              Manchester - some of which are projecting Wahhabi ideas far from the Gulf.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Isil,
              with its murder of innocents, its desecration of ancient monuments and its
              subjugation of women, is the latest incarnation of extreme Wahhabism, and Saudi
              Arabia - the West's biggest ally in the region - is Isil's biggest external
              financier. It costs money to wage war and Isil gets money from oil, local
              racketeering, hostage-taking and external private donations. The private
              donations come from donors, many of whom are Saudi.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you follow the money, all radical roads lead back to Saudi Arabia, not states
              that are supposedly the West's enemies such as Libya, Iraq or even Assad's
              Syria.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              majority of the 9/11 hijackers, Bin Laden, his al-Qa'ida chief lieutenants and
              all five regional Isil commanders in Syria and Iraq are Saudis. Each of these
              extremist organisations are the 21st century offspring of Muhammad ibn Abd al
              Wahhab, the cleric who came out of the desert in the 1730s and the institution
              he allied with in 1745: the House of Saud.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              sooner the West admits this, the better.</span></p>
