              <p>I met Luangta Mahabua in February 2005, when he was 92. <br><br>The monk is perhaps best known for collecting more than 10 tonnes of gold bars and more than US$10 million in cash via donations to a public campaign to salvage Thailand's economy after the Asian financial crisis. <br><br>In my meeting with him in 2005, I remember as I approached the Wat Pa Ban Tad temple in Udon Thani, that I felt the aura of the place. The area around the temple was a bit dry and dusty, but morning light filtered through the leafy trees. The grounds and parts of the temple were being swept by devotees.<br><br>I remember waiting for him to finish speaking to his followers, and then he sent word for me to join him. I sat next to him and he asked me what I wanted. <br><br>I felt momentarily awkward because there were about 50 people listening to our conversation. How was I to conduct an interview, much less an interview about politics, under these circumstances? But I ploughed on, and opened with a question on the practice of the Dharma (Thais call it Dhamma) in Thailand. <br><br>I can’t recall his answer today. I do recall that when I tentatively broached a political question, he sidestepped it. I dropped the idea of talking about politics then, and we just had a short conversation about Buddhism.<br><br>What I recall most of all was his presence. The strength of his personality was palpable. He struck me as the classic spiritual teacher – stern, blunt yet compassionate, engaged yet detached, and with an acerbic sense of humour. <br><br>At age 92, he sat upright and his face was still strong. I was in my late 40s then, but felt like a child in his presence.<br><br>Luangta Mahabua made an extraordinary impact on Thailand, not just in spiritual terms. After the 1997-98 financial melt down, he began collecting gold from followers to bail out the Bank of Thailand. <br><br>By August 2003, he had donated a stunning 7,726 kilos of gold and US$ 7.7 million in cash to the bank. A mid-year tally in June 2004, showed that visitors to his website alone had donated 10,312 kilos of gold and over US$10 million.<br><br>Reports say he left three wills, each stating that all donated gold in his custody should be turned over to the Bank of Thailand. <br>Luangta Mahabua was born in August 1913 as Bua Lohitdee. He became a monk at age 21, like many young Thai men. But unlike most Thai men, he stayed on. <br> <br>He was regarded by his followers as a living ‘’arahant’’ or one who has attained true spiritual liberation. <br>Following the death of his teacher Ajarn Mun Bhuridatto, also a charismatic forest monk, Luangta Mahabua practiced in the seclusion of the forests. In 1997 he told his followers this life would be his last and he would not be born again. <br><br>I feel privileged to have been in his presence even if for only a short while.</p>
