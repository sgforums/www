This would indirectly isolate or keep out many out there from making the first step to want to understand Buddhism.<br><br>This is not to say all Buddhist teachings should now be completely translated into English, but let's try new ways, and improve on existing ones, to make Buddhist teachings more accessible to English speaking people. We need translators, interpreters, for example, who may or may not be Buddhists. The emphasis is on bringing out the true essence of the teachings.<br><br>Your concern about English speaking families and their future religious inclinations is the same as mine.<br><br>Buddhists can do the same as Christians, not because we want to convert any non-believers, but guiding people when they're lost, is one of most natural things a fellow human being and any Buddhist should do. It's not about comparisons, it's about learning good things that we can observe in others, regardless of religion or race.<br></div>

Or perhaps they are 'IC-Buddhist' but aren't Buddhist (didn't take refuge in triple gems), and did not know the dharma...<br><br>So it is also not just a matter of believing or not believing, I think there are many out there who 'believe in Buddha' but don't know much about the teachings, much less how to practise the teachings.<br><br>It is because of the lack of dharma knowledge among the younger generation (like Isis said earlier if you tok about Buddhism ppl will usually have the impression of being 'cheena' as well as the confusion of buddhism with some folk practises) that Buddhism is not growing that fast.</div>

This seeing is neither visual nor cognitive. It is a function of awareness or "citisakti" (consciousnessenergy) and functions as prajna.<br><br>objects and their constituent factors when seen through lose their conditioned significance. phenomena, which are nothing other than perceptual acts, are no longer taken out of their underlying context as separate objects in an objectgrid. there is no longer a dissecting of the web of manifestation into defined objects, actions, events and situations. awareness-of becomes simply Pure Awareness within which awareness-of (objects) comes and goes. this coming and going is seen to be a play of the mind, a projection based on the perceptual mechanism.<br><br>as the conditioned activity of the mind (vrtti) slows down its underlying context and source: citisakti is naturally uncovered. the slowing down of conditioned perception renders the mind transparent (empty of objects). through that transparency the ground within which perception spontaneously arises comes to the fore. the background has merged with the foreground, the foreground with the background. the perception of objects can and will still occur should action require it. but the tendency to regard any objects, actions, or events as independent and autonomous from the flow of totality, which is thereby overlooked, is being undermined. instead objects, such as they are, are experienced as being emanations of the totality specific only and momentarily to definable coordinates of space and time. however these co-ordinates are only functions of their definition as such. they also are functions of perception. "unconditional samadhi undermines the sense of self as the projected play of perception and time cease". as objects resolve into the mandalic web of citisakti, so also does the subject lose its significance. in the light of unobstructed citisakti neither subject nor object can sustain their significance. in this way the tyranny of dualistic perception arising from the sense of separate self is fully undermined.</div>

Though it is also regrettable that Buddhist teachings have been distorted in one way or another, due to inevitable influences of folk cultural practices, it just simply means that we have an never-ending but welcomed responsibility (moral, religious or personal, etc) to improve our personal behaviour and public image through our practical application of Buddhist teachings.<br><br>I can only hope that more committed, caring and insightful Buddhist leaders (young or old), are willing to be more proactive in disseminating and explaining basic Buddhist core values and also more importantly, in debunking myths among the general public, of any race, religion, or language.<br><br>In order to achieve that, we have to actively befriend people, so that we have more opportunities and time to discuss and explain basic Buddhist teachings to the general layman public. Note this is not recruitment or conversion of faith in any sense, cos anyone and everyone becomes a follower of Sakayamuni Buddha's teachings through his or her own understanding and choice.<br><br>As long as one day, it can be observed that more and more members of the public, especially among the young, are slowly able to have a good understanding of basic Buddhist core values, we would have been contributing/have contributed in a small way to helping people learn about Buddhism, which ultimately benefits everyone in all aspects of their lives.<br></div>
