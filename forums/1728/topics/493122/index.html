              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the Cakkavatti Sihananda Sutta, the Buddha said that
              immorality and crime, such as theft, falsehood, violence, hatred, cruelty,
              could arise from poverty. Kings and governments may try to suppress crime
              through punishment, but it is futile to eradicate crimes through force.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the Kutadanta Sutta, the Buddha suggested economic development
              instead of force to reduce crime. The government should use the country’s
              resources to improve the economic conditions of the country. It could embark on
              agricultural and rural development, provide financial support to entrepreneurs
              and business, and provide adequate wages for workers to maintain a decent life
              with human dignity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the Jataka, the Buddha had given to rules for Good
              Government, known as ‘Dasa Raja Dharma’. These ten rules can be applied even
              today by any government which wishes to rule the country peacefully. The rules
              are as follows:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">a.    be liberal and avoid selfishness,
              maintain a high moral character,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">b.    be prepared to sacrifice one’s own
              pleasure for the well-being of the subjects,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">c.    be honest and maintain absolute integrity,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">d.    be kind and gentle,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">e.    lead a simple life for the subjects to
              emulate,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">f.    be free from hatred of any kind,
              exercise non-violence, practise patience,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">g.    and respect public opinion to promote
              peace and harmony.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Regarding the behaviour of rulers, He further advised:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">– A good ruler should act impartially and should not be
              biased and discriminate between one particular groups of subjects against
              another.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">– A good ruler should not harbour any form of hatred against
              any of his subjects.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">– A good ruler should show no fear whatsoever in the
              enforcement of the law, if it is justifiable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">– A good ruler must possess a clear understanding of the law
              to be enforced. It should not be enforced just because the ruler has the
              authority to enforce the law. It must be done in a reasonable manner and with
              common sense. — (Cakkavatti Sihananda Sutta)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the Milinda Panha, it is stated: ‘If a man, who is unfit,
              incompetent, immoral, improper, unable and unworthy of kingship, has enthroned
              himself a king or a ruler with great authority, he is subject to be tortured‚
              to be subject to a variety of punishment by the people, because, being unfit
              and unworthy, he has placed himself unrighteously in the seat of sovereignty.
              The ruler, like others who violate and transgress moral codes and basic rules
              of all social laws of mankind, is equally subject to punishment; and moreover,
              to be censured is the ruler who conducts himself as a robber of the public.’ In
              a Jataka story, it is mentioned that a ruler who punishes innocent people and
              does not punish the culprit is not suitable to rule a country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The king always improves himself and carefully examines his
              own conduct in deeds, words and thoughts, trying to discover and listen to
              public opinion as to whether or not he had been guilty of any faults and
              mistakes in ruling the kingdom. If it is found that he rules unrighteously, the
              public will complain that they are ruined by the wicked ruler with unjust
              treatment, punishment, taxation, or other oppressions including corruption of
              any kind, and they will react against him in one way or another. On the
              contrary, if he rules righteously they will bless him: ‘Long live His Majesty.’
              (Majjhima Nikaya)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha’s emphasis on the moral duty of a ruler to use
              public power to improve the welfare of the people had inspired Emperor Asoka in
              the Third Century BC to do likewise. Emperor Asoka, a sparkling example of this
              principle, resolved to live according to and preach the Dhamma and to serve his
              subjects and all humanity. He declared his non-aggressive intentions to his
              neighbours, assuring them of his goodwill and sending envoys to distant kings
              bearing his message of peace and non-aggression.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">He promoted the energetic practice of the socio-moral virtues
              of honesty, truthfulness, compassion, benevolence, non-violence, considerate
              behaviour towards all, non-extravagance, non-acquisitiveness, and non-injury to
              animals. He encouraged religious freedom and mutual respect for each other’s
              creed. He went on periodic tours preaching the Dhamma to the rural people. He
              undertook works of public utility, such as founding of hospitals for men and
              animals, supplying of medicine, planting of roadside trees and groves, digging
              of wells, and construction of watering sheds and rest houses. He expressly
              forbade cruelty to animals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Sometimes the Buddha is said to be a social reformer. Among
              other things, He condemned the caste system, recognized the equality of people,
              spoke on the need to improve socio-economic conditions, recognized the
              importance of a more equitable distribution of wealth among the rich and the
              poor, raised the status of women, recommended the incorporation of humanism in
              government and administration, and taught that a society should not be run by
              greed but with consideration and compassion for the people. Despite all these,
              His contribution to mankind is much greater because He took off at a point
              which no other social reformer before or ever since had done, that is, by going
              to the deepest roots of human ill which are found in the human mind. It is only
              in the human mind that true reform can be effected. Reforms imposed by force
              upon the external world have a very short life because they have no roots. But
              those reforms which spring as a result of the transformation of man’s inner consciousness
              remain rooted. While their branches spread outwards, they draw their
              nourishment from an unfailing source — the subconscious imperatives of the
              life-stream itself. So reforms come about when men’s minds have prepared the
              way for them, and they live as long as men revitalize them out of their own
              love of truth, justice and their fellow men.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The doctrine preached by the Buddha is not one based on
              ‘Political Philosophy’. Nor is it a doctrine that encourages men to worldly
              pleasures. It sets out a way to attain Nirvana. In other words, its ultimate
              aim is to put an end to craving (Tanha) that keeps them in bondage to this
              world. A stanza from the Dhammapada best summarizes this statement: ‘The path
              that leads to worldly gain is one, and the path that leads to Nibbana (by
              leading a religious life) is another.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">However, this does not mean that Buddhists cannot or should
              not get involved in the political process, which is a social reality. The lives
              of the members of a society are shaped by laws and regulations, economic
              arrangements allowed within a country, institutional arrangements, which are
              influenced by the political arrangements of that society. Nevertheless, if a
              Buddhist wishes to be involved in politics, he should not misuse religion to
              gain political powers, nor is it advisable for those who have renounced the
              worldly life to lead a pure, religious life to be actively involved in
              politics.</span></p>
