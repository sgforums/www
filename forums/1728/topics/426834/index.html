              <p>So here it says if you recite a mantra, one will be protected from sickness, famine, fire, danger from water, danger from war, weapons, one is protected from all kinds of punishments, unnecessary punishments; not the necessary ones. And unexpected deaths. These are the eight ordinary accomplishments and six wealths. What are the six wealths that we would accomplish from such practice?</p>
              <p><br>Six Wealths<br>1. We will live long life.<br>2. We will accumulate lots of merits.<br>3. We will look very graceful, powerful.<br>4. Everybody will admire you, respect you.<br>5. You will have lots of friends.<br>6. And you will accumulate lots of wealth.</p>
              <p><br>These are the six wealths.</p>
              <p>Four motivations<br>1. Everybody will see you as parents, so they will love you, care for you, admire you, like you.<br>2. And everybody will see you as a guru, so they will respect you. This is second.<br>3. And then everybody will see you as a very powerful person, like a king, so everybody will be afraid, or scared to talk to you or harm you.<br>4. And everybody will see you as a friend. Everybody will be very friendly with you.</p>
              <p>Eight accomplishments<br>Then these are the eight accomplishments. These are always discussed. Benefits are always explained in many Tantrayana teachings.<br>1. Medicinal Eye lotion. Not to look pretty. Different. Eye Lotion. When you use this eye lotion then you are able to see through the ground. What is there? Is there any gold mine or whatever under ground? You are able to see everything. This is the first accomplishment.<br>2. Then Kangyok. "Kangyok" means once you have this, you are able to walk very fast. Like ordinary people can walk about one kilometer, maybe you can walk about 20, 30 , 40 or 100 kilometers.<br>3. Then you hold a wisdom sword, you are able to fly. You can come to Sikkim. (Rinpoche laughs)<br>4. You are just able to go under ground, with a physical body you can just go underground, nothing obstructs you.<br>5. There is also a pill that when you hold that you are able to do so many things, miraculous things. You will have miraculous power<br>6. You are able to go to many places of daka, dakinis, purelands.<br>7. You become invisible man. Nobody can see you, you just disappear, even if you are standing in front of us. Nobody can see you – invisible man.<br>8. Finally, “tru'len “ that you are able to absorb the nature of four elements. There are some people, some gurus who don't have to eat because they can do that. You can absorb the energy, something like extract you know, extract from the four elements. You don't have to eat, you don't have to drink. Always healthy, strong, energetic, because you are extracting the energies of the four elements or five elements. So you are able to do that. So these are the benefits that one can accomplish, even though you may not have become a Buddha but you will have these you know. And of course the ultimate accomplishment is to become a Buddha.</p>
