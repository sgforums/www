              Why is the Kalachakra Initiation So Popular?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Zuzi Griffiths Cernakova
              Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-03-24 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Once
              every couple of years, news and social media light up around the world with
              images of the red-robed Dalai Lama seated upon a high ceremonial throne amid a
              sea of devoted followers and captivated audience members. This newsworthy and
              popular Buddhist event is the Kalachakra initiation, which has become something
              of a hallmark of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama as the religious gathering
              has enjoyed an undiminished popularity over the last six decades. Arenas filled
              to bursting with well-wishers and devotees have earned the self-proclaimed
              “simple Buddhist monk” quite the rock star status. At the start of this year’s
              event, a multitude of Vajrayana Buddhists and fans of the Dalai Lama from
              around the world converged on the holy site of Bodh Gaya in India to attend the
              “34th Kalachakra Initiation and Teachings” that began on 2 January.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              10-day event, presided over by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and organized by the
              Central Tibetan Administration, the Tibetan government in exile, received more
              than 200,000 attendees from 92 countries (the final tally would have been even
              higher had the Chinese government allowed people from Tibet to attend). In
              addition to those present in Bodh Gaya, another 150,000 people joined via live
              webcast translated into 15 languages, including Tibetans unable to attend due
              to travel restrictions. Hearing reports of such a massive turnout, an outside
              observer might naturally wonder: “Why does the Kalachakra draw such enormous crowds?
              And, more particularly, what makes it so appealing to those in the West?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Ever
              since His Holiness began giving Kalachakra initiations in Tibet in 1954 and
              1956, the event has attracted large congregations. When given in India, the
              numbers are similarly immense, as it is a convenient location for both Tibetans
              in exile and Asian Buddhists. The very first Kalachakra initiation was given
              some 2,594 years ago in southern India by Shakyamuni Buddha, who attained
              enlightenment in Bodh Gaya. Receiving any kind of Dharma blessing or teaching
              at such a sacred place is thus considered especially auspicious.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Since
              the beginning of the tradition, initiations have been passed from teacher to
              disciple in an unbroken lineage extending to the Dalai Lama in the present day.
              Receiving an initiation or empowerment, and subsequently accomplishing a
              practice as given by a realized master of an authentic lineage is a pinnacle of
              spiritual endeavor for Vajrayana Buddhists. Upon request, His Holiness has
              given the initiation 34 times in his life, 10 of which were held in the West,
              starting in 1981, when the Kalachakra took place in Wisconsin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              series of empowerments is so sophisticated that only a fraction of the
              multitudes present can truly receive it. Whether or not one can depends on
              one’s level of preparation and motivation, though anyone present is certain to
              receive blessings. During the three principal days of the empowerments to the
              highest yoga tantra class, His Holiness leads the initiates through complex
              visualizations that require the ability to grasp emptiness, in addition to a
              special kind of concentration achieved through prior experience with
              meditation. Having dissolved ordinary appearances and concepts into emptiness,
              one’s self, the surroundings, and the master, are experienced in their pure
              form as the deity within its mandala. Received within this frame, the
              empowerments act as a catalyst for the transformation of the mind’s energies.
              Having thus received the initiation and associated vows, the disciple continues
              to accomplish the practice, with the aim of total transformation of the mind
              and, ultimately, enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Shakyamuni
              Buddha’s original exposition was later recorded as a tantric text containing
              explanations and meditation instructions aimed at leading the practitioner
              toward the ultimate goal, perfect enlightenment. The Cycles of Time tantra
              addresses the phenomenon of time, experienced by unenlightened beings as a
              never-ending stream carrying their lives forward through aging towards death. Time
              is categorized into three cycles: the alternative cycles deal with ways to defy
              time as a life-destroying force, otherwise known as impermanence, the very
              nature of samsara. The outer cycles of time are external cycles the universe
              goes through and are a basis for ancient cosmology, which inspired Tibetan
              astrology and calendar making. The inner cycles relate to the physiological and
              mental cycles of the body, which form a basis for Tibetan medicine. In this
              way, the Kalachakra has been integral to Tibetan culture and science since it
              reached Tibet 1,000 years ago. The relevance within the Tibetan context is
              obvious, but what has the Kalachakra to offer the rest of the world?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              one, this ancient scripture baffles modern science. It offers a strikingly sophisticated
              presentation of the universe, with a description of atoms and sub-atomic
              particles that have a surprising correlation with modern theories of particle
              physics. His Holiness has discussed these parallels in meetings with
              scientists, and there are suggestions that the space particle presented in the
              tantra may be equivalent to the famously elusive Higgs boson.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Despite
              the incredibly sophisticated and multilayered technical content, the Kalachakra
              has not put people off. Quite the contrary, one of the main reasons for
              attending is the social aspect of the occasion; Tibetans have traditionally
              enjoyed religious gatherings as an opportunity to socialize. For foreign
              participants, it is a venue where they can meet like-minded practitioners and
              share in the generation of positive collective merit, while bathing in the
              Dalia Lama’s charismatic presence. Recognizing the social function of the
              initiation, His Holiness uses any opportunity to preach his universal message
              of love, compassion, and peace to the world beyond his flock. When the
              Washington event was titled “2011 Kalachakra for World Peace,” it served as a
              platform for a discussion on His Holiness’ famous message of peace, inviting
              the general public to attend this ancient ritual.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Kalachakra has also given the West the notion of Shambhala, or Shangri-la. The
              myth of the Shambhala pure land, an important part of the tantra, was singled
              out at the start of the 20th century to inspire fanciful theories, which led to
              a hopeless search for a hidden land that could be exploited. It later went on
              to fire the imaginations of the followers of the New Age movement of the 1970s,
              thus making the notion of Shambhala as a perfect spiritual land part of popular
              Western culture. The actual meaning, according to the teachings, is that
              Shambhala is a level of spiritual attainment rather than a physical or
              celestial place.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Assumptions
              based on such popularized misconceptions make the Kalachakra a likely subject
              for misinterpretation. Similarly, the esoteric atmosphere of the distinctly
              Tibetan Buddhist ritual itself, with its trademark sand mandala construction,
              chanting, masked dances, deity depiction, and the symbol of the mantra can
              easily be misinterpreted within the context of an entirely different sociocultural,
              historical, and religious background. Owing to authentic teachings being
              notoriously scarce in the past without preliminary study, the ceremony could
              easily be confused for a great mystical show. But with more reliably sourced
              information made widely available in modern languages in print and digital
              media, earnest candidates are well equipped to appreciate the real meaning and
              potential of the Kalachakra and to make the most of the initiation experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Originally,
              the Kalachakra Tantra, similar to many other ancient Indian Buddhist texts,
              found its way to Tibet, where it was saved from extinction and practiced for
              some 1,000 years. With time, these practices adjusted to and subsequently
              permeated the unique Tibetan culture, ultimately proving their absolute value
              through producing living examples of realized Tibetan practitioners. The
              Buddha’s intention is to benefit all sentient beings beyond the constraints of
              time, space, and culture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Despite
              its esoteric feel and cultural baggage, the unfading global popularity of
              events like the Kalachakra prove how relevant these ancient treasures are for
              today’s spiritually and morally deficient societies, by showing us
              possibilities beyond shallow materialistic goals and stifling consumerist
              self-expression. Ultimately, the objective is to emulate the Buddha in
              following a wholesome path to achieving the perfect freedom of enlightenment
              for the benefit of fellow shackled beings.</span></p>
