              <p>Gampopa said to Phagmotrupa , “Take a walk to that hill over there in the east; later we will discuss all of the dharmas received from others to which you are attached.”</p>
              <p>Phagmodrupa went up the eastern hill and pondered all of this. A short time later,<br>all of his former good experiences quickly disintegrated, falling away like chaff and<br>husk, and he then genuinely realized the true face of authentic realization, that<br>which is beyond rational mind, the mahamudra. At that moment, his mind became<br>unobstructed, like space, and he gasped, “All those former lamas  what are they to<br>me now?” He returned to Gampopa, who was aware of his realization and said to<br>him: “I have nothing more than that to teach you; however, my tradition has a convenient  method that I will give you,” and so he taught him the practice, ‘Unification<br>with Coemergence’. After asking him questions about the nature of mind,<br>Gampopa said, “I say! Geshepa, you understand the Dharma very well”, and explained to him the authentic, vast and profound points of Dharma and gave him the<br>entire set of practice advice in the manner of pouring into a full vase.</p>
              <p>When Gampopa was about to pass into parinirvana, he said, “Geshe Khampa<br>and myself are so indistinguishable from each other, you could split a hair one<br>hundred times and still find no difference. Therefore you great meditators, all you<br>who need to request practice advice and all you who need to cut superimposition,<br>look to him.”</p>
              <p>The next night, the sixteenth, the lama signaled the beginning of his passing with these words: “Alas! Since all composite things  impermanent, production-disintegration dharmins  disintegrate  after being produced, pacify your minds closely and be happy!” Over the next few days he finished the Dharma teaching he had been giving, and then on the twentieth day of the month he gave away all his possessions and made this last testament: “Wealth is the root of all suffering  don’t cling to it! It is easy to be tainted by the stench of bad friends  don’t entrust your mind to worldly people! Wherever you go and wherever you stay, be inseparable from loving-kindness, compassion, and bodhichitta! Don’t investigate other’s faults; this will bring about your own downfall!”</p>
