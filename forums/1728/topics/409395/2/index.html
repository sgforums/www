              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I think there's a point to what you said...</p>
              <p>Btw Thusness told me when he step out of the airplane in Australia, he felt that the energy field in Australia is totally totally different from Singapore... even the air, etc, the environment. The moment he lands in Australia he totally fuses with the environment and enters a very deep meditative state without needing to meditate at all... just being there alone is enough to put you into a very deep meditative state. He also says it's a good place to retire and stay.</p>
              <p>And then this reminded me that my Taiwanese teacher also made the exact same comment... he said that the moment he steps out of his airplane in Australia, he felt a totally different energy field and that is very very different from any other places... he said that Australia is the 'last pure land on Earth'. He also recommends people to move and stay there.</p>
              <p>I wonder why... but looking at Australia on the map, it's one freaking big continent with only like 20 million people... the environment, the air, etc... must still be very pure.</p>
              <p>Btw, Eckhart Tolle also wrote in his book that his intuition brought him from London where the energy field is somewhat dense... to Cananda. Canada is also one freaking big country with very very few people.... he said the energy field in Canada is completely different, and that he cannot write any spiritual books in England but when he moves to Canada he suddenly feels inspired to start writing.</p>

              <p>i wrote a long post then it got wiped by the server. rewriting the gist.</p>
              <p>anyway, agree with simpo, the energetic properties of the place makes a huge difference. It is in fact one of my favourite studies. In tantra, we say there are power spots on earth and these correspond to our inner energetic system, and these places accelerate one's practice by manifold degrees, some say one day of practice in such places equals a years practice in normal places.</p>
              <p>for Australia or NZealand, the energies of the place i think are not only linked to the population density. Another reason i venture , is that the people in that place are still in connection/balance with the Dralhas, or local nature energies.  Their native population are still available (at least in N Zealand) to continue their methods of communication with nature and heal the land. In many other countries, such things are gone. We are quite disconnected from the land. I think C Trungpa rinpoche has addressed this issue quite much too.</p>
              <p>the energetic properties of the environment is very much tied up with the general trend of spiritual/psychological health of the population. i have always been interested in finding out ways in which such things can be improved.</p>

              <p>Yeah there is definitely 'power spots' on Earth... Thusness told me many years ago he wanted to go months-long retreat at some remote high mountains or caves in China where the energy is good to meditate. Practicing in those places can have a very different effect. But he didn't have the time then to do it as he was a busy businessman. I don't know if he still intends to do so today. Or maybe Australia is also good.</p>
              <p>Many ancient practitioners also choose good energy spots on the mountains to cultivate...</p>

              <p>Yeah, there surely must be many other places... do you know of any 'tantric power spots'?</p>
              <p>Eckhart Tolle has definitely realised Stage 1 and 2... and his books lead to Stage 1 (I AM) and 2 (I AM with personality deconstructed leading to the intuition that the universe and everything shares the same source) kind of insight and experience. But he does not have Stage 4 kind of non-dual realisation. Also in recent videos, he start to talk about the divine will... and this is a recent development to my knowledge. I believe it could eventually lead him to Stage 3.</p>
              <p>I still like to read Eckhart Tolle stuff... even though he's not talking about Anatta or Emptiness and in this aspect is different from Buddhism, and he teaches mostly on Presence only, it is nevertheless full of insights and very practical.</p>
              <p>I am glad that someone with true spiritual insights like E.T. could write such an inspirational and transformative book and mass market it to the mainstream... seldom do we see spiritual books full of practical wisdom like that that become bestsellers.</p>
              <p>Which book of his are you reading?</p>

              <p>Tantric Power Spots include places in Nepal (Parping, Godhavari, Sankhu, Maritika etc)</p>
              <p>In India, Bodhgaya is of course a blessed place. But many people there.</p>
              <p>Orissa is one too.  There is Mount Kailash. Padma Ko, Sikkhim, Tso Pema, Lapchi mountains, Chimphur near Samye Monastery. </p>
              <p>I'm just giving the general region. One has to know the specific location.  It may be a small area or a cave etc. </p>
              <p>I have not been to Borobodur but it seems to be a energetic spot too from what i've heard.</p>
              <p>The actual very highly blessed places will tend to be quite uninviting and only renunciates with full dedication to practice can stay long and bear the living conditions&amp;hardships... not to mention that sometimes the guardians seeing that you are not suitable will create obstacles.  But sincere practitioners will benefit alot.</p>
              <p>Hope and wish that you will have the chance to do practice at such places.</p>
              <p>In the meanwhile, wherever u practice, u can make it more conducive by fixing a place of practice, so that spiritual momentum builds up and anchor the force-field with prayers, intention, crystals, holy objects, relics etc.  It will help alot over time.  Having a realised being stay at that place before will also help. </p>
              <p>In Tibetan tradition, the geomancy of the place for doing retreat is regarded as being very important.  It can decide the difference between success or failure.  Those who think that they can succeed against all odds with just their inner qualities while disregarding the external factors which will highly facilitate one's practice or otherwise, will often fail to harvest the fruits of their practice.</p>

              <p>Usually these kind of things is not by Guan Yin. Guan Yin don't anyhow give people supernatural powers.</p>
              <p>It's usually gui shen, ghost deities pretending to be Guan Yin. A lot of mediums who claim to communicate with guan yin are also communicating with ghosts. These ghosts will give these people powers.</p>
