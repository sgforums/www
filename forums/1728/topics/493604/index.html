              maintenance – lessons from the bestselling Buddhist monk </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">John-Paul Flintoff 1 March
              2017 The Guardian </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Haemin
              Sunim says a happy relationship and contented children are within reach for us
              all – if we could just slow down and pay attention to each other</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Some
              people, if you ask them a question, answer quickly. Others take a moment to
              think first. Haemin Sunim looks up, slightly to the right, and allows 14
              seconds to pass before he answers one of my questions. I counted, when I listened
              to the recording. And here’s something: waiting for his reply, I didn’t feel
              even remotely uncomfortable. Because taking time is Sunim’s thing. He’s a
              Buddhist monk who has become internationally famous for it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              book Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down was published in South Korea in
              2012, quickly rose to No 1 on the bestseller list and stayed there for nearly a
              year, selling more than 3m copies. Written in response to requests for advice
              on social media (he has 1.25 million followers on Twitter), it directly
              addresses problems facing people around the world. Some of this is based on his
              personal experience. Much is based on what he has learned from people who ask
              for his help.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              come out of a tradition of Zen Buddhism, and I practise meditation. I give
              lessons. The formal teaching is Buddhist doctrine and teachings. But in the
              temple, when people come in to pray, you might have coffee or tea, and the
              conversation is not usually about spiritual matters but about mundane, everyday
              life. I ask for questions. And often the questions are not about
              meditation but about daily struggle. What do I do to solve this problem, or
              that problem? Very specific. I try to offer my own answers.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Many
              of the questions are about family life. “I encourage people to have a
              very intimate and close relationship with their child, when the child is one,
              two, three, four and five. You should pour your attention and love into them.
              But when the child has grown up, it’s different. Often parents are so much
              in love with their child that they want to do everything – even when the child
              is in their 20s. I say, ‘Maybe you can let your child know that he is already
              an adult. Say, “I love you very much but it’s time for you to grow up.”
              Focusing less on him, and more on yourself, your partner, and the people around
              you, will bring benefits to your child.’”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              was Sunim’s experience. “I feel very lucky. My mother cares deeply about me,
              but is very happy with her own life, and doesn’t have any need to control me. I
              was in my mid-20s when I realised. I have a cousin, and like me he went
              abroad to study.” (Sunim moved to the US to study film, then found the
              religious life.) “My aunt would always pack everything – food, clothes,
              everything – and follow him to the airport to say goodbye. And I realised that
              my mum didn’t do that. Sometimes she didn’t even come to the airport! Not
              that she didn’t love me. She loved me very much.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Did
              you ever tell her?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Yes,
              I told her how grateful I am. She is a very happy person. The best gift you can
              give to your child is to be happy yourself, rather than trying to make your
              child happy.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sunim
              grew up in Seoul, South Korea and has a younger brother. The family was poor,
              he says. “Especially when I was in elementary school, but I always felt a
              sense of love.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              mother is a housewife. His father sells art. “He has a tiny shop selling
              paintings. Other people’s paintings.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sunim
              was always interested in spirituality, he says, and the meaning of life. “What
              happens after we die – that sort of thing. So when I went to bookstores I would
              pick up those books. I started in high school, with a book that profoundly
              influenced me by Krishnamurti. There are so many wonderful books by him. I
              thought it was very interesting. That genuine freedom is freedom from your own
              thoughts. That was such a powerful teaching. I always thought of freedom as
              something to do with politics.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              can he tell people who didn’t have a happy childhood?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              get a lot of questions like that.I offer different ways to heal yourself.
              If you have the issue of abandonment, you feel that your parents didn’t care
              much about you, you were the middle child, or the last child, or your
              family was very poor and your parents were always very tired when they came
              back from work … Having your own child can become a way to heal yourself,” he
              says. “I have heard a number of times that caring for a child, and giving the
              kind of love you never received, can be transformative and healing for
              yourself,” he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              people who don’t have a child? He thinks for a while. “You can offer the love
              you haven’t received by doing volunteer work, perhaps in an orphanage. I heard
              from somebody who volunteered, and frequently washed the babies and children in
              an orphanage, and she always felt incredibly happy, and connected. So I think
              you can heal yourself by giving the love that you haven’t received from your
              own parent.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Do
              you think families pause enough? Or is it always a fight to be heard?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              would be great if we could gift to ourselves a moment of calm, to find our own
              centre, and live more intentionally</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Usually,
              it’s a fight to be heard. When we pause, we can connect to our body, and to the
              person in front of us, instead of being wrapped up in our own thoughts.” One
              reason we don’t do that, he says, is sheer busyness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“People
              have to work for many hours and they are sacrificing their health to make
              money. And because of the net and cellphones, people are losing their
              connections to family members or friends. They’re always online, so on your
              birthday, you get 50 birthday messages and realise you have nobody to have
              dinner with. And that’s very common.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“It
              would be great if we could gift to ourselves a moment of calm and quietude, to
              find our own centre, and go out and live more intentionally, rather than being
              pulled in many different directions and getting sucked in, and losing control,”
              he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              are the most useful pieces of advice you can offer families?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              think that a lot of mothers, with a full-time job, carry a sense of guilt,
              about not spending enough time with her child. My advice would be to think that
              quality matters more than quantity. So even if it’s a very short amount of
              time, shower your child with your full attention and loving care,” he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“That
              intimacy can have huge benefits for the child, compared with being there but
              being stressed and annoyed and anxious that you have to get away. A lot of
              mothers, they get depressed because they don’t feel they have enough time. But
              maybe because you are working, you feel a little more fulfilled. And with that,
              you can bring positivity to your child.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              also get a lot of questions about husband-and-wife relationship problems. If
              your child is emotionally upset, it could be because the husband didn’t pay
              enough attention to his wife. So being kinder to your wife can help your child
              to have balance.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Does
              that kind of teaching usually arise in response to husbands?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Usually
              wives.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Do
              men seek your advice as well? “Usually the husband tells me, ‘My wife nags, she
              tries to control me, she tells me: “Do this, do that, you’re not good enough.”’
              So I jokingly tell my female audience, ‘You thought before you got married that
              you would be able to somehow change him, and you now know how impossible that
              is. And a part of love is acceptance, rather than trying to change your
              husband. To a certain degree, we have to reconcile and accept differences.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You
              said something like that earlier, about your mother not trying to control you …</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“That’s
              one of the lessons that I try to share. When you are trying to control people, you
              feel that something is missing within you, and you want to find somebody else
              who can give you the things that you need. And in the process, you want to
              control that person. But often you can just go out and get that which you have
              been longing to have, rather than use other people to get it,” he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              did you see, and hear, that made you know that you were loved as a child?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Well,
              my parents would sacrifice financial means to give me the best education. I
              felt that they were willing to invest their resource into
              me. And when I was with them, they asked many questions. Questions
              about how I’m doing, how I’m feeling. And whenever I write something, my mum
              collects my newspaper columns. She talks about whether this week’s column
              is good, or not so good. She’s definitely interested in my writing.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So
              it’s something to do with having their attention? Not lots of hugs and kisses?
              Sunim shakes his head.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              say that in my book. If you can pay attention to somebody, without being
              carried away by your thoughts, that’s an expression of love. Only when you love
              somebody can you do that. Krishnamurti tells us to go out and get any stone in
              the world, and put it in your living room, and to pay attention to it every
              time you pass by. And after two months that will be the most important stone in
              the world. Because you paid attention to it.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Do
              you have a stone in your living room? “Hahaha! No!”</span></p>
