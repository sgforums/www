              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The tranquil ‘Kingdom
              of Bhutan’ as Bhutan is officially called is a South Asian country, which lies
              at the eastern end of the Himalayas and shares its borders with China in the
              north and with India from its eastern, western and southern sides. The serenity
              of Bhutan’s capital, Thimphu, which is also the largest city of the country, is
              extremely calming and will help you get a breath of fresh air far away from the
              bustling of the metropolitan cities around the world. Bhutan is one of the best
              places to visit if you’re looking for an unperturbed and rejuvenating holiday.
              Here are 10 reasons why Bhutan will prove to be a blissful experience.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Religious
              beliefs/Buddhism: </span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Buddhism is a religion to about 300 million people around
              the world. More than two-third of the Bhutanese citizens follow Vajrayana
              Buddhism (also the state religion) and around one-third follow Hinduism, which
              is the second most dominant religion in Bhutan. People from all over the world
              come to visit the Bhutanese monasteries.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Landscape/Biodiversity: </span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>While
              you travel through Bhutan you will find steep and high mountains crisscrossing
              by networks of swift rivers. The extra-ordinary geographical diversity and the
              diverse climate conditions play an important in contributing to Bhutan's
              outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems, which are worth seeing.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Weather: </span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Bhutan experiences
              five prominent seasons namely summer, monsoon, autumn, winter and spring. The
              western part of Bhutan experiences heavier monsoon rains whereas the southern
              part undergoes hot humid summers and cool winters and the central and eastern
              Bhutan remain temperate and drier than the west with warm summers and cool
              winters. Bhutan hence gives the flexibility for you to choose the location and
              the time of the year to visit, depending upon the preferable climatic conditions.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Tourist attractions: </span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Thimpu has one of the
              largest statues of Buddha made of bronze and gilded in gold towering over
              Thimpu in Bhutan and the National Memorial Chorten nearby, where Buddhists
              circle clockwise while reciting prayers and whirling prayer wheels. The there
              is the Tiger’s Nest (Taktsang), which is a beautiful monastery located in the
              cliff-side of the upper Paro valley, in Bhutan. Punakha Dzong, Zuri Dzong Hike,
              Gangtey Valley and Bumthang Valley are some other breathtaking destinations in
              Bhutan.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Cuisine: </span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Ema datshi, the
              national dish of Bhutanese is a very spicy dish made with cheese and chilies
              and take great pride in it and you must try it too. The people also take great
              pride in asserting that Bhutan is the first country in the world to have banned
              the sale of tobacco under its Tobacco Act of 2010, hence you can ensure clean
              and fresh air.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Culture and society: </span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Bhutanese tradition
              is deeply steeped in its Buddhist heritage, be it the dress (The national dress
              for Bhutanese men, Kho and for women Kira), the language (Bhutanese or
              Dzongkha), the cultural activities (including masked dances, dance dramas
              accompanied by traditional music at festivals) or its national sport archery,
              which you may have a feel of when you visit Bhutan. Also, you may get to see a
              convention in Bhutanese families where inheritance is generally passed through
              the females rather than the males i.e. the daughters inherit their parents'
              house and the man is expected to make his own way in the world and is asked to
              move to his wife's home. Another distinct feature includes polygamy. Though
              rare, it is accepted in order to keep property in a contained family unit
              rather than dispersing it.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Feeling royal: </span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Bhutan made the
              transition from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy and held its first
              general election in 2008. The current king is Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck
              who wed Jetsun Pema on 13 October 2011. And it may come to you as a surprise
              that spotting/meeting the King of Bhutan is not as difficult as you may think.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Transport: </span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Paro Airport is the
              only international airport in Bhutan. And though Bhutan did not have any
              railways earlier, it has entered into an agreement with India to link southern
              Bhutan to India's vast network. Coming to the connectivity through road, the
              Lateral Road acts as Bhutan's primary east–west corridor, connecting
              Phuentsholing in the southwest to Trashigang in the east and also conncets the
              capital Thimphu to other major population centres such as Paro and Punakha.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Economy: </span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Bhutan's currency is
              the ‘ngultrum’. Its value is fixed to the Indian rupee, which is also accepted
              as legal tender in the country. Though Bhutan's economy is one of the smallest
              economies of the world, it has grown rapidly in recent years. Agriculture used
              to be more instrumental in managing the economy earlier than now Bhutan
              established itself as the first country in the world, with 100 percent organic
              farming, which is creditable.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Souvenirs: </span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Hand-woven textiles,
              Yatras or Yethras (colorful strips of wool cloth, dyed with natural colors,
              which are used to create blankets, jackets, bags and carpets, specially those
              produced in Jakar, Bumthang), Buddhist paintings (usually made </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria Math","serif"; '>â€‹â€‹</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>of
              cloth), stamps (as Bhutan is said to be the "philatelist paradise")
              with detailed images, bright and lively colors and with a high numismatic
              value, Dzi stones, brass statues of various Buddhas, saints, Vajra bells, Dorje
              bells used for religious rituals, cymbals, Bhutanese violins, Tibetan trumpets
              and prayer wheels (which are a popular choice amongst the tourists) are the
              various souvenirs that you may pick up from the markets of Bhutan.</span></p>
