ThatÂ’s your mind. I answer. ThatÂ’s my mind. If I had no mind how<br>could I answer? If you had no mind, how could you ask? That which asks is your mind.<br>Through endless kalpas" without beginning, whatever you do, wherever you are, thatÂ’s your<br>real mind, thatÂ’s your real buddha. This mind is the buddha" says the same thing. Beyond this<br>mind youÂ’ll never find another Buddha. To search for enlightenment or nirvana beyond this<br>mind is impossible. The reality of your own self-nature the absence of cause and effect, is<br>whatÂ’s meant by mind. Your mind is nirvana. You might think you can find a Buddha or<br>enlightenment somewhere beyond the mindÂ’, but such a place doesnÂ’t exist.<br>Trying to find a Buddha or enlightenment is like trying to grab space.

The Buddha is a product of the mind. Why<br>look for a Buddha beyond this mind?<br>Buddhas of the past and future only talk about this mind. The mind is the Buddha, and the<br>Buddha is the mind. Beyond the mind thereÂ’s no Buddha and beyond the Buddha thereÂ’s no<br>mind. If you think there is a Buddha beyond the mindÂ’, where is he? ThereÂ’s no Buddha<br>beyond the mind, so why envision one? You canÂ’t know your real mind as long as you<br>deceive yourself. As long as youÂ’re enthralled by a lifeless form, youÂ’re not free. If you donÂ’t<br>believe me, deceiving yourself wonÂ’t help. ItÂ’s not the BuddhaÂ’s fault. People, though, are<br>deluded. TheyÂ’re unaware that their own mind is the Buddha. Otherwise they wouldnÂ’t look<br>for a Buddha outside the mind.</div>

If you donÂ’t<br>understand by yourself, youÂ’ll have to find a teacher to get to the bottom of life and death. But<br>unless he sees his nature, such a person isnÂ’t a tea6er. Even if he can recite the Twelvefold<br>Canon he canÂ’t escape the Wheel of Birth and Death. He suffers in the three realms without<br>hope of release. Long ago, the monk Good Star 21 was able to recite the entire Canon. But he<br>didnÂ’t escape the Wheel, because he didnÂ’t see his nature. If this was the case with Good Star,<br>then people nowadays who recite a few sutras or shastras and think itÂ’s the Dharma are fools.<br>Unless you see your mind, reciting so much prose is useless.<br>To find a Buddha all you have to do is see your nature. Your nature is the Buddha. And the<br>Buddha is the person whoÂ’s free: free of plans, free of cares. If you donÂ’t see your nature and<br>run around all day looking somewhere else, youÂ’ll never find a buddha. The truth is thereÂ’s<br>nothing to find. But to reach such an understanding you need a teacher and you need to<br>struggle to make yourself understand. Life and death are important. DonÂ’t suffer them in vain.<br>ThereÂ’s no advantage in deceiving yourself. Even if you have mountains of jewels and as<br>many servants as there are grains of sand along the Ganges, you see them when your eyes are<br>open. But what about when your eyes are shut? You should realize then that everything you<br>see is like a dream or illusion.</div>

Only one person in a million becomes<br>enlightened without a teacherÂ’s help. If, though, by the conjunction of conditions, someone<br>understands what the Buddha meant, that person doesnÂ’t need a teacher. Such a person has a<br>natural awareness superior to anything taught. But unless youÂ’re so blessed, study hard, and<br>by means of instruction youÂ’ll understand.<br>People who donÂ’t understand and think they can do so without study are no different from<br>those deluded souls who canÂ’t tell white from black." Falsely proclaiming the Buddha-<br>Dharma, such persons in fact blaspheme the Buddha and subvert the Dharma. They preach as<br>if they were bringing rain. But theirs is the preaching of devils not of Buddhas. Their teacher<br>is the King of Devils and their disciples are the DevilÂ’s minions. Deluded people who follow<br>such instruction unwittingly sink deeper in the Sea of Birth and Death. Unless they see their<br>nature, how can people call themselves Buddhas theyÂ’re liars who deceive others into entering<br>the realm of devils. Unless they see their nature, their preaching of the Twelvefold Canon is<br>nothing but the preaching of devils. Their allegiance is to Mara, not to the Buddha.
