              <p>Timidness is an attachment to the 'self'. To overcome it you must face any sensation of fear or timidness as it is without any aversion, with complete acceptance. We must cut through all habitual tendencies to reason and worry. We must practice this every moment.</p>
              <p>This is by our forummer, Longchen:<br> <br> <span><strong>Dear Friends,<br> <br> If you want to experience non-duality, you must completely let go.
                                              That means you must not argue with yourself and you must not run
                                              away from any sensation, thoughts or feeling that is being felt at
                                              that moment.<br> <br> You must not give yourself excuse to be not what you are at that
                                              moment. You must not reason yourself away from the situation that
                                              you are in at that particular moment.<br> <br> If this persist long enough, something 'magical' will be

              <p>Questioner: In certain situations in life I feel blocked by a
                                              fear which prevents me from acting. How can I be free from this
                                              obstacle?<br> <br> Jean Klein: First free yourself from the word, the concept, 'fear'.
                                              It is loaded with memory. Face only the perception. Accept the
                                              sensation<br> completely. When the personality who judges and controls is
                                              completely absent, when there is no longer a psychological
                                              relationship with the<br> sensation, it is really welcomed and unfolds. Only in welcoming
                                              without a welcomer can there be real transformation.<br> <br> We are in essence one with all existence; when we truly observe
                                              ourselves there is ultimately no observer, only observation -
                                              awareness.</p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p>“In simple openness which is welcoming you will come to accept
                                              and get to know your negative feelings, desires and fears. Once
                                              welcomed and nondirected attention to these feelings will burn
                                              themselves up, leaving only silence. “</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #004080;">Dzogchen Practice in Everyday 
                            Life<br> by HH Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche</span></h1>
              <p>The everyday practice of dzogchen is simply to <strong>develop a complete carefree 
                            acceptance, an openness to all situations without limit.</strong></p>
              <p>We should realise openness as the playground of our emotions and relate 
                            to people without artificiality, manipulation or strategy.</p>
              <p><strong>We should experience everything totally, never withdrawing into ourselves 
                            as a marmot hides in its hole.  This practice releases<br> tremendous energy which is usually constricted by the process of maintaining 
                            fixed reference points.  Referentiality is the process by<br> which we retreat from the direct experience of everyday life.</strong></p>
              <p>Being present in the moment may initially trigger fear.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But by 
                            welcoming the sensation of fear with complete openness, we cut through<br> the barriers created by habitual emotional patterns.</strong></span></p>
              <p>When we engage in the practice of discovering space, we should develop 
                            the feeling of opening ourselves out completely to the entire universe. 
                            We should open ourselves with absolute simplicity and nakedness of mind. 
                            This is the powerful and ordinary practice of dropping the mask of self-protection.</p>
              <p>We shouldn't make a division in our meditation between perception and 
                            field of perception.  We shouldn't become like a cat watching a 
                            mouse. We should realise that the purpose of meditation is not to go 
                            "deeply into ourselves" or withdraw from the world.  
                            Practice should be free and non-conceptual, unconstrained by introspection 
                            and concentration.</p>
              <p>Vast unoriginated self-luminous wisdom space is the ground of being 
                            - the beginning and the end of confusion.  The presence of awareness 
                            in the primordial state has no bias toward enlightenment or non-enlightenment.  
                            This ground of being which is known as pure or original mind is the 
                            source from which all phenomena arise.  It is known as the great 
                            mother, as the womb of potentiality in which all things arise and dissolve 
                            in natural self-perfectedness and absolute spontaneity.</p>
              <p>All aspects of phenomena are completely clear and lucid.  The 
                            whole universe is open and unobstructed - everything is mutually interpenetrating.</p>
              <p>Seeing all things as naked, clear and free from obscurations, there 
                            is nothing to attain or realise.  The nature of phenomena appears 
                            naturally and is naturally present in time-transcending awareness.  
                            Everything is naturally perfect just as it is.  All phenomena appear 
                            in their uniqueness as part of the continually changing pattern.  
                            These patterns are vibrant with meaning and significance at every moment; 
                            yet there is no significance to attach to such meanings beyond the moment 
                            in which they present themselves.</p>
              <p>This is the dance of the five elements in which matter is a symbol 
                            of energy and energy a symbol of emptiness.  We are a symbol of 
                            our own enlightenment.  With no effort or practice whatsoever, 
                            liberation or enlightenment is already here.</p>
              <p>The everyday practice of dzogchen is just everyday life itself.  
                            Since the undeveloped state does not exist, there is no need to behave 
                            in any special way or attempt to attain anything above and beyond what 
                            you actually are.  There should be no feeling of striving to reach 
                            some "amazing goal" or "advanced state."</p>
              <p>To strive for such a state is a neurosis which only conditions us and 
                            serves to obstruct the free flow of Mind.  We should also avoid 
                            thinking of ourselves as worthless persons - we are naturally free and 
                            unconditioned.  We are intrinsically enlightened and lack nothing.</p>
              <p>When engaging in meditation practice, we should feel it to be as natural 
                            as eating, breathing and defecating.  It should not become a specialised 
                            or formal event, bloated with seriousness and solemnity.  We should 
                            realise that meditation transcends effort, practice, aims, goals and 
                            the duality of liberation and non-liberation.   Meditation is always 
                            ideal; there is no need to correct anything.  Since everything 
                            that arises is simply the play of mind as such, there is no unsatisfactory 
                            meditation and no need to judge thoughts as good or bad.</p>
              <p>Therefore we should simply sit.  Simply stay in your own place, 
                            in your own condition just as it is.  Forgetting self-conscious 
                            feelings, we do not have to think "I am meditating."  
                            Our practice should be without effort, without strain, without attempts 
                            to control or force and without trying to become "peaceful."</p>
              <p>If we find that we are disturbing ourselves in any of these ways, we 
                            stop meditating and simply rest or relax for a while.  Then we 
                            resume<br> our meditation.  If we have "interesting experiences" 
                            either during or after meditation,  we should avoid making anything 
                            special of them.  To spend time thinking about experiences is simply 
                            a distraction and an attempt to become unnatural.  These experiences 
                            are simply signs of practice and should be regarded as transient events.  
                            We should not attempt to re-experience them because to do so only serves 
                            to distort the natural spontaneity of mind.</p>
              <p>All phenomena are completely new and fresh, absolutely unique and entirely 
                            free from all concepts of past, present and future.  They are<br> experienced in timelessness.</p>
              <p>The continual stream of new discovery, revelation and inspiration which 
                            arises at every moment is the manifestation of our clarity.  We 
                            should learn to see everyday life as mandala - the luminous fringes 
                            of experience which radiate spontaneously from the empty nature of our 
                            being.  The aspects of our mandala are the day-to-day objects of 
                            our life experience moving in the dance or play of the universe.  
                            By this symbolism the inner teacher reveals the profound and ultimate 
                            significance of being.  Therefore we should be natural and spontaneous, 
                            accepting and learning from everything.  This enables us to see 
                            the ironic and amusing side of events that usually irritate us.</p>
              <p>In meditation we can see through the illusion of past, present and 
                            future - our experience becomes the continuity of nowness.  The 
                            past is<br> only an unreliable memory held in the present.  The future is only 
                            a projection of our present conceptions.  The present itself vanishes 
                            as<br> soon as we try to grasp it.  So why bother with attempting to establish 
                            an illusion of solid ground?</p>
              <p>We should free ourselves from our past memories and preconceptions 
                            of meditation.   Each moment of meditation is completely unique 
                            and full of potentiality.  In such moments, we will be incapable 
                            of judging our meditation in terms of past experience, dry theory or 
                            hollow rhetoric.</p>
              <p>Simply plunging directly into meditation in the moment now, with our 
                            whole being, free from hesitation, boredom or excitement, <em>is</em> enlightenment.</p>
