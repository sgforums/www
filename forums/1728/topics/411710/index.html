Fear not the forms of the peaceful and wrathful who are one's own<br> thought forms.<br> <br> O now when the bardo of rebirth is dawning in one's mind With one single wish,<br> join with the results of meritious acts May the door of the womb be closed and<br> the revulsion recollected The time has come when energy and pure love are needed<br> May one cast off jealousy and meditate upon the father-mother<br> <br> O procrastinating one, who thinks not of the coming of death Devoting oneself to<br> the useless doings of this life, Improvident one is in dissipating ones<br> opportunity Mistaken indeed would ones purpose be now if one returns empty<br> handed Since Dharma is one's need, would one not devote oneself to the Dharma<br> even now?<br> <br> Thus say the Great Adepts in devotion If the chosen teaching of the guru not be<br> borne in mind Would one not be acting as a traitor to oneself? It is of great<br> importance that these root words be heard.<br> <br> Here begins "The Path of Good Wishes Which Protects from Fear in the Bardo":<br> <br> When the cast of chance of one's life is exhausted The relatives of the world<br> avail one not When wandering alone by oneself in the bardo O you conquerors,<br> peaceful and wrathful, exercising the power of your compassion Let it come that<br> the gloom of ignorance is dispelled<br> <br> When wandering alone, parted from loving friends When the shapes of one's empty<br> thought-forms dawn upon one here May the Buddhas, exercising the power of their<br> divine compassion That there be neither awe nor terror in the bardo<br> <br> When the bright radiances of the five wisdoms shines upon one now May one,<br> neither awed or terrified recognize them to be of oneself When the apparitions<br> of the Peaceful and the Wrathful forms are dawning upon ones mind Let it be that<br> with the assurance of fearlessness that one recognizes the bardo<br> <br> When experiencing miseries because of the results of one's actions Let it be<br> that the conquerors, the Peaceful and the Wrathful dispel the miseries When the<br> self-originating sound of reality reverberates like a thousand thunders Let it<br> be that they are transmuted into the sounds of the Mahayana.<br> <br> When one is unprotected and habitual influences have been followed here Beseech<br> the conquerors, the Peaceful and the Wrathful for their protection When<br> suffering miseries because of habitual propensities Let it be the blissful<br> Samadhi of clear light dawning upon ones mind<br> <br> When assuming supernormal rebirth in the Sidpa Bardo Let it be that the<br> perverting revelations of Mara do not occur within When ones mind arrives<br> wheresoever one wishes Let it be that one not experience the illusory fright and<br> awe from karma.<br> <br> When the roarings of savage beasts are uttered Let it be that they are<br> transformed into the Six Syllables (the mantra of the jewel in the lotus) When<br> pursued by snow, rain, wind and darkness Let it be that one sees with the<br> celestial eyes of bright wisdom<br> <br> Let it be that all sentient beings of the same harmonious order in the bardo<br> Without jealousy obtain re-birth in the Buddhalands When suffering from intense<br> miseries of hunger and thirst Let it be that one not experience the pangs of<br> hunger and thirst, heat and cold.<br> <br> When beholding one's parents in union Let it be that one see them as the divine<br> pair, The conquerors, the Peaceful and the Wrathful, Father and Mother. With the<br> ability of being born anywhere for the benefit of others May one be endowed with<br> signs and graces<br> <br> Obtaining for oneself a body, Let it be one that liberates all Without allowing<br> karma to follow Let it be the merits which follow and be multiplied<br> <br> Wherever one is born, there and then Let it be that one meets the conquerors,<br> the Peaceful and the Wrathful. With the ability to walk and talk at birth, May<br> it come that one accomplishes the non-forgetting intellect And remember all ones<br> past lives.<br> <br> In all the various lores, great, small and intermediate Let it be that one<br> masters hearing, reflecting and seeing In whatever place one is born let it be<br> auspicious And may all sentient beings be endowed with happiness<br> <br> O you conquerors, Peaceful and Wrathful, in likeness to your bodies, The number<br> of your followers, duration of your life period, limits of your realms. And in<br> the likeness of ones divine nature Let it be that all others equal you in every<br> way<br> <br> By the gift-waves if the innumerable Peaceful and Wrathful deities And by the<br> gift-waves of the wholly pure reality And by the gift-waves of the one- pointed<br> devotion of the mystics Let it be that whatever is wished for be fulfilled here<br> and now.<br> <br> The Colophon:<br> <br> Through perfectly pure intention In the making of this, through the roots of the<br> merits thereof May the protectorless sentient beings, Mothers, Be placed in the<br> state of the Buddha Let the radiant glory illuminate Jambudvipa (this world) Let<br> this treatise be auspicious And let goodness and virtue be perfected in every<br> way.<br> credited to the precious guru, PadmaSambhava<br> <br> The Path of Liberation Through Hearing, Reflecting, and Seeing in the Bardo<br> <br> Throughout the six realms of samsaric existence this teaching is known as<br> "Liberation Through Hearing and Reflecting". It is not necessary to understand<br> what this teaching means, but rather in simply listening to the words and<br> letting one's own interpretations do the rest. The title means just what it<br> says, particularly the use of the word "through". These teachings are the "Root<br> Verses of the Bardo Thodol", the transition, state of change, life flux, basis<br> of duality, between birth and death; a description of conditioned arising. The<br> deities mentioned are representative of the different aspects of consciousness<br> in one's own mind, and do not represent some external divine being. They form a<br> mandala, a recognizable pattern of archetypal conscious thought forms.<br> Psychologically, they are known to the individual minds of samsaric beings as<br> expressions of egocentricism, namely: (1)ignorance,(2)jealousy, (3)desire,<br> (4)pride, and (5)hatred, as well as the corresponding collective alternatives as<br> (1)bodhisattvic mind,(2)impartiality (justice), (3)altruistic affection,<br> (4)compassion, and (5)all-embracing love. The attributes 2 through 4 constitute<br> the first(1). This teaching is important because of the changes in<br> consciousness, and is not meant to be understood as an intellectual truth or<br> conclusion. It is applicable to uprooting the habitual tendencies of<br> conditioning in one's own mind, but it has no utility otherwise. This teaching<br> is tantric in nature, utilizing duality as a vehicle of skillful means for<br> expounding this dharma and penetrates to the deepest layers of collective<br> unconsciousness. I post it not as an effort of self-aggrandizement, but only to<br> offer it to you without any expectations of reward or condemnation, that all<br> sentient beings realize enlightenment.</p></div>
