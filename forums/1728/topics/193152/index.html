For Buddhism, as Buddhists, we know that Faith leads to steadfastness for us to pursue what the Buddha had taught. Faith leads to Understanding, and Understanding enhances one's Faith.<br><br>Sometimes sutra-studying can be quite interesting. As there are much cultural and era context differences, it is important not to take words literally, but understand the morals behind the texts. So it is best to read n clarify from a Buddhist guide or teacher, to prevent misinterpretation. Buddha promotes rational reasoning, and will never promote superstitious practices or teachings.<br><br>We've to understand this word <strong>nian</strong> (Â”O). It means to "keep in mind", rather than just recite. How does one keep a Buddha or Bodhisattva in mind then? It's to understand their wholesome qualities, and as much as we try, to be like them. As Buddhists, that means to comprehend what Buddha had taught and try as much as we can to apply in our lives.<br><br>To my understanding, each different Bodhisattvas display the different characteristics of the Buddha. Pu Men Pin is showing a very active Compassionate trait of the Enlightenment state. Rather than being passive, Guanyin vows to be actively delivers sentient beings away from sufferings.<br><br>I remember reading this news that happened in quite a few years ago. This boy was walking on the street. As the metal cover of a manhole was faulty, one of his legs sank into the manhole and got stuck. The boy's leg was cut and bleeding profusely. He was in pain and yelling for help. To what I remember, there were people walking past him not extending any help. Finally, a motorcycle rider, stopped and helped him by calling the police and ambulance and keeping the boy company.<br><br>So who is the Guanyin here? =)<br><br>http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/kalama1.htm</div>

In fact in Mahayana Buddhism there are so many different kinds of Maha Bodhisattvas, each of them representing a particular quality - example, Great Vows, Great Compassion, Great Wisdom, Great etc etc.... it represents the type of qualities we must develope in order to attain Buddhahood. And all these Maha Bodhisattvas give us the perfect examples of such qualities we should remember to follow.<br><br>Secondly it is true that Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva's powers are inconceivable. However it is also to be noted that in Lotus Sutra, many things in there are metaphorical, although it is also true that the bodhisattva will be able to save you during dangerous times because the bodhisattva is 'jiu4 ku3 jiu4 nan4'. I would like to relate a story which I posted almost two years ago in the forum:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">If anyone wants to hurt you and pushes you into a great fire-pit, if you contemplate the power of Avalokitesvara, the fire-pit will change into a pond. - Lotus Sutra</span><br><br>So, this is what the translation says. But my master explained that, the "great-fire-pit" refers to the fires of hatred and anger, while the pond, clear and pure, refers to our Buddhamind. This relates to a true story, or experience, back in Taiwan.<br><br>My master had once observed that one of his disciples will meet a tribulation in the coming days... He called him up, and advised him not to be moved away from the triple jems (buddha, dharma, sangha), CHANT Guan-Shi-Yin frequently, and never to be affected by any anger. Just next day, this disciple was working at the construction site (he is a construction worker). Then, he got into an argument with someone on who should use the machine first. Tension rosed, and finally they decided to "settle it" outside. Suddenly, this person remembered my master's words, and began to truly regrett his earlier harshness. He chanted Namo Guanshiyin Pusa, and became very peaceful and calm, and smiled happily. The other person then went there to "settle" the issue, but seeing that he was smiling, he walked away. He threw a vegetable knife he was hiding onto the table. On seeing this, the person (who chanted guanshiyin) was extremely shocked, and realised what could have happened if he had continued the conflict. He was without any weapons, how could he be able to survive, fighting him with a fist?<br><br>From this, we should chant, pay reverence, learn, and most importantly, Be Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. We should learn to be compassionate in all situations, a Bodhisattva's compassion is selfless.<br><br>This is the testimonial to the "power of Avalokitesvara", of course, testimonials are really a lot, many people meeting disasters, car accidents, those that one definitely could not have survived, are saved miraculously by the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>Those who suffers from bad temper and strong hatred can try chanting regularly.. perhaps, 108 times a day. Most importantly, when we chant, we must not let our mind wander, and practice Samadhi (concentration, one-pointedness) on the chanting. In this way, chanting works best to remove our minds of sentient, samsaric thoughts.<br><br>We should all learn to be compassionate like Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>Â“The ultimate goal of teaching is that Emptiness whose essence is Compassion.Â” - Great Pandita Atisha</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like I said Lotus Sutra is heavy with metaphors. For example this one:<br><br>"Thereupon he swallowed various perfumes, sandalwood, kunduruka, turushka, prikka, aloes, and liquidambar gum, and he also drank the fragrant oil of champaka and other kinds of flowers, doing this for a period of fully twelve hundred years. Anointing his body with the fragrant oil, he appeared before the Buddha Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue, wrapped his body in heavenly jeweled robes, poured fragrant oil over his head and, calling on his transcendental powers, set fire to his body. The glow shown forth, illuminating worlds equal in number to the sands of eighty million Ganges. The Buddhas in these worlds simultaneously spoke out in praise, saying: 'Excellent, excellent, good man! This is true diligence. This is what is called a true Dharma offering to the Thus Come One. Though one may use flowers, incense, necklaces, incense for burning, powdered incensed, paste incense, heavenly silken banners and canopies, along with the incense of the sandalwood that grows by the southern seashore, presenting offerings of all such things as these, he can never match this! Though one may make donations of his realm and cities, his wife and children, he is no match for this! Good men, this is called the foremost donation of all. Among all donations, this is most highly prized, for one is offering the Dharma to the Thus Come One'"<br><br>- Chapter 23, Lotus Sutra<br><br>So does it mean that Lotus Sutra encourage self-immolation?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>No. A year ago when I read this part in Lotus Sutra I did not understand. But shortly later when I came across one short article which one of my Master's disciple asked him why was he sometimes in Taiwan, sometimes in U.S, going overseas, in order to spread the dharma he did not rest at all, what is the reason? My master replied that there are two reasons:<br><br>(1) "Burning-Body" Body Offering to the Buddha (Ran2 Shen1 Gong4 Fo2) (2) Clear Karmic Hindrances<br><br>From this I think the "Self-Immolation" refers to wholeheartedly devoting/sacrificing oneself and one's body to the Triple Gems irregardless of anything, and that is the highest offering.<br><br>----<br><br>Shinjo Suguro author of Introduction to the Lotus Sutra says:<br><br><blockquote>The offering of burning the body, which plays such a prominent part of this chapter, should not be taken literally, It symbolizes the spirit of giving one's whole self, believing wholeheartedly, embracing the Most-Venerable-One, and offering to serve the truth with all one's body and soul.</blockquote></div>

For this reason he is called "The Enlightened One<br>Who Listens to the Sounds of All the World."<br><br>If someone facing deadly harm recites Guan Shi Yin Bodhisattva's<br>name, the weapons of the assailants will break apart and he will get<br>away.<br><br>Even if the entire three-fold, great, thousand-world system were<br>teeming with Yakshas and Rakshashas bent on vexing men, when the<br>evil demons hear the name of Guan Shi Yin Bodhisattva called out<br>by these men, they will not be able to see them with their wicked<br>eyes, much less do them in!<br><br>If there is a person, whether innocent or guilty, who is locked in<br>stocks or shackled by ropes and chains, his fetters will snap and fall<br>away, letting him go free as soon as he invokes Guan Shi Yin<br>Bodhisattva's name.<br><br>Suppose vicious thieves in legions that could fill a three-fold, great,<br>thousand-world system infest a perilous road along which a merchant<br>chief guides a traders' caravan laden with precious jewels.If one man<br>among them proclaims: "Good Men, do not be afraid! With all your<br>hearts invoke the name of Guan Shi Yin Bodhisattva, the Enlightened<br>One Who Gives Courage to All Beings! If we beseech this<br>Bodhisattva, we will surely escape these thieves".<br><br>Upon hearing this exhortation, if all the traders in unison cry out,<br>'Namo Guan Shi Yin Bodhisattva!' By virtue of calling out Guan<br>Shi Yin's name, they will immediately go free.<br><br>Infinite Resolve! How imposing is the awesome spiritual power of the<br>Great Bodhisattva Who Listens to the Sounds of All the World!<br><br>If any living being with weighty desires can constantly revere and keep<br>in mind Guan Shi Yin Bodhisattva, his passions will subside. If<br>someone with much anger can constantly revere and keep in mind<br>Guan Shi Yin Bodhisattva, then his anger will subside. If someone<br>dull and foolish can constantly revere and keep in mind Guan Shi Yin<br>Bodhisattva, he will leave stupidity behind.<br><br>Infinite Resolve! The Bodhisattva Who Listens to the Sounds of All<br>the World, with his magnificent spiritual power, confers such abundant<br>benefits as these. And so, living beings should always keep him in<br>their hearts and hold his name in mind.<br><br>If women seeking sons bow to and make offerings to the Bodhisattva<br>Guan Shi Yin, they will give birth to sons happy, virtuous, and wise.<br>If instead, they wish for daughters, they will bear gifted daughters with<br>deep-rooted, wholesome characters, beloved and respected by all.<br><br>Infinite Resolve! Such is the power of the Bodhisattva Who Listens to<br>the Sounds of All the World. Any living being who worships and<br>makes offerings to Guan Shi Yin Bodhisattva will never take a loss<br><br>Therefore, every single living being should hold Guan Shi Yin<br>Bodhisattva's name in mind. Infinite Resolve! Suppose someone held<br>the names of Bodhisattvas to the number of grains of sand in<br>sixty-two million Ganges Rivers, and for this person's entire life, made<br>offerings to them all of food and drink, clothes, bedding, and<br>medicine. What is your opinion? Would the merit and virtue accrued<br>by that good man or woman be abundant?"<br><br>Infinite Resolve replied, "Extremely abundant, World Honored One,<br>very great indeed!"<br><br>The Buddha said, "Yet if someone else held the name of Guan Shi<br>Yin Bodhisattva, bowed and made an offering but one time, the<br>blessings of these two people would be identical, the same in every<br>way, and would endure for quadrillions of aeons.<br><br>Infinite Resolve! Holding the name of Guan Shi Yin Bodhisattva<br>brings blessings and benefits as limitless and boundless as these."<br><br>Again, the Bodhisattva Infinite Resolve asked the Buddha, "World<br>Honored One, how does Guan Shi Yin Bodhisattva wander in this<br>Saha World? How does he speak Dharma for living beings, and what<br>manner of resourcefulness does he command?"<br><br>The Buddha answered Bodhisattva Infinite Resolve, "If there is a<br>living being in some country who can be liberated by a Buddha, Guan<br>Shi Yin Bodhisattva appears as a Buddha and teaches him the<br>Dharma. If someone can be liberated by a Pratyeka Buddha, he<br>appears as a Pratyeka Buddha and teaches him the Dharma. If<br>someone can be liberated by a Sound-hearer, he appears as a<br>Sound-hearer and teaches him the Dharma. If someone can be<br>liberated by a Brahma-heaven King, he appears as a Brahma-heaven<br>King and teaches him the Dharma. </strong></div>

The Lotus Sutra teaches that all other vehicles are taught out of expedient means and in reality it is only the One Buddha Vehicle.<br><br>The Mahayana Practise is to focus on practising the bodhisattva way and thereby attaining Buddhahood while the Theravada focuses on attaining self-liberation, Arhantship, therefore does not focus so much on Maha Bodhisattvas and their qualities. The Lotus Sutra is not recited by the Theravadin Buddhists because their canon does not have this sutra.<br><br>--------------<br>From Sinweiy's previous post in the forum:<br><br>there's difference in opinions n practice between Arahathood &amp; Bodhisattvahood. and jus that Theravada do not like us calling them hinayana(smaller vehicle). so if one's mahayanist, one should watch what we say. there's a expression from Mahayanist saying, without learning hinayana first as a foundation, one's not Buddha's disciple.<br><br>here's Some history, First Council :<br><a href="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php?showtopic=11766&amp;hl=" rel="nofollow">http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php?showtopic=11766&amp;hl=</a><br><br><blockquote>First Council<br>Also known as 500 Council, Theravada Council", The First Compilation, etc. The assembly of 500 leading Bhikhus gathered for 3 months after the Buddha's death to compile the Buddhist sutras.

Mainly the Sravakas, Pratyeka and Bodhisattva. The word Hinayana is found in the Lotus Sutra as well. As I mentioned in my earlier post, we should consider the background and culture when the Sutra was compiled.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes... very good post by Yamizi.<br><br>I forgot to mention... according to the views of Lotus Sutra even Theravada is part of the One Buddha Vehicle because in reality, all the different paths expediently taught in Buddhism are the One Buddha Vehicle which is to say the path towards Buddhahood. By understanding this we will be able to throw away all discriminations at the seemingly different 'yanas'.<br><br>But as to the question of Maha Bodhisattvas, it is very important for Mahayana Buddhists to practise the qualities of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all<br><br>I shall add on<br><br>1. The calling out to a savior in times of help is also present in other religions, esp catholicism, where they call out to Virgin Mary<br><br>2. Based on my study of both Lotus Sutra and Surangama Sutra, Chp 25 of LS is linked to the method advocated in Surangama Sutra. The method is known as the Meditation on the organ of hearing. In mandrin its known as Er Gen Yuan Tong. In the Surangama Sutra, it explains in dept and systematically based on the structure of LS Chp 25, as to why when you call Guan Yin, you have various effects in times of need.<br><br>In meditation there are methods which focus on 1 part of the body --&gt; eg on breathing, on the nose tip, on the eye/ear/nose/tongue/body/mind. And Buddha has affirmed that any sense organ can bring one to englightenment. In the Surangama Sutra, the meditation on the organ of hearing is advocated as suitable for dhamma ending age sentient beings.<br><br>Chronologically Surangama Sutra is expounded after LS but just before the Nirvana Sutra. You can find clues in the sutras itself which suggest this.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are simple explanations of the 5 vehicles, although only the last three are commonly mentioned.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/5vehicles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/5vehicles.htm</a><br><br>In his forty-nine years expounding on the Buddha-dharma, Sakyamuni Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, taught the Five Vehicles of Buddhism. These Five Vehicles are taught as expedients to cater to the different capacities and capabilities of sentient beings. In Buddhism the term Â‘vehicleÂ’ is analogous to a conveyance of deliverance for sentient beings. Thus, when one cultivates according to the teachings of these vehicles, one is conveyed or ferried from one shore to the other. That is, from the present shore where there is an abundance of affliction and suffering of birth and death, to theshore where there is bliss and enlightenment.<br><br>The Five Vehicles of Buddhism are:<br><br>Humanity Vehicle Buddhism, or translated phonetically from Mandarin, Jen Chen Buddhism: The main objectives of Jen Chen Buddhism are to purify the human mind and to promote a blissful culture for humanity, so that we may realize a happy and blissful family, and pure land in this world.<br><br>Deva Vehicle Buddhism: The doctrines expounded to the Devas or celestial beings.<br><br>Small Vehicle Buddhism, Sravaka, or Hinayana Buddhism: The doctrines for those who cultivate for the sake of personal liberation and aspiration for personal salvation. The highest level of attainment forcultivators of Hinayana Buddhism is the Arahat.<br><br>Middle Vehicle Buddhism or Pratyeka-Buddha Buddhism: This is slightly more advanced than the Small Vehicle Buddhism. Like those of the Small Vehicle Buddhism, practitioners of the Middle Vehicle Buddhism are not concerned about the salvation of other sentient beings.<br><br>Greater Vehicle Buddhism, Bodhisattva Vehicle Buddhism or Mahayana Buddhism: While the Small Vehicle is like a motorcycle or a bicycle which carries one or two persons at a time, the Greater Vehicle is likened to a train or a ship which can ferry many passengers on a single trip. Thus, the doctrines of the Greater Vehicle are for personal salvation as well as for the salvation of other sentient beings. Practitioners of the Greater Vehicle Buddhism aspire to ferrying both self and others to the shore of enlightenment. Amongst the well known Bodhisattvas of the Greater Vehicle Buddhism are Avalokitesvara or Kuan-Yin, Mahasthama, Manjusri, Ksitigarbha and last but not least, Samantabhadra Bodhisattva.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/jencbuddhism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/jencbuddhism.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Although the Five Vehicles of Buddhism are means through which one attains Buddhahood, they were expediently taught by Sakyamuni Buddha according to the capabilities of the sentient beings. In reality there is only one vehicle that leads to Buddhahood as is stated in the Lotus Sutra, "In the domain of the Buddhas of the ten directions, there is only One Vehicle of Buddha-dharma, not two nor three, for the rest were taught expediently by the Buddha."...</span></div>
