              <p>Many thanks for your sharing yesterday on the Heart Sutra. Greatly 
              appreciate it. I enjoyed it as it was conducted in a lively and fun 
              manner… Very useful for me. I learnt a lot and better understand some of
               the concepts… Very grateful for your sharing… I have long started 
              helped to promote your books and your courses. It would benefit others 
              who are interested as well. Special thanks for your teaching and 
              sharing. - <strong>Violet</strong></p>
              <p>Just want to say that this is my first time joining a soo… religious 
              class. It’s enlightening and enriching… To share with you, because of 
              attending the class, I’ve started to learn to see my colleague 
              differently. Not to judge her but to empathise and sympathise with her 
              behaviour. And to be forgiving and more tolerating of others. - <strong>Cindy</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you for the wonderful session yesterday. - <strong>Carrie</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks for the wonderful lesson today on the Heart Sutra. - <strong>Wenqing</strong></p>
              <p>Would also like to stress that you have been very detailed and lively during the whole sessions. - <strong>Karen</strong></p>
              <p>Indeed, I got a better understanding of the Heart Sutra now than before - <strong>Fengyi</strong></p>
              <p>Shi’an, it is really nice to receive your notes every week as I have 
              difficulties to retain very ‘chim’ (profound) teachings. Your notes help
               to reinforce concepts that I will otherwise not retain. Thank you very 
              much. - <strong>Maggie</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you for sharing your valuable insights with us. I enjoy your 
              lively presentation and use of real life personal examples. I appreciate
               that the Heart Sutra is very complex and deep, and sometimes it is not 
              easy to convey the meaning of the subtle nuances of this ancient text… 
              Look forward to attending more of your courses. Thank you again for a 
              job well done! - <strong>Kit Fun</strong></p>
              <p>It is very comprehensive and lays a good basis for further study as 
              the concepts are quite ‘chim’ (profound)… Thanks for the sharing and I 
              wish you many successful runs ahead. - <strong>Siew Fern</strong></p>
              <p>Really appreciate the effort you put in for this course – the 
              tireless non-stop explanation in class, as well as the comprehensive and
               precious notes… Thank you. - <strong>Chiew How</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Shi’an, I recently attended your class on the Heart Sutra. It has 
              been most enlightening… Once again, your sessions have always been great
               and they have been very enjoyable. Please keep up the good work and I 
              look forward to further sessions soon. Cheers, <strong>William</strong></p>
              <p>‘Emptiness is form. Form is emptiness.’ A classic verse from the 
              Heart Sutra. Sounds contradicting yet intriguingly true at the same 
              time. Being a beginner learner of the Buddha’s teachings, this doesn’t 
              sound logical to me. The Heart Sutra is the core essence of the Prajna 
              Paramita (Perfection of Wisdom) Though it is the shortest sutra, it is 
              also the most profound sutra. With layman intelligence, it is quite 
              difficult to understand the real meaning behind the verses.</p>
              <p>If you read the whole sutra literally, at the end of the reading, you
               might only conclude that everything is empty. There is no feeling, no 
              perception, no volition, no consciousness, no eye, no ear, no tongue 
              etc. Thus some people have a misconception that Buddhism teaches people 
              to do nothing. Sorry, but this is WRONG. If doing nothing can attain 
              Buddhahood, then why are you and I still here? Emptiness is not 
              nothingness, but being empty of any unchanging fixed nature.</p>
              <p>The Heart Sutra is more than just about emptiness. Every verse has a 
              deeper meaning behind it. It contains the teachings of 4 Noble Truths, 
              Noble Eightfold Path, 12 Links of Dependent Origination… All these are 
              teachings from Sakyamuni Buddha, meant to help all sentient beings to 
              end their suffering… If you are keen to explore the ‘mystical’ teachings
               in the Heart Sutra and to have a deeper understanding behind every 
              verse that you chant, I will recommend this course to you – ‘The Heart 
              of the Heart Sutra’ by Shen Shi’an.</p>
              <p>Through this course, you will get to understand the meaning behind 
              every single word and verse. On top of that, you will get to know the 
              origin of Heart Sutra. You will also gain insights with different 
              perspectives of the Heart Sutra. Teacher Shi‘an will also skilfully add 
              in some jokes to lighten the mood so as to make sure we will not fall 
              asleep!</p>
              <p>At the end of the course, I realised that the Heart Sutra is not as 
              simple as it seems to be. To be able to fully understand the Sutra, it 
              will take years of study and practice. Within the 260 words of the short
               Heart Sutra, it is fully packed with all the goodness of the Dharma’s 
              amazing wisdom. - <strong>Kelly</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Shi’an, our deep gratitude for another round of solid edu-tainment
               on the Heart Sutra class! We’re really amazed at the immense effort you
               took to prepare your classes… <strong>- Bro. Han &amp; Linda</strong></p>
              <p>I really enjoy your Heart Sutra lessons, and been trying to listen to
               the audio music of the Heart Sutra every day. I hope to realise the 
              contents of the Heart Sutra one day through practising the Dharma in 
              daily life. May your teaching be passsed on to benefit more sentient 
              beings, and may this be the cause to help more people to remove Dukkha 
              from their present life. <strong>- Chengding</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Bro Shi’an, my heartfelt gratitude to you for propagating great 
              Buddhist classes to benefit us all. It’s indeed our blessings to have 
              you as a Dharma teacher in Singapore. I’ve indeed learnt &amp; truly 
              benefited from the Heart Sutra class (5th run). I do appreciate 
              your strenuous effort and time devoted to put across the key meaning of 
              ‘Emptiness not being just empty or nothing’… Upon attending your lessons
               (also attended ‘Understanding Amituofo Via The Amitabha Sutra’), 
              recitation of Heart Sutra and Nianfo (Mindfulness of Amituofo) has 
              becoming more meaningful to me, strengthening my faith &amp; aspiration 
              to be reborn In Pure Land. Once again, thanks for the great sharing, and
               may this be just the beginning of the many, many sentient beings coming
               forward to learn from your classes. - With Metta,<strong> Tuck Khuen </strong></p>
              <p>Yes! The [first] session is interesting. Going for Buddhist classes 
              is something new to me… Your explanation is very clear and elaborate. 
              You really make it easy for beginners to appreciate [the Heart Sutra].<strong> - Joyce</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks for the effort in making the lessons interesting with the many
               examples. I personally benefited much from these classes and have no 
              regret attending. Have better understanding of “emptiness” as mentioned 
              in this Sutra and also the Three Universal Characteristics which I had 
              learnt many years ago. Hope more practitioners from the different 
              schools of thought can attend this class. Thanks…åŠŸå¾·ç„¡é‡�. <strong>- Andrew</strong></p>
              <p>First of all, I like to say a big thank you for your tremendous 
              amount of work and effort in holding this class. In the past, I did not 
              understand what is the real meaning behind the Heart Sutra, until I 
              attended your lessons. Very informative, knowledgeable and clear… Once 
              again, a big thank you. I believe all of us have truly benefited. <strong>- Vincent</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you for the detailed, comprehensive and 
              informative materials presented in the class. Indeed, much effort and 
              thoughtful preparation had been put forth to ensure that every 
              single point was conveyed in a clear and easy to understood 
              manner. While the examples given and experiences shared liven up the 
              classes with laughter, they also taught us how to practically practise 
              what we’ve learnt. I think you are a good student of the Buddha! <strong>- Ee</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you for conducting this class! I really enjoyed it and it 
              seriously cleared many doubts of what I had when reading up on the 
              concept of emptiness. In fact, after attending this class, I’m inspired 
              to read up more and attend more lessons/talks on the Heart Sutra. I also
               like how you bring in stories and examples to illustrate the concepts, 
              making it easier to understand… Once again, thank you for teaching this 
              course and the notes sent every week. I am grateful for the opportunity 
              to learn from a knowledgeable teacher like you. <strong>- Stephanie</strong></p>
              <p>Many thanks for another interesting &amp; well taught course! You 
              have given a lucid explanation of the Heart Sutra which is a profound 
              teachings of emptiness taught by the Buddha.  I like the slides and 
              various examples you shared with us to help us understand the meaning of
               the Sutra better. I particularly like the story you shared during the 
              last lesson… It serves as a reminder to me not to be emotionally 
              affected and to remain calm… when face with ups and downs in life. I 
              hope I can have the opportunity to attend your class again as I always 
              enjoy and come out from the class with better understanding of the 
              Buddha’s teachings. Thanks for sharing unselfishly your vast knowledge 
              in Buddhism with us.  Amituofo! – With Metta, <strong>Ivy</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you for the wonderful lesson [1] last week. Unfortunately I’m 
              travelling this week and next, so won’t be able to attend, but hope to 
              return in two weeks’ time. <strong>- Steve</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you… Your method of instruction is a refreshing change.  What I
               particularly like is the way you presented the Buddha Dharma from a new
               angle. <strong>- Lihua<br> </strong></p>
