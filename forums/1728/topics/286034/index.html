Pure love itself is not problematic, and in fact is to be cultivated, such as the practise of metta (loving kindness), as well as the unconditional compassion of a Bodhisattva. These are very important qualities that each Buddhist must cultivate in our lives.<br><br>Even love for your family and spouse is fine, and I have said before there are many lay practitioners, who have families whom they love and care, and yet these practitioners also have attained enlightenment (even today). Some of the highly enlightened forummers here have families too. There has been many lay persons who attained enlightenment and liberation since the days of the Buddha. My local dharma teacher too is a lay practitioner who has family too, same as my Taiwanese teacher though he has in recent years moved to live alone in his dharma center to spend more time in self-cultivation as well as responding to the visits of his students. Though, my Master (who has passed away) is a monk.<br><br>The difference is, is one able to transcend one's attachment to family, or spouse, or anything? You can love them and that is fine, but is there any attachment to them as 'one's posession'? You can't live without them... why? Because it is the grasping of the 'self'... your 'self' holding onto feelings, emotions, and attachment on someone. What if some day your loved ones has to depart from you? Is there a pain in your heart because you have developed such a deep conditioning, your memories, the things you all did together, that you find so precious and have become deeply identified with... and yet all that has to come to an end. What hurts is your ego, your attachment, the sense that my possession has to depart from me... When a thought of losing your loved ones arise, does it lead to fear surging through your entire bodymind? This is surely a sign of deep rooted conditioning and attachment due to the illusory 'self' and the posessiveness of self (attaching to 'mine').<br><br>So the problem is not with love but with attachment and possession, and if that is dissolved/liberated then there is no problem. Your love does not have to be tainted with strong grasping on feelings and possession, though of course that is not very easy but can be achieved through gradual practise.<br><br>If there is unconditional love... the attachment to feeling, persons, identification, the sense of certain people as your 'posession' can dissolve... and yet it is not unfeeling because you have pure unconditional love and compassion for each of them.<br><br>And this unconditional love, being unconditioned, expands to include every single person... in this way there is no exceptions.<br><br>As my taiwanese teacher said... one's obsession with someone can be 'expanded'... to become the unconditional love and compassion encompass everyone, like a bodhisattva.. and this love is not just fixated or focused on a single person. A bodhisattva treats every sentient being equally with compassion and sees the Buddha Nature within each sentient being. He is not obsessed with feelings, possessions, etc.. therefore if say, his wife were to pass away, he would not suffer because of his self-centered attachments to persons and feelings. Maybe he may be sad for a while, but he didn't fixate his love and attachment entirely on that single person (which would then be attachment to the form of a 'self' and 'other person') -- his compassion and love is also 'shared' among all other sentient beings... a form of 'greater love'.. so he does not feel so much of the suffering of losing one's attached possession.<br><br>Furthermore, a Buddhist who have developed wisdom, or gained enlightenment, will be able to have more wisdom when dealing with relationships, will know what kind of relationship to engage and what kind to avoid, and will know how to cope with relationship in life -- i.e not get entangled in relationship, or become obsessed with it causing detrimental effects on your life.<br><br><img src="http://img530.imageshack.us/img530/3200/lqsyxl1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img530.imageshack.us/img530/6681/lqsy2fr8.jpg"><br><br>~ Fa Yin Xuan Liu (2), Ven Shen Kai<br><br><img src="http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/2076/sufferingmb7.jpg"><br><br>~ Fa Yin Xuan Liu (3), Ven Shen Kai</div></blockquote></div>

If anyone takes 'non-attachment' too literally, they is an immediate art of 'non-attachment' to master. This is a wrong understanding.<br><br>Non-attachment comes from attachment. It cannot be separated because it has never been separated. We have to undergo the entire pain, suffering, attachment; we have to cry, fight and feel helpless to understand non-attachment. Because non-attachment does not stand alone, it has its root from attachment. If a person talks about non-attachment without talking about attachment, then it is just blind talks. Without these pains, suffering, feeling of being lost and so on, 'non-attachment' cannot arise because it is a single whole. Before non-attachment is fully understood, we continue to be attached along the path of understanding non-attachment.<br><br>So what does that mean?<br>It means that the pain, aversion, sadness and struggle are all parts of the process of trying to be non-attached and before you 'fully' realised the 'face' of non-attachment, the 'how of fighting the battle' is to replace one form of attachment with another form of attachment.<br></div>

The concept I can roughly understand from the surface, but how to do it EXACTLY in real life? That's the most perplexing and frustrating part for me.<br><br>What and how exactly did the Bodhisattva do when he was just a layman like the rest of us, without great wisdom and all that, arrive at the stage of non-attachment but yet with compassion?<br><br>For example, You and I are now just online acquaintances. If let's say I suffer due to sickness or maybe commit suicide, the intensity of your feeling is almost definitely different compared to another scenario whereby you get to know me in person and for a long time.<br><br>Hardly any Buddhist (there will be some of course, but definitely not in great numbers) in this lifetime can achieve the level of non-attachment of even a first stage saint, much less an Arahant or Bodhisattva.<br><br>As such, many youngsters who hear of such concept feel that Buddhism is cold and indifferent and hard to understand and do in real life.<br><br>At my level of understanding, with my present intellect, I can only struggle...<br></div></blockquote>What I said must be practised, it is not something only an enlightened Bodhisattva can achieve. If that is so there is no point discussing about it. Every Bodhisattva also begin practising as a commoner. That is you can gradually enlarge your 'scope' of love so that instead of fixating on a single person, you become like a Bodhisattva who shares this love with all others.<br><br>We must practise, and that is why we must 'walk the Bodhisattva path'. (xing pu sa dao).. Actually all that I said can be, and must be practised by all of us.<br><br>Talking about enlightenment.. actually as what my Taiwanese teacher told us, all of all we must have confidence in our Buddha Nature, that our Buddha Nature is already complete and we all can attain enlightenment. There are many people who have attained enlightenment, probably much more than you think there is because I know many of them are. I've met many people who had transcendental insights, here in this forum, ppl in my dharma center, my teachers, etc.<br><br>My teacher also spoke about one of his students... who is very low in confidence of his own path. He thought he would never become enlightened, or that enlightenment is somehow a very far off, limited-to-few persons kind of thing. But after being transmitted the dharma by my (taiwanese) teacher, he practised diligently and attained enlightenment. What he attained is not yet full liberation or Xiu Zheng, but is an initial enlightenment (Jian Zheng). But he is very happy and called my teacher up, thanked him and told him the entire process of his awakening.<br><br>So moral of the story is we must be confident in our buddha nature, and practise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> All the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas were just like us once, but they practised and therefore became enlightened.<br><br>I'll post more later when I have time...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW the difference between bodhisattva and sentient, is that sentient is 'you qing' -- have feelings, but bodhisattva is 'jue you qing' -- aware/awakened and have feelings.
