              <p>Hi Bro Shian! Very grateful to have the opportunity to attend this 
              class and learn more about the Dharma. The lessons were fun and 
              interesting as usual, with many quotes (I love them!), animations/ 
              videos and your own stories and analogies (especially the one about the 
              two arrows which is imprinted in my mind now as I find it so true!) to 
              bring your points across. All of these made learning the Dharma even 
              easier, but not forgetting the effort you put in to organise all the 
              information into concise points for the purpose of the lessons. Thank 
              you once again! Amituofo. With metta, <strong>Stephanie</strong></p>
              <p>Like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of your 
              effort in conducting the sessions. Steven and myself thoroughly enjoyed 
              every lesson. Though it was just 2 sessions (so far), I felt energised 
              after the class and try to cultivate some self-reflection on my thoughts
               daily as time goes by… You are a fantastic and interesting teacher. – <strong>Pris &amp; Steven</strong></p>
              <p>I attended your Project Rebirth class yesterday (as the first lesson) and I learnt a lot from it. <strong>- Kelly</strong></p>
              <p>Thumbs up for blending (the materials) so well and your good 
              Powerpoint presentation skills. Your sense of humour is remarkable but 
              unneeded to wow your audience. I can’t fault you and think you deserve 
              every single praise as rightly dedicated below : ) <strong>- Ming Rui</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you very much for the Project Rebirth materials. It is 
              wonderful to have such concise information. I really feel as if I have 
              found the spiritual source I have been searching for. If not for you and
               your words, I may not found the right path. I will read everything you 
              sent me, and also look forward to share them with my friends. Once 
              again, thank you for offering a very enlightening and informative 
              (course and) website. I am very happy to learn how to apply Buddhism in 
              daily life. Best Regards, <strong>Sheila</strong></p>
              <p>Desiring to learn increases learning; by learning wisdom increases; 
              when wisdom increases, it brings happiness. Thank you so much, and I 
              wish you all the best. <strong>- Cheng Wan</strong></p>
              <p>I do find myself progressing better, slightly, as I attend your 
              classes. The course does not only provide me with a better understanding
               of Buddhism, it also given me the courage to step forward to help those
               around me. <strong>- Annie</strong></p>
              <p>It is a great opportunity for me to learn the Dharma from you. 
              Through the interestingly conducted classes, I have been more exposed to
               Buddhism as a religion itself. It allows me to accept Buddhism in a 
              steadfastly secular manner, where it is a teaching to improve oneself in
               becoming a better person. Nevertheless, it has been enjoyable to attend
               your lessons as they are both awe-inspiring and captivating at the same
               time. Each lesson lays a path to rediscover, reflect and recharge 
              yourself… Once again, thank you for answering my questions and being 
              such a great guide of the Dharma. I truly admire your courage to detach 
              yourself from the corporate world and devote into spreading the truth, 
              influencing as many beings as you can. Wishing you all the best in your 
              future endeavours and look forward to your new courses and books. - <strong>Jason</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks for this wonderful course. You have so much things to share, 
              that maybe 10 lessons is not enough? :-] Through this course I have 
              decided on three things: 1) Become a vegetarian or vegan 2) Take the 
              Threefold Refuge and 3) Learn more about Buddhism. Buddhism does make me
               a better person, thanks again. – Amituofo, <strong>Leng</strong></p>
              <p>Just wanna let u know that I thought project rebirth is a good class. <strong>- Jarene</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks for taking effort to send us the notes. Have enjoyed your lessons very much. – Amituofo, <strong>Clarice</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you. I really enjoyed your lessons. I am looking forward to the next course… – Best regards, <strong>Wai Ling</strong></p>
              <p>The last lesson was really good! Cos the last 3 parts have the things
               that I’m interested to know, like karma and rebirth, Buddhist rituals, 
              and refuge. And I learnt a lot in a single session. It was easy to 
              understand. And it’s interesting too.’ – Regards, <strong>Yicai</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you for enlightening me on Buddhist thought. I attended your 
              course as I wanted to know more about life, and how to be contented and 
              happy with oneself… After attending each of your sessions, I also 
              emailed your notes to my husband for his reading, and he too, finds them
               enlightening and beneficial for becoming a better person… Thank you for
               doing a GREAT job and giving me some inspirations in my life. – 
              Regards, <strong>Swee Khoon</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Shi’an, thank you for running Project Rebirth. I have learnt much. <strong>- Adel</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Shi’an… I would like to say that I enjoyed the sessions of Project
               Rebirth very much. This is my first course with you and I totally 
              enjoyed it! Kudos! <strong>- Sze Jie</strong></p>
              <p>I was in the class for Project Rebirth round 2… I attended this round
               (4) as was accompanying my friend. Positive feedback for this round – I
               noticed that you have more diagrams and slides prepared which helps 
              participants to relate much better to the concepts.<strong> – Wendy </strong></p>
              <p>I really enjoy EVERY session. Every session is a golden opportunity 
              to be free from mundane distractions, and I treasure each moment of 
              learning, relearning, discovery, rediscovery and reflection. I am just 
              so full of energy after each session, though my body is tired at the end
               of the day. Thank you so much for bringing us these sessions. I 
              benefited so much from them. I have a strong urge to continue learn 
              after this session. <strong>- June</strong></p>
              <p>Dear Brother Shi’an, Thank you for your effort in sharing the Dhamma…
               Coming from a Theravada background, your teaching is lighthearted and 
              inspiring… Please keep up the good job. <strong>- Jasmine</strong></p>
              <p>Both my husband and myself have benefited much from Project Rebirth. 
              The illustrations, analogies and video clips were refreshing and easy 
              to relate, thus making the lessons very interesting, prolonging our 
              attention span and ease in understanding. Deep gratitude. Keep up the 
              good work of propagating the Dharma. Metta, <strong>Joyce &amp; Andrew</strong></p>
              <p>Shi’an, many thanks for all the enlightening Dharma sharing and 
              discussions!… The sessions have been helpful for me to ponder and see 
              life in a different light. Will help you spread the word for the 
              upcoming run! <strong>- Han Yang  </strong></p>
              <p>Thank you again for the very interesting class!… The course content 
              is easy to relate to as the teacher supplements it with the usage of 
              movies and everyday examples. Open discussion of topics related to the 
              course content is also encouraged, thus making the learning process more
               meaningful. Overall, the course has been an enriching experience. 
              Amituofo, <strong>Ling</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Bro Shi An, I one of your students who are currently attending 
              your Project Rebirth. I’m really enjoying it… Thanks… Sincerely, I’m 
              looking forward to your next advanced course. Please keep me in the 
              loop… – <strong>Ivan</strong></p>
              <p>I have been interested in Buddhism since I was young but I am 
              embarrassed to say I have never practiced it diligently. Nor have I 
              joined any Buddhist group, though I have always endeavoured to try and 
              keep to the teachings of Buddhism. I joined Project Rebirth so as to 
              receive a formal and proper introduction to the basic teachings of 
              Buddhism, and I must say I have achieved a better and more accurate 
              understanding of Buddhism after the course. <strong> - Leo</strong></p>
              <p>Though I started attending Project rebirth from the 5th lesson, there
               was still much Dharma for my learning, and I enjoyed every lesson 
              attended. I did hestiate to attend Project rebirth because of the 
              location, but am glad I gave myself a chance to learn. And thanks to you
               for sharing the Dharma. <strong>- Abrie</strong></p>
              <p>I want to thank you for conducting this course. I’ve been reading 
              Buddhism materials (although not diligently) since year 2004 and 
              couldn’t understand most of its teachings… Having a busy lifestyle 
              coupled with commitments and responsibilities, I find it really helpful 
              to attend Buddhism classes like this as it helps me to put aside time to
               listen and learn about Buddhahood. <strong>- Caryn</strong></p>
              <p>I am grateful for the opportunity to learn Dharma from you. I walked 
              into the class on day 1 with very little knowledge of Buddha and Dharma;
               as I mostly do self-reading. Now, I walk out with my mind and heart 
              filling with the Buddha and Dharma.  Now, it is up to me to put Dharma 
              into daily practice… I truly benefited a lot from your sessions and hope
               that many others like me will start this journey with you soon. Till we
               meet again, take care! Amituofo, <strong>YT</strong></p>
