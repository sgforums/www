What is the 'stream' that the stream enterer enters? The Buddha explained that the stream is the noble eightfold path, so basically such a person, having attained realization of the right view - which is the forerunner of the noble eightfold path, has entered the path which invariably leads to Nirvana.<br><br><span>A

              <p>1. No brahmas are eternal. No gods are eternal. They experience the suffering of death and then they cycle in the six realms again based on their karmas.

Those aggregates are empty of a self/Self. The so called 'nothingness' is just a subtler form of consciousness that is ultimately empty of Self. If one identifies with that, and attaches to that, then one is likely to become reborn in the formless realm of infinite space or nothingness where one stays there for many aeons until one's wholesome karma is exhausted, then one falls into the lower realms including hells, and one has to work up from there again.<br><br>Nirvana just means the cessation of passion, aggression and delusion, including all sense of self or Self.<br><br><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html</a><br><br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In the seen, there is only the seen,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the heard, there is only the heard,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the sensed, there is only the sensed,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the cognized, there is only the cognized.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Thus you should see that</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">indeed there is no thing here;</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">this, Bahiya, is how you should train yourself.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Since, Bahiya, there is for you</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the seen, only the seen,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the heard, only the heard,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the sensed, only the sensed,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the cognized, only the cognized,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">and you see that there is no thing here,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">you will therefore see that</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">indeed there is no thing there.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As you see that there is no thing there,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">you will see that</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">you are therefore located neither in the world of this,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">nor in the world of that,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">nor in any place</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">betwixt the two.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This alone is the end of suffering.” (ud. 1.10)</span></p>

              <p><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>Regarding 'True Self', I wrote this last year:</span><br><br><span>...the
               original teachings of the Buddha leads to the complete relinquishment 
              of all self/Self. In my experience this is the case. For me, the sense 
              of a Soul or transcendental identity/Self has been terminated for good 
              and no longer arise at all for years. I have been through the stage 
              where there is identification with the transpersonal Self/I AM, and then
               such identification is put to an end with further insights into anatta.</span><br><br><span> This is why Buddhadharma is radical.</span><br><br><span> As Loppon Namdrol/Malcolm Smith wrote before:</span><br><br><span> "What you are suggesting is already found in Samkhya system. I.e. 
              the twenty four tattvas are not the self aka purusha. Since this system 
              was well known to the Buddha, if that's all his insight was, then his 
              insight is pretty trivial. But Buddha's teachings were novel. Why where 
              they novel? They were novel in the fifth century BCE because of his 
              teaching of dependent origination and emptiness. The refutation of an 
              ultimate self is just collateral damage."</span><br><br><span> And as Thusness wrote to me in 2005 way before we knew anything about AF's Richard Parker (late 2009):</span><br><br><span> The Pristine awareness is often mistaken as the 'Self'. It is especially</span><br><span> difficult for one that has intuitively experience the 'Self' to accept</span><br><span> 'No-Self'. As I have told you many times that there will come a time when u</span><br><span> will intuitively perceive the 'I' -- the pure sense of Existence but you</span><br><span> must be strong enough to go beyond this experience until the true meaning of</span><br><span> Emptiness becomes clear and thorough. The Pristine Awareness is the</span><br><span> so-called True-Self' but why we do not call it a 'Self' and why Buddhism has</span><br><span> placed so much emphasis on the Emptiness nature? This then is the true</span><br><span> essence of Buddhism. It is needless to stress anything about 'Self' in</span><br><span> Buddhism; there are enough of 'Logies' of the 'I" in Indian Philosophies.</span><br><span> If one wants to know about the experience of 'I AM', go for the Vedas and</span><br><span> Bhagavat Gita. We will not know what Buddha truly taught 2500 years ago if</span><br><span> we buried ourselves in words. Have no doubt that The Dharma Seal is</span><br><span> authentic and not to be confused.</span><br><br><span> When you have experienced the 'Self' and know that its nature is empty, you</span><br><span> will know why to include this idea of a 'Self' into Buddha-Nature is truly</span><br><span> unnecessary and meaningless. True Buddhism is not about eliminating the</span><br><span> 'small Self' but cleansing this so called 'True Self' (Atman) with the</span><br><span> wisdom of Emptiness.</span><br><br><span>And it is not just I or Thusness or Malcolm who is saying so - Buddha himself is saying so.</span><br><br><span> Taken from accesstoinsight:</span><br><br><span> "Cula-sihanada Sutta (MN 11) -- The Shorter Discourse on the Lion's 
              Roar {M i 63} [Ñanamoli Thera and Bhikkhu Bodhi, trans.] - </span><a dir="ltr" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.011.ntbb.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.011.ntbb.html</a><span> , the Buddha declares that only through practicing in accord with the 
              Dhamma can Awakening be realized. His teaching is distinguished from 
              those of other religions and philosophies through its unique rejection 
              of all doctrines of self. [BB]"</span><br><br><span>...Hi [name redacted],</span><br><br><span> Buddha did not reject only one view of self/Self but 84 kinds of 
              views about Self - including the view that Self is the unchanging 
              Consciousness or soul that survives after death in the BrahmajÄ�la Sutta.
               Also in the Mulapariyaya Sutta/MN 1, the Buddha was speaking to a group
               of ex-Samkhya followers who became converted and became his monks. Even
               though they have converted, they still held the belief in the Purusha 
              (pure consciousness/awareness) as changeless Self or Soul, and they 
              believed in a "root" or Source: an abstract principle out of which all 
              things emanated and which was immanent in all things.</span><br><br><span> Because the Buddha knew the monks still held onto this 
              belief/view/position, he began the discourse with "I will teach you the 
              sequence of the root of all phenomena". He described a whole range of 
              phenomena that can be experienced, including subtle states accessible in
               meditation like the "infinite consciousness", "infinite space", 
              "nothingness" and so on. In each of these experiences, he declared that 
              they are not to be established as Self, not to be viewed as a Source out
               of which things emerges from. Even Nirvana/unbiding (the termination of
               all passions, aggression and delusion), he declared, is not to be 
              established in terms of a Self or to be viewed as a Source.</span><br><br><span> Interestingly, this is the ONLY teaching the Buddha taught that at 
              the end of the discourse, the monks were unhappy and dissatisfied. 
              ("Displeased, the monks did not delight in the Blessed One's words.") As
               obviously the monks wanted the Buddha to affirm their 
              belief/view/position/experience instead of rejecting or refuting it.</span><br><br><span> Fortunately, by paying heed to the Buddha's teachings, the monks 
              practiced and eventually overcome all false views and conceits of "I Am"
               and attained complete Nirvana.</span><br><br><span> By "cleansing True Self", Thusness means one's experience of 
              consciousness is cleansed of ALL traces of self/Self including any form 
              of identifying with a "True Self". As Thusness stated back in February 
              2006, "The different between hinduism and buddhism is they return to the
               "I AM" and clings to it. But in buddhism it is being replaced by 
              "emptiness nature", (the sense that) there is a purest, an entity, a 
              stage to be gained or achieved is an illusion. There is none. No self to
               be found. No identity to assumed. Nothing attained. So for a teaching 
              that is so thorough and complete, why must it resort back to a "True 
              Self"? For one that has experienced in full emptiness nature, does 
              he/she need to create an extra "True Self"?"</span><br><br><span> "In light of emptiness nature, "True Self" is not necessary. The so 
              called "purest" is already understood, there is no clinging. There is 
              hearing, no hearer...etc (This) is already beyond "True Self". Yet it 
              exactly knows the stage of "True Self". If there is no hearing...then 
              something is wrong. There is hearing but no hearer. Put your time into 
              practice and understanding of no-self and emptiness. "</span><br><br><span> The wisdom of "no-self" or "emptiness" is the realization that there
               is no actual self/Self/soul/any kind of substantiality. This 
              realization releases all delusions and bondage. Otherwise, one can have 
              PCEs but the delusion of identity can persist. This is why I posted the 
              "No mind and anatta" thread.</span><br><br><span> Sensate experience is immediately direct gapless without identity or
               reifications, in the direct actualization there is naturally no 
              concepts, no emotions, no separation, stillness, without a sense of 
              vantage point/center to measure movement, etc.<br></span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I used to think that we have a soul and the ultimate purpose in life is to make this soul free of it"s coverings, karma and it's attributes. Then it will dissolve in the universe/ brahman and everything is finished.</span></p>
              <p>In Buddhism as I learned even this soul is an aggregate. Like a flame which is created by combination of spark and a combustible material. Something lighted a flame and when the self understands it's not real,but an aggregate of various things giving the illusion of self, then it's Nirvana. That is by the example fire is extinguished and it becomes nothing.</p>

              <p>Why in Hindusim they speak of soul so much?And freeing it from the coverings of hate,passion etc is the purpose of human life as they call it?</p>

              <p>No, you still don't seem to get it. It is <strong>not </strong>that soul is the three poisons. It is that there is <strong>no soul </strong>to begin with.<br><br>This means when anger arise, there is no self behind or within anger, there is only anger. When passion arise, there is no self behind or within anger, there is only anger. When there is delusion, there is no self behind or within delusion, there is only delusion. There is in seeing always only sight/scenery/colours that is vividly seen, but no seer. In hearing just sound, no hearer.<br><br>Venerable Buddhaghosa states quite clearly:<br></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"Mere suffering is, not any sufferer is found</p>
              <p>The deeds exist, but no performer of the deeds:</p>
              <p>Nibbana is, but not the man that enters it,</p>
              <p>The path is, but no wanderer is to be seen."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Nirvana is the cessation of the three poisons, Nirvana is the cessation of afflictions, of suffering, Nirvana is the cessation of the delusional sense of self, but Nirvana is *not* the cessation of a soul. Why? There simply isn't any actual 'soul' to begin with, it is as fictitious as santa claus or rabbits with horns. It is merely a delusional imputation. This delusional imputation is the cause of rebirth and suffering.<br><br>So, there is the delusional sense of self, but that is merely a thought-constructed apparent reality, which is fundamentally a fiction. But there never was any actual self to begin with.<br><br>Actually to say 'the soul doesn't exist' wouldn't be accurate - because non-existence would require a predicate, an entity, an existent in the first place which could then be asserted to become non-existent. As the Buddha pointed out, if a 'Tathagata' or 'Soul' or 'Self' cannot be pinned down as a reality, an entity, either within nor apart from the five aggregates to begin with, how can you speak of its existence, or non-existence, or both existence and non-existence, or neither existence nor non-existence? These four extremes (a.k.a tetralemma) are automatically refuted when one realizes no-self or emptiness. Also it cannot be that 'self' ceases to exist or becomes non-existent if it cannot be established to begin with.<br><br>To get a better sense of this you may also want to read this article I wrote before: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/eternalism-nihilism-and-middle-way.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/eternalism-nihilism-and-middle-way.html</a><br><br><br><br>The reason why the Hindus speak of the Atman-Brahman so much is because they directly realized what the Buddha calls the luminous mind (phabhassara citta). The luminous aspect of mind is simply pure cognizance, pure presence, pure awareness, however this aspect of mind is almost always mistaken to be a true eternal Self without insight into anatta and emptiness.<br><br>For example, Stage 1 to 4 of are different gradations of the Atman-Brahman realization (<a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a>). Only at Stage 5 is anatta being realized, and not only is the sense of individual self released (this happens even before stage 5) but also the delusion of an ultimate, inherently existing Self (with capital S) or pure subjectivity or metaphysical Essence.<br><br>Other than me and Thusness, many others have gone through the same phases of insights.<br><br>For example, Zen teacher/priest Alex Weith wrote:<br><br><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/zen-exploration-of-bahiya-sutta.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/zen-exploration-of-bahiya-sutta.html</a><br><span id="textNode_40942143" class="threadText"><br> This also means that  the first step is to disembed from impermanent 
              phenomena until the only  thing that feels real is this all pervading 
              uncreated all pervading  awareness that feels like the source and 
              substance of phenomena. Holding  on to it after this realization can 
              hower become a subtle form of  grasping diguised as letting go.<br> <br> The second step is therefore to  realize that this brightness, awakeness
               or luminosity is there very  nature of phenomena and then only does the
               duality between the True Self  and the appearences arising and passing 
              within the Self dissolve,  revealing the suchness of what is.<br> <br> The next step that I found  very practical is to push the process of 
              deconstruction a step further,  realizing that all that is experienced 
              is one of the six consciousness.  In other words, there is neither a 
              super Awareness beyond phenomena, not  solid material objects, but only 
              six streams of sensory experiences.  The seen, the heard, the sensed, 
              the tasted, the smelled and the  cognized (including thoughts, emotions,
               and subtle thougths like  absorbtion states, jhanas).<br> <br> At this point it is not difficult to see how relevent the Bahiya Sutta can become.</span><br> <br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_41099474" class="threadText"><br> Just for the sake of  clarification, I would like to make it clear that I
               never said that  "these luminous self-perceiving phenomena which are 
              craving-free and  nondual are the Ultimate", if there could still be any
               ambiguity about  that.<br> <br> On the contrary, I said that what I used to take for an  eternal, empty,
               uncreated, nondual, primordial awareness, source and  substance of all 
              things, turned out to be nothing more than the luminous  nature of 
              phenomena, themselves empty and ungraspable, somehow  crystallized in a 
              very subtle witnessing position. The whole topic of  this thread is the 
              deconstruction of this Primordial Awareness, One  Mind, Cognizing 
              Emptiness, Self, Atman, Luminous Mind, Tathagatgabha, or  whatever we 
              may call it,<br> <br> As shocking as it may seem, the Buddha  was very clear to say that this 
              pure impersonal objectless nondual  awareness (that Vedantists called 
              Atma in Sanskrit, Atta in Pali) is  still the aggregate of consciousness
               and that consciousness, as pure and  luminous as it can be, does not 
              stand beyond the aggregates.<br> <br> "Any kind of consciousness whatever, whether past, future or  presently 
              arisen, whether gross or subtle, whether in oneself or  external, 
              whether inferior or superior, whether far or near must, with  right 
              understanding how it is, be regarded thus: 'This is not mine, this  is 
              not I, this is not my self.'" (Anatta-lakkhana Sutta).</span><span id="textNode_40976585" class="threadText"><br> </span><br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <span id="textNode_41099752" class="threadText"><br> What I realized also  is that authoritative self-realized students of 
              direct students of both  Ramana Maharishi and Nisargadatta Maharaj 
              called me a 'Jnani', inviting  me to give satsangs and write books, 
              while I had not yet understood the  simplest core principles of 
              Buddhism. I realized also that the vast  majority of Buddhist teachers, 
              East and West, never went beyond the same  initial insights (that 
              Adhyashanti calls "an abiding awakening"),  confusing the Atma with the 
              ego, assuming that transcending the ego or  self-center (ahamkara in 
              Sanskrit) was identical to what the Buddha had  called Anatta 
              (Non-Atma).<br> <br> It would seem therefore that the Buddha  had realized the Self at a 
              certain stage of his acetic years (it is not  that difficult after all) 
              and was not yet satisfied. As paradoxical as  it may seem, his "divide 
              and conquer strategy" aimed at a systematic  deconstruction of the Self 
              (Atma, Atta), reduced to -and divided into-  what he then called the 
              five aggregates of clinging and the six  sense-spheres, does lead to 
              further and deeper insights into the nature  of reality. As far as I can
               tell, this makes me a Buddhist, not because I  find Buddhism cool and 
              trendy, but because I am unable to find other  teachings and traditions 
              that provide a complete set of tools and  strategies aimed at unlocking 
              these ultimate mysteries, even if mystics  from various traditions did 
              stumble on the same stages and insights  often unknowingly.</span><span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText"> </span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br><br><br>Also Joel Agee wrote:<br><br><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/joel-agee-appearances-are-self.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/joel-agee-appearances-are-self.html</a><br><br><br> Joel Agee I will try to describe what it is that rings true for me in 
              Thusness’s words. I don’t have a theoretical preference for the early 
              Buddhist teachings over the later ones, including Dzogchen. In fact I 
              know very little about the Pali Canon. My approach isn’t conceptual or 
              theoretical at all. I look directly into the nature of my own 
              consciousness in silent, objectless sitting meditation – shikantaza if 
              you will. Whatever doesn’t meet the test of direct experience holds no 
              lasting interest for me.<br> <br> Until fairly recently, the metaphor of the mirror and its reflections 
              seemed a fitting image of my contemplative experience: that there is an 
              unchanging, ever-present, imperturbable awareness that is the absolute 
              ground and the very substance of phenomena, and that while this 
              motionless, contentless awareness-presence is inseparable from the 
              ceaseless coming and going of appearances, it also transcends everything
               that shows up, remaining untouched, unstained, absolute and 
              indestructible.<br> <br> A couple of years ago I discovered Soh Wei Yu’s blog, Awakening to 
              Reality, and in it Wei Yu’s account of his exploration of the Bahiya 
              Sutta and the Zen Priest Alex Weith’s report on his realization of 
              Anatta through practical application of the Bahiya Sutta. I saw then 
              that Anatta was not fully realized in my experience. The illusory nature
               of a separate unchanging personal self had been seen through, but an 
              unconscious identification with “Awareness” or “rigpa” had taken its 
              place.<br> <br> Since then, an unstoppable deconstruction of that impersonal background 
              identity has been happening in my contemplation and in my daily life. 
              There is still a noticeable attachment to the memory of that subtle Home
               Base. It shows up as a tendency to "lean back" from the unpredictable 
              brilliance and dynamism of the moment into a static, subtly blissful 
              background presence. But there is no longer a belief in an Awareness 
              that is anything other than, or greater than, or deeper than, THIS 
              sound, THIS smile or stirring of emotion, THIS glance of light. There is
               no Mirror that is not the reflections.<br> <br> So the shift in my experience and practice is not a preference for one 
              teaching over another. It’s an ongoing realization that direct contact 
              with the grain and texture of moment-by-moment experience is what Dogen 
              meant by “being awakened by the ten thousand things.”<br> January 2 at 3:20am · Unlike · 6</p>

              <p>No, you still don't seem to get it. It is <strong>not</strong> that soul is the three poisons. It is that there is <strong>no
                  soul</strong> to begin with.<br> <br> This means when anger arise, there is no self behind or within
                  anger, there is only anger. When passion arise, there is no self
                  behind or within anger, there is only anger. When there is
                  delusion, there is no self behind or within delusion, there is only
                  delusion. There is in seeing always only sight/scenery/colours that
                  is vividly seen, but no seer. In hearing just sound, no
                  hearer.<br> <br> Venerable Buddhaghosa states quite clearly:</p>
              <p>Nirvana is the cessation of the three poisons, Nirvana is the
                  cessation of afflictions, of suffering, Nirvana is the cessation of
                  the delusional sense of self, but Nirvana is *not* the cessation of
                  a soul. Why? There simply isn't any actual 'soul' to begin with, it
                  is as fictitious as santa claus or rabbits with horns. It is merely
                  a delusional imputation. This delusional imputation is the cause of
                  rebirth and suffering.<br> <br> So, there is the delusional sense of self, but that is merely a
                  thought-constructed apparent reality, which is fundamentally a
                  fiction. But there never was any actual self to begin with.<br> <br> Actually to say 'the soul doesn't exist' wouldn't be accurate -
                  because non-existence would require a predicate, an entity, an
                  existent in the first place which could then be asserted to become
                  non-existent. As the Buddha pointed out, if a 'Tathagata' or 'Soul'
                  or 'Self' cannot be pinned down as a reality, an entity, either
                  within nor apart from the five aggregates to begin with, how can
                  you speak of its existence, or non-existence, or both existence and
                  non-existence, or neither existence nor non-existence? These four
                  extremes (a.k.a tetralemma) are automatically refuted when one
                  realizes no-self or emptiness. Also it cannot be that 'self' ceases
                  to exist or becomes non-existent if it cannot be established to
                  begin with.<br> <br> To get a better sense of this you may also want to read this
                  article I wrote before: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/eternalism-nihilism-and-middle-way.html"> http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/eternalism-nihilism-and-middle-way.html</a><br> <br> <br> <br> The reason why the Hindus speak of the Atman-Brahman so much is
                  because they directly realized what the Buddha calls the luminous
                  mind (phabhassara citta). The luminous aspect of mind is simply
                  pure cognizance, pure presence, pure awareness, however this aspect
                  of mind is almost always mistaken to be a true eternal Self without
                  insight into anatta and emptiness.<br> <br> For example, Stage 1 to 4 of are different gradations of the
                  Atman-Brahman realization (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's
                  Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a>). Only at Stage 5 is anatta being
                  realized, and not only is the sense of individual self released
                  (this happens even before stage 5) but also the delusion of an
                  ultimate, inherently existing Self (with capital S) or pure
                  subjectivity or metaphysical Essence.<br> <br> Other than me and Thusness, many others have gone through the same
                  phases of insights.<br> <br> For example, Zen teacher/priest Alex Weith wrote:<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/zen-exploration-of-bahiya-sutta.html"> http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/zen-exploration-of-bahiya-sutta.html</a><br> <span><br> This also means that the first step is to disembed from impermanent
                  phenomena until the only thing that feels real is this all
                  pervading uncreated all pervading awareness that feels like the
                  source and substance of phenomena. Holding on to it after this
                  realization can hower become a subtle form of grasping diguised as
                  letting go.<br> <br> The second step is therefore to realize that this brightness,
                  awakeness or luminosity is there very nature of phenomena and then
                  only does the duality between the True Self and the appearences
                  arising and passing within the Self dissolve, revealing the
                  suchness of what is.<br> <br> The next step that I found very practical is to push the process of
                  deconstruction a step further, realizing that all that is
                  experienced is one of the six consciousness. In other words, there
                  is neither a super Awareness beyond phenomena, not solid material
                  objects, but only six streams of sensory experiences. The seen, the
                  heard, the sensed, the tasted, the smelled and the cognized
                  (including thoughts, emotions, and subtle thougths like absorbtion
                  states, jhanas).<br> <br> At this point it is not difficult to see how relevent the Bahiya
                  Sutta can become.</span><br> <br> <br> <span>.............</span><br> <br> <span><br> Just for the sake of clarification, I would like to make it clear
                  that I never said that "these luminous self-perceiving phenomena
                  which are craving-free and nondual are the Ultimate", if there
                  could still be any ambiguity about that.<br> <br> On the contrary, I said that what I used to take for an eternal,
                  empty, uncreated, nondual, primordial awareness, source and
                  substance of all things, turned out to be nothing more than the
                  luminous nature of phenomena, themselves empty and ungraspable,
                  somehow crystallized in a very subtle witnessing position. The
                  whole topic of this thread is the deconstruction of this Primordial
                  Awareness, One Mind, Cognizing Emptiness, Self, Atman, Luminous
                  Mind, Tathagatgabha, or whatever we may call it,<br> <br> As shocking as it may seem, the Buddha was very clear to say that
                  this pure impersonal objectless nondual awareness (that Vedantists
                  called Atma in Sanskrit, Atta in Pali) is still the aggregate of
                  consciousness and that consciousness, as pure and luminous as it
                  can be, does not stand beyond the aggregates.<br> <br> "Any kind of consciousness whatever, whether past, future or
                  presently arisen, whether gross or subtle, whether in oneself or
                  external, whether inferior or superior, whether far or near must,
                  with right understanding how it is, be regarded thus: 'This is not
                  mine, this is not I, this is not my self.'" (Anatta-lakkhana
                  Sutta).</span><span><br></span><br> <span>.............</span><br> <span><br> What I realized also is that authoritative self-realized students
                  of direct students of both Ramana Maharishi and Nisargadatta
                  Maharaj called me a 'Jnani', inviting me to give satsangs and write
                  books, while I had not yet understood the simplest core principles
                  of Buddhism. I realized also that the vast majority of Buddhist
                  teachers, East and West, never went beyond the same initial
                  insights (that Adhyashanti calls "an abiding awakening"), confusing
                  the Atma with the ego, assuming that transcending the ego or
                  self-center (ahamkara in Sanskrit) was identical to what the Buddha
                  had called Anatta (Non-Atma).<br> <br> It would seem therefore that the Buddha had realized the Self at a
                  certain stage of his acetic years (it is not that difficult after
                  all) and was not yet satisfied. As paradoxical as it may seem, his
                  "divide and conquer strategy" aimed at a systematic deconstruction
                  of the Self (Atma, Atta), reduced to -and divided into- what he
                  then called the five aggregates of clinging and the six
                  sense-spheres, does lead to further and deeper insights into the
                  nature of reality. As far as I can tell, this makes me a Buddhist,
                  not because I find Buddhism cool and trendy, but because I am
                  unable to find other teachings and traditions that provide a
                  complete set of tools and strategies aimed at unlocking these
                  ultimate mysteries, even if mystics from various traditions did
                  stumble on the same stages and insights often
                  unknowingly.</span><br> <br> <span>.............</span><br> <br> <br> Also Joel Agee wrote:<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/joel-agee-appearances-are-self.html"> http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/joel-agee-appearances-are-self.html</a><br> <br> <br> Joel Agee I will try to describe what it is that rings true for me
                  in Thusness’s words. I don’t have a theoretical preference for the
                  early Buddhist teachings over the later ones, including Dzogchen.
                  In fact I know very little about the Pali Canon. My approach isn’t
                  conceptual or theoretical at all. I look directly into the nature
                  of my own consciousness in silent, objectless sitting meditation –
                  shikantaza if you will. Whatever doesn’t meet the test of direct
                  experience holds no lasting interest for me.<br> <br> Until fairly recently, the metaphor of the mirror and its
                  reflections seemed a fitting image of my contemplative experience:
                  that there is an unchanging, ever-present, imperturbable awareness
                  that is the absolute ground and the very substance of phenomena,
                  and that while this motionless, contentless awareness-presence is
                  inseparable from the ceaseless coming and going of appearances, it
                  also transcends everything that shows up, remaining untouched,
                  unstained, absolute and indestructible.<br> <br> A couple of years ago I discovered Soh Wei Yu’s blog, Awakening to
                  Reality, and in it Wei Yu’s account of his exploration of the
                  Bahiya Sutta and the Zen Priest Alex Weith’s report on his
                  realization of Anatta through practical application of the Bahiya
                  Sutta. I saw then that Anatta was not fully realized in my
                  experience. The illusory nature of a separate unchanging personal
                  self had been seen through, but an unconscious identification with
                  “Awareness” or “rigpa” had taken its place.<br> <br> Since then, an unstoppable deconstruction of that impersonal
                  background identity has been happening in my contemplation and in
                  my daily life. There is still a noticeable attachment to the memory
                  of that subtle Home Base. It shows up as a tendency to "lean back"
                  from the unpredictable brilliance and dynamism of the moment into a
                  static, subtly blissful background presence. But there is no longer
                  a belief in an Awareness that is anything other than, or greater
                  than, or deeper than, THIS sound, THIS smile or stirring of
                  emotion, THIS glance of light. There is no Mirror that is not the
                  reflections.<br> <br> So the shift in my experience and practice is not a preference for
                  one teaching over another. It’s an ongoing realization that direct
                  contact with the grain and texture of moment-by-moment experience
                  is what Dogen meant by “being awakened by the ten thousand
                  things.”<br> January 2 at 3:20am · Unlike · 6</p>

              <p>Thanks for the detailed info.WIll definitely take some time to really understand this.</p>
              <p>In Hinduism so they reached 'an abiding awakening' as you mentioned and then they believed this was the final stage,dissolution in Brahman?. Buddha too achieved this but went forward to 'systematic desconstruction of self' and found soul too isn't real. I had read the blog with 7 stages and I understood HIndusim doesn't go that far.I am not an expert in that religion as well,unfortunately.</p>
              <p>As I understood the Hindu final goal or merger with Brahman,I was thinking why should this be the end?Why should Brahman make souls which must transmigrate and come back to it finally?Is there soemthing beyond,but I couldn't find anything beyond this till I Came across Buddhism.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Karma means actions. Mental, verbal, bodily actions. These actions will ripen in results in present and future lifetimes.  Wholesome actions result in fortunate births, unwholesome actions result in unfortunate births, while practicing noble eightfold path leads to the end of rebirth in samsara - which is nirvana.<br><br>We can also think about karma as traces and imprints. When you watch a movie, or play a video game, you may notice that images have a tendency to manifest in your mind for some time. Our ignorance, tendency to grasp at self and things, karmic imprints, are deep conditionings that continue from moment to moment, but there is absolutely no such thing as a 'soul' that 'contains' them. It is just a momentary stream of afflictions/delusions/conditioning that manifest moment by moment.<br><br>The key to liberation is to practice the noble eightfold path. Are you familiar with the noble eightfold path? If not, please read all these carefully: <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html</a><br><br>As Thusness said before: "If we were to practice mindfulness from start and learn to experience things in bare. We develop this intuitive mode of directly experiencing things as they are. Together with firm understanding of the basic teaching of Buddha, we will be able to break this habitual energy of seeing things in a dualistic mode. Buddha never taught about ‘who’ instead he made Anatta a Dharma Seal; nothing about inherent existence, instead impermanence and oneness. Never about first cause but about Dependent Origination that will eventually lead us into seeing things as unborn, no coming and going. He taught mindfulness as the preferred way of meditation and said that it will lead us into enlightenment. All these can be experienced right here and now. We should take it seriously. It will eliminate a lot of unnecessary sufferings. ""<br><br>Once liberated, past karma will still manifest in that lifetime, but no longer manifests after death because one is freed from samsaric rebirth - i.e. there is no more fuel or conditions for further birth, as birth arise only when there is grasping and becoming - the 'I am' conceit is there. You do not have to 'work out the past karmas' - those karmic causes just do not have the conditions to manifest anymore. Think of it like a seed, a seed needs water and nutrients to grow into a fruit, but it does not grow if there is no more conditions for it to grow.<br><br><br>p.s. I did not start with practicing Buddhadharma, I started with self-inquiry and Awareness practice then gradually when there is direct realization of Awareness, I looked into non-dual, anatta and emptiness. It depends on which path you would like to take. My path is explained in my e-journal: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html</a></p></div>

              <p>Arahants overcome afflictive obscurations thus putting an end to the samsaric cycle of rebirth, Buddhas overcome two obscurations (afflictive and cognitive) thereby obtaining omniscience.</p>
              <p>In addition to the overcoming of afflictive obscurations, one must also overcome the knowledge obscurations. This means complete actualization of one's realization of twofold emptiness*. Furthermore to attain Buddhahood one has to have perfected all the six/ten paramitas/perfections (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81ramit%C4%81">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81ramit%C4%81</a>).<br><br>*Buddhist glossary:</p>
              <blockquote>Two emptinesses (äºŒç©º) include (1) emptiness of self, the 
                              Ä�tman, the soul, in a person composed of the five aggregates, constantly
                               changing with causes and conditions; and (2) emptiness of selves in all
                               dharmas—each of the five aggregates, each of the twelve fields, and 
                              each of the eighteen spheres, as well as everything else with no 
                              independent existence. No-self in any dharma implies no-self in a 
                              person, but the latter is separated out in the first category. 
                              Realization of the emptiness of self in a person will lead to attainment
                               of Arhatship or Pratyekabuddhahood. Bodhisattvas who have realized both
                               emptinesses ascend to the First Ground on their Way to Buddhahood.</blockquote>

              will necessarily possess the quality of omniscience. The historical Buddha
              pointed to the fact that his knowledge is vast, Sutta SN56.31, and that he
              possesses the three knowledge, Sutta MN71, but certainly do no claim that he is
              omniscience. See Sutta MN71, MN90. Here, if one strictly takes the meaning of omniscience
              as possessing infinite knowledge or understanding. There are also suttas such
              as MN67 that shows he is not omniscience.</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 130%;   color: #111111; " lang="EN"></span></p>

What he rejected was 'omnipotence' - that there could be a kind of knowing of everything in the universe simultaneously. Now, both Theravada and Mahayana <strong>do not </strong>accept that anyone including Buddha has omnipotence, because the Buddha has categorically rejected them. However, the traditions maintain that the Buddha is able to know whatever he intends to know, and to that end, all states, realm, phenomena are knowable to the Buddha who is omniscient.</p></div>
