              <p>This topic is probably more appropriate for western materialists. I think Asians accept rebirth easier. But just sharing.<br><br>..................<br><br>sign again:</p>
              <blockquote> Nowadays Buddhist-inspired meditation and mindfulness seems to be 
                          accepted by non-Buddhists, after stripping out the 'religious' parts. 
                          It's good that it helps people in their lives. But it's like there's 
                          also a trend for atheistic/secular Buddhism where people follow the 
                          philosophy, but don't subscribe to the beliefs in karma and rebirth and 
                          other 'religious' parts. Some people like to say Buddhism is philosophy 
                          by the historical Buddha and it is people who made it into a religion.<br> <br> What's your take on it? </blockquote>
              <p><br><br> This is a good question.<br> <br> Those who strip out rebirth and karma are stripping out the basis for 
                          practicing for liberation. That is, they only experience the meagre 
                          benefits of calm abiding in their meditation, but they will never 
                          experience the benefits that the wisdom of dharma has to offer which 
                          leads towards the liberation from afflictions (passion, aggression and 
                          delusion) - the causes of samsara and rebirth. All they want will be 
                          some inner peace, but they will never get to the true import and goal of
                           Buddhadharma which is Nirvana. <br> <br> Since all they have is one life (a.k.a. 'YOLO'), there is no need to 
                          care about future life at all, other than to just enjoy one's life in a 
                          hedonistic way. Meditation is merely just a means for them to experience
                           some relaxation.<br> <br> When my spiritual mentor, lets just call him X because he likes anonymity, recalled numberless past lives and 
                          faces in his meditation samadhi one day long long time ago, he got sick 
                          of it and realized the necessity to be liberated. He also got the sense 
                          that this life is really not very important at all (other than to 
                          practice, that is), what used to be very important turns out to be quite meaningless. <br> <br> Got another time long long time ago, King Yama (lord of the death, a.k.a
                           é˜Žç½—çŽ‹) and another spirit were speaking to each other when he was 
                          meditating - and both of them were saying that he has not overcome 
                          death. He did not even know who 'yama' was at that time, but he heard a 
                          voice addressing Yama and Yama said oh, so that was the one who has not 
                          yet overcome death. When he came out of meditation he went to find out 
                          what 'yama' is. Why did yama appear in his meditation? I do not know, 
                          maybe to serve as a reminder. He was already quite experienced and had 
                          certain realization at that time, but it is always good to remind 
                          ourselves that the path is long ahead and not get carried away. <br> <br> If we are real practitioners of Buddhadharma who accept rebirth and 
                          karma, we must not kid ourselves, death is our real test. Until we have 
                          perfected our practice and attained complete liberation, we must never 
                          be satisfied with some results in practice, we must never satisfied with
                           our realization, much less what those atheist get out of meditation 
                          (some minor relaxation or peace, which is meagre). On the other hand if 
                          there is no rebirth, then everyone will achieve 'Nirvana' at death 
                          without practice so one can just relax and take things easy and just 
                          enjoy life as it is, therefore such a view is fundamentally at odds with
                           the Buddhadharma and is totally not appropriate for real practitioners.
                           Thinking about death and rebirth everyday will instill a sense of 
                          urgency and necessity for practice which will never come if we reject 
                          rebirth.<br> <br> X also said in 2006:<br> <br> "Life is like a passing cloud, when it comes to an end, a hundred years 
                          is like yesterday, like a snap of a finger. If it is only about one 
                          life, it really doesnt matter whether we are enlightened. The insight 
                          that the Blessed One has is not just about one life; countless lives we 
                          suffered, life after life, unending. Such is suffering.<br> <br> It is not about logic or science and there is really no point arguing in
                           this scientific age. Take steps in practice and experience the truth of
                           Buddhas words. Of the 3 dharma seals, the truth of suffering to me is 
                          most difficult to experience in depth.<br> <br> May all take Buddhas words seriously."<br><br><br><img src="http://academic.reed.edu/hellscrolls/scrolls/aseries/a05/A05images/Yama2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427"><br><br>(King Yama)</p>

              <p>Those that hold the wrong view that 
              there is no rebirth, are opponents to the arahants who have recalled 
              their past lives and declared the existence of rebirth. Holders of wrong
               view cannot be expected to attain the goal, since right view is the 
              forerunner of the noble eightfold path which leads to Nirvana.<br> <br> Buddha:<br> <br> "Because there actually is the next world, the view of one who thinks, 
              'There is no next world' is his wrong view. Because there actually is 
              the next world, when he is resolved that 'There is no next world,' that 
              is his wrong resolve. Because there actually is the next world, when he 
              speaks the statement, 'There is no next world,' that is his wrong 
              speech. Because there actually is the next world, when he is says that 
              'There is no next world,' he makes himself an opponent to those arahants
               who know the next world. Because there actually is the next world, when
               he persuades another that 'There is no next world,' that is persuasion 
              in what is not true Dhamma. And in that persuasion in what is not true 
              Dhamma, he exalts himself and disparages others. Whatever good 
              habituation he previously had is abandoned, while bad habituation is 
              manifested. And this wrong view, wrong resolve, wrong speech, opposition
               to the arahants, persuasion in what is not true Dhamma, exaltation of 
              self, &amp; disparagement of others: These many evil, unskillful

              who strip out rebirth and karma are stripping out the basis for practicing for
              liberation. That is, they only experience the meagre benefits of calm abiding
              in their meditation, but they will never experience the benefits that the
              wisdom of dharma has to offer which leads towards the liberation from
              afflictions (passion, aggression and delusion) - the causes of samsara and
              rebirth. All they want will be some inner peace, but they will never get to the

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The teaching of rebirth and karma are to encourage
              individuals to practice good morality, ethical behaviors and the act of giving;
              one of the three paths of purification from the Theravada point of view. To say
              that if one does not believe in rebirth one will never experience the benefits
              of the wisdom of dharma is an overstatement. Many practitioners in this region
              go to temples and practices dana to accumulate merits for a better present life
              and also hopefully a better future rebirth. When the practice of giving are
              carried out with such intention it defeats the purpose of the third noble truth
              which is the ending of suffering and the cessation of further rebirth. This is
              not to say that there are no practitioners who do not do dana on selfless
              ground. The practice of meditation is to purify one’s mind for calm abiding so that
              wisdom can arise. To say that such experience is of meagre benefit is an
              understatement in itself.</span></p>

              existence act and behave the way it is stated above. There are secular Buddhists
              who believe in the practice of the here and now, believe in the four noble
              truths, the dependent origination doctrine and live life by the eightfold noble
              path. Who is to judge that such people will not realized the cessation of

Of course an atheist can still be practicing meditation quite diligently (just like an atheist can be a diligent yoga practitioner [modern yoga is usually stripped off from its Samkhya roots which is fundamentally spiritual aiming to attain self-realization of Purusha, having stripped off its spiritual context modern yoga is often left with a set of watered-down mental and physical asanas or exercises with benefits only on that level], or diligent swimmer, or dancer, etc), but they will never dwell into the true essence of Buddhism, and they will not be so concerned about getting rid of fundamental ignorance and delusion and samsara in its entirety. Their main concern is merely for the limited benefits of here-now. If meditation makes their life happier, they are satisfied with it, who cares whether there is rebirth or one has 'overcome rebirth'. Therefore they are satisfied with whatever meagre benefits they have (even if they had some limited insights as a result of practicing meditation). Therefore, they are 'slack' when it comes to practicing for the aim of overcoming fundamental root ignorance and samsara.<br><br>If an Atheist were to ask me instructions on meditation and dharma, I will not say "oh you should not practice meditation since you are atheist". Of course not. I will talk about meditation and dharma to them and encourage them to find some benefit from the teachings. But lets not pretend they are getting anywhere close to what Buddhadharma is truly about if they do not even accept the need to overcome samsara.<br><br>Since they are only concerned with some limited here-and-now benefits out of watered-down mindfulness and relaxation practices (found even in common medical/psychotherapy and self-help), they are not concerned with something like 'the ultimate Nirvana that is liberation from samsara and rebirth' (though they may misperceive what they experience to be so called 'liberation'). They may not even believe that it is possible to truly put an end to the three poisons of passion, aggression and delusion. (Putting an end as in terminating the defilements, not merely a transient shamatha state where defilements are suppressed) They may think that ending passion, aggression and delusion is a thing of myth, that at most what we can experience is some limited mental peace and equanimity while passion, aggression and delusion continue to arise though in a more controlled way. Even if they were to gain some meagre insight and benefits, they will never take it all the way to put an end to samsaric birth and death.<br><br><strong>A true Buddhist practitioner is not satisfied with anything short of the end of rebirth and all samsaric afflictions driving birth and death. A true Buddhist practitioner is not satisfied with any meagre insights or benefits short of the direct knowledge: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, there is no more coming to any state of being."</strong><br><br>In short: atheists can be passionate about their so called 'practice', but they generally do not even believe in what purification truly entails - or their idea of purification is very shallow and do not get at the roots of completely overcoming the defilements that result in samsara. They may claim to practice for purification but their purification is very limited.<br><br>As what Buddha said of Devadatta: <br><br>(Devadatta Sutta)<br><br>...<strong>and although there was more that should have been done, he stopped halfway through gaining a trifling attainment of distinction...<br><br><br>...Having thought himself his equal,<br>He assaulted the Tathagata<br>And went to the four-doored frightful palace<br>Avici the Unremitting Hell...</strong><br></span></p>

              <p>I was writing in Dharma Connection just now:<br><br><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>We
               study and practice Dharma to be liberated from samsara, fundamental 
              ignorance, the suffering of afflictions. Many people who practice 
              meditation are absolutely not Buddhadharma practitioners at all. It's 
              like going for yoga, practicing a watered-down asanas for the sake of 
              health and relaxation but nothing to do with the original aims of Yoga 
              which is rooted in the Samkhya - self-realization and absorption in 
              Purusha/true self. Is yoga devoid of a spiritual (vedantic) context 
              useful? Yes of course it is, but it is just a set of mental and physical
               exercises with benefits on that level, nothing spiritual. (note: of 
              course, Samkhya and Vedanta are different from Buddhism, just using an 
              analogy)</span><br><br><span>Likewise
               in Buddhism, when we discuss Buddhism and dharma, which is the purpose 
              of this very group's existence, we must discuss the core of it. We must 
              point out what is the purpose of Dharma. It is not for the kind of 
              watered-downed mindfulness practice (taught even in many non-dharma 
              places), or relaxation meditations. Well, those are fine of course, but 
              they are not even getting near what Buddhadharma is about. Likewise 
              those people who expound Awareness teachings, or skew towards certain 
              aspect of experience - such as non-conceptuality, those are still not 
              getting close to what Buddhadharma is about (though it may be the point 
              of other spiritual systems). (note: not that Awareness teachings are not
               useful or should be rejected, but Buddhadharma is far from being just 
              that)</span><br><br><span>Therefore
               we get to the very core, the very bottom of this. Practitioners of 
              Dharma, or those who claim to practice the Dharma, must be aware of what
               the Dharma is for. I sincerely do not wish for the true Dharma to be 
              covered up by all the surface benefits and watered-down 'practices' or 
              'spirituality'. We are here to liberate ourselves from delusion and the 
              suffering of samsara, and what that entails, we should get to the bottom
               of it</span></span></span></p>

                  thinks, 'There is no next world' is his wrong view. Because there
                  actually is the next world, when he is resolved that 'There is no
                  next world,' that is his wrong resolve. Because there actually is
                  the next world, when he speaks the statement, 'There is no next
                  world,' that is his wrong speech. Because there actually is the
                  next world, when he is says that 'There is no next world,' <strong>he makes
                  himself an opponent to those arahants who know the next world</strong>.
                  Because there actually is the next world, when he persuades another
                  that 'There is no next world,' that is persuasion in what is not
                  true Dhamma. And in that persuasion in what is not true Dhamma, he
                  exalts himself and disparages others. Whatever good habituation he
                  previously had is abandoned, while bad habituation is manifested.
                  And this wrong view, wrong resolve, wrong speech, opposition to the
                  arahants, persuasion in what is not true Dhamma, exaltation of
                  self, &amp; disparagement of others: These many evil, unskillful
                  activities come into play, in dependence on wrong view."</em><br><br>Rebirth teaching is essential from Theravada onwards. You cannot understand what Buddha is talking about in Pali suttas without understand the overcoming rebirth is the fundamental basis for his whole teaching. It is mentioned again and again and pretty obvious unless one is so blinded by materialist views as to dismiss them all.</p>

              <p>To me, rejecting rebirth is almost like denying there is suffering in this world... due to "I", and therefore suffering arise.<br><br>And also, the Buddha in some suttas also said (let me copy paste) many times:<br><br><em>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid
               of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to 
              imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past
               lives. I recollected my manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, 
              two...five, ten...fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many
               eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of
               cosmic contraction &amp; expansion: 'There I had such a name, belonged 
              to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my 
              experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away
               from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, 
              belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such 
              my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing 
              away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus I remembered my manifold 
              past lives in their modes &amp; details.</em></p>

              which uses the term ‘other world’ rather than ‘next world’. Other worlds here
              would refer to other realm of existences. MN 60 refers more to the right view
              on ‘existence’ which is Right View with effluents and sides with merit. Try
              contrasting it with what is stated in Sutta SN 12.15 below about existence that
              is consider transcendental Right View.</span></p>

              nothing difficult that is needed to know or understand about the teaching of

              relation to the other Buddhist doctrines. To some, it is of upmost important,
              especially for a Mahayanist. To me, it is just necessary to know the objective
              of the Buddha’s teaching is ultimately to stop this stream of becoming, birth
              and death and to move on from there to the more important task on the

              <p>I have heard it said the process of rebirth is the same for ordinary and realized beings, but the former are reborn as a result of strength of their past actions, while the latter, free of all negative karma, take rebirth deliberately in suitable conditions in which to continue helping others.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>AtlasWept hasn't replied, and while I do hope he would reply you more in detail, I will reply in brief for you first:<br><br>1) Budhahood cannot be attained by only 'doing good and avoiding evil'. That can cause good karma to be reborn in higher realms or deva realm (heaven), but that is temporary, it is not even the path to Nirvana. To attain Buddhahood you must attain perfection of wisdom, merits and compassion, and perfect the ten paramitas. You need to realize emptiness and fully actualize emptiness in your life. There is no way this can be accomplished without Buddhist study and meditation.<br><br>2) If you mean 'why do some people are born in good families/circumstances and some people in bad families/circumstances', the answer is past life karma. If you mean why are some people virtuous and some people unvirtuous, the reason isn't a matter of karma, but a matter of one's own mental afflictions (greed, anger, ignorance) and possibly other forms of conditionings and upbringing, etc.</p></div>

              <p>Nothing, other than the mind itself, can allow us to know the ultimate nature of the mind. If introspection has failed, and is subsequently discarded, it's because those who use it didn't have suitable tools at their disposal with which to conduct their experiments. They had neither the slightest training in, nor the slightest knowledge of, the field of contemplation, and knew nothing of the techniques that allow the mind to be calmed so its underlying nature can be observed. Apprenticeship in contemplative techniques requires perserverance. If the goal is enlightenment, one cannot dismiss the application of proper contemplative techiques with a wave of the hand because they're far from a predominate preoccupation and/or because one doesn't feel inclined to have the experience for oneself.</p>
              <p>Buddhism neither claims any monopoly of the truth, nor to have discovered something new. It's not a matter of constructing dogma, but of using a science of the mind to bring about both a transformation of the individual and a realization of the ultimate nature of things through contemplation.</p>
              <p>In this manner, Buddhism uncategorically promotes a way, provides, by virtue of codification, a path and, ultimately, a goal, liberation. The Buddha's teachings are akin to guides that leads others along the same path he took himself. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Could one, not knowing Buddhist philosphy and practiced meditation, attain enlightenment? Yes, most assuredly! Siddharta Gautama (the historical Buddha) is one such example, and he lived well by helping others. And, yes, it would be a good life.</span></p>

              <p>Tibetan Buddhism follows the Indian tradition and all Indian traditions take for granted belief
              in rebirth. Even if traditional Buddhist seekers do not have a deep understanding of what takes
              rebirth or how rebirth works, still they have grown up with the idea of rebirth as a cultural
              given. They need merely to have their understandings refined, but do not need to become convinced
              in the existence of rebirth. Therefore, texts on the graded stages of the path (<em><span class="tool" title="lam-rim:Graded path; graded stages of the path; graded stage of motivation; graded stages of pathway minds. A course of training in the Mahayana sutra teachings through which one makes progress by developing graded stages of motivation, which act as pathway minds leading to enlightenment.|J. Hopkins' translation: &quot;stages of the path.&quot;">lam-rim</span></em>) do not even mention the topic of gaining conviction in the existence of
              rebirth.</p>
              <p>Without rebirth, the discussion of <span class="tool" style="cursor: pointer;" title="The cognitive activity of merely giving rise to an appearance or mental hologram of something knowable and cognitively engaging with it.">mind</span> having no beginning and no end becomes meaningless.

With respect to physical or verbal karmic actions, it is (a) the revealing form of the physical impulse of the physical action or the sound of the words of the verbal action, plus (b) the nonrevealing form of the subtle invisible &quot;vibration&quot; of the action, which continues during and after the action. Some translators render the term &quot;karma&quot; as &quot;action.&quot; (3) A general term used loosely for behavioral cause and effect. Also called: karmic impulse.|J.

Also translated as &quot;dependent origination.&quot;|J. Hopkins' translation: &quot;dependent-arising.&quot;">dependent arising</span> likewise falls apart.</p>
              <p>Moreover, in terms of the three scopes of lam-rim <span class="tool" title="motivation:When used in Western languages, a state of mind that entails two mental factors (subsidiary awarenesses): a motivating aim and a motivating emotion.

How can we sincerely aim for enlightenment and the

              <p>Thus, it is clearly evident that rebirth is a cornerstone for a large and crucial portion of the

              <p>Most Westerners come to Dharma without prior belief in rebirth. Many approach the study and
              practice of Dharma as a method for improving the quality of this lifetime, especially in terms of

              psychotherapy.</p>
              <p>I have coined the term 
              <em>Dharma-Lite</em> for this approach to Buddhist Dharma, analogous to "CocaCola-Lite." It is a
              weakened version, not as strong as "The <span class="tool" title="real:A nontechnical term for what actually exists.">Real</span> Thing." The traditional approach to Dharma – which
              includes not only discussion of rebirth, but also the presentation of the hells and the rest of the

              <ol>

              <span class="tool" title="intention:The subsidiary awareness (mental factor) to obtain any object, to achieve any goal, or to do something with the object or goal once obtained or achieved.|J. Hopkins' translation: &quot;aspiration.&quot;">intention</span> to study the accurate teachings on it. Thus, we aim to improve this lifetime with the
              Dharma methods merely as a steppingstone on the way to working to improve our future rebirths and
              to gain liberation and enlightenment. Thus, Dharma-Lite becomes a preliminary step on the graded
              path to enlightenment, a step prior to the initial scope. Such an approach is completely fair to
              the Buddhist tradition. It does not call Dharma-Lite "The Real Thing."</li>
              <li>We may practice it with the <span class="tool" title="recognition:The mental factor (subsidiary awareness) of distinguishing an object as being something specific, such as when studying the Dharma, oneself as being a sick person, one's spiritual teacher as being a doctor, and the Dharma as being medicine.|J.

              also the most appropriate and skillful form for Western Buddhism to take. Such an approach
              shortchanges and is grossly unfair to the Buddhist tradition. It easily leads to an attitude of
              cultural arrogance.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Therefore, we need to proceed with great care if we find that, at our present level of spiritual
              development and understanding, Dharma-Lite is the drink for us.</p>
