              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Jewish Daily Forward Elissa Strauss April 19, 2015</span><span style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111c24;'>Of all the coming-of-age milestones my 2.5-year-old son has
              already passed through, none has impacted me quite as much as his first
              haircut. That first shearing, the transformation of the hair on his head from
              disordered to ordered, wild to tame, left me, to tell you the truth,
              despondent. So unsure was I of the decision to have his hair cut, even after it
              was done, that I rejected the lock of hair offered to us by our chatty Armenian
              barber. The haircut had happened, but I wasn’t quite ready to make it count, to
              ritualize the act.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111c24;'>I was prepared for such a reaction — I had held off on the first
              haircut until my son was a few months past 2 years old. I hadn’t exactly
              planned on putting it off until then; more so it was just that on some gut
              level, cutting his hair never felt quite right. I still felt this way on the
              day we took him to the barber, but, truth be told, I succumbed to peer
              pressure. And aesthetics. His hair was no mob of soft curls, or silky locks
              running down his nape; it was a highly uneven mullet. People were asking
              questions. I had no defense.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111c24;'>“And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted
              all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as
              forbidden; three years shall it be as forbidden unto you; it shall not be
              eaten.” Leviticus 19:23.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111c24;'>This is the passage from the Torah used to explain the Jewish
              custom of<span> </span><em>upsherin</em>, or
              the practice of not cutting a boy’s hair until the child is 3. Traditional Jews
              make a big to-do over the first haircut: Friends and family are invited over
              and handed a pair of scissors, and the first snip is done at the front of the
              head, where the boy will one day place his tefillin. There are blessings, and
              the first introduction of the Aleph-Bet. Some drip honey over the letters and
              allow their sons to lick it off as they say each one. May the Torah be sweet on
              his tongue.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111c24;'>I was aware of<span> </span><em>upsherin</em><span> </span>before the haircut, but it was
              definitely outside the realm of Jewish traditions in which I feel obligated to
              take part. Rich in poetics but lacking in logic, I had little at my fingertips
              to convince others, and frankly even myself, that this was a custom we had to
              observe. And so I caved and agreed, one Sunday morning, to accompany my husband
              and son to the local barber.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111c24;'>It was only once my son was shorn, and I was left with a strange
              devastation, that I began to ponder the potency of hair, both within Jewish
              culture and without. Muslims, Hindus and the Chinese all have specific rituals
              connected to the first haircut, and many of even the most secular Americans
              save a lock from that first trip to the barber. Of course, for the highly
              observant in a number of faiths, adults are also subject to a number of rules.
              Buddhist monks are commanded to shave their heads, Catholic nuns and Jewish and
              Muslim women to cover theirs, and Jewish men to maintain long side locks, or<em>peyes</em>,
              and beards. Hair is a way for the pious to manifest their internal discipline to
              the outside world.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111c24;'>Hair is a symbol of our vitality, our unbridled life force, the
              urges and tempers that we’re born with and, if we manage to mature properly,
              learn how to tame as we grow up. In Freudian terms, hair is the id, and
              haircuts, or hair coverings, are the super ego, or a “successful instance of
              identification with the parental agency,” as Freud wrote.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111c24;'>What devastated me about my son’s haircut, I came to realize, is
              this imposition of a superego before my id-filled beast was truly ready. We do
              this a lot to kids these days. Terrified of their internal wildness, we rush
              them through to adulthood, desperate to ensure that they will be both at the
              top of their class and wearing the right shoes. Not cutting my son’s hair was a
              tiny attempt to raise him in the spirit of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Emile, a
              “natural man” uncorrupted by society. That lopsided mullet was me embracing his
              glorious wildness, right here in Brooklyn Heights. My tree wasn’t ready; he
              needed time.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111c24;'>I requested that the barber keep his hair as long as possible,
              and he said he would try. Then, with each snip it grew shorter and shorter, and
              he kept shrugging and telling me how uneven it was. My son left with a crew
              cut. “This is best. It will come back nice and full and even,” the barber said.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111c24;'>“It will come back.” Those words comforted me, if not exactly in
              the way he intended. I would get a second chance. I could let it grow out
              again. I could wait until his third birthday. I could say a blessing for a
              ritual that still carries no logic for me but speaks to my id, that wildness in
              me that the birth of my son woke up and that, for his sake, deserves to be
              heard.</span></p>

              <p>Inner beauty--a kind heart that cherishes others for who they are--will draw others to <br>us, be a base of true friendship, and enable us to be of benefit to others. -Thubten <br>Chodron</p>
              <p>In the outer appearances it is a reflection of a one-point where societal values meets <br>individual values, and it is only the inner, inward beauty that truly evokes individual <br>values.</p>
              <p>Just as a slice of silver, hanging orb of moon is a reflection of light and benefits gleaned from Buddha's teachings, so too is our ignorance by our hair as a reflection of anger and fear from society, mixed with our individual characteristic traits on equanimity, love, compassion, joy, and wisdom.</p>
              <p>As one would look inwards, gleaning and learning Buddha's teachings, so one would too look past appearances and engage insightful and meaningful exchanges, building upon stable, secure and better relationships.</p>
              <p>Just as some occupations entail wearing a uniform so people can identify them, monastics wear a "uniform," our monastic robes. Part of our appearance is our hair, or rather our lack of it. Why is shaving off our hair part of taking monastic vows?Shaving our head symbolizes cutting off confusion, hostility, and attachment-what the Buddha called the "three poisonous attitudes." These three mental toxins poison our well-being and our relationships with others. -Thubten<br>Chodron</p>
              <p>Whenever we monastics shave our head, we think about cutting off our own and others' confusion, hostility, and attachment. Cutting our hair becomes a way to recall the purpose of our life.-Thubten<br>Chodron</p>
              <p>I'd rather have deep and stable friendships with people who look for inner beauty--what a person has in his or her heart. Thus we monastics are committed to developing our inner beauty because that won't fade with age. -Thubten <br>Chodron</p>
              <p>What does this have to do with young people? Am I hinting that everyone should shave their head? No! You can still work to cultivate equanimity, love, compassion, joy, and wisdom without shaving your head. But understanding the underlying symbolism of a shaved head--that it is not our outer appearances that matter but our inner beauty--will help you to let go of useless attachments in order to find true, lasting happiness. -Thubten <br>Chodron</p>
