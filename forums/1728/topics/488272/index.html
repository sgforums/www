              are simple to explain. <a href="http://www.netplaces.com/world-religions/jainism/the-five-vows-of-jainism.htm">No sex. At all. Period</a>. They don’t promote one way of
              sexuality over another, but that any sex that isn’t for procreation is not
              permitted. Of course, since homosexuality cannot be used to reproduce, it is
              automatically not allowed. However, it is right there with any heterosexual sex
              for fun, premarital sex, and any other kind.</span></p>

              refrain from doing, rather than something considered commandments. In one of
              them, he states that lay-people should refrain from “sexual misconduct.” What
              that entails isn’t specified, though he did add that men should respect a
              woman’s commitment. He felt that as long as it was consensual, affectionate and
              loving, sex is fine. Once you threaten, harm, break commitments, abuse or
              force, it is not acceptable. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_sexual_orientation">Buddhism</a> overall encourages peace and love. Buddha’s last
              words were to Venerable Anand, his companion, who cried and didn’t know who to
              follow and believe in. <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/lifebuddha/2_31lbud.htm">Buddha told him ‘appa deepo bhava’</a> (be a light unto
              yourself). The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Dalai-Lama-Speaks-on-Gay-Sex-He-says-it-s-wrong-2836591.php">Dalai Lama has stated that homosexual sex</a> is okay if nobody
              is harmed and it’s completely consensual.</span></p>

              same-sex is frequently shown as natural in the world through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_themes_in_mythology">mythical
              stories</a>. Many of the temples depict same-sex relationships and sexual
              behavior <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-love-cast-in-stone-temples-in-india-depicting-erotic-art-1907716">between all genders</a>. The scriptures about the deities show
              many of them as androgynous, such as Shiva. Ayyappa was born from Vishnu and
              Shiva when Shiva had taken a female form. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagiratha">story of
              Bhagiratha</a> follows that he was born from two women who had sexual
              intercourse under divine blessings. The Kamasutra primarily describes
              intercourse as a form of pleasure, and even divided up types of men into female
              and male type. Jiddu Krishnamurti, a Hindu philosopher, has said that
              homosexuality has only been viewed as a problem because “<a href="http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-text.php?tid=1598&amp;chid=1295">humans focus too much on sex</a>.”</span></p>

              one way or the other. It primarily aims to not hate or be angry at others
              regardless of their lives and being. While some preachers, such as <a href="http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4b6fe234d.pdf">Giani
              Joginder Singh Vedanti</a>, condemn it, many feel that, based on what has been
              stated in the Guru Granth Sahib, it isn’t a bad thing. The Sikh Gurus mainly
              encourage the married life between two souls, which don’t have genders. There
              is little controversy, aside from the preachers, and LGBTI are welcome to
              temple and other activities. However, since it isn’t specifically addressed,
              they don’t hold marriage ceremonies for LGBTI in their churches.</span></p>
