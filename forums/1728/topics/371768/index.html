              <p>Sentient beings are attached to everything whether they like or dislike, love or hate, them.</p>
              <p>A Bodhisattva is someone who has unconditional love for all sentient beings, a love not tainted by passions and attachments. A Bodhisattva is someone who abides in awareness and presence, so he is not caught up/identified/attached to/lost in thoughts and feelings but is able to utilize them skillfully.</p>
              <p>A Bodhisattva is no longer attached to persons, appearance, and emotions, because he has seen the empty nature of things and persons. No longer attached to anything, he still spontaneously act out of love and compassion for the sake of all sentient beings.</p>
              <p>A Bodhisattva sees and experiences whatever feelings and actions as being like a flight path of a bird in the sky, like painting on the surface of water, the moment they appear they self-liberate leaving no traces. There is nothing graspable or substantial there, no attachments.</p>

              <p>In Buddhism, craving, desire, ignorance is known as the cause of suffering, and this is taught in the Four Noble Truths by the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Why ignorance causes suffering? Ignorance is attachment to a self. Realization is seeing through the illusion of self. Having the illusion of self perpetuates the endless cycles of seeking, whether it is someone seeking to get, or remove oneself from, an object. Without a sense of 'me' as a reference point, there can be no craving or aversion, because craving and aversion is always a 'movement' of 'me' towards and away from some 'thing'. Without two opposing poles there can be no movement towards or away, hence this duality and sense of separation is the root of all attachments and suffering. Seeing this we understand that the Three Poisons in Buddhism, which is Craving, Aversion and Ignorance, these fetters are interlinked.</p>
              <p>So it is not 'love' that is the cause of suffering but the attachment and craving that usually comes with it due to the illusion of separation/self/duality. It all involves around the sense of self, manifesting in many ways. In the case of relationships it manifests as an attachment of 'posessing somebody'. And the 'loss of somebody' (the person left 'me') or perhaps not getting back the other person's love ('me' not getting 'that') is also very painful. Or it could manifest in other ways like 'I hate that person' or 'I am going to ignore that person', a.k.a. dualistic attraction, aversion and ignorance. It is all the manifestation of the sense of self, and the sense of subject/object separation. When we realise the nature of reality we will be able to experience what Vimalakirti Sutra stated above, <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the
                                                  love that is nondual because it is involved neither with the
                                                  external nor with the internal</strong></span></em></p>
              <p>That endless cycle of seeking and craving and the ignorance (the sense of self) is known in Buddhism as Dukkha or Suffering.</p>
              <p>To let go of all these attachment, we observe the dynamic, impermanent nature of all manifestations, and see that they do not consist of or pertain to a self (anatta). Nothing makes up a self. Seeing thus we gradually come to the realization that there is nothing to grasp in reality nor is there someone at the center who can grasp. There is just an ever changing dynamic process of process, event, manifestation and phenomenon, but nothing to hang on to, and no one who could 'hang on' to something.</p>
              <p>Practicing bare attention of each moment of our sensate reality and constantly reminding oneself of the 3 characteristics: impermanent, unsatisfactory and not-self nature of all phenomena is taught by Buddha as Insight Meditation or Vipassana. This leads to enlightenment. We can practice vipassana all the time which we should.</p>
