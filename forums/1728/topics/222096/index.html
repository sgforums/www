            <div class='col-md body'>I was just wondering what Buddhists think....<strong>will you let your children visit the Casino?</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.newsintercom.org/" rel="nofollow">Casino Issues until Dec 8<br>Columns By Andrew PK Yap<br><br>Based on criticisms from certain quarters, I would like to clarify that this site is heavily skewed towards Casino issues at the moment because the Sentosa IR is under consideration as we speak. The results should be announced on or around Dec 8th.<br><br>If you have any suggestions to make, please write in to your MPs by emails or go down personally to see them on an urgent basis.<br><br>Have compassion on the children as very powerful people try to tempt them to visit the Casino IR.<br><br>At the very least, let them know that you will object strongly if the Ministry of Education through their schools organise trips to the Casino attractions.<br><br>In fact, let them know that you object strongly for them to organise trips to Sentosa Island itself. Threaten them with your vote if need be.<br><br>To have a better understanding of the issues please read on this site the following if you had not done so.</a><br><br><a href="http://www.newsintercom.org/index.php?itemid=489%20-%20Is%20the%20Casino%20Harmful?%20(Click%20to%20Link)" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsintercom.org/index.php?itemid=489 - Is the Casino Harmful?

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the theme parks alone are OK as long as the children aren't tempted by parents to join the casinos. I went to Genting when I was young a few times and never associated theme parks with casino or fun with casino, even though I know its part of the casino. I think casino should be able to be out of reach of children as long as law is enforced strictly.<br><br>We should also educate the great harm and addictiveness of gambling. Telling children "it's bad to gamble" is not good enough, we need to explain why. Similarly, when Buddha set his code of ethics for his disciples, he explains clearly the consequences of indulging in such things... not just because "it's bad". It is workable - see how Singapore does its anti-drugs and anti-smoking campaign. That's a good example... maybe the government can publish pictures of people killed by loan sharks or something (just like cigarettes packages have images of diseased lungs, stroke in brain, etc etc) unfortunately I doubt the government will be so aggressive in anti-gambling campaign since it's supposed to help our economy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But most importantly parents should set a good example by not visiting these casinos themselves.... not as in the theme parks, but as in, to take part in gambling. Everything they expect of their children, they must be just as good.... not be a hypocrite. It just doesn't work that way. Children will grow up influenced by the way of living of their parents... theoretically it's "you shouldn't do this" but by gambling you give a message to children "you shouldn't do this but nevertheless it's not so bad"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you have missed an important aspect. The whole idea of building a resort next to the casino is to "fool" people into associating gambling with "fun"<br><br>When parents or schools bring children to the casino's theme parks, they are selling to the children th idea that gambling is "fun" by association.<br><br>You need to have studied marketing or advertising to appreciate this point.<br><br>That you yourself had visited Genting and do not associate gambling with "fun" does not mean the there will not be many that do.<br><br>Advertisers do not expect everyone to buy their message. The know, however, many will.</div>
