            <div class='col-md body'>is it wise to mix religious view with economic / political view? there are many things to worry about if one is worry about almost anything. a person (young or old) can be knocked down by a car, can be in accidents or fatal disaster like in sunami while going for holiday, or maybe one can even get cut by knives while preparing meal in kitchen or maybe children can lead to astray by mixing around with the wrong company... etc etc....<br><br>the big picture here is the IR in singapore this thread referring to right? well worries are not necessary when things have not motioned into life action. if one say if we stop it now then it might have a chance to prevent unforseen things to happen. well too late. please look at the time to stop the becoming of IR, not now but it should have been before during the board meeting &amp; discussion (for those who are "worried / concerned" ).<br><br>for me - yes i will visit the casino, infact the IR that is to see what it brings. to indulge in gambling is not my practice. then for one who's worried, then how about maybe soccer betting / toto / 4d all also can stop. there are many things that is not possible to stop or change and also it is possible but before that lofty idea, maybe one should look at one's own current condition - family - education starts from home.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well perhaps i don't frequently label myself as a buddhist or dreamily boast that i have great buddhist values. whatever. what is a personal view vs a buddhist practice? was that "a personal view"??? i didn't realise that. shall i keep quiet and just let the island sink? hhhhmm....<br><br>good or bad is in the eyes of the beholder. to think it is good is also bad. to think it is bad is also good in disguise. how sure 100% that it is going to be bad or going to be good?<br><br>onceinabluemoon, your style is very "familiar". well perhaps you do know already what's good or bad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> if you really wish to know from a buddhist's perspective, i'd recommend you the search by looking for a reliable dharma center or organization or the highly enligtened ones to answer your troubled queries.<br><br>like someone mentioned to each his own.<br><br>cheers &amp; good night  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh i have something say about the IR thing. i do not really look at it as a main theme of gambling addicts or some unforseen bad consequences. well that is if anyone else can see from my angle.<br><br>there are the good &amp; bad sides if a person wants to weigh the scale.<br>the bad - cos it gambling - lead to addiction, debts, sorry states, influential, other problems, etc.<br><br>the good side is - it brings in (money) for the country - in return that the state can use to improve further the livelihood of the nation, etc.<br><br>another good side is - (i'm a realtor &amp; investor which is my business) with others in the same position as me, it is a big impact on the real estate industry which benefit both buyers &amp; sellers (trade) &amp; also the economics of the country &amp; the region which it gives job for the other nationality to earn a living.<br><br>as bad as it may seem or can happen, it is also beneficial in other ways. to summarise or totalising it all that is bad or good is not an intelligent perspective &amp; just because other "house" has shown bad example, doesn't mean we will follow suit or vice versa. like i mentioned education starts from home / school / commuinity / whatever else, the becoming is just turning into the right direction despite the hidden "dangers". you determine it, not others. say or talk so much also no use.<br><br>relax, most important is to have balanced view. i also have a kid, i might as well worried also or maybe not on the gambling side but worried when she'll lose her virginity or lead astray. compassion got many ways to do, doesn't mean you do this or that is called compassion. it comes from within, talk so much also cannot reflect compassion, so must do it without thinking it is for compassion sake.<br><br>all things are appreciated - both good &amp; bad. good cos it benefits one &amp; all; bad cos it strengthens you, teach you lesson, make you become a better person.<br><br>no worries....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
