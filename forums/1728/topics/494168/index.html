              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Pulitzer
              Prize winner Ian Johnson discusses his new book and whether faith can reshape
              the relationship between man and nature</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"> Ian Johnson’s latest book The Souls of China:
              The Return of Religion After Mao has rekindled a national conversation that
              started almost a century ago: what’s the spiritual status of the Chinese
              people?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">A
              hundred years ago, China’s humiliating defeat on the world stage kicked off a
              painful round of soul-searching within the country’s intellectual elites, many
              of whom blamed it on the nation’s backward state of mind. Since then,
              campaigns, movements and revolutions have been waged to reform and reshape the
              soul of the Chinese people; some have advocated the complete abolishment of
              traditional Chinese beliefs while others have insisted on their reinforcement.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Johnson’s
              book documents a new phase in this history of self-examination. By following
              various Chinese groups, including pilgrims in Beijing, Daoists in Shanxi and
              Christians in Chengdu, he depicts “a great awakening of faith that is shaping
              the soul of the world's newest superpower”, which many outside China are either
              unaware of or can’t fully understand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">On
              a sunny afternoon in downtown Beijing, we talked to Johnson about his book, and
              particularly about how this new awakening in Chinese society could form a
              foundation of environmental awareness in China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">chinadialogue (CD)</span></strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">: You’ve followed these faith communities in China for
              years. What’s different about them compared to other Chinese groups you
              interact with?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Ian Johnson (IJ)</span></strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">: These are people who are looking for community and
              some kind of togetherness in society. And people of course find answers in
              different ways but there is a significant number of them who find answers in
              faith groups such as pilgrimage associations (</span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"MS Gothic";' lang="EN-US">é¦™ä¼š</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The
              pilgrimage groups are like mildly dysfunctional families [laughs]. There is a
              lot of shouting and yelling, but there is always mutual respect, and, at the
              end of the day, a lot of comradery. Members of pilgrimage groups are often
              working class native residents. The churches are a bit more formal. As people
              who go to church are from a higher socio-economic class, they tend to be a bit
              more uptight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">CD: Through this "spiritual
              revival", what are some of the values being emphasised?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">IJ</span></strong><span style="font-size:
              13.0pt">: Again, community is the key point. People feel that they've lost this
              sense of community. When they live in villages, everybody is related to each
              other. There are clear ways of dealing with others. Through urbanisation people
              come to big cities, or even much smaller cities and county seats, where they
              don't know anybody including their neighbours. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Even
              people who always live in the cities see their communities essentially blown up
              through urban redevelopment. People who once lived in one alleyway are now
              living all around the city. So this is part of the reason that faith has some
              attraction. It reminds me of the great awakening in the United States in the
              19th century which was also a period of urbanisation and economic change.
              People looked for answers in faith.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Of
              course, not everyone finds an answer in religion. For issues like tainted milk
              powder or pollution, people may attribute them to the lack of laws, rules or a
              free press. But a strong moral component is also present in such discussions.
              There is a belief that if people do not have a sense of right and wrong then
              all these things are useless. So lots of people start to think of it as
              spiritual, as a lack of minimum moral standards (</span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"MS Gothic";' lang="EN-US">åº•</span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Microsoft JhengHei",sans-serif;
              ' lang="EN-US">çº¿</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">),
              which I think is often mistranslated in English as "bottom line".
              These are things you won't do to get ahead. And it is what a lot of people feel
              is missing in China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">CD: In your book you feature places like
              Miaofengshan, where pilgrims visit every year to pay tribute to the Buddhist
              deity Our Lady of the Azure Clouds. When Western readers think of a centre of
              worship they think of places like Mecca or Jerusalem. What’s unique about
              Chinese pilgrimage sites?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">IJ</span></strong><span style="font-size:
              13.0pt">: What's special about Chinese centres of worship is their linkage with
              mountains and the idea that mountains and holy places are almost synonymous.
              Going back in the history you have the idea of yue (</span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"MS Gothic";' lang="EN-US">å²³</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">), now called a peak. You have Buddhist holy mountains
              and specifically Daoist holy mountains like Wudangshan. People believe
              mountains bring them physically closer to the heaven. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In
              Daoism, a temple is called a guan (</span><span style='font-size:
              13.0pt;font-family:"Microsoft JhengHei",sans-serif;' lang="EN-US">è§‚</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">) which essentially means observatory, where you look
              at the stars and observe heaven. There is no division between the physical and
              the spiritual world. That’s probably why Chinese religions place a big emphasis
              on physical cultivation. It’s somewhat similar with Indian traditions such as
              Yoga, which started also as a purely spiritual practice. You have the same
              thing in China with different traditions often known as Qigong which is now
              making a comeback.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">CD: Does this say anything about the
              relationship between man and nature in Chinese culture?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">IJ</span></strong><span style="font-size:
              13.0pt">: On the more abstract level there is this idea that the body is a
              microcosm of the universe. You can recreate the universe in your body through
              different cultivation techniques. When Daoists meditate in a cave they talk
              about going back to the womb of the earth, trying to resync with the earth on
              some symbolic level. On the other hand I think it's a mistake to translate the
              traditional Daoist concept of ziran (</span><span style='font-size:
              13.0pt;font-family:"MS Gothic";' lang="EN-US">è‡ªç„¶</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">, nature) in a modern ecological way. It's more of an
              idea that you should be part of the cosmos (</span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Microsoft JhengHei",sans-serif;' lang="EN-US">é¡ºå…¶è‡ªç„¶</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Concretely
              there are moves by Daosim to position itself as a green religion. But in my
              view it seems to be an effort to rebrand itself because people have a hard time
              understanding what Daosim is. The so-called ‘world religions’ like Islam,
              Christianity and Buddhism, all have clear stories. Shakyamuni was a prince. He
              went outside and saw the world suffering. Then he discovered the solution to
              suffering was to end desire.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Daoism
              is more of a folk religion which doesn't really have a clear story, even though
              it is inside so much of Chinese culture, from Tai Chi to Fengshui. Marketing
              Daoism proves to be difficult. For historical reasons, it was also socially
              marginalised by the Manchurian rulers of the Qing Dynasty who were Buddhists. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The
              result is that even today the educational level of Daoist priests tends to be
              low. Almost nobody has a university degree. Buddhist temples would have monks
              with doctoral degrees who are much more able to tell stories and convert
              people. So Daoism is faced with a crisis and turns to ecology as a re-marketing
              opportunity. I don't mean it's disingenuous or that it's fake. But whether it
              will succeed or not is debatable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">CD: Do you think Chinese religions have
              the potential of forming the foundation of a new environmental awareness and to
              contribute to the global conversation about conservation?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">IJ</span></strong><span style="font-size:
              13.0pt">: There is potential in the sense that most of the temples are in the
              countryside and in mountainous areas. They used to have large land holdings.
              And some of them present themselves as stewards of these areas. I know some
              Daoist temples around Maoshan outside of Nanjing have organic tea and organic
              herbal products. The challenge for them is again the educational level of the
              priests who have difficulty marketing themselves successfully to the better
              educated urban elites. They even have trouble writing the promotional
              materials. Nowadays there are local governments that assist Daoist temples in
              marketing and attempts to elevate the level of sophistication of Daoism in
              general.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I
              think overall, Chinese are thinking about the same issues as other people
              around the world. These ideas that societies are not organised fairly, that
              there is a lack of justice and transparency which led to great political
              upheavals in the West concern Chinese society as well. If there is one idea
              that unites all the faith groups I’ve followed, it is the idea of justice, and
              of "tian" or heaven. I think that's a very strongly Chinese idea that
              society should be just. And justice is not something given by a party or a
              political campaign but it is divinely given. In Miaofengshan, these pilgrimage
              groups all perform stories of righteousness as part of their rituals.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The
              spiritual revival shows that Chinese people are participating in this global
              conversation. And it would be interesting to see if China through Daosim or
              other religions could contribute something unique.</span></p>
