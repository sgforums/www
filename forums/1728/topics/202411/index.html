Period.</div></blockquote>Yes, everyone is entitled to their views. I hope this tread shouldnt lead to some kind of whether God exists or not argument, but rather, what is the alternative path (which is Buddhism).<br><br>But if you believe in God, in Buddhism views it is also good in some ways. A true Christian is one who submits his life to God, not as in he doesn't do anything, but whatever it is, it is God's will. My dharma teacher who is an ex-Christian herself used to tell me, Christians also have its good points, for example when a baby is born, if he is deformed or etc, he will continue to shower the child with love and care, instead of cruelly aborting that child. This is because he submits to God, whatever God gives him, it is the best for him. They may also see it as a 'test of God'. This is what I call the true 'relationship with God', which is what Christianity is about. Or Islam, which calls itself 'Submission (to God)'.<br><br>However, this is not the path of Buddhism, so do tolerate what is being said here, and I do hope people do not go overboard at attacking other people's religion.</div>

I found<br>your address from a Buddhist Group, Site.<br><br>Dear computer user Buddhists!!!!<br><br>You use computers programs and networks built by programmers or System<br>Admisintrators. But do never forget these important points;<br><br>This Universe is a dazzling (marvelous) computer. It has a Great<br>Programmer who has created all things and the earth in the Universe and for the earth He has built the sun as a " power source' and the moon as a " system clock ".<br><br>This power source has never been shutdown, and this system clock has<br>never been corrupted. Therefore this demonstrates the Science and the Art of<br>the Programmer.<br><br>This One is also so exalted programmer who has written a life program<br>for our earth and it has been running for more than 100 thousands of years<br>without any " error " and " crash ". If you want to realize how a Great<br>Programmer He is first look at yourself. He located your all data in a<br>tinny cell that cannot be seen by your nude eye, and He is executing the<br>program in it.<br><br>Since DNA is a program obviously, and no program cannot be written out<br>of a programmer, the computer programs that you use are product of skills,<br>but if they are compared with with the Glorious one's (Universe<br>Program),yours like a mirror reflection.<br><br>Moreover as He makes your  cells talk and communate with eachother on<br>trillions protocols in the network, He has given you all your needs so<br>He makes you talk with other people, makes you smile and listen.<br><br>He has prepared light and voice in order that you can be aware of<br>everthing around your environment. You can be aware of them, but you cannot add any new device without His Permission. Therefore there is a so great One, Network Expert who knows your all needs , and gives the hard wares that you need. What you can do as a network administrator, is very tinny and if it is compared with the Science of the Network Administrator of the Universe.<br>Yet it is a great favour for you. He has created natural beauties, greeen<br>plants colorfull flowers, delicious fruits (and all kinds of food) for your<br>amusing. Moreover He has endowed extra senses that have not been used<br>in your computer systems yet. Tasting, touching and smelling. In the gren<br>leaves, there are perhaps quadrillion x quadrillions of micro chemical<br>factory that decompose lifegiving oxygen from karbondioxside (and<br>monoxide).<br><br>He has created you from a cell (two halphoid cells), shaped your body<br>giving you balance etc. that has not been reached by the robot technology yet.<br><br>This One is the owner and absolute King of the whole Universe from the<br>earth to the heavens, from the atoms to the stars, from the begining to the<br>end.....</blockquote></div>

Therefore<br>see and learn all " about " created by this Programmer who is  the Great<br>Network Administrator of this Universe and try to earn the full version (life<br>in the Paradise and Love of that Programmer,The Creator)<br><br>The Creation of the Lord is an Open Truth.<br><br>However according to Buddhisim many questions regarding the universe,<br>existence, and life cannot be replied.<br><br>Since it has no longer enough for any explanation of that power to<br>consider only the existance of the universe, as Buddhism did not even mention<br>ages ago (and as popularizers of Buddha continue to do today). Each of the<br>steps and structures that Buddhists have said (for the universe and the life)<br>were so simple actually involves staggeringly complicated biochemical<br>processes (of the living beings) that can not be papered over with rhetoric. "<br><br>Regarding Buddisim. I never wanted to insult to your religion. I see<br>that you Buddists have Buddha Statues to pray or etc. They believe his<br>concept and way (even though worshiping of the Buddha really means paying<br>homage, veneration and devotion to him and what he represents, and not to the stone or metal figure).<br><br>But I see the universe by examining. Our earth can never be compared<br>with any Buddha statue (on account of size, volume). Our earth is very small<br>if it is compared with the Sun. The immense Sun is very tiny when it is<br>compared with our Galaxy. Our Galaxy is very small (like a dust), if it<br>is compared with giant galaxy systems.<br><br>The Universe is so immense whose size cannot be imaged. In it there are<br>Supernovaes, Novaes, Quasars, Nebulas, Red Giants, etc.So budda<br>statues, buddhisim is NOTHING if it is compared with beings in the universe<br>(Black Holes, Super Novaes, Stars, giant Galaxies etc.)<br><br>According to Muslim faith we believe in the existence of the One,<br>Unique, Incomparable, Merciful God (Allah) Â– the Sole Creator. He creates and<br>sustains all things in the Universe. We meet with a tremendous balance,<br>when we examine the universe. Such as galaxies, black holes and super novas. He administrates the cells in the micro cosmos, or galaxies, solar<br>systems, cosmic rays in macro cosmos (the stars the earth and the living<br>beings).<br><br>He is our Cosmic Designer (The Creator of the Universe) and He capable<br>of creating the dazzling array of living things, Universe is great beyond<br>all imagining. He is Higher than all things. As it is stressed in the<br>Qur'an (Muslim Holly Book Sent By Allah to Prophet Muhammed (SAS) : HE IS THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE EARTH<br><br>You believe in the existance of the Paradise (after death). But one<br>cannot be in the Paradise,unless that one yields to our Cosmic Designer.<br>According to Islam there is no re-born. People are sent to the World at once. And they are givien enough time to choose the true path. After they die, they<br>are re-created and Judged. (On the Day of Judgement).<br><br>According to your belief. You say " we will be in the Paradise<br>according to our deeds, but Buddhisim says there is no Creator ".  Then who can send you to the Paradise? Who will judge you? Who will decide whether your dees are good or bad? To do this an Intelligent Activity is needed.<br><br>Regarding our computers. Virus programs are programmed by intelligent<br>agents, programmers. They can decide if the file is good or bad<br>(harmfull or not).<br><br>This cannot be out of natural, randomly,  because our computers need<br>programmers to be able to select whether the file is harmfull or<br>beneficent.<br>Since an Intelligent Activity is needed for the computers to sellect<br>good or bad files, there must be an intelligent activity to judge people after<br>death. He is Our Programmer, the Creator.<br><br>Friend, pls don't be cheated! All beautiful things that you see in this<br>worldlifeprogram are only'limited trial " versions. As you see you can never save your wealthy and joyfull times. Then know the One who has witten this Universe Program.<br><br>Beware! All things that you are doing are saved as log files without<br>being removed and skipped. These log files will be opened and checked by the<br>System Admin, the Most High.<br><br>In Addition, as according to Buddhisim there is no faith in God and<br>worshiping (wanting help) to the Lord is regarded as dangerous. The<br>main teaching is " You must only trust in yourself " Buddhist Monks (Lamas)<br>teach so.<br><br>But this is completely incorrect and dangerous and it accomplishes<br>nothing.<br><br>So to any monk (Buddhist teacher) we Muslims can say:<br><br>My Lord, Allah causes the sun to rise from the East and causes it to<br>come from the West!<br><br>(As a challenge to the monk) Now cause the sun to rise from the West.<br>If you really trust in yourself you succeed in this!<br><br>Moreover being in good thing for Buddhists accomplihes nothing. Because<br>unless one yields to the Creator of the Universe, God, that one is<br>already in the worst thing.<br><br>In Islam the Creator, already orders to do good thing.</blockquote>i think Buddha is a NEITHER-this-NOR-that Noble person.<br>(from pov of One vehicle)<br><br>/\<br></div>

It could very well be a valid argument. Nevertheless, I hope this topic isn't going too much on this direction. I am considering to close this topic because the topic name may be too provocative.
