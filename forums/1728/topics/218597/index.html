            <div class='col-md body'>i received this information and survey questionair from a friend, went through the website and questionair. however, there is something subtle that's not quite right...<br>here's the message i received:-<br><br><strong>Please post this request at your dharma and yoga centers:<br>The Great Western Vehicle is conducting research into the phenomena of<br>meditative absorption. If you believe that you may be experiencing any<br>kind<br>of subjective phenomena that is associated with the practice of<br>meditation,<br>such as meditative absorption, then we would like to receive your case<br>history.<br><br>After some time of gathering case histories we hope to select a group<br>of<br>subjects who fit certain criteria who will allow us to test them while<br>they<br>are in meditation. However, wiliness to be tested is not a criterion<br>for<br>filling out our case history questionnaire.<br><br>From an exhaustive cross-cultural study of the literature of gnosis we<br>have<br>found that meditative absorption has certain common characteristics<br>that<br>nearly every subject manifests, regardless of their culture or<br>religion. If<br>you manifest any one of the following characteristics while in<br>meditation,<br>then it is very possible that you are indeed experiencing meditative<br>absorption, and we would therefore like to receive your case history.<br><br>Some of the characteristics of meditative absorption are as follows:<br><br>1) Tactile sensations that are associated with the chakras, such as a<br>tingling or a pressure at the chest, throat, forehead or crown of head.<br><br>2) Tactile sensations in the hands or feet that could be perceived as<br>heat,<br>or tingling or a pressure in the hands and/or feet.<br><br>3) Sounds that may emerge only during meditation, or at first only<br>during<br>meditation. Those sounds could be a rushing sound like the wind, a<br>water fall or the rain; a chirping sound like cicadas or crickets; a ringing<br>sound, like a bell, or a high pitched electronic sound; or, the sudden<br>onset<br>of tinnitus after the practice of meditation, and exacerbated by the<br>practice of meditation.<br><br>4) Sweet smells and/or tastes, such as incense or honey, that only<br>arise in<br>association with meditation.<br><br>5) Luminance or an increase of light or visual images in association<br>with<br>the practice of meditation.<br><br>6) Any sense of vertigo or the feeling of flight from the practice of<br>meditation.<br><br>7) Increased lucidity during the sleep cycle or occurrences of<br>Out-of-Body<br>experiences (OOBs).<br><br>If you have any of these symptoms from your meditation practice, then<br>please<br>consider filling out the GWV Meditation Questionnaire at this URL:<br><a href="http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/casehistories/questionnaire.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/casehistories/questionnaire.htm</a><br><br>A service of GWV Meditation Research<br><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/meditation_research/" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/meditation_research/</a><br><br>If you live in the San Francisco Bay area then this Sunday there will<br>be a<br>potluck in San Francisco to discuss the GWV's research into the<br>phenomena of<br>meditative absorption.<br><br>Oct 29th, 11am-3pm, Sunday, "Ecstatic Buddhism, where Siddhartha Gotama<br>meets Teresa of Avila" dialog, meditation and potluck lunch at 101<br>Alpine<br>Terrace (cross street with Duboce, one block Mission side of Buena<br>Vista<br>Park in Cole Valley), SF, 94117, Info: Yogi Hendlin at<br>neworldview@yahoo.com<br>or (510) 472-2948<br><br>Kindest regards,<br><br>Jeffrey S, Brooks<br>(sÃ¡maÃ±Ã±a Jhananda)<br>the Great Western Vehicle<br>PO Box 41795<br>Tucson, AZ 85717-1795<br><br>PO Box 93<br>Bolinas, CA 94924<br><a href="http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/</a><br><br>If you value the service of the GWV, then please make a contribution<br>today,<br>so that these services can continue.<br><a href="http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/support.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/support.html</a></strong><br><br>initially it looked very interesting because i also experienced various kinds of meditative phenomena and this article was relevant enough to get my attention, interest and engagement but i slowly realised something and i didn't take part in the survey at all. but instead i wrote an email to them and expressed some understanding and enquiries. i didn't tell them that they were wrong in any way. just that, for my action - i couldn't just do nothing when it comes to authenthic dharma that's needs to be expediently right and truly beneficial to the world for genuine spiritual awakening sake. it's ok to have fun, relaxed, experiment and investigate but we cannot afford to lose our mindfulness anytime.</div>

In terms of jhana im sure many of them has quite profound experiences, but from what i read i doubt that those people have seen the ultimate nature of reality. The founder claims to be a sotapanna (stream enterer), but i have to doubt that. It is also quite possible to mistake an experience of jhana as the experience of ultimate, however buddha was quite clear that all jhanas are mundane experiences. The way they interprete 'emptiness' as a form of jhana instead of ultimate truth is therefore not right. But have to re read their articles again.. You see, its been many years and i wonder if their understanding has changed and also i am using my phone to reply...

            <div class='col-md body'>all phenomena are illusion, even in meditation. although they are like more inner but they are still outer. to me, no intention of misleading anyone as i feel one should discover and see it for oneself; and as observed for myself, they are a reflection of the world thats within us depending on one another to arise (conditioned) and as they are also no different from the outer material world relatively, therefore is illusion.<br><br>some of the whatever meditative experiences might have power or shakti or energy, even learning contents and thrills or maybe even overwhelms or charges you but they are also very tricky and unreliable. we don't take refuge in them or find comfort zone in them. we don't cultivate them. we cultivate towards compassion, loving-kindness, wisdom and selflessness instead.<br><br>i feel that we should not lose our right perspective and get carried away, at least for now. mind is complex, the basic vital thing is we ought to put in more effort to understand and realise "no-self" and this no-self is not physically not mentally either and the beautiful thing is it's everything.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
