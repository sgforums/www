As such, right view is the cognitive aspect of wisdom.

Right view is not necessarily an intellectual capacity, just as wisdom is not just a matter of intelligence. Instead, right view is attained, sustained, and enhanced through all capacities of mind. It begins with the intuitive insight that all beings are subject to suffering and it ends with complete understanding of the true nature of all things.

            <div class='col-md body'>I've asked myself that question too. So Eric, in my humble point of view, to achieve enlightenment, one will have to:<br><br>1) To see and understand one's own sufferings.<br>2) In relation to one's sufferings, one must also know what the Four Noble Truths are.<br>3) From here on, choose the one Dharma door that is situable for your learning in the Dharma.<br>4) Find a good advisor/guru and rely on him in the teachings of the Buddha.<br>5) Take refuge in the Triple Gems.<br>6) On the daily basis, practise the 10 virtues and avoid the 10 non-virtues. Do confession of sins and purification. Taking refuge of the Triple Gem can be done daily too.<br>7) Meditation can be done for gaining insights into topics such as impermanence.<br><br>The above are just few of the many methods (84000 Dharma doors) in cultivation. The most important aspect of Buddhism is to recognise one own suffering, believing in Karma and rebirth in the samsaric world.<br><br>Depends on what kind of enlightenment you are looking for, the Buddha took 3 great aeons to achieve Perfect Enlightenment, so it is still not too late to start now as we all have been in the six destinies for countless aeons since beginningless time.<br><br>Cherrio</div>
