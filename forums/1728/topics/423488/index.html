              <h4>Q: Have you and the other representatives discussed among yourselves the issues raised by conversion, changing from one religion to another, in particular the different forms of Protestantisrn, Catholicism, or even Buddhism here in France?</h4>
              <p><strong>A: </strong>In our private meeting, a Christian quoted to me an inscription of King Ashoka, which speaks of how intolerance towards other religions can destroy one's own religion; how the prosperity of a religion is linked to respect for other religions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Q: Do you think it is possible to be both Christian and Buddhist at the same time?</h4>
              <p><strong>A: </strong>I ... [previoiusly--<a href="/forums/1728/topics/hhdlquotes22.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">see later</span></span></a>] replied to this question indirectly when I said that belief in a Creator could be associated with the understanding of emptiness. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I believe it is possible to progress along a spiritual path and reconcile Christianity with Buddhism. </span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">But once a certain degree of realization has been reached, a choice between the two paths will become necessary.</span></strong> I recently gave a series of teachings in the United States and one of these teachings was about patience and tolerance. At the end there was a ceremony for taking the Bodhisattva Vows. A Christian priest who was in the audience wanted to take these vows. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I asked him if he had the right to, and he replied that yes, of course, he could take these vows and still remain a Christian.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Q: Christ's words "Love thy neighbour" embody for us the Christian religion. What is your message to humanity when you meet another human being?</h4>
              <p><strong>A: </strong>Love of one's neighbour, kindness, and compassion--these are, I believe, the essential and universal elements preached by all religions. In spite of divergent philosophical views, we can establish harmony among all spiritual traditions on the basis of these common traits of love, kindness, and forgiveness. I always insist on this point and devote a great deal of energy to it. Most difficulties between religions come about because of people who, having failed to transform and bring peace to their own minds, not only apply their own beliefs yet are all while to impose them on others. This unfortunate behaviour can provoke serious conflicts, although I have noticed a considerable re-conciliation between the different religions, more particularly between Tibetan Buddhism and Christianity. We have actually set up a very constructive programme of exchanges between monks and nuns of our two traditions.</p>

              <p><br>same as Upali, and Brahma girl in Earth Store Sutra.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Upali was one of the chief followers of the Jain master, Mahavira. Because of his intelligence, Upali often appeared in public debates on behalf of the Jains.<br><br>There was one incident where Upali had a debate with the Buddha. At the end of the debate, Upali was so impressed with the Buddha's teachings that he asked to be the Enlightened One's follower. "Venerable Sir, please allow me to be your follower".<br><br>To that, the Buddha answered, "Upali, you are at the height of your emotions. Go home and reconsider it carefully before you ask me again".<br><br>Upali was extremely impressed, "If it was any other guru, he will parade a banner saying, 'Mahavira's chief lay-disciple has become my follower'. But you, Venerable Sir, you asked me to go home and reconsider. Now, I want to be your follower even more. I will not stand up until you accept me".<br><br>Finally, the Buddha agreed to accept Upali, under one condition, "Upali, as a Jain, you have always given alms to Jain monks. When you become my follower, you will CONTINUE to give alms to Jain monks. This is my condition".<br><br>Upali agreed to this condition.</p>
