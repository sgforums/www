He was born in Nangchen, Kham (Tibet), amidst numerous auspicious signs. His birth coincided with the prophecies of the greatly-realized master Sito Pema Wangchuk (who discovered and enthroned the late 16th Karmapa, Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro and the present Sakya Trizin). Since young, Rinpoche has received numerous teachings, oral transmissions and initiations including all aspects of teaching related to the generation and completion stages, the songs of realizations, the complete teachings and transmissions of all the great texts. A non-sectarian master, Ganden Tritul Rinpoche exemplifies the view and conduct of past Rime masters. RinpocheÂ’s great compassion is seen from the way he has always offered everything he owned to the triple gems and for the sake of sentient beings, such as gold plating Buddha images, food and financial assistance to sangha members etc.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>About the Vajrasattva Puja</strong><br><br>Vajrasattva is a primordial Buddha where all Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Yidams manifest. The practice of Vajrasattva is extremely effective in purifying even the heaviest negative karma, as well as contaminated vows.<br><br>This uncommon lineage of Vajrasattva originates from the 4th Panchen Lama, Lobsang Chokyi Gyaltsen. It is one of the important practices in Ganden Monastery till now.<br><br>As there are many practitioners who have received initiations and samaya vows, this puja is especially dedicated to the maintenance of precious connection with the three roots and jewels, which are our ultimate objects of refuge.<br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/cas_sg/gandentulku2003.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/cas_sg/gandentulku2003.html</a></div>

After the famous Gongkar Rinpoche (previous incarnation) identified and recognized Him as a reincarnation of a great practitioner, Rinpoche consequently embarked on the fulfillment of His destiny by joining the local monastery in Tibet - at the age of ten.<br><br>By fifteen years old, Rinpoche was enrolled in Gaden Shartse Norling College, located in central Tibet. It is the most prestigious and renowned school in Tibet, and it was at Gaden Shartse Norling College where Rinpoche pursued his study of Buddhist scriptures, and eventually, earning Him the highest honours among the foremost scholars of His day. At that time, RinpocheÂ’s field of study included Pramana Vidya (Logic), Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wisdom), Madhyamika (Middle Philosophy), Abidharma (Treasure of Knowledge), Vinaya (Spiritual Rules and Moral Law).<br><br>In 1959, after nineteen years of intensive study and training, Rinpoche sat for the Geshe Lharmapa examination. This major examination was held in the summer palace of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, located in the capital of Tibet, Lhasa. Candidates were various scholars and top students from the 3 main monasteries, and yet Rinpoche still managed to emerge 2nd overall. In the next year, H.E. was officially conferred as Â“Geshe LharampaÂ” Â– a qualification which is equivalent to the PH.D. degree in the Indian universities. And in that same year, Rinpoche joined the tantric college in Lhasa, and started intensive study in Tantra since. In the following years, H.E. taught many young incarnate lamas, as well as gave dharma talks to the mass public. In 1964, Rinpoche arrived in Dharamsala, and was subsequently appointed as Spiritual Assistant to His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama Â– Rinpoche serves His Holiness faithfully till today.<br><br>In 1976, under His HolinessÂ’s suggestion, various universities in America invited Lati Rinpoche over, where H.E. gave illuminating dharma discourses to an appreciative public. In addition, Rinpoche taught at Namgyal Gomba (His HolinessÂ’s personal monastery), at the debating college, and has guided and taught many laypeople as well. In the same year, Rinpoche was appointed as the Abbot of the Shartse Norling College of Gaden Monastery, in South India. H.E. held this position for eight years Â– where besides looking after the administration, law and order of the Sangha, Rinpoche also personally taught extensively on all aspects of Buddhism. RinpocheÂ’s contribution towards Gaden Shartse Norling College is widely recognized by all, and H.E. is deeply respected by many strong devotees all over the world.<br><br>Since His retirement, Rinpoche dedicated His life mainly on dharma practice, as well as propagating the dharma, guiding people along the sometimes complex path of the dharma. On repeated requests from many countries in Europe and America, Rinpoche has travelled extensively, benefiting dharma students in various parts of the world.<br><br>To His credit, Lati Rinpoche has authored many important books on Tibetan Buddhism, including:<br><br>v      Death, Intermediate State and Rebirth.<br><br>v      Mind in Tibetan Buddhism<br><br>v      Meditative States in Tibetan Buddhism</strong></span></div>

Drubwang Pema Norbu Rinpoche, also known as Penor Rinpoche, is an emanation of the great Indian Dzogchen adept Vimalamitra, who was born in 1932 in Eastern Tibet.  He was brought to Palyul Monastery, the seat of his former incarnations and was enthroned as the incarnation of the 2nd Drubwang Penor Rinpoche and the 11th Throne-holder of Palyul Monastery at the age of five.<br><br>In 1959, he foresaw the irreversibility of the Chinese Occupation and decided to depart for India in order to keep the flame of Buddha Dharma burning brightly so that sentient beings would not plunge into the darkness and gloom of ignorance. Penor Rinpoche moved to Mysore, southern India, in 1961 together with 600 people and re-established the great Palyul Namdroling Monastery. This was by no means an easy task, as he had only a paltry sum of 300 rupees to rebuild his entire life and that of his monastery. Penor Rinpoche had, however, insurmountable hidden resources Â– his enormous courage and determination.  The inexhaustible energy and commitment that Penor Rinpoche invested has borne him abundant fruits.  Today, the Palyul Namdroling Monastery in India, with over 5000 monks and nuns, can be said to be the largest Nyingma monastery outside of Tibet.<br><br>Despite his commitments at Namdroling Monastery, Penor RinpocheÂ’s compassionate benevolence sees him tirelessly traveling around the world bestowing teachings and empowerments, conducting prayers and establishing Dharma Centres to benefit the local populace in India, the Himalayas, Asia and the West.<br><br>There is no limit to the extent of Penor RinpocheÂ’s selfless, enlightened activities and powerful miraculous deeds.  His efforts for the doctrine and sentient beings are equal only to the limits of space. May his life be firm!</strong></span><br><br></div>
