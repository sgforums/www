              <p>IMO based on exploration of Buddhism, Buddha Sakyamuni has no money, only lived on simple one meal per day. His ç¦�éŸ³ has benefitted å¹¿ä¼  all walks of life. They never ç­¹æŽªé’±è´¢, the donation is voluntarily from the kindness of people which has gone into good use for maintaining the expenses of monastry for the well beings of all. In Singapore, the government would never support monastry free of charge although the teachings of Buddhism is free of charge. There were many instances where additional é’±è´¢ was used for the well beings of people and other religious institutions, aged, medical etc. It fosters a cohesive society. In fact, buddhism teachings is to bring out the intrinsic peace and love of both the physical body and mental of æ¯�ä¸€ä½�ä¿¡å¾’çš„æ½œåŠ› that beyond materials. Simply applying this impermanent body to achieve permanent grace, love and harmony from within. In this regards, it incurs very minimum expenses with maximum potential of bliss for the well beings of oneself and its surrounding environment.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">John 2:13-16"The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables. Making a whip of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, both the sheep and the cattle. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. He told those who were selling the doves, "Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father's house a marketplace!" </span></p>
              <p>From the above, we know Jesus is also against religious organisation doing business.</p>
              <p>I'm not too sure of the answer, can more Buddhists share your views.</p>

              <p>not really a religious organisations, but think some teaching can be apply.</p>
                  <p>if u KNOW how.</p>
                  <p>example èƒ¡å°�æž— a Successful Entrepreneur who use å¼Ÿå­�è§„ taught by Old Master Chin Kong to run his business. can search youtube for his successful account. He seldom "care" the company, he let it run by itself. sort of like å±…å¯ºæž— which provide free food, but money still come in to pay the food.  Old Master said it is the help of dharma protector/Buddha, bodhisattvas.  what èƒ¡å°�æž— care about most is the problem of the staffs. problems like health problem, money problem, family, children problem etc. he'll do his best to help. really ä»¥å¾·æœ�äºº. ã€Šå¼Ÿå­�è§„ã€‹"å‡¡æ˜¯äºº,çš†é¡»çˆ±,"ã€‚The staff repay him by working hard.  in order to be in his company, one need to learn how to å�ƒäº� suffer losses ; be at a disadvantage. Sound odd but He believe that what is yours it's yours. what is not yours it's not yours.

              Few the Leader is a Gd steward, members will give for the love of God.
              From my understanding through a CHC member, she was sharing that not just Church Leaders but also Ministry Leaders and Cell Group Leader. 
              
              They had abuse their authority and asked member to "SERVE" such as: running errands, baby sitting, free-lancing for performances, collecting stuffs from places to places, and lots more... 
              
              My poor friend had fail in her "O" level due to performing the "Drum Ministry", 
              
              She received about $100 dollars excluding transports, meals and the lastly the leader asked "how much u wanna give the FUND?
              
              So is this business? or using member to fulfill their dream in the world?

              <p>I think we have to separate different religions.</p>
              <p>Christians may have their own view, Buddhist may have their own view, which may be different, but valid for their own reasons. I don't think we should impose the Buddhist POV on another religion.</p>
              <p>Dawn posted a good quote on Jesus. I think Christians should take that into account also.</p>
              <p>As for Buddhists, if you are talking about the monastic community, the original Buddha did not even approve monks of handling money, let alone running a business organisation.</p>
              <p>This goes against the very spirit of Shramanas that the Buddha belonged to, which means a group of wandering monks concerned only with their inner cultivation and helping others (including lay men) in their cultivation, and collecting necessary alms and donations (including monasteries, etc) from devoted laities.</p>
              <p>Of course, times have changed - Theravada continues to emphasize on not making business, even dharma books are usually (though not always) distributed for free.</p>
              <p>But particularly in Vajrayana, they do sell their dharma books and items, which are a form of 'business'.</p>
              <p>However... what the megachurches are doing now (investing donations in multiple other business chains) are unheard of in Buddhism so far as far as I know (I could be wrong). Buddhism may also not receive as much donations (because we don't have a tethering system), or have mega monasteries that have more than 30k followers.</p>
