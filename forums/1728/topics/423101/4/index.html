              <p>pardon me as im gonna be very forthright here. </p>
              <p>Buddha Dharma is the essential teachings of the nature of this world and the potential for liberation in every sentient beings. In the practice and realization of the Dharma, the mind is experienced for what it is, and with this establishes right view with consistent practice.</p>
              <p>what AEN wrote has already sum up the point. it's through skillful means and intention that one can convey the Dharma to another who has yet to get in touch. Without compromising right understanding is very important, and this is a more personal aspect of the practice.</p>
              <p>i use an example, one that comes from my home. my parents belong to the 'folk belief' Buddhists and it is very difficult to break their beliefs and practices. however i can choose to do it through personal practice of meditation, demonstration of respect and kindness to subtlely help them to understand that cultivation is the practice.</p>
              <p>they still adhere to certain practices like praying to the deities during certain days, and while there is right understanding, i do not oppose to participating as a form of gesture. it is also a form of respect towards my parents for the upbringing and harmony in the family. i can only slowly continue be a condition for them to be in contact with the Dharma.</p>
              <p>it is not so much of to mix, promote or spread. that is the issue i see here. it is the position that some buddhists take of what is Buddhism versus what is not. this is exactly what the Buddha exorts us to avoid. The teachings are important, for they are the raft to bring us to the other shore of liberation. we must see them for what they are through the various practices that allows realization of this mind.</p>
              <p>The Buddha taught the Dharma. not Buddhism.</p>
              <p>feel free to comment. sorry for the rant :P</p>

              <p>you said: u dun get my question, let me repeat:<br></p>
                                <p>so is it ok for existing Buddhists to mix, promote and spread non buddhist teachings ? <br><br>yes or no ?</p> 
              my reply:
               there is no problem at all in promoting non buddhist book as long as it does ot contradict dharmic principles. i havent read di zi gui so cant comment on it as i havent read it. but if it purely preaches on morality then i dont see why we cant promote it. its like promoting cme (civics and moral education) book or some books that makes you a better person.
              
              however as i said, we must not compromise on right understanding. though blible teaches morality, they also promote the idea of a creator god, which is false view according to the buddha. so we must be careful whether we are promoting false views.  if no false view then no problem. doesnt matter whether the book comes from a buddhist. wisdom matters, not authorship.
              
              as for studying other religions, i think it should be encouraged to enhance our interreligious knowledge. that said the difference with buddhism must be understood. if for example some books are good moral texts then they can be promoted but what must be understood is morality alone does not result in enlightenment, liberation, end of sufferings.
              
              but i cant comment on mjk statements cos i dunnu his context.

              I think firstly, we got to dispel the myths. The myths due to
              mixing of folklore deity worship, supernatural occult and real
              Buddhism. </p>
              <p>Secondly, we got to remove the mental barrier that Buddhism
              is fully practised only by monastics. Layperson, due to lack of
              time, need a relevant way to practise the dharma, that shows impact
              in their lives too.  We need to increase the relevance of
              dharma in the present society in different aspects of living and
              dying. </p>
              <p>On the practical level, we need to have more teachers who are
              well practised and learned in the dharma who are willing to come
              out and speak on a wider platform. The propagation of dharma
              entirely hinges on this. There is no limit to what just one very
              good teacher can do.</p>

              I agree, the reason being there being a difference in the current generation and the the imported world view of our forebears ,
              Earlier immigrants from China are less educated and financially and 
              physically more vulnerable, thus more prone to seeking spiritual assistance to ensure smooth sailing in life, so whomever is more "ling" 
              or spiritually more efficacious, they seek that deity, hence the popularity of Buddhism/ Taoist deity like Kwan Im.
              The changes in mindset caused the more westernised younger generation to disassociate  with the practices of the older generation.
              I feel we need some ordained monks and teachers to  move away from 
              the religious rituals to serve the younger set. While some others will continue to serve the older ones. Buddhism must be patient, adaptive without being overly critical or self righteous.   
              On a lighter note, one thing I'd like to see, is that public figures who are Buddhists thank Buddhism or the Buddha when accepting public awards!

              one reason being, different methods for different people, it is from a non Buddhist that one becomes a part time Buddhist to one who is a full time Buddhist.
                          Being a Buddhist is a process of the mind and not a switch of identity.  
                          The young and western educated need to be saved, as for the older, we need to plant the seed of affinity, that it may ripen later on.   
                      We do not need to demonize other methods we feel is not suitable for us.  Buddhism is suitable for difference classes of all beings, both in compassion and skillful ability.

              Being compassionate also being patient with those you think are ignorant or heretical.
              Whether you choose to liberate yourself only or stay on to liberate others, you need compassion, and that means patience. Both for the sake of others and also yourself, for the aspiration,wisdom and skillful ability to arise.

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I don't think SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT IS TO BE BLAME FOR THE DECLINE.</span></p>
              <p>I think Buddhist community must take up the responsiblity for this trend.</p>
              <p>As mentioned by wisdom eye, it is not merley about bringing the person to the temple ensuring that the person seek refuge in triple gem and that's it. In fact, it is a life long process. Being around for the person when he run into trouble. Using the wisdom of Buddhist teaching to guide them on the path. It is a pastoral work which Buddhist community is lacking. People always celebrate the birthday of "sifu" how about the aunt and uncle who is attending the same chanting session with us. Do we bother to walk up to them, acknowledge their presence and congrate them for being with us.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the monks, nuns and the temple committee need to take an active role in knowing the temple members. Once, this process has been in place the members can open their hearts to share their problems and needs. Then the sangha can decide what can be done to address the issue.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, the active youngster need to take a proactive role in participating in the local temple activities instead of hiding at home as Forum Pro Dharma Personnel. Why? The temple need the youngster around to be around to assist them in their dharma work. From printing of the poster, organising event, public relation and etc. They need your idea in order to lighten up the temple. It maybe a eco walk, get together session and etc. Imagine a youth stroll into the temple, all he see is uncle and aunt. Their activities is nothing but chanting. He did not see even a youth whom he can related to. Of course, he get bored and went off perhaps to a trendy church with emotional charge music to express how he felt inside.  </p>
              <p>Fourthly, the community need to take time to understand each other buddhist tradition practice instead of brushing it off. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ONLY MINE IS THE BEST ATTITUDE</strong></span>. I am not sure what is the role Singapore Buddhist Federation but I think it is vital for them to bring the Buddhist together. As my practice is Nichiren based in nature, I noted that the Japanese Buddhist Federation make effort to bring the various sect of Buddhism together. If you know something about Japanese Buddhism Sect, you will notice their practice is based solely on one or two sutra. Nembutsu will be purely Amitabha Sutra. Tendai will be Lotus Sutra. Zen will be Diamond Sutra.......etc. We have our differences but our role as Buddhist is to share the dharma to relieve the suffering of the people. A person may prefer one sutra to another but at least he can practice with his whole heart. In Singapore, we are more of a mixed which is an interesting situation.</p>
              <p>Lastly, we are living in dharma degeneration era when the Buddhist teaching will be loss in time to come. However, we can still rejoice because it is also the most exciting time. When a layman practice the dharma wholeheartedly, he is still able to gain enlightenment. He will be a light in the darkess. The darker the nite, the brighter the light.</p>

              <p>Just look at the catholic schools in Spore. I am sure quite a
                  number of them students are influence by christianity 'cause of the
                  school environment. And when they leave school, guess wat religion
                  would they likely to take up? Asian religions or Western? Buddhism
                  or Christianity?</p>
              <p>The more we are expose to Western culture, values, religions,
                  the more likely we will take up the Western values and religions.
                  So as we are getting more and more westernize, we tend to move away
                  from Asian values and religions Its just simple as that.</p>
              <p>How to reverse the trend, the decline of Buddhism here in Spore,
                  the answer is right in front of us. One of the most important step
                  is to reverse the trend of overly Westernization. If we day in day
                  out, speak english, read english books, what are the chances we
                  pick up Lao Tzi or Buddha? Chances are high we will pick up Plato,
                  Christianity, etc instead of Lao Tzi or Buddhism. I dun noe why u

              <p>What you say is true and accurate but some people cannot see the connection, no matter how obvious it is to us.</p>
              <p>The root of the problem must be tackled head on.</p>
              <p>If you run away from the problem, the trend of decline of buddhism won't be corrected.</p>
              <p>The problem is PAP and their anglisation policy. This is the root of the problem.</p>
              <p>The specific problem is that people are trained under an education system based on alien culture and not local culture and thus all cultural values, all morale is undermined.</p>

              Buddhist legends about Emperor Wu of Liang
              
              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_legends_about_Emperor_Wu_of_Liang#The_emperor.27s_encounter_with_Bodhidharma
              
              The emperor's encounter with Bodhidharma
              
              According to tradition, around 520, during the period of the Southern Dynasties, Bodhidharma, the first Zen patriarch of China, came to visit Emperor Wu in hopes of converting him. Hearing that the emperor was already a Buddhist, there was no need to do so.
              During the patriarch's time with the emperor, he started to talk about his building of temples and giving financial support to monastics. He then asked Bodhidharma how much merit he accumulated in the process. Emperor Wu felt that the patriarch might not know about the good deeds that he made, so he pointed them out to the patriarch. The patriarch felt that Emperor Wu was providing his own promotion campaign rather than seeking the Dharma to end samsara; instead, he wanted to boast of his own merit and virtue. Thinking that the emperor might have been attached to his own ego, Bodhidharma replied, "Actually, you have no merit and virtue. In truth, no merit and virtue at all."
              Perplexed, the emperor then asked, "Well, what is the fundamental teaching of Buddhism?" The bewildering reply was "vast emptiness".
              "Listen", said the emperor, now losing all patience, "just who do you think you are?" Bodhidharma replied, "I have no idea."
              Bodhidharma originally went to Emperor Wu with the idea of saving him. To the patriarch's dismay, he realized that the emperor was too conceited; he had too high an opinion of himself. Being an emperor was already something, he thought. He had built many temples, enabled people to leave home, given away a lot of money, and made many offerings to the Triple Gem. He thought that he had created a tremendous amount of merit and virtue. Bodhidharma, wanting to shatter the emperor's attachment, replied that he had no merit and virtue at all.
              From then on, the emperor refused to listen to whatever Bodhidharma had to say. Although Bodhidharma had come from India to China to become the first patriarch of China, the emperor refused to recognize him. Since he refused to believe in what Bodhidharma told him, he practically missed his chance to come face to face with someone who was important to Buddhism. Bodhidharma knew that he would face difficulty in the near future, but had the emperor been able to leave the throne and yield it to someone else, he could have avoided his fate of starving to death.
              According to legends, Emperor Wu's past life was as a monk in the Buddha's time. While he cultivated in the mountains, a monkey would always steal and eat the things he planted for food, as well as the fruit in the trees. One day, he was able to trap the monkey in a cave and blocked the entrance of the cave with rocks, hoping to teach the monkey a lesson. However, after two days, the monk found that the monkey had died of starvation.
              It is said[by whom?] that the monkey was reborn into Hou Jing of the Northern Wei Dynasty, who led his soldiers to attack Nanjing. After Nanjing was taken, the emperor was held in captivity in the palace and was not provided with any food, and was left to starve to death. Though Bodhidharma wanted to save him and brought forth a compassionate mind toward him, the emperor failed to recognize him, so there was nothing Bodhidharma could do. Thus, Bodhidharma had no choice but to leave Emperor Wu to die and went into meditation in a cave for nine years.

              Just by this post, we can see how self righteous you are,   you don't even understand the point of Buddhism. You call yourself a Buddhist, but you are even not trying to be one. 
              Using available educational materials to bring the Buddhist fold, perhaps you are incapable of understanding simple words.

                  Without Buddhism, Chinese culture is only Taoism and  Confucianism.   The Chinese form of Mahayana has always been a fusion of these three elements. 
              I don't and won't print bibles, neither did Jing Kong Fashi, so do  you wish to  accuse of me or is it Jing Kung Fashi of printing bible ?

              <p>If printing more bibles can lead people to Buddha's dharma, we should go ahead and print but you, everyone and I know it is not likely and not possible so why do it. However, printing of Di Zi Kui brings more people to recite Amitabha. This is fact which you can't deny. Reciting Amitabha is definitely part of Buddhism. So, the end result of printing Di Zi Gui is leading people to true Buddhism. You must understand there are many types of people with different level of understanding and wisdom.</p>

              <p>So since you said Chinese Mahayana has always been a fusion of these three religions, does it mean that those Chinese Mahayana temples in Singapore such as Fu Hui, Sagaramudra Fo Guang Shan and Mahaprajna etc whom promote Chinese Buddhism without the latter 2 are not orthordox?  So do you also mean that Chinese Mahayana Buddhists should worship and learn all the 3 religions? If this is the case, why did so many of the comments here pushed the "blame" for the decline of Buddhism here is due to no clarity btw Buddhism and Taoism, since your argument was "chinese mahayan Buddhism" has all along a fusion of 3. <br><br>Ven Jing Kong printing bibles? Nope, he is already preaching on bible, rosary and quran already. His famous saying, " i can go to pureland using the bible and quran, you don't believe?
