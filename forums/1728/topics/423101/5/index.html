              there is no problem at all in promoting non buddhist book as long as it does ot contradict dharmic principles. i havent read di zi gui so cant comment on it as i havent read it. but if it purely preaches on morality then i dont see why we cant promote it. its like promoting cme (civics and moral education) book or some books that makes you a better person.
              
              however as i said, we must not compromise on right understanding. though blible teaches morality, they also promote the idea of a creator god, which is false view according to the buddha. so we must be careful whether we are promoting false views.  if no false view then no problem. doesnt matter whether the book comes from a buddhist. wisdom matters, not authorship.
              
              as for studying other religions, i think it should be encouraged to enhance our interreligious knowledge. that said the difference with buddhism must be understood. morality books can be promoted as long as it doesnt contradict right view. but ppl should also understand that morality is just a foundation and is not rnough for enlightenment and liberation from sufferings.
              
              but i cant comment on mjk statements cos i dunnu his context.

              <p>i know of a Singapore supercentenarian, social worker, Teresa Hsu Chih <span lang="zh">è®¸å“²</span>(112), a Sister/nun/Roman Catholic for many years, like Upali, was converted by old Master Chin Kung due to his idea that Buddhism is a Religion of Love/Compassion, as similarly advocated by HHDL. Master Chin Kung did gave talk on çŽ«ç‘°ç»�, but the talk is for Catholic/Christian, not Buddhists in particular. when they see MCK's attitude, even as a Buddhist monk, is able to embrace their teaching, on the contary, many Catholic/Christian are converted into Buddhist.</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Hsu_Chih#cite_note-2">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Hsu_Chih#cite_note-2</a></p>
              <p>on the other hand, one reason why the west is detered by Christianity is due to its dogmatism and intolerance towards other religions , hence over the years, westerners come to like Buddhism because it advocated to find out the truth for yourself. if one want to walk the same path as this dogmatic intolerance Christian,  one can go ahead.</p>

              <p>your answer is does coresponds to Ven Jing Kong's teaching of "God manifested as Buddha in India, Jesus in Middle East, Kongzi in China".<br><br>Is this so called "skillful" means again? <br><br>As i said, Ven Jing Kong is not only doing harm to Pureland buddhist teachings but to Buddhism as a whole.

              <p>one day MCK went to visit Japan, to meet up with a very old zen/pureland monk(can't remenber) who told him for the very first time that the founders of all religion are all è§‚ä¸–éŸ³è�©è�¨ Guan Yin Bodhisattva. a disciple of the japanese monk standing beside, then told MCK that their master never told them before. they were also puzzled. perhaps the japanese monk know that not all people can realise it.</p>

              If you  have no compassion and intolerant of the values of a Taoist, then you are unable to see their good and thus incompatible to relate goodness in the context of a Taoist.
              
              
              If you have no compassionate and intolerant of the values of a Confucianist, then you are unable to see their good and thus incompatible to relate goodness in the context of a Confucianist.

              If you have no compassion and intolerant of the values of a Mohammedan, then you are unable to see their good and thus incompatible to relate goodness in context of a Muslim
              
              If you have no compassion and intolerant of the values of a Hindu, then you are unable to see their good and thus incompatible to relate goodness in a context of a Hindu.
              
              Everyone is an individual according his/her circumstances. 
              
              
              Having  labelled yourself as "Buddhist" does'nt automatically disqualify you from being a zealot or a bigot, being tolerant and patient does. You are stuck in being right. 
              
              
              If one is unable relate to values of another, then how can one  bridge the gap to bring understanding to the the other? 
              
              
              If I or one assumes that I, self, soul and creator exist, you would not be able to convince me otherwise because I am inculcated with that assumption. Only when I still myself down, then can I begin on my journey of inquiry. If you are anti me, my values,I won't accept what you say,simply  because you are anti me, it is  human nature. 
              
              
              We accept Buddhism because  it resonates with our ideals or goodness,
              I understand and relate concepts in relation to myself, not spewing like it some kind of party ideology. 
              
              
              The strongest suit of Buddhism is compassion and loving kindness and tolerance. Though one may not fully grasp the profound teachings of Buddha, an average person can appreciate and respond to what are deemed positive values.
              
              
              Avalokiteshvara, hearer of cries of the world, is a manifestation of compassion,  and will manifest in any manner  to alleviate suffering. Does it mean not be being a Buddhist, you cannot exercise compassion? I did not know that loving kindness and compassion is a patented exclusive by Buddhist ! Ask yourself this, does a person in suffering does'nt deserve your compassion because he/she is not deserving or you are incapable of compassion(yet), because you are still so full of yourself. 
              
              There is no one single unified Buddhist church, for the simple reason that Buddhism is pro people oriented. What that means is Buddhism serves people, not the other way around. You gravitate to what resonate with you,you feel comfortable, you sit, you practise . Ultimately, Buddhism is about the Four Noble Truths, using insight and calm abiding, the rest being peripheral but instrumental, tailoring to different needs, disposition.

                  The reason, why I disagree with you is because whatever is connected with Jing Kung, you lose rationality , get emotional.you then to demonize him, you put word out of context, you even distort them. 
                  
                  
                  Why do I say that, because, everytime someone gives you a rebuttal, you did not take the rebuttal in it's own entirety, choose to selectively use a sentence and changing it's meaning, choosing to put your words to distort the meaning and intention. I am also your victim.
                  
                  Although I am not a fan of  Jing Kung Fashi, I nevertheless appreciate him as a simply put person, with sincerity. His values are a little bit archaic for my tastes, a bit overly confucianistic, that I can understand as he is from a different era.  Still there are people who can benefit from his teachings, that you cannot take away.I have some of his video tapes left by my mother and I've seen some of his talks in youtube. That's why I am not convinced with your accusations. Now,whether you printed any books or not any, does not apply to the crux of the matter. 
                  
                  The difference between Jing Kung and the cults you mentioned is non buddhist teachings he incorporated are only peripheral, they do not constitute the core, unlike the cults without embodying the four noble truths.
                  Jing Kung Fashi teaching is Buddhist at the core, not a fusion, like the syncretic religions like you claimed. There is a difference, and when highlighted do not constitue intolerance or bashing. 
                  
                  Religious discussion for the sake of understanding and to enlighten others of the difference in appropriate moments is beneficial. To argue for the sake of being right and demonize it not helpful, harmful even.  
                  
                  I strongly believe you have taken his statements out of context, your shown inherent tendency to distort, and also that because he has taken a lot of effort to initiate Buddhism to non believers of a different creed, and taken a universal line of peace and harmony. Foreign cultures understand the concept of God, so should argue with them till our throats and never even passing through the initial door?   He does'nt allow the flow of understanding in insisting concepts of what is alien to foreign cultures.  Also I accept him for being very chinese, a interesting mix! 
                  
                  You have opportunity to show his video and article directly attributed to him, yet till date, non is forthcoming.  Everything is hearsay. I do not trust you, I am your victim.

              Teacher	Lee Ping-nan
              Chin Kung, AM (æ·¨ç©º; pinyin: JÃ¬ngkÅ�ng) (b. 1927) is a Buddhist monk from the Mahayana tradition. He is the founder of the Corporate Body of the Buddha Educational Foundation, an organization based on the teachings of Pure Land Buddhism.
              He was born in Lujiang County, Anhui Province, China under the birth name of Hsu Yeh-hong (XÃº YÃ¨hÃ³ng å¾�æ¥­é´»). He spent thirteen years studying Buddhism and Philosophy under the guidance of Professor Fang Tung-mei (æ–¹æ�±ç¾Ž), Changkya Khutukhtu (ç« å˜‰å‘¼åœ–å…‹åœ– a master in Mongolian Buddhist tradition), and lay teacher Lee Ping-nan (æ�Žç‚³å�—). He entered the monastic life in 1959, where he was ordained at Lintzi Temple at Yuanshan in Taipei, Taiwan. It was then that he received the name of Chin Kung, meaning "pure emptiness".
              Master Chin Kung is well known for using modern technology to spread the Buddha's teachings. His lectures are recorded on audio, video tapes and CDs for wide distribution in many temples, including many Buddhist temples and centers where people can pick up books to distribute to other places.
              He has sponsored the printing and the distribution of Buddhist texts worldwide, as well as portraits and pictures of various buddhas and bodhisattvas. All these items have been distributed free of charge.
              In recent years, Chin Kung has emphasized the Infinite Life Sutra and the Pure Land cultivation method of Buddha recitation which is concerned mainly with the recitation of AmitÄ�bha Buddha's name.
              Chin Kung was the ordination master for the late actress Chen Xiaoxu. He is currently residing in Australia.
              [edit]Achievements
              
              Chin Kung had worked categorically on Buddhist teachings to bridge gaps and reconcile misunderstandings between different faiths through interfaith visits and dialogues, especially in Asia and Australia. In recognition of his achievements, he has been bestowed several awards and honours.
              In 2002, he was awarded an Honorary Professorship from the University of Queensland, Australia and an Honorary Doctorate from Griffith University, Australia. In December 2003, he was awarded the Honorary Founding Patron of the Australian Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Queensland, Australia. In April 2004, he was awarded the Honorary Doctor Degree of University of Southern Queensland. He was then further granted the Honorary Doctor Degree of Syarif Hidayatullan State Islamic University, Jakarta Indonesia in June. In August, he was invited to present a paper at the 2004 Okayama Topia for International Contribution NGO Network Conference on the United Nations.
              In June 2005, Chin Kung was appointed as a member in the General Division of the Order of Australia by Queen Elizabeth II.[1] He was recognised for service to the Buddhist community in Queensland, particularly through the promotion of Buddhism and the fostering interfaith activities between diverse ethnic groups, and to the community through support for educational and health institutions.
              In 2006 he sponsored and attended actively the solemn and sumptuous celebration of the 2550th birthday of the Buddha Shakyamuni, which took place in the office of the UNESCO in Paris, organized by the Venerable Tampalawela Dhammaratana, ex-president of the Buddhist Union of France, it was an event of international scale, that left a big influence in the Buddhist and not Buddhist world, by the distribution of its message of world peace and peace of mind in the heart of each.

Do a check on Buddhism not with me with any kalayanamitras around you and always like the kalama spirit, don't blindly believe in me and also dun accuse me of taking out of context untill you have done the research for yourself clearly. <br><br>Respecting another religion and incoporating their beliefs into Buddhist tenets is wrong to both Buddhism and the non-buddhist religion. <br><br>This video was uploaded by a Christian who found it offensive to Jesus being misintepretated by Ven Jingkong but too bad also damaged our very own buddhist heritage. <br><br>Also do not say that I say Buddhists cannot learn other religions, Yes we Buddhists CAN and SHOULD also study non buddhist scriptures to learn the good values and understand them, the Buddha had clearly asked us to spend 3/4 of time on Buddhist teachings and 1/4 on non buddhist teachings. There is perfectly nothing wrong with Buddhist understanding and respecting other religions but no, we do not bring in their teachings and "rojak" with Buddhism and such beliefs as God or killing cows or even non buddhist teachngs should not be a pratice to Buddhists. <br><br>As Buddhists, we rely only upon the Buddha as our Teacher <br>As Buddhists, we rely only on the Dharma as our guidance <br>As Buddhists, we rely only on the Sangha as our good friends<br><br>Anything wrong with that?  look at that video yourself, don't say I am taking out of context.</p></div>

              <p>Bible teaches people to go to heaven which is against Buddha's preaching. Buddha taught us to liberate ourselves and not to be reincarnated in 6 paths. I think you know very well too.</p>
              <p>Bible also teaches by beliving in Jesus will go to heaven but Buddha said anyone can go to heaven as long as one is good but Buddha discouraged us to go to heaven which is within the 6 reincarnation path.</p>
              <p>Many more, bible teaches God is the creator, Buddha said there was no creator etc. and so on and so on.</p>
              <p>Does Di Zi Gui have those above taught in bible ? No. It is purely moral education.</p>

              Have I now become a spokesman for Reverend Jing Kung? 
              Ha! Ha!
              Firstly Rev Jing Kung is promote peace and harmony, without which Buddhism cannot spread effectively, so his mission is not incompatible.
              He applies public relations and social interaction to reduce discrimination  and thus friction among the different religions
               
              There are four keys to his mission:-
              
              1) charity - in the; bodhisattva's way to end craving,
                  in social conduct; acts of generosity. to foster goodwill, creating          
                  precedence  of mutual kindness
              
              2) kind or considerate words
              
              
              3) helpful way of conduct
              
              
              4) together or mutual involvement
              
              To these end,  one must be humble, not self righteous, or holier than thou,
              to show respect for others highest beliefs. 
              
              Compassionate of the highest order :-
              
              Origins of major religions derive out of goodwill, sincerity and therefore compassion towards man. Just as it is said Avalokeshvara, out compassion in the various 32 forms to save setients beings from suffering. So when Jing Kung Fashi bows, he is bowing to Avalokeshvara, embodiment of compassion.
              Just as image of Jesus invokes the spirit of compassion, so to is believers of other faiths, the image of Buddha or Bodhisattve is representative of compassion.     
              
              
              Learning from other religions:-
              
              Seeing the Buddha nature in all things:-
              
              When we read and learn from any sources, when we benefit from, is is because when person who wrote it benefit us. So we learn to be grateful, in 
              buddhist lingo Mudita. Because we are able to understand the noblest of their principles, we are the manifest wisdom and respect. That being Buddhist is being able to embody nad embrace everyone, everything. Without compassion and sincerity, one learns nothing.
              
              Witht discrimantion, one shuns from learning and becomes stagnant, and one cannot grow, creating contradictions among the different religions and sects  Where are contradictions, one can not be truly happy..  Jing Kung Fashi acknowledges there are unhealthy trends of protelyzing by some, but it is unhealthy because it closes avenues for learning and understanding.
              
              All things being inherently empty:-
              
              When a person reaches a stage non duality, there is no division between right or wrong. As all is part of phenomena arising from mind.
              
              Anyway, thank you for this link, I am now able to see another aspect of Reverend Jing Kung from this. It should us the great compassion and wisdom of Buddhism. That I can still grow to be even better!
              
              Thank you again! 
              
              OM MANI PADME HUM

              <p><br>I don't have the time to watch. Can you tell me which part mentioned God manifest as Buddha ? If yes, from now onwards I keep my mouth shut on this topic about MCK. He said Buddhists called God as æ³•æ€§, Buddha said everyone has æ³•æ€§, so we are all God, potential God. MCK mentioned there is only one God which is very wrong because Buddha said all sentiment beings have æ³•æ€§.</p>
              <p>MCK mentioned only 1 God which was very wrong because Buddha said there are 33 levels of heavens, there are many gods.</p>

              <p>weychin,</p>
              <p>Nobody is aganist compassion, peace and harmony. Did I even suggest starting a war aganist non-buddhist religions and their believers? I suggested we respect them and their beliefs. So intolerance was never a point here.<br><br>What's the problem here now is he has imported non-buddhist teachings into Buddhism and what's worst? instead of complementing Buddhist teachings, such teachings he imported in goes aganist the basic tenets of the Buddhist Faith. <br><br>The Buddha was never a God nor an incarnate of God, this is a well known belief shared by Buddhists across all traditions and the Buddha was aganist the belief of a "Almighty God" in control of all human beings. Such a belief in God should never be mixed into the flow of Buddhism. <br><br>Secondly, according to Pureland Buddhist teachings, all purelanders rely on the name of Amituofo and his vow power to gain rebirth in the Pureland, there are various options from the ten recitation methods for purelanders ranging from mouth recitation to samadhi or visualisation recitation but again Ven Jing Kong is now promoting that we can rely on the bible and quran and gain rebirth in Amituofo's Pureland, this is untrue of what the Buddha nor all pureland grandmasters taught. Purelanders singlely and wholeheartly rely on Amituofo and not on bibical nor quranic teachings. Almost all well learned Purelanders knows that Pureland is not Heaven. Neither Buddhism nor Christianity/ Islam offered rebirth in Pureland either ways but a new age teaching by Ven Jing Kong again. <br><br>Get it clear again, weychin. this is not a case of disharmony, intolerance or religious bashing and never a religion was ever bashed in all my replies. The root problem now is the purity of the Buddha's teachings ! <br><br>No discrimination to any religons nor scriptures here but respecting common spaces and importing them into Buddhism and thus making Buddhism more and more unclear is the problem now. <br><br>As a Buddhist, we rely ONLY on the triple gems. is this call discrimation ???<br><br><br>namo amituofo</p>
