              <p>Chinese education system doesn't necessarily promote religion.</p>
              <p>Buddhism does not require very high standards of Chinese to teach or learn - if it did, then perhaps it is time to change. (personally, I never thought very high standards of Chinese is necessary, especially in my particular tradition where very basic Chinese knowledge is required - no chim words, etc)</p>
              <p>For the better - because if high standards of Chinese is required to spread its teachings, then the teachings become limited to only a group of people.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, more effort must be put on spreading the teachings in English which is already happening nowadays.</p>
              <p>For now, Theravada and Vajrayana is being taught in English... the Mahayana should put more effort in teaching bilingual.</p>

              <p>Once the education system is not one of local culture and is of an alien type the person produced under such a system, his culture and morale will be weakened, having trained under an alien system for years and not one of his own native culture. This is made worse by the fact that the system like ours from a young age is already of an alien type. The first 5 years of a person's life is the critical period in absorbing cultural traits, but ours is a bastardised system. </p>
              <p>This is the reason why the culture has weakened, the morale is of a much weaker type and the language is a bastardised singlish.</p>
              <p>This is why minority groups from all other countries will fight to the death for their educational and linguistics rights. </p>

              <p>There are so many "local cultures", so if by your argument, whose "culture" do we use in education? Malay? Chinese? Indian? Eurasian? Should we have continued following our neighbour up-north where they have continue having vernacular schools, but the people divided and ruled apart, even to the point where those of a different race and religion are discriminated and still called "pendantang" or "immigrants" even though they've been here for generations?</p>
              <p>Anyway, this is getting off-topic. I agree one thing with AEN, Mahayana Buddhism or rather, Chinese Mahayana Buddhism still continues to be largely mono-lingual. Even Christian churches are starting to use Chinese and even dialects to preach, even though English is still the main language of missionary work for them. We Buddhists ourselves just don't bother and then want to blame the government for the loss of numbers, which doesn't even make sense.</p>

              <p>I dun noe why is it so difficult for some of you guys to see the relation between the decline of Buddhism and PAP. Almost everything here in this country has to do with the PAP directly and or indirectly. Let me show u a quote from Lee Kuan Yew. Thats how his way of running this country:</p>
              <p><strong>"I am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens. 
                      Yes, if I did not, had I not done that, we wouldn't be here today. And I
                       say without the slightest remorse, that we wouldn't be here, we would 
                      not have made economic progress, if we had not intervened on very 
                      personal matters - who your neighbour is, how you live, the noise you 
                      make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right. 
                      Never mind what the people think." - Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, 
                      Straits Times, 20 April 1987</strong></p>
              <p>So why are u guys still defending the PAP? C'mon. Seriously. U want to do something about the decline of Buddhism here in Spore, first of all thing, u gotta face up the root cause of the problem! U could beat around the bush whole lifetime, I gurantee you, Buddhism in Spore will keep on declining if we dun do something about the decline of Asian culture, religions, heritage, values, language here in this country! Dun tell me Asian culture is flourishing 'cause of some Daoist temple somewhere here in this country very crowded during eve of CNY. Go talk to the kids and see how they think about Asian language and values. They will say 'Duh? Where got time.' Thats how this country is going. Dun tell me XYZ Asian countries also like that leh. XYZ Asian countries go eat shit should we also follow??</p>
              <p>I also dun like to talk about politics, and the worldly stuff such as education policy, or language we use. But its a fact of life, those earthly policies by a all powerful government, those stuff affect our lives. We cannot deny the fact that politics do affect the growth or decline of religion. Look at chinese history. Buddhism ganna jia lat jia lat at some point of ancient chinese history, and also during modern china during cultural revolution. Politics affect the development of religion. Stop this irrationality denial mode.</p>

              <p>So why are u guys still defending the PAP? C'mon. Seriously. U
              want to do something about the decline of Buddhism here in Spore,
              first of all thing, u gotta face up the root cause of the problem!
              U could beat around the bush whole lifetime, I gurantee you,
              Buddhism in Spore will keep on declining if we dun do something
              about the decline of Asian culture, heritage, values, language here
              in this country! Dun tell me Asian culture is flourishing 'cause of
              some Daoist temple somewhere here in this country. Go talk to the
              kids and see how they think about Asian language and values. They
              will say 'Duh? Where got time.' Thats how this country is going.
              Dun tell me XYZ Asian countries also like that leh. XYZ Asian
              countries go eat shit should we also follow??</p>
              <p>I also dun like to talk about politics, and the worldly stuff
              such as education policy, or language we use. But its a fact of
              life, those earthly policies by a all powerful government, those
              stuff affect our lives. We cannot deny the fact that politics do
              affect the growth or decline of religion. Look at chinese history.
              Buddhism ganna jia lat jia lat at some point of ancient chinese
              history, and also during modern china during cultural revolution.
              Politics affect the development of religion. Stop this nonsensical
              denial mode.</p>

              <p>The trends, like de-emphasis in Chinese, and so on, may be perceived as negative (subject to personal opinion) - nevertheless I do not believe they have a big impact on religion as a whole.</p>
              <p>Religion is about what you believe and practice, it is not about what language you speak. And all Singaporeans speak bilingually anyway, this hasn't changed.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is not a religion tied to culture (Taoism may in a sense be - but philosophical Taoism is also well received in western countries). Buddhism however is independent of culture, and also mingles with any cultures very well, that is why it is all over the world, adopting and absorbing various cultures. For example, Buddhism is actually of Indian origin - but you do not see Indian Buddhism in Singapore.</p>

              <p>I think Buddhism needs to adapt to the changing trends.</p>
              <p>China and Singapore are totally different - there is no
                      religious persecution because our government is secular in terms of

              <p>Come on. Buddhism also touches on filial piety, and æ„Ÿæ�© (grateful). So is it grateful for Singapore this country, majority of which are Chinese, to turn its back against Chinese language? Is this being grateful? Chinese language standard is slowly but surely declining! Its a sign we are marginalize our own asian language. Thats not being nice, good. To turn our back against our language, for the chinese here.</p>
              <p>LKY attitude, his bias against Asian culture and language, translate into language policies and education policies. And thus, we are getting more and more westernize. And when we are getting more and more westernize, what do we do? We slowly ditch away asian values, culture, and even religions. Thats why Buddhism on the decline bro.</p>
