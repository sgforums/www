              <p>The recent Singapore population census of 2010 report indicated a rapid decline (first dip in 30 years) of people adopting the Buddhist faith.

              <p>Joss-stick temples preoccupied with the business of offering vegetarian dishes and ancestor worship services, but neglected the teaching of the Dharma as a core duty and responsibility. Buddhist practices that embraced and incorporated the practices of Brahmanism, Confucianism, Taoism and the deification of the Buddha. The purity and simplicity of the original teaching of the Buddha has been contaminated by divinization of the teachings.</p>
              <p>Sociologist Daniel Goh, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, said ‘Higher-educated people are more likely to look to a de-ritualized way of life. “. Has the popular ”Buddhist” practices (or malpractices) we see here in today’s Singapore run counter to this trend of the more educated younger generation, therefore causing these younger and more educated Singaporeans to stay away from Buddhism? ~ Low Teck Suan</p>

              <p>Look at ourselves. Have we developed positive qualities or changed ourselves in any way for the better after learning dharma.  If we have, for instance become calmer, more thoughtful and helpful to others, able to remain less affected by good and bad circumstances, have a basic sense of good cheer and contentment... then people around us who observe the changes may realise that something is working.  Then they are more intrigued to learn. </p>
              <p>If we become more attached after learning Buddhism, become more greedy even if in the spiritual sense, creating more hassle and problems for others, then we will no doubt set a bad example and create distaste in the minds of others.</p>

              <p>The recent Singapore population census of 2010 report indicated
              a rapid decline (first dip in 30 years) of people adopting the
              Buddhist faith. I wonder if the reason for such decline is
              linked to the following phenomenon of abuses in Buddhist
              practices so often cautioned by Venerable Master Yinshun in
              his various writings: Emphasis on rituals, obsession with the
              mystical and metaphysical aspects.</p>
              <p>Joss-stick temples preoccupied with the business of
              offering vegetarian dishes and ancestor worship services, but
              neglected the teaching of the Dharma as a core duty and
              responsibility. Buddhist practices that embraced and
              incorporated the practices of Brahmanism, Confucianism, Taoism
              and the deification of the Buddha. The purity and simplicity
              of the original teaching of the Buddha has been contaminated
              by divinization of the teachings.</p>
              <p>Sociologist Daniel Goh, an assistant professor at the
              National University of Singapore, said ‘Higher-educated people
              are more likely to look to a de-ritualized way of life. “. Has
              the popular ”Buddhist” practices (or malpractices) we see here
              in today’s Singapore run counter to this trend of the more
              educated younger generation, therefore causing these younger
              and more educated Singaporeans to stay away from Buddhism?

              <p>Don't bullshit and say it's PAP's fault. If not, why was there a rise in Taoism?! Just went to have a look at Loyang Tua Pek Kong temple on the 9th day of CNY (so-called Tee Kong's birthday), filled to the BRIM! Just a few hours before that i went to Foo Hai Monastery (yes, the one whose abbot was just released from jail not long ago!) it was also full to the brim with adherents praying. So don't bullshit and say there's a decline in local culture.</p>
              <p>There are alot of other nations in Asia that are also "Westernising" or looking up to the west. Look at Korea, within 60 years more than 2/3 of religious adherents there are either Catholic or Protestant, but also with more less religious. Japan walked the same path (people there becoming less religious), China is about to walk it! Alot of Asian countries are becoming even more westernised than us. However, Indonesia and Malaysia are becoming more radicalised, so are you saying it's Islam's fault?</p>
              <p>Everything also want to blame the government! When you point a finger, 3 (4) point back at yourself. So don't say it's the government's fault if there is a decline in Buddhism; we Buddhists only have ourselves to blame for not doing a better job!</p>

The report submitted by Chris Lydgate was not published by Asia Online.</span><br><br>Tang Liang Hong lived in Singapore with his wife and three children. There, he owned two cars, a Lancia and a Mercedes 280, and belonged to the Singapore Cricket Club and the Jurong Country club. On the face of it, he was a successful lawyer of 28 years experience who had earned himself a comfortable lifestyle in a place famous for its shopping and its access to international travel. He should have been considering retiring comfortably.<br><br>Instead, Tang has run afoul of Singapore’s government and Lee Kuan Yew, the leader he once admired.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Because of his concern for Singapore in general, and for the Chinese community in particular, Tang has been forced to leave the country. He fled to Malaysia in January, 1997, shortly after the general election in Singapore.</span></span></strong><br><br>Tang, one of eight children, was born in 1935 of parents who came from farming families. His father was practically illiterate and his mother could not write her own name correctly but, with the children to help, they ran a laundry. It was only when he was thirteen that Tang began to receive any formal schooling.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In 1949 he joined Yeung Ching Primary School, a Chinese school, and graduated from high school in 1957. In those days, Tang was a staunch supporter of Lee Kuan Yew. In fact, he and a group of students once stood in front of a stage as bodyguards to protect Lee and other political leaders at a political rally for Singapore’s struggle for democracy and independence.</span></span></strong><br><br>After his graduation, though, Tang began to be active in the Chinese community. He taught at a Chinese village school for five years. By the end of that time, though, he had decided that he wanted to do something more.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> "I was very influenced by Confucian thinking," he says. "I wanted to pursue my education."</span></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The University of Singapore did not accept graduates from Chinese schools, but Nanyang University had recently opened and so, in 1962, Tang joined there.</span></span></strong> The following year, though, things were different. Singapore University became open to him in a sort of pilot project Lee Kuan Yew had initiated in order to "let a few piranhas (man-eating fish) in the goldfish tank" to climatise and season the English educated. Tang graduated in 1967 and joined the bar the following year at the age of 38.<br><br>Tang became more active in the Chinese community. He was the chairman of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts for many years, and sat on the board of management of Singapore Chinese High School, Hwa Chong Junior College, and a few other schools.<br><br>In the 1990’s, at an age when many people might have been considering their retirement options, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tang became concerned about an emerging problem: Too few Chinese had any mastery of Mandarin. "Many younger generation Chinese can’t even read the menu in a Chinese restaurant, let alone Chinese newspapers," Tang says. "Many Chinese students loathe learning Chinese language. Isn’t there something wrong?</span></span></strong><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Singapore is 77 percent Chinese, and you need a ‘Speak Mandarin Campaign’ to remind Singaporean Chinese to use the language. How pitiful! In addition, the campaign is in fact a deliberate attempt to arouse fear among the non-Chinese and in turn the PAP use that fear to club the Chinese community in the name of maintaining racial harmony.</span> Do you need a Speak English Campaign in England or America to maintain the continual use of English?<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> LKY has succeeded, which the British colonialists failed, to make many Singapore students hate learning their own language and culture."</span></span></strong><br><br>He was not alone in his concern.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Together with a group of Chinese intellectuals, he drew up a memo on the problem and suggested several new policies.</span></span></strong> As a result, Tang was profiled in the Straits Times and, says Tang, misquoted. His friends, outraged, drafted letters in response, but Tang told them it wasn’t worth bothering with. "It did not occur to me that I would one day participate in politics," he says. "Never!"<br><br>Then, after making a simple comment in a magazine, Tang found himself in storm over the HPL scandal. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hotel Properties Limited had given a discount of S$700,000 to Lee Kuan Yew and his son Lee Hsien Loong to buy condominium units. Lee Kuan Yew and his son maintained that this was normal and legal.</span> Tang, during an interview with a Hong Kong based magazine, Asia Weekly, suggested that the case should be referred to the Corruption Practices Investigation Bureau.<br><br>"To me," he says, "I was touching on a topic of public interest. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether, as a matter of public policy, it is legally and morally right for so many people holding high positions, to get deep discounts through ‘guan xi’ (connection) from a public-listed company, which is supposed to maximise returns to its shareholders.</span>And my comment was very fair. Why should this case not be handled like any other case? It was time to stand up to Lee Kuan Yew and say ‘No,’ although he’s very important and his power is awful. But I think someone has to tell him, ‘No.’ I don’t think he must have his way all the time under whatever circumstances.<br><br>"Lee Kuan Yew had been bullying people for years," Tang continues. "But I’m not like those who are easily intimidated. I’m prepared to sacrifice everything to fight for freedom of speech, particularly on matters of public interest. This is me! After all, Goh Chok Tong had already said HPL matters should be investigated. I only said, ‘why don’t you allow the professionals to investigate?’ Defamation?"<br><br>Tang also explained, "The magazine’s lawyer did not think the comment was defamatory. Nevertheless, the magazine decided to apologise and pay damages to maintain its circulation in Singapore. That was a commercial decision, but I’m not a commercial man."<br><br>Tang found himself not merely participating in politics, but running for election. His reasons for this decision were very much based on his concerns over what was happening to the Chinese community and other minority communities, in Singapore.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-English speaking Singaporeans, including Chinese, Malays and Indians have, he says, been discriminated against unnecessarily under the PAP policies, particularly, for example the Chinese-educated, the Buddhists, the Taoists, the Hindus and the Muslims.</span> </span></span></strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">The discrimination, he says, takes various forms: Nanyang University was restructured; </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">there is no Chinese-language business paper; there is discrimination in the intake of university students, in the engagement of university lecturers and school teachers, in the manning of positions in the army and police forces, and an absence of representation of the non-English-speaking Singaporeans in the decision-making process and in many top government posts.</span> </span></span></strong>These are just a few examples.<br><br>"Once in a blue moon," Tang says, "when world conference on Confucianism was held in Singapore, the PAP would seize the opportunity to launch its massive propaganda to the outside world and hood winked the Chinese communities around the world, especially those scholars in China, into believing that Singapore promotes Confucianism. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is just another fraud."</span></span></strong><br><br>Later, he adds, "Confucianism is not taught in schools – only Confusionism!"<br><br>Tang has been accused of being a Chinese chauvinist because of his comments on education and language. He has been misquoted and his words taken out of context when he tried to describe the richness that words from different languages have to offer.<br><br>"Take the word ‘equity’," he says. "That one word – you can write a book on it. You cannot translate it verbatim into Chinese. It means fairness. It also has legal and technical meanings. It means also having clean hands and a fair mind. It is not possible to translate it into one word. On the other hand, the Chinese word ‘xiao’ is usually translated as piety, or filial piety. But that’s just a small fraction of the concept. You can translate the concept, but not word for word. They distorted my view by accusing me of believing that ideas can only be expressed in Chinese. I have never [been] opposed to learning English." <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">By knowing only English, and not knowing Chinese language, Chinese people miss out on the richness of culture that might be available to them. This loss helps no one. "The Chinese stand to lose by not knowing his own language and culture," Tang says. "Their loss is not a gain to the other races."</span></span></strong></div>

              <p>PAP, by destroying the chinese education system and imposing an alien system in Singapore is already a form of weakening the local culture and religion. The anglisation of Singapore society and weakening of local culture is all completely and totally due to PAP.</p>
