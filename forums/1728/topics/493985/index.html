              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Applying
              mindfulness to the body, feelings, mind and objects of mind</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              origins of [mindful awareness] practice are found in Gautama’s own discourse on
              the “Foundations of Mindfulness” (Satipatthana Sutta) in the Pali Canon. It has
              been described as “the most important discourse ever given by the Buddha on
              mental development,” and as such is highly revered in all Theravada Buddhist
              countries of Asia. The Buddha opened the discourse by declaring:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              is, monks, this way that leads only to the purification of beings, to the
              overcoming of sorrow and distress, to the disappearance of pain and sadness, to
              the gaining of the right path, to the realization of Nirvana—that is to say the
              four foundations of mindfulness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">These
              four foundations are the four areas of life to which mindful awareness needs to
              be applied: body, feelings, mind and objects of mind. In other words, the
              totality of experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddha recommends that a person retire to a forest, the root of a tree or a
              solitary place, sit cross-legged with body erect and then turn his or her
              attention to their breath. Then, “mindfully he breathes in, mindfully he
              breathes out. Breathing in a long breath, he knows that he breathes in a long
              breath, and breathing out a long breath, he knows that he breathes out a long
              breath.” There is no attempt to control the breath or in any way interfere with
              the immediacy of experience as it unfolds. If the breath is long, one
              recognizes it to be long; if short, one recognizes it to be short.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yet
              for many this seemingly straightforward exercise turns out to be remarkably
              tricky. One finds that no matter how sincere one’s intention to be attentive
              and aware, the mind rebels against such instructions and races off to indulge
              in all manner of distractions, memories and fantasies. One is forced to
              confront the sobering truth that one is only notionally “in charge” of one’s
              psychological life. The comforting illusion of personal coherence and
              continuity is ripped away to expose only fragmentary islands of consciousness
              separated by yawning gulfs of unawareness. Similarly, the convenient fiction of
              a well-adjusted, consistent personality turns out to be merely a skillfully
              edited and censored version of a turbulent psyche. The first step in this
              practice of mindful awareness is radical self-acceptance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Such
              self-acceptance, however, does not operate in an ethical vacuum, where no moral
              assessment is made of one’s emotional states. The training in mindful awareness
              is part of a Buddhist path with values and goals. Emotional states are
              evaluated according to whether they increase or decrease the potential for
              suffering. If an emotion, such as hatred or envy, is judged to be destructive,
              then it is simply recognized as such. It is neither expressed through violent
              thoughts, words or deeds, nor is it suppressed or denied as incompatible with a
              “spiritual” life. In seeing it for what it is—a transient emotional state—one mindfully
              observes it follow its own nature: to arise, abide for a while, and then pass
              away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddha described his teaching as “going against the stream.” The unflinching
              light of mindful awareness reveals the extent to which we are tossed along in
              the stream of past conditioning and habit. The moment we decide to stop and
              look at what is going on (like a swimmer suddenly changing course to swim
              upstream instead of downstream), we find ourselves battered by powerful
              currents we had never even suspected—precisely because until that moment we
              were largely living at their command.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              practice of mindful awareness is a first step in the direction of inner
              freedom. Disciplining oneself to focus attention single-mindedly on the breath
              (for example) enables one to become progressively more quiet and concentrated.
              Such stillness, though, is not an end in itself. It serves as a platform from
              which to observe more dearly what is taking place within us. It allows the
              steady depth of awareness needed to understand the very origins of
              conditioning: namely, how delusion and craving are at the top of human
              suffering. Such meditative understanding is experiential rather than
              intellectual, therapeutic rather than dogmatic, liberating rather than merely
              convincing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              aim of mindful awareness is the understanding that frees one from delusion and
              craving. In Pali, such understanding is called vipassana (“penetrative
              seeing”), and it is under this name that the traditional practice of mindful
              awareness is frequently presented in the West today. Vipassana is often
              translated as “insight” and courses are offered on “insight meditation.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              usage has given rise to some confusion. It has led to the impression that some
              Buddhists practice vipassana, while others (such as practitioners of Zen or
              Tibetan Buddhism) do not. In fact, vipassana is central to all forms of
              Buddhist meditation practice. The distinctive goal of any Buddhist
              contemplative tradition is a state in which inner calm (samatha) is unified
              with insight (vipassana). Over the centuries, each tradition has developed its
              own methods for actualizing this state. And it is in these methods that the
              traditions differ, not in their end objective of unified calm and insight.</span></p>
