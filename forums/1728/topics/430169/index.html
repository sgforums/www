              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">According to one “certified” master of the official Soto Zen school (which claims Dogen as their founder):</div>
              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>The term “Lineage” refers to an unbroken chain of “masters” having received “<em>Dharma</em>-transmission”,
               going all the way back to the historic Shakyamuni Buddha. This 
              authentic lineage is said to insure that the Buddha’s original teaching (<em>Dharma</em>) is preserved and transmitted in its original.</strong></div>
              <strong> Ryofu Pussel, <span id="btAsinTitle"><em>Dharma-transmission in Dogen's Zen-buddhism</em></span></strong><br> <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">This definition generally agrees with the common understanding of the term as it is used in contemporary Zen communities.</div>
              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">As
               with most Buddhist teachings the tradition of Dharma-transmission 
              should not be hastily understood; it is one expression of truth 
              concerning the significance of the transmission <em>of</em> enlightened wisdom (<em>prajna</em>). Whenever sacred literature is reduced to biographical or historical <em>fact</em> it becomes susceptible to dogmatism and legalism. To regard such as the
               formulation of absolutes, rather than expressions of truth is to bring 
              it down to mere idolatry.</div>
              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">While
               the evidence incontrovertibly refutes the historical possibility of “an
               unbroken chain of masters” going all the way back to the historic 
              Shakyamuni Buddha, the Zen masters have never been overly concerned with
               historical facts; their business concerns the great matter of life and 
              death. Master Yuanwu (1063-1135), compiler of the classic Zen text, <em>The Blue Cliff Record</em>,
               demonstrates one example of how Zen masters handle discrepancies 
              between “matters of fact” and “expressions of truth.” Noticing just such
               a discrepancy in the first case of the <em>Blue Cliff Record</em>, Yuanwu commented:</div>
              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>According
               to tradition, Master Chih died in the year 514, while Bodhidharma came 
              to Liang in 520; since there is a seven year discrepancy, why is it said
               that the two met? This must be a mistake in the tradition. As to what 
              is recorded in tradition, I will not discuss the matter now. All that’s 
              important is to understand the gist of the matter.</strong></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">About
               a century later, Dogen came to a similar conclusion in relation to an 
              issue concerning the Zen tradition of Dharma-transmission.<span style="color: black;"> </span>Noting
               certain discrepancies among the variety of the lineage charts he saw 
              while he was in China, Dogen questioned a senior monk about it:</div>
              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: black;">The
               veteran monk Shugetsu, while he was assigned to the post of head monk 
              on Tendo, showed to Dogen a certificate of succession of Unmon’s 
              lineage… Mahakasyapa, Ananda, and so on, were aligned as if [they 
              belonged to] separate lineages. At that time, Dogen asked Head Monk 
              Shugetsu, <em>“Master, nowadays 
              there are slight differences among the five sects in their alignment [of
               names]. What is the reason? If the succession from the Western Heavens 
              has passed from rightful successor to rightful successor, how could 
              there be differences?”</em> Shugetsu said, <em>“Even
               if the dif­ference were great, we should just study that the buddhas of
               Unmon-zan mountain are like this. Why is Old Master Sakyamuni honored 
              by others? He</em></span><em> <span style="color: black;">is
               an honored one because he realized the truth. Why is Great Master Unmon
               honored by others? He is an honored one because he realized the truth.”</span></em><span style="color: black;"> Dogen, hearing these words, had a little [clearer] understanding.</span></strong></div>
              <strong> </strong><strong><em><span style="color: black;">Shobogenzo, Shisho,</span></em><span style="color: black;"> Gudo Nishijima &amp; Mike Cross</span></strong><br> <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">This
               monk’s comments were later supported by Dogen’s Chinese master and 
              finally led Dogen to accept “for the first time, the existence of 
              Buddhist patriarchs’ succession of the Dharma.”</div>
              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>My late Master, the eternal Buddha, the great Master and Abbot of Tendo, preached the following: <em>“The
               buddhas, without exception, have ex­perienced the succession of the 
              Dharma. That is to say, Sakyamuni Buddha received the Dharma from 
              Kasyapa Buddha, Kasyapa Buddha received the Dharma from Kanakamuni 
              Buddha, and Kanakamuni Buddha received the Dharma from Krakucchanda 
              Buddha. We should believe that the succes­sion has passed like this from
               buddha to buddha until the present. This is the way of learning 
              Buddhism.” </em>Then Dogen said, <em>“It
               was after Kasyapa Buddha had entered nirvana that Sakyamuni Buddha 
              first appeared in the world and realized the truth. Furthermore, how 
              could the buddhas of the Kalpa of Wisdom receive the Dharma from the 
              buddhas of the Kalpa of Resplendence? What [do you think] of this 
              principle?” </em>My late Master said, <em>“What
               you have just expressed is understanding [based on] listening to 
              theories. It is the way of [bodhisattvas at] the ten sacred stages or 
              the three clever stages. It is not the way [transmitted by] the Buddhist
               patriarchs from rightful successor to rightful successor. Our way, 
              transmitted from buddha to buddha, is not like that. We have learned 
              that Sakyamuni Buddha defi­nitely received the Dharma from Kasyapa 
              Buddha. We learn in practice that Kasyapa Buddha entered nirvana after 
              Sakyamuni Buddha succeeded to the Dharma. If Sakyamuni Buddha did not 
              receive the Dharma from Kasyapa Buddha, he might be the same as a 
              naturalistic non-Buddhist. Who then could believe in Sakyamuni Buddha? 
              Because the succession has passed like this from buddha to buddha, and 
              has arrived at the present, the individual buddhas are all authentic 
              successors, and they are neither arranged in a line nor gathered in a 
              group. We just learn that the succession passes from bud­dha to buddha 
              like this. It need not be related to the measurements of kalpas and the 
              measurements of lifetimes mentioned in the teaching of the Agamas. If we
               say that [the succession] was established solely by Sakyamuni Buddha, 
              it has existed for little over two thousand years, [so] it is not old; 
              and the successions [number] little more than forty, [so] they might be 
              called recent. This Buddhist succession is not to be studied like that. 
              We learn that Sakyamuni Buddha succeeded to the Dharma of Kasyapa 
              Buddha, and we learn that Kasyapa Buddha succeeded to the Dharma of 
              Sakyamuni Buddha. When we learn it like this, it is truly the succession
               of the Dharma of the buddhas and the patriarchs.”</em> Then Dogen not 
              only accepted, for the first time, the existence of Buddhist patriarchs’
               succession of the Dharma, but also got rid of an old nest.</strong></div>
              <strong> </strong><strong><em><span style="color: black;">Shobogenzo, Shisho,</span></em><span style="color: black;"> Gudo Nishijima &amp; Mike Cross</span></strong><br> <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">Having “got rid of an old nest” allowed Dogen to see through the “idol” (i.e. external fact) of Dharma-transmission to the <em>mythological truth</em> of the expression; such truths are never<em> “arranged in a line nor gathered in a group.”</em> In a commentary on the Dharma-transmission between Shakyamuni to Mahakasyapa, Robert Aitken Roshi wrote:</div>
              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>The
               story of the Buddha twirling a flower before his assembly, like the 
              story of the baby Buddha taking seven steps in each of the cardinal 
              directions , need not be taken literally. The first account of his 
              transmitting the Dharma to Mahakasyapa is set forth in a sutra of 
              Chinese origin that is dated A.D. 1036, fourteen hundred years after the
               Buddha’s time. This was the Sung period—a peak in the development of 
              Chinese culture when great anthologies, encyclopedias, and directories 
              were being produced. Myth, oral tradition, and sectarian justification 
              all played a role in this codification. The fable of the Buddha twirling
               a flower filled a great need for connection with the founder, and it 
              was picked up immediately and repeated like gospel. The “Four 
              Principles” attributed to Bodhidharma were also formulated during the 
              Sung period, some six hundred years after Bodhidharma’s time, using some
               of the same language attributed to the Buddha: “A special transmission 
              outside tradition—not established on words or letters.” The Sung 
              teachers were making important points with their myths.</strong></div>
              <strong> </strong><br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>During
               World War II, I asked a Catholic priest who was interned with us, “What
               if it could be proved that Jesus never lived?” He replied, “It would 
              destroy my faith.” That priest was very young at the time. I wonder what
               became of him, and what he might be saying on the subject now. 
              Something a little different, I would suppose. I too was young at the 
              time, but I felt there was something wrong with his answer. I still 
              think so. I don’t believe it is very important whether Jesus and Buddha 
              and Moses were historical figures. True religious practice is grounded 
              in the nonhistorical fact of essential nature. “The World-Honored One 
              Twirls a Flower,” “Pai-chang's Fox,” and all the other fabulous cases of
               Zen literature are your stories and mine, intimate accounts of our own 
              personal nature and experience.</strong></div>
              <strong> </strong><strong>Robert Aitken Roshi, <em>The Gateless Barrier</em></strong><br> <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">While
               the “literal” fact of formal Dharma-transmission can be used as 
              guidance for the intermediate student (e.g. a student that has come to 
              trust a teacher may find some assurance in that teacher’s sanction of 
              another), a Dharma-transmission certificate, even in a “trusted 
              lineage,” should not be regarded as guaranteeing a legitimate teacher. 
              When we do find an <em>authentic</em> teacher, we can <em>usually</em> trust their ability to recognize others who have the skills and 
              character needed to teach others. Nevertheless, we still need to check 
              it out for ourselves; after all, it is the great matter of life and 
              death.</div>
              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">In
               any case, the true significance of Dharma-transmission is not about 
              lineage charts or certificates; it is about the transmission <em>of</em> wisdom (<em>prajna</em>) <em>by</em> wisdom, <em>to</em> wisdom. In <em>Shobogenzo, Inmo</em>,
               Dogen describes the significance of transmission in the context of the 
              sixth ancestor of Zen, Huineng (Eno Daikan). After reminding us that 
              Huineng, though never exposed to the “eternal teachings” was “suddenly 
              illuminated” upon hearing a Buddhist scripture recited, Dogen goes on to
               say:</div>
              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>This is just the truth of <em>Those who have wisdom, if they hear [the Dharma]{truth}, Are able to believe and understand at once.</em> This <em>wisdom</em> is neither learned from other people nor established by oneself: wisdom
               is able to transmit wisdom, and wisdom directly searches out wisdom ...
               It is beyond coming and beyond entering: it is like the spirit of 
              spring meeting springtime, for example. Wisdom is beyond intention and 
              wisdom is beyond no intention. Wisdom is beyond consciousness and wisdom
               is beyond unconsciousness. How much less could it be related to the 
              great and the small? How much less could it be discussed in terms of 
              delusion and realization? The point is that although [the Sixth 
              Patriarch] does not even know what the Buddha Dharma {Buddhist teaching}
               is, never having heard it before and so neither longing for it nor 
              aspiring to it, when he hears the Dharma, he makes light of his debt of 
              gratitude and forgets his own body and; such things happen because the 
              body-and-mind <em>of those who have wisdom</em> is already not their own. This is the state called <em>able to believe and understand at once</em>.
               No-one knows how many rounds of life-and-death [people] spend, even 
              while possessing this wisdom, in futile dusty toil. They are like a 
              stone enveloping a jewel, the jewel not knowing that it is enveloped by a
               stone, and the stone not knowing that it is enveloping a jewel. [When] a
               human being recognizes this [jewel], a human being seizes it. This is 
              neither something that the jewel is expecting nor something that the 
              stone is awaiting: it does not require knowledge from the stone and it 
              is beyond thinking by the jewel. In other words, a human being and 
              wisdom do not know each other, but it seems that the truth is 
              unfailingly discerned by wisdom.</strong></div>
              <strong> </strong><strong><em><span style="color: black;">Shobogenzo, Inmo,</span></em><span style="color: black;"> Gudo Nishijima &amp; Mike Cross</span></strong><br> <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">Dogen’s
               words, “wisdom is able to transmit wisdom, and wisdom directly searches
               out wisdom”, are a direct expression of Dharma-transmission itself. 
              Wisdom (prajna) <em>is</em> Buddha-Dharma (Buddhist truth); wisdom <em>transmits</em> wisdom and is <em>received</em> by wisdom. Huineng heard the <em>wisdom</em> transmitted by <em>wisdom</em> (from <em>the Diamond Sutra</em>), his innate <em>wisdom</em> was “able to believe and understand at once.”</div>
              <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">The
               jewel (wisdom) has been in the rock (body-mind) all along; the “rock” 
              realizes the “jewel” has been embodied all along. “[When] a human being 
              recognizes this [jewel], a human being seizes it.” Dharma-transmission 
              is really the <em>activation</em> of inherent wisdom <em>by</em> expressed wisdom. To “grasp” the truth expressed in a sutra or a koan, 
              is to actualize the fundamental point (genjokoan). That is 
              Dharma-transmission. Thus, Dogen says, “a human being and wisdom do not 
              know each other, but it seems that the truth is unfailingly discerned by

               Buddha-Dharma cannot be known by people. For this reason, since ancient
               times, no common man has realized the Buddha-Dharma and no-one in the 
              two vehicles has mastered the Buddha-Dharma. Because it is realized only
               by buddhas, we say that <em>buddhas alone, together with buddhas, are directly able perfectly to realize it.”</em></strong></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">This is Dharma-transmission. The <em>Buddha</em>-Dharma (wisdom) is transmitted by <em>Buddha</em> (wisdom) and realized (made real) by <em>Buddha</em> (wisdom). The “common man” is the “rock” (in Dogen’s earlier analogy); 
              when the jewel is revealed, the “rock” is already a “jewel” – when the 
              Buddha-Dharma is realized, the “common man” is already “Buddha.”</div>

              <p>When Buddha gained enlightenment he realized that inside every rock there is a jewel. From that time on, the jewel can help the rock realize this fact, without having to struggle mightily like Buddha.</p>
              <p>For that it is helpful to meet an enlightened teacher face to face so the transmission can be done.</p>
              <p>I would also add that the transmission happen only when the rock is ready and have done prepatory work. Otherwise the jewel will just look like another rock.</p>

              Yup, Dharma transmission is originally not transmitted from someone to someone. It is a transmission of wisdom, of true seeing, of the traditional Right View.  If one sees the truth, then dharma transmision has occured. Transmission of the view has occured. One inherits the eye of the master or patriarch, and inherits the world. So the patriarchs and masters are not dead and gone, they are alive and share in the dharma.  So that's why we can say transmission is continuously being given. The question is do we receive it?

              Hi emanrohe, I know u are a fan of zen books... There is a book I juist started reading yesterday which I heartily recommend. Its the "flatbed sutra of louie wing" I dunno if sold in singapore bookstores but u can find it in amazon.
              
              It really covers zen and the teachings of zen masters really well and ted biringer definitely speaks from experience and authority.
