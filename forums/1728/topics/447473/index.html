              <br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If I didn't agree with the 
                      assessments of the authors I quoted I wouldn't have quoted them. But let me be 
                      crystal clear: There is no mention of a doctrine of momentariness, either 
                      explicitly or implicitly, in the suttas, and anyone who reads such a doctrine 
                      into the suttas is reading later interpretations into this strata of material. 
                      Moreover, there is nothing esoteric, mysterious, or hidden about impermanence. 
                      Your body will surely die. My body will surely die. Death could occur at any 
                      time. And mental processes are subject to even greater change, alteration, and 
                      passing away than the body. This recognition is stark and sobering. This is what 
                      is important to understand, not some pseudo theory of momentariness with all of 
                      it's conceptual proliferation.</span>

              <div><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A perception of momentariness without 
                      momentary dhammas is nonsense.</span></div>
              <div>...</div>
              <div><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As far as I'm concerned, the fundamental 
                      teachings of the PÄ�li dhamma are the <span><em>only</em></span> thing worth 
                      discussing. Period. Anything other than these fundamental teachings is 
                      unnecessary and should be cleared from the path lest it impede what is 
                      important. The recognition of unattractiveness (asubhasaññÄ�) is important. The 
                      recognition of death (maraá¹‡asaññÄ�) is important. The recognition of impermanence 
                      (aniccasaññÄ�) is important. The recognition of dispassion (virÄ�gasaññÄ�) is 
                      important. The theory of momentariness is not important. The theory of two 
                      truths is not important. And any other novel ideas that Buddhaghosa introduced 
                      to TheravÄ�da commentary are not important. Moreover, if one isn't tied to the 
                      thought-world of the Visuddhimagga, then Burmese VipassanÄ� doesn't really have 
                      much to offer that's especially interesting or important.</span></div>

              <p><br>Change and alteration of what persists do not entail the "constant 
              perishing of phenomena" or "incessant dissolution." To arrive at this 
              latter conclusion requires belief in a view of discrete dhammas subject 
              to momentary arising, subsistence, and dissolution.<br><br>Ledi SayÄ�daw, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Manual of the Excellent Man</span>:<br></p>
              <ul>
              In
               the ultimate sense, however, new psychophysical phenomena arise only 
              after the old phenomena have perished, which is death. This constant 
              perishing of phenomena is also called cessation (nirodha) or dissolution
               (bhaá¹…ga). It is only when one discerns the ultimate truth of this 
              cessation of phenomena that one gains insight. <br>
              </ul>
              <p><br>MahÄ�si SayÄ�daw, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Great Discourse on the Anattalakkhaá¹‡a Sutta</span>:<br></p>
              <ul>
              The
               yogÄ« perceives that all the nÄ�mas, rÅ«pas which manifest themselves at 
              the moment of seeing, hearing etc., are undergoing instant dissolution 
              and are, therefore, transient.... When the yogÄ« comes to the bhaá¹…ga 
              stage, during the interval of one cycle of rising and falling, numerous 
              moments of dissolution will be seen to flit by. The material body of 
              rising and falling, being subjected to incessant dissolution is indeed 
              not permanent.<br>
              </ul>
              <p><br>And one doesn't have to look too far to find this view spelled out in detail. For example, the VisuddhimaggamahÄ�á¹­Ä«kÄ�:<br></p>
              <ul>
              [Conditioned
               dhammas] individual essences (sabhÄ�va) have rise and fall and change. 
              Herein, conditioned dhammas' arising owing to causes and conditions, 
              their coming to be after non-existence, their acquisition of an 
              individual self (attalÄ�bha), is 'rise'. Their momentary cessation when 
              arisen is 'fall'. Their changedness due to aging is 'change'.<br>
              </ul>
              <p><br>So
               here we have discrete momentary dhammas acquiring individual selves, 
              then aging, then dying. In other words, the "constant perishing of 
              phenomena."</p>

              <p><br><br>Actually, according to this 
              view the mind attends to a completely new and different object each 
              moment. For example, take the mundane experience of listening 
              attentively to a song as it plays. In terms of conventional designation 
              one can describe this song as undergoing alteration and change as it 
              plays. But according to the view of radical momentariness, each moment 
              of attentive listening requires a new and different object. So instead 
              of listening to "a song" there are now how many "songs" or "sub-songs" 
              or "pieces of song"? 100 thousand?... 100 million?... 100 trillion?... 
              Is this not arbitrary? How could it not be? Ven. Sujato:<br><br>Thus
               impermanence becomes, not simply being subject to birth and death, rise
               and fall, but the momentary dissolution of phenomena – one dhamma rises
               and ceases in an instant, leaving no trace of residue in the next. 
              Samadhi becomes, not an exalted, stable coalescence of mind, but a 
              ‘momentary samadhi’ running after the fluctuations of phenomena. The 
              path becomes, not a gradual program of spiritual development, but a 
              ‘path-moment’, gone in a flash. And the mind itself becomes just a 
              series of ‘mind-moments’.... This idea seems to derive some of its 
              impressiveness from its air of acrid, pessimistic, reductionist 
              severity, which is often mistaken as a sign of really uncompromising 
              wisdom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>(a) adhering to the idea of a direct perception of momentary 
              dissolution without accepting the existence of discrete, momentary 
              dhammas is nonsensical; (b) the doctrine of momentariness is itself 
              arbitrary with no demonstrable basis; and therefore both are untenable 
              views. Ven. Sujato:<br><br>Find this hard to swallow? You might be 
              interested to know that in contemporary abhidhamma circles it is, 
              apparently, the orthodox position that the series of ‘mind-moments’ can 
              only be directly seen by Buddhas, and perhaps chief disciples. This is, 
              admittedly, challenged by some, who claim it can be seen in meditation. 
              In just the same way, a Christian meditator will claim to see God, or a 
              Hindu to see the universal Self. Seek and ye shall find. The very fact 
              that such a controversy could possibly arise is a sign how far we have 
              drifted from the Buddha’s pragmatic empiricism.</p>

               the continued present (santatipaccuppanna) finds mention in the

              <ul>
              The
               theory of impermanence in Buddhism has been generally misunderstood 
              because it came to be confused with a later theory known as the 
              'doctrine of moments' (ksanavada/ kanavada), which was formulated from a
               logical analysis of the process of change (parinama) by the later 
              Buddhist scholars belonging to the scholastic (abhidhamma) tradition. 
              But such a theory is conspicuous by its absence in the early discourses.<br>
              </ul>
              <p><br>von Rospatt, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Buddhist Doctrine of Momentariness</span>:<br></p>
              <ul>
              There
               can be no doubt that the theory of momentariness cannot be traced back 
              to the beginnings of Buddhism or even the Buddha himself. It does not 
              fit the practically orientated teachings of early Buddhism and clearly 
              bears the mark of later doctrinal elaboration. Thus in the 
              NikÄ�yas/Ä€gamas there are many passages which attribute duration to 
              material and even mental entities, whereas there is, at least to my 
              knowledge, no passage which testifies to the stance that all conditioned
               entities are momentary.... Furthermore, the fact that the theory of 
              momentariness was a controversial issue among the various schools of the
               so-called HÄ«nayÄ�na indicates that it is not canonical.<br>
              </ul>
              <p><br>Sujato, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mystique of the Abhidhamma</span>:<br></p>
              <ul>
              In
               the later abhidhamma, the treatment of time is dominated by a radical 
              new theory, totally unlike anything in the suttas or even the canonical 
              abhidhamma, the theory of moments (khaá¹‡avÄ�da).... Now it is quite 
              possible to take this theory, compare it with the suttas, and refute it 
              point by point. But here I would simply like to point out what an 
              implausible and useless idea it is.<br>
              </ul>
              <p><br>Bodhesako, <span style="font-style: italic;">Change: An Examination of Impermanence in Experience</span>:<br><br>Indeed,
               although the four NikÄ�yas occupy some 5,500 pages of print in their 
              abbreviated roman-script edition, there seems to be not a single 
              statement anywhere within them that requires us to understand thereby 
              (in opposition to the above passages) a doctrine of flux. On the 
              contrary, the Suttas are wholly consistent on this point (as on others).
               Therefore even in precisely those passages where we would most expect 
              to find such a doctrine, if it were to be found in the NikÄ�yas at all, 
              the assertion is conspicuously absent.</p>

              Without approval and without scorn, but carefully studying the sentences word by word, one should trace them in the Discourses and verify them by the Discipline. If they are neither traceable in the Discourses nor verifiable by the Discipline, one must conclude thus: 'Certainly, this is not the Blessed One's utterance; this has been misunderstood by that bhikkhu â€” or by that community, or by those elders, or by that elder.' In that way, bhikkhus, you should reject it.

              <p>Thanks for the thread, but this is very hard for me to follow. Link doesn't work as well, maybe because I don't have an account with the site. So, here are some questions that I'd love for anyone in the know to answer, because I'm beginning to doubt that I can understand english, not to mention, buddhism:</p>
              <p>1. So what exactly is this doctrine of momentariness? That everything that "exists" in every moment is something completely new? So this is... wrong?</p>
              <p>2. Article seems to be a critique of what seems to be the major Burmese "schools"? As well as the Vishudimagga, abhidhamma. So, Ledi SayÄ�daw, Mahashi Sayadaw, and the VisuddhimaggamahÄ�á¹­Ä«kÄ� are wrong?</p>
              <p>3.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>(a) adhering to the idea of a direct perception of momentary
                                      dissolution without accepting the existence of discrete, momentary
                                      dhammas is nonsensical; (b) the doctrine of momentariness is itself
                                      arbitrary with no demonstrable basis; and therefore both are
                                      untenable views. Ven. Sujato:<br><br> Find this hard to swallow? You might be interested to know that in
                                      contemporary abhidhamma circles it is, apparently, the orthodox
                                      position that the series of ‘mind-moments’ can only be directly
                                      seen by Buddhas, and perhaps chief disciples. This is, admittedly,
                                      challenged by some, who claim it can be seen in meditation. In just
                                      the same way, a Christian meditator will claim to see God, or a
                                      Hindu to see the universal Self. Seek and ye shall find. The very
                                      fact that such a controversy could possibly arise is a sign how far
                                      we have drifted from the Buddha’s pragmatic empiricism.</em></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>So what we should really be doing is just to notice the in, out and pause, no need for those kind of 10-20 notes per second kind of work that Daniel Ingram did, right? Because it seems to me doing so inevitably will cause you to end up with the whole "momentariness" problem.</p>

                      southern part, a top part, or a bottom part. Since they cannot be divided like 
                      that, they are said to be ultimate. If they could be divided into those parts, 
                      then they would not be the smallest parts.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Since these particles 
                      are small and indivisible, they cannot be destroyed. Since they cannot be 
                      destroyed, since they can not be broken down any further, these small parts are 
                      said to possess a particular energy, or power.</strong></span></p>

                      particles.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>From the point of view 
                      of consciousness, consciousness cannot be destroyed in the same way that an 
                      object can be destroyed. With consciousness, one analyses it into the 
                      consciousness that was, the consciousness that is yet to be, and the present 
                      consciousness. And with the present consciousness, one investigates it down to 
                      the subtlest moment or instant, beyond which it cannot be divided any further, 
                      and that is the ultimate truth.</strong></span></p>

                      tradition that is called the limit of time. Through one's analysis, through 
                      one's intelligence, one could say that the moment could be divided into 
                      hundreds, into thousands, into millions. Of course, that is possible. But in 
                      terms of the arising of thoughts, the thought arises in these 64 divisions of a

                      But if one analyses it, one sees that is has to go through the first flower

              <p style="line-height: 18pt;"><br> <em class="bbc">And at the end of the day, we will still be left with 
              the fact that all of these so called "things" are just imputations of 
              identity onto impermanent collections, which themselves are composed of 
              still further impermanent collections.<br> <br> So whatever clinging we have to any impermanent collection whether 
              internal or external in terms of identity is certain to lead to 
              suffering. This is the point of Madhyamaka i.e. to demonstrate that the 
              beleif that attributions of identity onto impermanent collections are 
              anything more than mere conventions is a delusion.<br> <br> Of course these conventions work, but they are no more real than the 
              habit of the "I" we attribute to our personal collection of aggregates. 
              The habit of "I" certainly works, but that "I" is not real. The 
              imputation of salt onto a given collection we have chosen to call salt 
              "works" but the "salt" can't be found apart from the imputation we make 
              onto that collection so we can use it effectively.<br> <br> The problem most laypeople have with the MMK is that people rarely are 
              acquainted with the views that MMK is seeking to correct. Without 
              understanding Abhidharma, most of the arguments in the MMK will seem 
              rather pointless if not obscure in the extreme. Some people mistakenly 
              think that MMK is a panacea -- when it fact it is rather narrow text 
              with a rather narrow project i.e. to correct Abhidharma realism and 
              bring errant Abhidharmikas back to a proper understanding of dependent 
              origination and help them to abandon a kind of naive essentialism that 
              had crept into Buddhism.<br> <br> Madhyamaka as a whole is an excercise in trying to introduce people to 
              the real meaning of dependent origination i.e. the emptiness of persons 
              and phenomena based in the Buddha's observation that statements about 
              existence and non-existence were at odds with the real meaning of 
              dependent origination.<br> <strong class="bbc"><br> Since there are no permanent phenomena, claims for the existence and 
              non-existence of phenomena are completely naive on anything other than a
               conventional level.<br> </strong><br> So you can keep insisting that salt harms snails as much as you like. 
              Since you are making a conventional statement you are not going to get 
              any complaint from me, but if you assert that there is saltiness in 
              salt, for example, you have only two courses -- mire yourself in the 
              myriad contradictions of asserting that there is an essence of salt or 
              simply accede the point that "salt" is a conventional identity 
              proposition that is at best a functional imputation and nothing more 
              than that.<br> <br> N</em></p>

But I don't establish 'momentary irreducible dharmas'... since everything is empty, there is no real arising or subsiding of anything.

              <p>As Namdrol said: <em>Molecules are made of atoms which are made of electrons and protons, etc.<br><br>By stopping at the salt molecule, you are making precisely the mistake Madhyamakas criticized Sarvastivadins for making i.e. arbitrarily stopping your analysis at a false level of irreducibility.</em></p>

              <p style="line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>What is meant by indivisible, according to Vaibhashika tradition, are the smallest, subtlest particles, which cannot be divided into, for example, a northern part, a southern part, a top part, or a bottom part. Since they cannot be divided like that, they are said to be ultimate. If they could be divided into those parts, then they would not be the smallest parts.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Since these particles are small and indivisible, they cannot be destroyed. Since they cannot be destroyed, since they can not be broken down any further, these small parts are said to possess a particular energy, or power.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>The aggregation of these small indivisible particles constitutes the coarse objects. If you take the gross object and destroy it, what is left over are the smallest indivisible particles.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>From the point of view of consciousness, consciousness cannot be destroyed in the same way that an object can be destroyed. With consciousness, one analyses it into the consciousness that was, the consciousness that is yet to be, and the present consciousness. And with the present consciousness, one investigates it down to the subtlest moment or instant, beyond which it cannot be divided any further, and that is the ultimate truth.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>This smallest moment in the Buddhist tradition is said to be the time it takes a finger to snap, divided by 64. That is what is said to be the smallest instant in time; in the Buddhist tradition that is called the limit of time. Through one's analysis, through one's intelligence, one could say that the moment could be divided into hundreds, into thousands, into millions. Of course, that is possible. But in terms of the arising of thoughts, the thought arises in these 64 divisions of a finger snap.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>If you take an arrow or a bullet and you shoot it through 100 flower petals, it seems to go through instantaneously; one cannot break down the movement through 100 flower petals. But if one analyses it, one sees that is has to go through the first flower petal before it goes through the second flower petal, and so forth.</strong></span></p>

              <p style="line-height: 18pt;">Namdrol:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt;"><br><em>And at the end of the day, we will still be left with the fact that all of these so called "things" are just imputations of identity onto impermanent collections, which themselves are composed of still further impermanent collections.<br><br>So whatever clinging we have to any impermanent collection whether internal or external in terms of identity is certain to lead to suffering. This is the point of Madhyamaka i.e. to demonstrate that the beleif that attributions of identity onto impermanent collections are anything more than mere conventions is a delusion.<br><br>Of course these conventions work, but they are no more real than the habit of the "I" we attribute to our personal collection of aggregates. The habit of "I" certainly works, but that "I" is not real. The imputation of salt onto a given collection we have chosen to call salt "works" but the "salt" can't be found apart from the imputation we make onto that collection so we can use it effectively.<br><br>The problem most laypeople have with the MMK is that people rarely are acquainted with the views that MMK is seeking to correct. Without understanding Abhidharma, most of the arguments in the MMK will seem rather pointless if not obscure in the extreme. Some people mistakenly think that MMK is a panacea -- when it fact it is rather narrow text with a rather narrow project i.e. to correct Abhidharma realism and bring errant Abhidharmikas back to a proper understanding of dependent origination and help them to abandon a kind of naive essentialism that had crept into Buddhism.<br><br>Madhyamaka as a whole is an excercise in trying to introduce people to the real meaning of dependent origination i.e. the emptiness of persons and phenomena based in the Buddha's observation that statements about existence and non-existence were at odds with the real meaning of dependent origination.<br><strong><br>Since there are no permanent phenomena, claims for the existence and non-existence of phenomena are completely naive on anything other than a conventional level.<br></strong><br>So you can keep insisting that salt harms snails as much as you like. Since you are making a conventional statement you are not going to get any complaint from me, but if you assert that there is saltiness in salt, for example, you have only two courses -- mire yourself in the myriad contradictions of asserting that there is an essence of salt or simply accede the point that "salt" is a conventional identity proposition that is at best a functional imputation and nothing more than that.<br><br>N</em></p>

Though what he has quoted are from the <span>Vaibhashika tradition, the quotes also applies to the Theravada tradition which classified all elements as real and existing in themselves albeit impermanent. Of course when combined, like our skandhas, it give rise to the notion of an ego though unreal and non-existing is grasped as the ‘I’ in the ordinary person.</span></span></span></p>

              <p>Thank you.. yes very true... I think only traditions informed by Prajnaparamita sutras or Madhyamika are free from such 'realism'.</p>
              <p>Yesterday found an e-book by a Theravada Venerable Nanananda, which Geoff calls a 'proto-Madhyamika'... seems his views is at odds with the Theravada tradition as he talks about emptiness of phenomena too (but he doesn't talk about Madhyamika, just entirely based on Pali suttas)</p>
              <p>Funny... all those suttas he quoted there seems to be what I like to quote too. lol</p>

              <p>So, the whole problem with the momentariness doctrine is that they're viewing phenomena as something that really exists, just that they are broken up into different moment huh.</p>

              <p>BTW, AEN I'm reminded of a post in your blog that seems to be something like this, http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-is-self.html. Is what Thusness describing there as self1 self2 etc, really just skillful means to view the self then?</p>

              <p>Hi Nick,
              I have not finished reading your interesting article, but on the outset I would say that I don't really concentrate or focus with the intention to trigger a special state. There is just a passive attention to what is, the seen, the heard, the sensed, the tasted, the smelled and the cognized, seeing how they interact with each other, seeing how they created the illusion of a self, seeing how they create the illusion of a body in a world of solid objects. Soon, it turns into pure shikantaza, allowing everything to be as it is.
              If we compare this to watching a movie, it would not be concentrating on the flickering of the images at high speed (like Daniel Ingram's vipassana), but only paying attention (more like Kenneth's direct mode and/or 3rd gear) to the sound track, the flow of images and the interaction between the two. Effortlessly, the apparent reality of the movie gives way to what it is really, namely images in motion coordinated with sounds and voices.</p>
