My head was supporting Mount Sumeru4, but I didn't feel its weight.<br><br>"In the third dream, I saw the sangha putting on Buddhist robes, but not following the Buddha's teachings.<br><br>"In the fourth dream, the monastic order did not wear Buddhist robes, and they faltered among the thorns and difficulties of the world.<br><br>"In the fifth dream, there were a lot of wild pigs rooting at the base of a huge, lush candana tree.5<br><br>"In the sixth dream, young elephants trampled green grass and polluted the river while ignoring warnings from the large elephants. The large elephants could only go away to a place with clear water and green grass. The young elephants later starved to death because there was no grass to eat and they could not drink the water from the river.<br><br>"In the seventh dream, a lion died, but other carnivorous animals did not dare to approach to eat the flesh. Instead, worms came out of the lion's body and ate its flesh.<br><br>"Why would I have these strange dreams?"<br><br>Then the Buddha replied with concern in his eyes. "Ananda, let me explain them to you. In the first dream, you saw the fire burning up the rivers and the oceans. This indicates that in the future, monks and nuns will betray my teachings and start disagreements within the sangha.<br><br>"In the second dream, your head supported Mount Sumeru. This means that in ninety days I will pass away. All the monks, heavenly beings and human beings will need your help to remember and pass down my teachings.<br><br>"In the third dream, you saw monks and nuns putting on the robes but not following my teachings. This means that after I pass away, the sangha will give lectures on my teachings to large gatherings of people, but the sangha itself will not follow my teachings.<br><br>"You saw monks not wearing the robes, lingering among the thorns. This shows that in the future there will be monks not wearing the robes but commoners' clothes. They will abandon the precepts and adopt commoners' lives, and they will also have wives and children.<br><br>"You saw wild pigs rooting at the candana tree. The sangha in the future will not promote my teachings, but will only look after their own livelihood by selling statues of buddhas and holding various services for commoners.<br><br>"Sixth, you saw young elephants not listening to the adult elephants and later dying from starvation. This means that in the future, new monks and nuns will not listen to the teachings of the elder monks, and they will fall into purgatory after death.<br><br>"Seventh, you saw worms eating the lion's flesh. It indicates that no other religions will destroy my teaching, but the monastic order itself will be destroyed from within.<br><br>"Ananda, what you dreamt last night is the future of Buddhism," the Buddha said sadly.</blockquote></div>

Enlightened meaning having at least had a glimpse of the nature of reality/emptiness and recognised that... but they still have to practise to attain complete and perfect Buddhahood. The Buddha is still the "highest", and the Bodhisattva is on his path towards Buddhahood.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/5vehicles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/5vehicles.htm</a><br><br>The Five Vehicles of Buddhism are:<br><br>Humanity Vehicle Buddhism, or translated phonetically from Mandarin, Jen Chen Buddhism: Themain objectives of Jen Chen Buddhism are to purify the human mind and to promote a blissful culture for humanity, so that we may realize a happy and blissful family, and pure land in this world.<br><br>Deva Vehicle Buddhism: The doctrines expounded to the Devas or celestial beings.<br><br>Small Vehicle Buddhism, Sravaka, or Hinayana Buddhism: The doctrines for those who cultivate for the sake of personal liberation and aspiration for personal salvation.

Human realm is the most suitable realm to attain Buddhahood. All Buddhas attain Buddhahood in human realm, not in the other 5 realms. It also shows that every single one of us is able to attain Buddhahood. Celestial realms are too enjoyable/pleasurable, hell/lower realms have too much sufferings, human realm is just nice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> However having attained awakening, the Buddha transcends all realms. He remains in this world for the purpose of saving sentient beings.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">85.

This triple world is as dreadful as that house, overwhelmed with a number of evils, entirely inflamed on every side by a hundred different sorts of birth, old age, and disease.<br><br>87.
