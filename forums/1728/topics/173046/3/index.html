All the Maha Bodhisattvas exhibit different qualities and characters that Mahayana practitioners must learn. For example the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (Guan Yin) represents Great Compassion. Manjusri represents Wisdom. Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva represent Great Vows.

All Buddhas teaches one to attain enlightenment and liberation. Maitreya Buddha will also teach the 4 noble truths and the 8 fold path to enlightenment.<br><br>Vajrayana Buddhism is the esoteric form of Buddhism. Maitreya Buddha sees that it is unsuitable to teach the Vajrayana teachings to sentient beings at that time.</div>
