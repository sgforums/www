              <p><strong>Scenerio 1:</strong> Someone come into sgf and say they are into certain activities and is seeking like-minded people to do meritorious act. However this person only got 1 post overall in his/her account. (Potential scam underlying).</p>
              <p><strong>Scenerio 2:</strong> The person claim that he/she does not want to handle $$. However in later stage tell you certain<strong> XXX</strong> company may not accept individual payment and ask you to bank transfer instead. (Potential scam underlying).</p>
              <p><strong>Scenerio 3:</strong> The person can send you receipts. But can you really see the end product? As in did the the meritorious act really take place??? Think about it.........(Potential scam underlying). </p>
              <p>Dear all, rather than transfering $$ to a unknown person. Why don't we spend the $$ on old people selling tissue paper? Or just give the $$ to the poor. You know, do good deeds personally and out of true compassion.  Coz nowadays you really can't count on claims and promises like the above scenerios.</p>

(I provided the printer's website and contacts)<br><br>2) Due to printing 18 pieces, the printer indeed might not be able to track one by one and thus I have kept a clear and open account on people whom transfer the amount to me and to verify with the printer.<br><br>3) The receipts are from the printer itself, anyone is free to check with the printers if the reciept reflects the truth.  The end product can of cause be been by the sponsors itself if they want to at the printer's office. (I do not issue a reciept)<br><br>As Buddhists, it is no doubt that the Kalama spirit to be upholded but without careful analysis &amp; understanding and when one start pointing fingers and calling your fellow Dharma friends scammer and ugly names, this is aganist the four requirements of the Bodhisattva path practicioners of Kind Speech. <br><br>There is always room for doubts in Buddhism but not for accusations, esp towards own community of brothers and sisters. Words should be said with dignity and careful findings and not based on personal feelings, esp when words which may cause harm towards others.<br><br>I think it is equally meritrious if one spends the money on needy tissue woman on the streets (if he/she is really poor) we won't know if these tissue man/ woman or beggers are sometimes richer than normal people in the disguise of being poor and old. So to cast the doubt, I would buy them a meal instead of giving them a mere two dollars.<br><br>This is perfectly the reason why I did not make monetary donations to these Venerables but instead I offer them in kind on their personal requistes.<br><br>Once again, I urge you to disclose fully the emails btw me and you to prove your doubts right and for the benefit of the forummers here.<br><br>May you be well &amp; happy <br><br><br>Namo @mituofo<br>Goh</p></div>

              <p> You went to the extent of searching my past comments huh... doesn't affect me.</p>
              <p>Where did I state a ugly name??  I just warn people of scammers. I didn't even say is you but you come here and flood me with so much text and quotes. I already say <strong>I am just saying it</strong>.( you understand a not?)</p>
              <p>A really keen practitioner will not mind my so called by you "harsh" speech.</p>
              <p>You cannot accept people's opinion. How very harsh am I ? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>A underage teen wanted to smoke, so as a teen I use a teen's word to shoot back. Do you really think people will give a damn about what I said to this potential smoker?? Joking around with people of my age also wrong? What makes you think I am a saint? You suppose everyone should be?</p>
              <p>Do you want to check how many forummers participate in Buddhism topic goes around other threads and slander, make fun, joke around...etc??? Do you also want to go and correct their acts?? Huh huh??</p>
              <p>Because I post a topic that caught your attention. Thats why.</p>
              <p>You must know there so many kinds of people in forum, if there are 100 people here agree with my opinion how? Huh?? Don't need to flood me with Buddha's teaching.</p>
              <p>everyone deep down will have doubts.  And this is a forum, people just will state their opinion about stuff like this. Get over it.</p>
              <p>Its a 50/50 chance that there are scammers around. So what if the 50/50 chance came out right? If it came out not then its æ¸…è€…è‡ªæ¸…ã€‚</p>
              <p>What is there so hard to swallow?? I guess this is human nature. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, I indeed search for your post but what wrong with that?<br><br>As in the beginning of the reply, I have assumed that you might be implying me and of cause you can choose to deny but ultimately only you know who you are pointing to, you do not owe me an answer. =)<br><br>Personally, I do not mind harsh speeches aganist me but should such harsh speeches be condoned, it will affect others whom are particiapating in this merit making project and morever, as a fellow Buddhist, we should remind each other of our own faults and not be a self righteous bigot, this is one of the qualities that the Buddha taught of being a mitra to another. <br><br>Also by cursing an underage teen whom wants to smoke quoting you "<strong>Go to hell please. I wish you get cancer and die before 20 years old."</strong> is this the right thing that a Buddhist should speak? The Buddha had always taught us to use kind and gentle speech and even at the extend when the Buddha heavily reprimanded Bikkhus for breaking the vinayas, the Buddha nor his disciples never made words like "wishing you go to hell, cancer and die" , contary to that, as a Buddhist, we should emulate the Buddha as an example by guiding these people on the wrong path using love, care and concern and if further being rejected, we should step off and wish him well and happy. <br><br>I am no checking on others since you are the one whom replied to this scam post and which does not involves others. Yes, you posted the topic and caught mu attention, this is no doubt.<br><br>Also as a civillised person, I accept and respect the differing opinons of the various forummers here but that does not mean we should condone malicuious words which are untrue and should prove it with careful analysis and investigations like the Buddha whom taught in the Kalama Sutta. <br><br>Also, I hope that you respect the Dharma as your source of refuge and guidance and not say "flood" you with the Dharma, the Dharma itself is meant for all sentient beings like ourselves, infact the Buddha taught us to be mindful of the Dhamma every moment and let the Dhamma mindful to others. But again, if you choose to think that the Dharma is something for you to mock around with or not your source of guidance, I respect your views and can only wish you well and happy. <br><br>As i have invited you to fully paste all the email postings between you and me to prove yourself right, this invitation is done in the spirit of openness for myself and all forummers reading it. Even as a cyber forummer, we do have our responsibilities and dignity and is not about "forget and get over with it" , if such actions were to be condoned, the world will be filled with accusations and names calling. <br><br>Also as i said, I truly agree that there are lots of scammers and false money cheaters around in this cyberspace, one should always be doubtful and careful when it comes to monetary issues. For this i truly believe you arose from a good intention, no doubts for that. But what you are lack of is the spirit of investigation and careful analysis and sensitiveness before posting this topic, when in doubt, we should always investiage and verify before passing any comments.<br><br>There is nothing hard to swallow for myself but something to be done to untrue comments which might affect others at large. May we all learn to contemplate of the dharma and bring wisdom to our lives.<br><br>May you be safeguarded by the Triple Gems!<br><br><br>Metta Karuna,<br>Goh<br></p></div>
