              <p>Old Master Chin Kung did not believe in Pureland method for 20 over years. He studied a lot. Until he studied thoroughly the Avatamsaka Sutra, He was shock to find so many bodhisattva/mahasattvas all want to be born in western pureland of Amitabha. Even Shurangama Sutra, Lotus sutra relates to Amitabha pureland. Indeed Amitabha Sutra mentioned that this method is difficult to believe.</p>
              <p>Note: Amitabha pureland is a very young pureland, considering it was only created 10 kaplas ago.</p>

              <p>Grand Shantao: "The primary most important reason why Buddha was here, was to expound the Primal Vow of Amitabha." it come to a point when u realise that the rest is just expedient dharma; Skill in means.</p>
              <p>i think one factor which work for purelanders is the factor of modesty. one final main hinderance of Dharma practice is egoism. there's not a point where when one study a lot, they become proud of how much they know about Dharma. the ego mind tend to compete with other.</p>

              </blockquote>this is also amazing. Buddha-elect (Ekajatipratibuddhas)! i.e. State like Arya Avalokiteshvara Guan Yin Bodhisattva and Majushiri Bodhisattva. i.e. the last final stage of Bodhisattvahood! next time they will be Buddhahood. sort of like a "Non-returner", but in Mahayana way. :) /\</dl>
