              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: medium;">III. The Third  
              Characteristic: Sunyata</span></p>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Ordinarily, 
              people do not understand the concept of sunyata (emptiness). They generally think that 
              sunyata means nothingness. This is a misconception. We have already mentioned the 
              phenomenon of Conditioned Genesis, in which all dharmas arise from causes and conditions 
              and they cease because of causes and conditions. All dharmas come into being because of 
              the coming together of the right causes and conditions; they cease due to the 
              disintegration of the causes and conditions that were responsible for their formation. 
              Therefore the nature of all dharmas is emptiness. That is, dharmas do not have any true 
              self-nature, so they are described as "empty."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Commonly people 
              limit their understanding of sunyata to mean "absolute nothingness,"</span><span style="color: #800000; font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">yet 
              consider existence real. According to the Buddhist teachings, existence</span><span style="color: #800000; font-size: small;">—</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">arising 
              due to Conditioned Genesis</span><span style="color: #800000; font-size: small;">—</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">is illusory yet does not preclude 
              emptiness. Similarly, Sunyata</span><span style="color: #800000; font-size: small;">—</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">the nature of all existence is 
              fundamentally empty</span><span style="color: #800000; font-size: small;">—</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">means nonsubstantiality but does not 
              preclude existence. This is the concept of Conditioned Genesis with nature of emptiness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">I would like to  
              explain sunyata as follows:</span></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">A.  
              The four great elements are fundamentally empty; the five aggregates do not have true  
              existence.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata is the 
              infinite meaning of Mahayana Buddhism. It is not "absolute nothingness."</span><span style="color: #800000; font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">It 
              is a constructive and revolutionary concept. It is used by the Mahayanists to explain the 
              existence of this world and universe. "The four great elements are fundamentally 
              empty; the five aggregates do not have true existence"</span><span style="color: #800000; font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">is how the 
              Buddha explained of the nature of all events and phenomena of this world and universe 
              after he attained enlightenment. All dharmas exist due to the coming together of the four 
              great elements. What are the four great elements? They are earth, water, fire, and wind. 
              Earth has the property of solidity, water has the property of humidity, fire has the 
              property of heat, and wind has the property of mobility. Why do we say that the four 
              elements of earth, water, fire, and wind are great? Because everything in this world and 
              universe is formed by these four elements. For example, a cup is made by firing clay that 
              is constructed in the shape of a cup. Clay belongs to the earth element. Water is added to 
              the clay in order to shape the clay into a cup. The cup is then fired. After being fired, 
              the cup is cooled and dried by the wind. So, all four great elements are involved in the 
              formation of this cup.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Similarly, a 
              human being is also formed by the unity of the four great elements. For example, our skin, 
              hair, nails, teeth, bones, and flesh all belong to the earth element. Our blood, saliva, 
              and urine belong to the liquid element. Our body heat belongs to the fire element, and our 
              breathing and movement belong to the wind element. Thus, if any one of these four great 
              elements is out of balance, we will become ill. If these four great elements disintegrate, 
              we will no longer exist.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">From these 
              examples, we therefore can see that the physical body is formed by the combination of the 
              four great elements. Furthermore, the mind, or the consciousness according to our usual 
              understanding, is only a combination of the five aggregates</span><span style="color: #800000; font-size: small;">—</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">rupa 
              (form), vedana (feeling), samjna (perception), samskara (mental formation), and vijnana 
              (consciousness). Life is the result of the combination of causes and conditions, without a 
              true independent self-nature; a physical body with consciousness is only an existence due 
              to a combination of factors. When the uniting force of these causes and conditions is 
              exhausted, the previously formed combination of these factors dissolves, and the living 
              being will no longer exist. Where then is the separate true self? Therefore, the Buddha 
              teaches thus, "The four great elements are fundamentally empty; the five aggregates 
              do not have true existence."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Once, Tung-p'o Su 
              of the Sung Dynasty went to visit Ch'an Master Fo Yin. When Tung-p'o Su arrived, Ch'an 
              Master Fo Yin was teaching the Dharma. When the Ch'an Master saw Tung-p'o Su, he said to 
              him, "Mr. Su, where did you just come from? We do not have a place for you to 
              sit."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Tung-p'o Su 
              replied immediately, "Master, if there is no seat, why don't you lend me your four 
              great elements and five aggregates (your body) to use as my meditation seat?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Ch'an Master Fo 
              Yin said, "I have a question for you. If you can give me a satisfactory answer, I 
              will let you use me as your seat. If you cannot give me an answer, then please leave your 
              jade belt behind as a souvenir. Here is my question: my four great elements are all empty 
              and my five aggregates do not have true existence. May I ask where you are going to 
              sit?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Tung-p'o Su could 
              not give him an answer. So he took off his jade belt, which had been presented to him by 
              the emperor, and left.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">From this story  
              we can see that the human body, an illusive combination of the four great elements and  
              five aggregates, does not have any true substantial essence for us to attain.</span></p>
              <p><em><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">B.  
              What is sunyata? </span></strong></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">In the Mahayana 
              teaching, the word "sunyata"</span><span style="color: #800000; font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">integrates the Three Dharma Seals. Sunyata 
              is the Ultimate Truth. It is an important concept in Buddhism and a special characteristic 
              of Buddhism that distinguishes it from other worldly teachings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Most people do 
              not understand what sunyata means. They think it means complete nullity and nothingness. 
              This is just not so. Sunyata is, in fact, a most profound and wonderful philosophy. If one 
              can truly understand sunyata, one can understand the whole of Buddhism. What, then, is 
              sunyata? It is simply not possible to explain the meaning of sunyata in just one sentence. 
              The<em> Treatise That Explains Mahayana </em>gives ten definitions of sunyata. Although 
              these definitions cannot thoroughly explain the true meaning of sunyata, they are very 
              close.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">The ten 
              definitions of sunyata, as explained in this treatise, are as follows:</span></p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata has the meaning of 
                  non-obstruction. Like space, it can be found everywhere and will not obstruct any material 
                  existence.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata has the meaning of 
                  all-pervasiveness. Like space, it is pervasive and reaches everywhere.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata has the meaning of 
                  equality. Like space, it does not make any distinctions but treats all equally.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata has the meaning of 
                  vastness. Like space, it is vast, limitless, and boundless.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata has the meaning of 
                  formlessness. Like space, it has no shape or form.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata has the meaning of purity. 
                  Like space, it is always pure.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata has the meaning of 
                  motionlessness. Like space, it is always still, completely beyond any form of arising and 
                  decaying.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata has the meaning of 
                  absolute negation. It negates all facts and theories.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata has the meaning of 
                  emptying sunyata itself. It negates all concepts of independent self-nature and also 
                  destroys all attachment to the concept of sunyata.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata has the meaning of 
                  unattainability. Like space, it cannot be attained or held.</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Although these  
              ten definitions cannot entirely describe the truth of sunyata, nevertheless, together they  
              provide us with a vivid depiction for better understanding of this important Buddhist  
              teaching.</span></p>
              <p><em><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">C.  
              How can sunyata be perceived?</span></strong></em></p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata can be perceived through 
                  the illusive nature of continuation. All existence is empty because all phenomena are 
                  impermanent. Just like on the Yangtze River, the waves from behind push the waves in 
                  front; a new generation replaces an older generation. Time continues without interruption, 
                  and worldly events are always of suffering, emptiness, and impermanence. Through the 
                  continuation of impermanence, we can see emptiness.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata can be perceived through 
                  the illusive nature of cycles. All dharmas of the universe are governed by the Law of 
                  Cause and Effect. A cause will become an effect, which in turn will become a cause. For 
                  example, when the appropriate amount of sunlight, air, water, and soil are present, a seed 
                  will germinate, bloom, and produce fruit. The seed is the cause, the fruit is the effect. 
                  When the necessary external conditions are present, the seeds from the fruit will 
                  germinate, bloom, and produce more fruit. In this case, the fruit, which was the effect, 
                  has become the cause. Through this continuous cycle wherein cause becomes effect and 
                  effect becomes cause, we can see sunyata.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata can be perceived through 
                  the illusive nature of combinations. All dharmas arise due to the harmonious unity of 
                  various causes and conditions. For example, the human body is made up of the harmonious 
                  unity of skin, flesh, bones, blood, and various bodily fluids. If the human body is 
                  separated into these components, there will no longer be such existence as an independent 
                  human body. Thus, we can understand sunyata through Conditioned Genesis.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata can be perceived through 
                  the illusive nature of relativity. All dharmas of this universe are relative, such as 
                  father versus son and teacher versus student. For example, when a son gets married and has 
                  a son, he himself becomes a father. Likewise, a student who learns enough can then become 
                  a teacher. Thus, all things are relative and therefore are unreal and empty.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata can be perceived through 
                  the illusive nature of appearance. There is no set standard or measure for how we view 
                  appearance. For example, light from a candle may appear bright to our eyes, but when an 
                  electric lamp is switched on, the candlelight now seems dim. Further, the speed of an 
                  automobile may seem fast to us until it is compared to the speed of an airplane. These 
                  examples allow us to realize that the appearance of all events and all phenomena are 
                  viewed by us without a set standard; we can therefore realize sunyata.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata can be perceived through 
                  the illusive nature of terms. Each dharma in this universe is called by a different name. 
                  These names are nonsubstantial in nature and thus empty. For example, a female baby is 
                  called a baby girl. When she is grown up, she is referred to as Miss. When she gets 
                  married, she will be addressed as Mrs. When she has her own children, they will call her 
                  "mother."</span><span style="color: #800000; font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">When she is old and has grandchildren, she 
                  is then known as a grandmother. From a baby girl to grandmother, she is still the same 
                  person, yet her titles are different. Thus, we can understand sunyata through the 
                  illusiveness of terms.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-size: small;">Sunyata can be perceived through  
                  the illusive nature of different viewpoints. Different people with different states of  
                  mind will have differing views on the same thing or event. For example, on a snowy night,  
                  a poet sitting in front of the window inside a warm and cozy house hopes that the snow  
                  will continue through the night, so that he can enjoy more beautiful scenery. But, a  
                  beggar shivering in the cold hopes that the snow will stop soon; otherwise, he will not be  
                  able to make it through the night. Thus, we can understand sunyata through different  
                  viewpoints.</span></li>
