Hoping it can lend you some perspectives.<br><br>How do you know Buddha &amp; Christ exist?<br><br>Historically, it is undeniable that the two figures existed. Historical Shakyamuni Buddha, previously Prince Siddhartha. &amp; Jesus Christ. Both are historical figures, well recorded &amp; undisputed.<br><br>So does knowing that increase your faith in the religions?<br><br>Probably not, because your faith wouldn't simply be based on whether their founders ever existed. What would matter more to you, is probably are teachings/doctrines true? Are the teachings useful for you?<br><br>That's when you need to study the teachings from the various religions to understand what are they trying to teach and point to. And then verify their teachings and apply to see if they are useful.<br><br>Since this is Buddhism Forum, I'll discuss about Buddhism.<br><br>A good question you might want to ask yourself - Are you happy? Are you satisfied? Yes, there are times when you are happy, but are you able to ensure that you're always happy? If you are super duper rich, will you be always happy? When you strike 4D first prize, will you be forever happy? Are you able to ensure that your loved ones are always happy? Even if you give the best things, buy the biggest house for your parents and stay by their side always, will they be always happy? Even with the best medicine and technology, can you ensure your loved ones will never fall ill, never die?<br><br>Because if the answer is 'no', then that's where Buddhism comes in. Prince Siddhartha left the palace because he saw the fundamental "dissatisfactoriness" in life, he saw that there was no way to bring about true happiness to himself and his loved ones. He wanted to find the way out of such "dissatisfactoriness".<br><br>So Prince Siddhartha went in search of the answer - and he found it! We call that Enlightenment. And he left a whole legacy of teachings that help people achieve that too.<br><br>My suggestion to you would be....it's okay to feel doubtful. Clarifying doubt is the first step towards developing understanding and insight.<br><br>There are plenty of resources if you're interested to find out more about the Buddhist teachings and how it can help you and your loved ones.<br><br>You could download this PDF file on "What Buddhists Believe" It is written in a very simple and clear manner, addressing common questions people have about Buddhism.

But can we be sure that the 'way' that is being pass down since thousands years ago did not stray from the correct way? Assume it is in the correct path.. I dont understand that fact since budda or other religious figure pass their teaching down, and y is it that hteir follow is still one step below them and not able to attain the 'Buddhahood' still in the level or arahat?<br><br>If we follow christ teaching? y is that we are not able to reach christ lvl as a 'god'?<br><br>If we follow the teaching of hindu?

Then wad will happen to the 'outgoing' buddha? Continue with his cycle? To come back to earth and go thru another enlightenment? people practise buddhism is to hope to have enuf merit to break this cycle of life and attain enternal enlightenment.. Isnt that a waste of time if even after attaining enlightening and u will have to go thru the cycle again?<br><br>Again, i apologise if i made any unintentional offensive remark..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like Wanderer already gave you a very good reply.. I'll just add what I feel like saying.... knowing there are probably others who can give better replies.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by oldbandit:<br>I do not know if it is right for me to postit here. If there is any offence taken, my sincere apology..</blockquote>Don't worry, this forum is very open and we do not easily take offence at any posts especially when the intention is good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> We do not often reject topics... which is why you'll see that in my forum there are hardly any topics that are closed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>My whole family are buddist, i was a buddist..

I do not know y, but just maybe i could not figure something out.</blockquote>I think Wanderer already replied this part very well... that it might be time to re-look into our old beliefs to gain new perspectives and insights... to really find out what Buddhism is all about? Is it just a matter of praying to Buddha, wearing pendants, or even just having faith? How can Buddhism really help us and how we can benefit from practising Buddhism? By the way pendants are just a culture of Thai Buddhism, it's not the essential thing in Thai Buddhism or Buddhism, nor the teaching of the Buddha... such things are only things added to Buddhism due to cultural influences along times as Buddhism spread to different places from India.. so whether you wear the pendant is not a very crucial issue. The essential thing in Thai Buddhism, or any other traditions of Buddhism, is the dharma, the truths, the teachings of the Buddha.<br><br><blockquote>We are now living in a world and we only know abt the past from history..<br><br>How sure can we be that buddha did exist?<br><br>How sure can we be there is christ?<br><br>How sure can we be that those hidus gods exist?</blockquote>Again as Wanderer said, Buddha and Jesus are both <strong>real people who lived on Earth</strong> 2000+ years ago, with historical proof backing their existence, and marks of their existence found all over the ancient civilisations till this day. Just like the ancient emperors of China, like Emperor Qin, etc, you cannot doubt that they existed 2000+ years ago. They are certainly not mythical beings or some tales. Another thing I want to state is that... Buddha is not a god. Buddha looks as ordinary as us (although he looks very magnificant with 32 major marks and 80 minor marks of a Buddha)... but he is in another sense extraordinary, even higher than gods, and the gods took him as their Teacher (because those gods themselves are not liberated from the sufferings of samsara and the cycle of rebirth). But the point of his teaching is that everyone of us has Buddha Nature that is already wholly complete just yet discovered, if he can get enlightened, so can we, if he can find liberation from sufferings and the highest lasting bliss of Nirvana, so can we. He does not ask people to worship him, but shows us the possibility for each of us to gain complete bliss, liberation, enlightenment.<br><br>If you read the story of Buddha, you would know that the Buddha was once a prince living in royalty, was going to become the King, he was married to a very beautiful wife and even had a child (who later renounced and attain enlightenment too), however he found that all of that was ultimately unsatisfactory... that with the best of his ability, he cannot save everyone from the sufferings of life -- birth, ageing, sickness, death, and the 8 distresses, and more of all from the fundamental suffering caused by dualistic ignorance/illusions. Therefore, by being a king, or a ruler of the world, he would still not bring his people lasting happiness and end of sufferings.. that what he could do as a king is really limited. So he renounced his worldly life, and attained the realisation of the truth that leads to complete ending of sufferings, the key to liberation from birth and death, to the attainment of the highest bliss of nirvana... And this is the only way that can truly bring people lasting bliss and liberation from all sufferings. In his lifetime alone, thousands of his followers attained enlightened and complete liberation from samsara and samsaric sufferings through practising the Dharma teachings.. there continue to be many enlightened people even today.<br><br><blockquote>I mean i used to believe in them in a sense i offer my respect. Wadever religion i make it a point to show my respect by not saying bad things so is now. But just that now, i lost the faith, i m not saying they are fake, juz that i cant convince myself that they do exist before. Is there any advise i can get from here to be sure of myself before i really go bonkers thinking of this.</blockquote>In Buddhism, faith is not just by blind following or belief. We have to practise the dharma and see ourselves... through practising the dharma, we will gain confidence in the teachings because we will see how it truly helps in our lives... and eventually we will attain Enlightenment! Lot's of people have attained enlightenment, almost countless in fact since the time Buddha taught the dharma... Even today there are a lot of enlightened people.. whether they are teachers or just practitioners of the dharma. Even in this forum, there is quite a number of people who are already enlightened to the ultimate nature of reality, to the truths that the Buddha taught... and they are just common practitioners of the dharma, not some great masters or reincarnated teachers. And of course when you are enlightened, you will certainly have no doubts about what the Buddha taught because you have truly seen them yourselves! It is truly possible... although I am just a beginner (started learning about buddhism about 4 years ago, currently just turned 17, so still quite a novice) and I'm not enlightened yet. But the thing is this... Once you have a taste of how practicing dharma results in, you will never be able to resist the path, you can't forget it, you can't discard it. There is a natural compulsion to continue practicing all the way to enlightenment.<br><br>Learn and practise the dharma, one day you will awaken to your Buddha Nature and ascertain what the Buddha said is true... and that this Buddha Nature is really one with all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the 10 directions and 3 periods (past, present, future). And what is the Buddha? Is the Buddha just an appearance, an image, or the statue you see in temples? Is he just someone who appeared 2500 years ago and passed away at 80 years old? Please see my next reply on this topic <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>By the way, like a scientist, the Buddha encouraged the Buddhist practitioners to find out for themselves the truths that the Buddha said, to put it to test, and to see for ourselves, and to get enlightened. Buddhism does not encourage any blind belief and dogmas (see Kalama Sutra), and also encourages analytical questioning -- whether this teaching actually helps us.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Kalama Sutra</strong><br><br>"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the<br>spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not believe in anything simply because you<br>have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do<br>not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything because it is<br>written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and<br>elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is<br>conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."<br><br>- the Buddha<br><br>Note: this is just a summary, please read the entire sutra here: <a href="http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/resources/kalama_sutra.html" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/resources/kalama_sutra.html</a></blockquote></div>

It is only when we have attained a certain advanced level in the learning and practising of Buddhism that we will be able to understand the profound meaning of these verses. If you were to tell a person who has just started to learn Buddhism that learning Buddhism is like these verses, then he would find them too profound. He would not be able to make out what Buddha is like. Of course, he knows what human beings are like and quite naturally he will assume that only those who are similar in form to human beings are Buddhas. We can say that this is correct, but we can also say that this is wrong. For example, kindergarten teachers may use drawings of an old man and old woman when teaching the young children about grandfathers and grandmothers. Thereafter, when the children see other old folks in such resemblance they know that they are someone elseÂ’s grandparents. But, to university students it would be inappropriate for professors to use the same approach when talking about such blood relationships.<br><br>It is the same in learning Buddhism. When we encourage a new student of Buddhism to pay respect to the Buddha in the temple or monastery, he will not be frightened when he sees that the Buddha is the same as a human being. At the same time, when he sees that the Buddha and Bodhisattva images are so dignified and compassionate, it will give rise to a feeling of joy and reverence and lead him to learn Buddhism.<br><br>Often we come across people who have been learning Buddhism for a long time saying that they saw this Buddha or that Bodhisattva in their dreams. Initially, when we do not know about their level of understanding of Buddhism, we may praise them by saying, Â“Oh! You have such good affinity with Buddha and Bodhisattva that you can even see their images!Â” But it is wrong if we always praise them like this. If they report dreams like this for more then 3 times, you have to tell them, Â“The Mara is here, you have seen the Mara! All the Zen masters advise to obliterate the Buddha when the Buddha appears, and obliterate the Mara when the Mara appears [1].Â” We cannot praise them any more because they have already developed an attachment to forms.<br><br>In the same way, when we are dealing with people who are already advanced in Buddhism, we should use the method of the Diamond Sutra rather than the kindergarten method:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“He who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in sounds is on a heterodox path and cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).Â”<br>Â“All forms are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata.Â”</span><br><br>At this level, people will realize that Buddhism is the only religion that eradicates superstition and attachment to all forms.<br><br>Critics often say that the Buddha image is an idol. They criticize that Buddhism worships idols. In reality, the cross, the Jesus Christ image and Mother Mary, they are also idols. In this sense, is there a religion that does not worship idols? Therefore, we cannot say that Buddhism is the only religion that worships idols. The fact is that only Buddhism does not worship idols. The Diamond Sutra states, Â“All forms are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata.Â”!<br><br>The essence of the Buddha, the Buddha Nature is omnipresent in the space of the Dharma realm, and the Dharma Nature is omnipresent in the space.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>1. To ignore and not to be attached to such forms;.

After all Shakyamuni Buddha was not the only Buddha! He said he is not the first nor will he be the last. There were countless Buddhas before him and to appear in the future. Enlightened people exists. Of course that includes today... in fact there continue to be a large number practitioners who have become enlightened to the truth. But relatively speaking nowadays, it seems that there are less people interested in Buddhism due to lack of knowledge of what is the the right dharma teachings in the first place, and many people are very attached to material life and many things... Due to this, and due to the generally inferior karmic roots that sentient beings have in the dharma ending age, there are less enlightened people around than before. But if we have confidence (that Buddha can lead us to enlightenment) and practise the teachings of the Buddha, we can certainly attain liberation, nirvana, etc. Like I mentioned just now even in this forum, there are quite a number of people who are enlightened... and I'm not kidding.. serious <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I think I will not name them unnecessarily in the public forum. And yes, there are Arhants and Bodhisattvas even in modern days. It's truly possible.<br><br>By the way I'm not sure if you're asking... why is there no Buddhas today, but only Bodhisattvas and Arhats? The reason is quite simple... there are Arhats and Bodhisattvas today that have attained complete liberation and enlightenment, the wisdom/insight of the ultimate truth of reality, the highest bliss of nirvana, the 6 supernatural powers, and various sorts of attainments. But they have not attained Buddhahood. Because Buddhahood is not a matter that can be accomplished within one lifetime. It will take many many lifetimes of practise... and the perfection of the 10 Paramitas... therefore Buddhas are rarer. However if we practise, we can attain various stages of the Bodhisattva bhumis (there are 10 stages of the Bodhisattva bhumis before Buddhahood), or the various levels of enlightenment before Arhatship (there are 4 stages of enlightenment in the Arhatship path, the highest being Arhat), or even Arhatship itself. Because our Buddha Nature is already wholly complete, we can say that eventually we will all attain Buddhahood, even though it is not a matter of just one lifetime's practise. We can awaken to the ultimate nature of reality, attain liberation from samsara, and also lead many other sentient beings to liberation, especially if you are one with Bodhisattva vows. There will be Buddhas in the future, Maitreya Bodhisattva will become the next Buddha (now is still Mi Le Pu Sa, not yet Mi Le Fo), but it is predicted that he will only attain Buddhahood a very very long time later, after Shakyamuni Buddha's teachings completely disappeared from the face of the earth. Also see: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no3a.htm" rel="nofollow">The next Buddha</a><br><br><blockquote>If we follow christ teaching? y is that we are not able to reach christ lvl as a 'god'?<br><br>If we follow the teaching of hindu?

Isnt that a waste of time if even after attaining enlightening and u will have to go thru the cycle again?<br><br>Again, i apologise if i made any unintentional offensive remark..</blockquote>I do not feel very much like commenting on the various other religions and teachings because I am not from their religions and if I comment too much, some of their followers may oppose my views... and also many teachings are distorted from the original words of their religious teachers... but basically if you go deep into them, you'll realise that many things are actually very similar... and that the religions' founders (I stress the founder, not necessarily the modern form of the religion) -- Jesus, some Indian sages, Lao Tzu and some other Taoist sages, etc etc, also taught that we can attain enlightenment although they way they put it may be different.. and their levels enlightenment may be different from the Buddha (after all Buddha is the one who has attained complete enlightenment, not just partial enlightenment) and many cases they are not very elaborate on 'how' to become enlightened like themselves, unlike the Buddha. Some of these teachers may be appearances of Bodhisattvas of different bhumi stages, and many times they teach the dharma in different ways as expedient/skillful means in accordance to the needs and situation of the people at that time. For example, many religious teachings stress on developing good qualities -- patience, love, generosity, doing good, avoiding evil, and so on.. but not so much on liberation and purification of the mind.<br><br>The Buddha taught that the Buddhas of past and future always teach Buddhism as 'avoiding all evil, doing all good, and purifying the mind'..<br>However generally speaking, religions we see nowadays generally stop at the level of 'doing good, avoiding evil'. I wrote this elsewhere:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As I mentioned earlier, religions generally teach people to avoid evil, do good, but they lack the part about purifying the mind, liberation, enlightenment. As a result of accumulating good karma, followers of other religions may (depending on their conduct and karma) be reborn in good realms such as the celestial, heaven realms. But this is not the ultimate aim of Buddhists as even in the highest realm of heaven (the formless realm of neither perception nor non perception), one is still subject to rebirth again at the tick of a thought and influence of karma, and one may even fall into the 3 lower realms of hell, ghost, animals, as all of us have created uncountable various kinds of karmas over countless lifetimes, these karmic seeds are latent deep in our 8th consciousness awaiting for conditions to ripen.<br><br>Therefore heaven is not a good refuge, it is still in samsara, it is still dangerous, according to Buddhism. Therefore we have to practise, attain enlightenment and nirvana to be above all influences of the cycles of samsara. Then if you are a practitioner of Mahayana, you will return to samsara out of vows to save other sentient beings, practise the 10 paramitas, and eventually attain complete Buddhahood. However, a Bodhisattva (pu2 sa4) is no longer under the influences of Samsara, he returns out of vows, not due to the strength of karma or the illusion of his 7th consciousness.</span></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>(continued from previous post)<br><br>Oh yes by the way since you mentioned 'sainthood'... what does Arhat means? Arhat literally means 'Saint', an enlightened, liberated saint. So if you are an arhat, you're a saint according to Buddhism.<br><br>Anyway the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Pratyekabuddhas, Arhats, have become liberated from the cycle of samsara. They can enter Nirvana and no longer need to be reborn in the 6 realms in Samsara. However the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas may return to samsara, or manifest in samsara, due to their compassionate vows to save sentient beings, fulfill their vows, or for the bodhisattvas also an opportunity to continue practising the dharma and cultivating the paramitas to perfect Buddhahood.. However even in the midst of being engaged in samsara, these enlightened beings are no longer attached and bounded by sufferings, illusions, and remain blissful even in samsara... Even in that very lifetime Shakyamuni Buddha appeared as our teacher, he did not suffer at all. Why? Because he is already enlightened, liberated, and does not suffer even while living... it does not mean he does not get sick or feel pain. Some say that the Buddha still has past lives' karma that still manifest in his lifetime... and it is generally possible that someone liberated still have karma brought from the past manifestating bad results in their life.. although they no longer generate any more karma. However even though a Buddha may have sickness, pain, etc, he does not suffer. He does not suffer even when pain and sickness is manifesting. Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. One who has awakened to the 4 noble truths and having accomplished the path is forever liberated from sufferings. However in Mahayana/Vajrayana teachings, Shakyamuni Buddha is already enlightened even from the point of birth, only manifesting his life in the human realm as an example for us.. so he manifests himself as a prince, he manifested his renunciation, his quest for enlightenment, his enlightenment, etc, to show the path and tell sentient beings that it is definitely possible to become enlightened and liberated from sufferingse, and also he manifest his ageing, his sickness to show that people with imperfectness like us can also attain the highest enlightenment.. and also to show that Birth, Ageing, Sickness, Death, is a fact of life that nobody can run away from.<br><br>Also since they have realised their true nature as Birthless and Deathless, as I have explained in the previous post, you cannot say that ultimately they are born and die.. because the nature of reality is Empty. This is the realise of "No coming, no going", or "Thus come, thus gone". Which is why the Buddha is known as "Thus Come One" or "Ru Lai"... And precisely because one has seen the emptiness nature and understands self-liberation, he is completely fearless, non-attached and being transparent does not cling to any notions of a 'self'... He sees the dream-like nature of our lives and does not cling to the notion of a 'self' that has 'birth' or 'death'.<br><br>Also the last point... accumulating merits alone is not enough for enlightenment. Like I mentioned earlier.. no matter how good you are, how much good karma you have, if you do not purify your mind, practise the dharma that leads to liberation, you will only remain in the higher realms of samsara like heaven/celestial realms, but still subject to impermanency, death, rebirth, dukkha, unsatisfactoriness. For a start.. to find out more about the purpose of Buddhism, how to practise Buddhism, you can read the various resources... like the one Wanderer provided... or the topic I've created dedicated to those who would like to know more about Buddhism (<a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=240316" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=240316</a>)<br><br>Also I wrote in a part of another topic which you might be interested to read... regarding the purification of the mind in <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=239181" rel="nofollow">Questions About buddhism</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Ultimately, through meditation and practise one will realise and experience/get in touch with one's primordial state of pure awareness, or one's Buddha Nature, which is like a clear bright mirror reflecting everything we experience in the world. This is just an analogy (and not a very good one since ultimately even the mirror is not a separate entity from its reflection, but rather it is a form of moment-to-moment 'participatory' awareness). It is also an all pervading presence of 'yourself' connected with the universe, so in this state of pure awareness there is actually no seperation between you and me or the universe, and everything is just spontaneous arising of this pure awareness, and we and all Buddhas are all one in a sense. The 'self' is merely an illusion, based on identification with the 5 skhandas, which is why the Buddha taught about no self. If we were to investigate, we will not find 'self' in the 5 skhandas (five aggregates), or our sensory experiences, or even in our thoughts, and therefore it would be meaningless to grasp on this fictitious idea, which is the root of all ignorance, afflictive emotions and sufferings. Through meditation one can also transcend this attachment through insights and awakening.<br><br>Reality has always been so (non dual) but due to the layer of illusion of separation, like the layer of dust covering the clear bright mirror and preventing us from seeing what's the reality of it all. Which is what the Buddha taught about 'purifying the mind' is all about -- clearing the dust, or attachment to dualistic, afflictive emotions (such as greed, hatred, jealousy, envy, etc) and ignorance, to reveal the reality underneath it. And this is what is special about Buddhism, as all 7 Buddhas Gatha says that the 7 Buddhas taught Buddhism as 'Avoiding all evil, Doing all that's good, and <strong>Purifying the Mind.</strong>' The third one, purifying the mind, sets Buddhism different from the other religions. At the time of death, if one can recognise the primordial clear light as one's true, original nature, one's 7th consciousness dissolves into this clear light and becomes liberated or enter into nirvana. Otherwise our Karma, along with the 7th Consciousness (consciousness of a seperate 'self' based on ignorance) will pull us back to undergo the endless cycles of rebirth in the world of suffering -- Samsara. Therefore to summarise, Buddhist meditation and practise has nothing to do with attaining any states of trance, but rather, it is a process of Awakening and Awareness...</span><br><br>To add.. not only attachment to afflictive emotions but also to incessant thinking, and dualistic notions and ideas of things due to ignorance (i.e not knowing the true nature/reality of all phenomena as emptiness) and illusions... which is also form of grasping, attachment. For example we grasp at appearances thinking that they truly exist even though all phenomena are empty of inherent existence.. as they are co-dependent arising and arise out of causes and conditions.. and are ever impermanent. Because of these illusions.. we suffer.. and cannot be liberated. We can start to purify our minds by practising mindful awareness... with mindfulness we will become more aware of the reality of ourselves, our thoughts and behaviors, and the reality of our thoughts and experiences (i.e emptiness, impermanence, the 3 dharma seals/4 seals, etc)... and with mindfulness we will also not become caught up and lost in appearances and thoughts, and eventually through practise and insights these thoughts and illusions will be self liberated as they arise and there will be an immediate awareness the moment they arise, and we will not become attracted and become lost in them, we will not be deceived by our minds, illusions of self and permanency, into attachment, seeking, or aversion.<br><br>By the way sorry for splitting the reply into so many posts.

We never preached immortality but instead, impermanence as the truth of reality. As such, the parinirvana of the Buddha is completely not in contradiction with his teachings.
