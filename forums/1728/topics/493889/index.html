              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">This is how Buddhist monks
              live without money </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Tree Watson 15 April
              2017  Economy Explores</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Laypeople
              and the monastic community have a relationship of mutual dependence. It's
              called 'gift economics'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Take
              money, for example. In the past there wasn’t any paper money. Paper was just
              paper, without any value. Then people decided that silver money was hard to
              store, so they turned paper into money. And so it serves as money."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Maybe
              someday in the future a new king will arise who doesn’t like paper money. He’ll
              have us use wax droppings instead—take sealing wax, melt it, stamp it into
              lumps, and suppose it to be money. We’ll be using wax droppings all over the
              country, getting into debt all because of wax droppings. Let alone wax
              droppings, we could take chicken droppings and turn them into money! It could
              happen. All our chicken droppings would be cash. We’d be fighting and killing
              one another over chicken droppings."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ajahn Chah, monk, founder of two major
              monasteries in the Thai Forest Tradition, &amp; instrumental  figure
              in the establishment of Theravada Buddhism in the West</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Why do Buddhist monks reject the idea of
              money?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Practicing
              Buddhists make five promises – not to lie, not to steal, not to engage in
              sexual misconduct, not to harm any living creature and not to take intoxicating
              substances which lead to carelessness. These are called the ‘5 precepts’.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              Buddhist monks and nuns ordain – don the robes, shave their heads, and start
              their training – they make all of the same promises that lay Buddhists
              (practicing Buddhists who aren’t monks) do, but also promise to let go of their
              attachments to all social conventions. It’s what the Buddha did on his path to
              enlightenment, so the Vinaya – the rules he put together for monks to follow –
              say they should do the same.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              Buddhists (and a lot of economists), money counts as a social convention. Coins
              are only valuable because we’ve decided that they are, and the same goes for
              paper banknotes. So like other social conventions, Buddhist monks give it up.
              They can’t buy or sell anything, get cash out of the bank or even give or
              accept charitable donations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Without money, how do monks get by?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist
              monks and nuns are completely reliant on the lay community to provide them with
              the material things they need to survive. In warmer Buddhist countries, monks
              will walk around their local village at mealtimes in what’s called an ‘alms
              round’, holding a bowl for locals to put food into. In the West, food often
              gets donated to monasteries in bulk, and volunteers then use it to prepare
              meals for the monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              lay community provides the money and the labor to build shelter for monks, make
              them clothes and buy them the technology they need to keep up with the world
              outside the monastery, from computers to iPads. Some monastic communities like
              the Forest Sangha even have a Twitter account.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Once
              a year, during the autumn festival of Kathina, families offer monks and nuns
              all the cloth they need for robes to get them through the winter months. Lay
              Buddhists club together to provide them with the basics in what’s known as an
              annual celebration of giving.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What do lay Buddhists get in return?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              lay community provides the monastic community with material support in exchange
              for the spiritual support they receive from them, in the form of ceremonies,
              guided meditation, or ad-hoc advice. It’s not a tit-for-tat kind of exchange –
              you don’t get a passage from the scriptures every time you donate a tin of
              tomatoes – but more of a relationship of mutual interdependence, or ‘gift
              economics’.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Surely people take advantage of the
              system?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Things
              don’t always go smoothly. Like anything, people interpret the rules in
              different ways, and some bend them a little too far. Monks are obliged to
              graciously accept anything that’s offered to them, whatever it may be. It’s not
              uncommon to see monasteries in Thailand overrun with dogs, donated by people
              who can’t look after them and know the monks can’t turn them away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              the monks have been known to bend the rules as well. A small sect of Western
              Buddhists called the New Kampada Tradition admitted to receiving rental income
              from people in receipt of housing benefit. Given the British taxpayer, who
              would be funding those benefits, definitely isn’t spiritually dependent on
              them, it goes against the ‘gift economics’ principle of the monk-to-layperson
              relationship, as well as counting as benefit fraud.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Technically,
              as long as it’s the lay community and not the monks who collect the funds, then
              they’re not breaking any Buddhist rules by passing that cash on to the monks if
              they want to. A number of Buddhist groups use this justification to get other
              things like meditation classes, books and so on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              a lot of Buddhists might take issue with this - whilst the monks aren’t
              actually handling any money, they are securing their material well-being by
              profiting from the lay community’s need for shelter and spiritual guidance. We
              end up with a situation where the Buddha’s teachings become a commodity, being
              sold to those who can afford it rather than offered to those who need it.
              That’s not gift economics anymore – it’s just standard market exchange.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Why stick to 'gift economics' if it's a
              flawed way of doing things?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">People
              who break the rules will always exist – but for hundreds of Buddhist
              communities around the world, the system of mutual dependence is a really
              important part of Buddhist spirituality. Buddhists often refer to themselves as
              ‘practicing’ because living morally is a question of practice – something you
              get better at with time. No economic model is perfect, but this system at least
              allows both the monastic and the lay community to meet their spiritual and
              material needs.</span></p>
