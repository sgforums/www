              There are many ways to practice generosity—by giving material goods, money,
              time, energy, work, and love. Letting go of material possessions helps to
              diminish attachment and craving, and so this teaching is often emphasized. In
              an age of over-consumption, generosity is a much-needed practice to counteract
              both individual and collective greed.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>As practitioners of the Buddha’s path, we can also go further by
              understanding the interdependent relationship of giver and receiver. There is
              virtue in giving away what you have, but there is also virtue in allowing
              others to give, by receiving. The first time my notions of giving and receiving
              were turned upside down was when I was traveling in India in 2004. I was in a
              taxi with a wealthy woman who lived in the town I was visiting, a friend of a
              friend. I had only been in India a few weeks and it was a swelteringly hot day
              just before the monsoon. At a stop light, a young girl came up to the window
              and asked for money. She was about ten years old, wearing a tattered pink dress
              coated in dust and dirt. Her eyes were at the same time both hungry and bored.
              The woman rolled down the window to give her a few rupees and the girl ran off.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Strangely, I found myself stunned that the girl didn’t say thank
              you. In Canada, I was raised to always say “please,” “thank you,” and “you’re
              welcome” to everyone. Whenever I gave money or food to someone begging in
              Canada, it was always received with a “thank you,” or at least a nod and a
              smile. I asked the woman about this, because the interaction felt strange to
              me. The woman said that in the Hindu concept of karma, a person who gives money
              to someone begging receives merit and thus the little girl had allowed her to
              gain merit<em>.</em></span><span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></em></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The girl didn’t need to say "thank you" since it was the
              woman who had received the most from the interaction. This was very different
              from the Eurocentric, materialistic worldview that I had been raised with. I
              saw for the first time that while I thought I practiced generosity freely, I
              still expected something in return, albeit something as small as a smile. This
              was the first time I saw that my giving was not as free as I thought it was.
              Seeing this subtle layer of craving helped me to understand a deeper layer of
              freedom—that of giving without even needing a “thank you.” I can now see why,
              in many Buddhist cultures, monastics do not say “thank you” when receiving
              donations, as this ensures that no one makes offerings to build up their pride.
              This was the beginning of my changed understanding of generosity, from a
              unidirectional flow of materials and energy to a reciprocal relationship.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>This shift deepened in 2007, when I found myself diagnosed with
              cancer. I was 29 years old. After four years of traveling and studying
              meditation, I was once again living with my mother and quite ill. While
              traveling, I had cultivated a long list of family and friends that I kept in
              touch with through group e-mails. So I wrote an e-mail about my situation
              asking these people to send prayers and healing energy to me. However, before
              sending the e-mail, I paused for a moment. Many people are quite private about
              health matters, and I wondered whether this was in fact something I might want
              to keep to myself. But I knew I needed all the support I could get, so I hit
              “send.” The outpouring of love that I received over the internet was
              overwhelming and incredibly healing. I felt that I was the clear recipient in
              this situation. But bit by bit, friends and family started writing to me, not
              only sending their love and prayers but also thanking me for sharing my
              experience and allowing them to offer something, even prayers, from thousands
              of kilometers away. It was a true relationship of</span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>dana,</span></em><span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></em></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>a loving expression of our
              interdependence. I saw how important it is not only to give, but also to allow
              others the chance to give, even if we feel a little embarrassed or awkward in
              receiving. We can learn to be honest and vulnerable with those we are close to
              and step into a flow of giving and receiving that has no expectations or
              conditions, even if it feels challenging at first. The fruits are certainly
              worth the effort.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>It is important to cultivate generosity to deflate the ego’s
              pride, but we must also be careful that we don’t mask our pride in false
              humility. Traditional practices of</span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>dana</span></em><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>that point to diminishing craving and pride are not ends unto
              themselves. They serve as a doorway to an embodied experience of</span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>anatta</span></em><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>(Skt.<em>anatman</em>,
              or “non-self”)—our interdependent, true nature. When your joy is my joy and
              your well-being is my well-being, we are relating to each other on a level that
              goes beyond the mundane worldview of self as a separate entity, that goes
              beyond being different or being the same. We can engage in an embodied
              experience of our Buddha Nature. This is why I value the practice of</span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>dana</span></em><span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></em></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>so much.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>My most recent experience with the inter-being of giver and
              receiver came up at my birthday. I had asked friends to bring a poem or song
              that carried a special meaning in their lives. I received funny, touching, and
              insightful “gifts” from many friends. Then, the next day, a friend who hadn’t
              been able to come the night before took me aside to offer a poem. As she read
              it to me, I realized that she was reading a poem that I’d written and shared
              with her the year before. It all started when she found a rough draft of a poem
              in the recycling bin. She figured out who had written it, asked if I had any
              more, and I shared some poems with her. I felt a little embarrassed, but didn’t
              want that to stop me from practicing generosity. As she read the poem, her
              voice made it her own. It became a whole new poem. It was a beautiful gift, yet
              again challenged my ideas of giver and receiver<em>,</em></span><span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></em></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>once again bringing me into the heart of inter-being—our
              interdependent nature. Who was the giver? Who was the receiver? No matter. We
              were both consumed in</span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";      color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>dana</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>, delighting in both the giving and the receiving, and there was
              no need to define or separate ourselves.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>In the next weeks, perhaps you might consider how generosity shows
              up in your life. Does it fuel pride? Shame? Joy? Frustration? Does it show up
              at all? Before you try to change anything in your practice of <em>dana</em>,
              look deeply into your experience and relationship to giving and receiving.
              Start to recognize that even the air you breathe and the earth you tread upon
              are gifts from the universe. When you can feel the immense generosity that
              supports all of life, you are ready to go further. Are there one or two ways
              you can bring more generosity into your life? Maybe you could let someone board
              the train ahead of you or give your seat to someone in need with a joyful
              heart. You can offer a smile to the teller at the grocery store. And, of
              course, you can make offerings to charities and temples knowing that it is a
              privilege to do so. It needn’t be a heavy moral obligation. In fact, duty and
              obligation are impediments to the perfection of generosity. Generosity,
              practiced with mindfulness and unconditional love, is a delight. May your
              giving be fruitful!</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'></span></p>

              <p>Giving gifts no less pleasant than to receive them. Gift - is an expression of our good relationship to man.</p>
              <p>You'd be surprised, but the gift should not be expensive. Moreover, give expensive gifts is simply indecent. This way you are implying that the person is not able to buy such a thing. Maybe so, but the show is definitely not necessary. Expensive gifts are presented only the closest relatives.</p>
