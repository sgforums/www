He went to the mountains to do a solitary retreat, concentrating all his meditation practice on the Buddha Maitreya, in the fervent hope that he would be blessed with a vision of this Buddha and receive teachings from him.<br><br>For six years Asanga meditated in extreme hardship, but did not even have one auspicious dream. He was disheartened and thought he would never succeed with his aspiration to meet the Buddha Maitreya, and so he abandoned his retreat and left his hermitage. He had not gone far down the road when he saw a man rubbing an enormous iron bar with a strip of silk. Asanga went up to him and asked him what he was doing. Â“I havenÂ’t got a needle,Â” the man replied, Â“so IÂ’m going to make one out of this iron bar.Â” Asanga stared at him, astounded; even if the man were able to manage it in a hundred years, he thought, what would be the point? He said to himself: Â“Look at the trouble people give themselves over things that are totally absurd. You are doing something really valuable, spiritual practice, and youÂ’re not nearly so dedicated.Â” He turned around and went back to his retreat.<br><br>Another three years went by, still without the slightest sign from the Buddha Maitreya. Â“Now I know for certain,Â” he thought, Â“IÂ’m never going to succeed.Â” So he left again, and soon came to a bend in the road where there was a huge rock, so tall it seemed to touch the sky. At the foot of the rock was a man busily rubbing it with a feather soaked in water. Â“What are you doing?Â” Asanga asked.<br><br>Â“This rock is so big itÂ’s stopping the sun from shining on my house, so IÂ’m trying to get rid of it.Â” Asanga was amazed at the manÂ’s indefatigable energy, and ashamed at his own lack of dedication. He returned to his retreat.<br>Three more years passed, and still he had not even had a single good dream. He decided, once and for all, that it was hopeless, and he left his retreat for good. The day wore on, and in the afternoon he came across a dog lying by the side of the road. It had only its front legs, and the whole of the lower part of its body was rotting and covered with maggots. Despite its pitiful condition the dog was snapping at passerby, and pathetically trying to bite them by dragging itself along the ground with its two good legs.<br><br>Asanga was overwhelmed with a vivid and unbearable feeling of compassion. He cut a piece of flesh off his own body and gave it to the dog to eat. Then he bent down to take off the maggots that were consuming the dogÂ’s body. But he suddenly thought he might hurt them if he tried to pull them out with his fingers, and realized that the only way to remove them would be on his tongue. Asanga knelt on the ground, and looking at the horrible festering, writhing mass, closed his eyes. He leant closer and put out his tongueÂ….. The next thing he knew, his tongue was touching the ground. He opened his eyes and looked up. The dog was gone; there in its place was the Buddha Maitreya, ringed by a shimmering aura of light.<br><br>Â“At last,Â” said Asanga, Â“why did you never appear to me before?Â”<br>Maitreya spoke softly: Â“It is true that I have never appeared to you before. I was with you all the time, but your negative karma and obscurations prevented you from seeing me. Your twelve years of practice dissolved them slightly, so that you were at last able to see the dog. Then, thanks to your genuine and heartfelt compassion, all those obscurations were completely swept away, and you can see me before you with your very own eyes. If you donÂ’t believe that this is what happened, put me on your shoulder and try and see if anyone else can see me.Â”<br><br>Asanga put Maitreya on his right shoulder and went to the marketplace, where he began to ask everyone: Â“What have I got on my shoulder?Â” Â“Nothing,Â” most people said, and hurried on. Only one old woman, whose karma had been slightly purified, answered: Â“YouÂ’ve got the rotting corpse of an old dog on your shoulder, thatÂ’s all.Â” Asanga at last understood the boundless power of compassion that had purified and transformed his karma, and so made him a vessel fit to receive the vision and instruction of Maitreya. Then the Buddha Maitreya, whose name means Â“loving kindness,Â” took Asanga to a heavenly realm, and there gave him any sublime teachings that are among the most important in the whole of Buddhism.</div>

Solve things one at a time, if cannot be solved now, then just leave it aside for the time being and go on to the next issue; come back to it after a while and see how things go.

Despite its pitiful condition the dog was snapping at passerby, and pathetically trying to bite them by dragging itself along the ground with its two good legs.<br><br>Asanga was overwhelmed with a vivid and unbearable feeling of compassion. He cut a piece of flesh off his own body and gave it to the dog to eat. Then he bent down to take off the maggots that were consuming the dogÂ’s body. But he suddenly thought he might hurt them if he tried to pull them out with his fingers, and realized that the only way to remove them would be on his tongue. Asanga knelt on the ground, and looking at the horrible festering, writhing mass, closed his eyes. He leant closer and put out his tongueÂ….. The next thing he knew, his tongue was touching the ground. He opened his eyes and looked up. The dog was gone; there in its place was the Buddha Maitreya, ringed by a shimmering aura of light.<br><br>Â“At last,Â” said Asanga, Â“why did you never appear to me before?Â”<br>Maitreya spoke softly: Â“It is true that I have never appeared to you before. I was with you all the time, but your negative karma and obscurations prevented you from seeing me. Your twelve years of practice dissolved them slightly, so that you were at last able to see the dog. Then, thanks to your genuine and heartfelt compassion, all those obscurations were completely swept away, and you can see me before you with your very own eyes. If you donÂ’t believe that this is what happened, put me on your shoulder and try and see if anyone else can see me.Â”<br><br>Asanga put Maitreya on his right shoulder and went to the marketplace, where he began to ask everyone: Â“What have I got on my shoulder?Â” Â“Nothing,Â” most people said, and hurried on. Only one old woman, whose karma had been slightly purified, answered: Â“YouÂ’ve got the rotting corpse of an old dog on your shoulder, thatÂ’s all.Â” Asanga at last understood the boundless power of compassion that had purified and transformed his karma, and so made him a vessel fit to receive the vision and instruction of Maitreya. Then the Buddha Maitreya, whose name means Â“loving kindness,Â” took Asanga to a heavenly realm, and there gave him any sublime teachings that are among the most important in the whole of Buddhism.</div></blockquote>That was v inspiring.. thanks for sharing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not defending the primitive religion of Japan.<br>However, i think you should make a clear line between Nationalistic Shinto, and Shinto as "practiced" or believed. Yes, Shinto has many sects, but like you said, not all of them are dark, so why generalise the whole Shinto religion as "dark"?<br><br>For example, Shinto places quite a bit of emphasis on respect for nature and its surroundings. Is that "dark"? Also, before the Meiji Restoration, Buddhism and Shinto were rather cohesive. It was not uncommon (even up to now) to have Shinto shrines in a Buddhist temple; and Shinto deities were actually regarded as manifestations of the various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. It was only after the Meiji Restoration that Nationalistic Shinto came into the picture and all the unwanted stuff with it until the end of WW2.<br><br>As to regards with the Yasukuni Shrine, i think, as non-Japanese it is really not our business to go and meddle or comment about it. To some if not a majority of Japanese, it is part and parcel of their culture. I neither condemn nor condone the Japanese PM worshipping there.<br><br>BTW, Tojo Hideki actually converted to Buddhism before he was exectuted. His chaplain was Hanayama Shoshin, a Jodo Shin priest and a previous Bishop of the Buddhist Churches of America.<br><br>As a Buddhist, one should practice wholesome speech and i think making judgements without knowing the reality is unwholesome, please reflect.<br><br>Gassho</div>

He was also one of the creators of the formal Japanese tea ceremony.<br><br>Contents [hide]<br>1 Biography<br>2 Childhood<br>3 Training<br>4 Vagabond<br>5 Impact<br>6 External links and references<br><br>[edit] Biography<br><br>[edit] Childhood<br>Ikkyu was born in 1394 in a small suburb of Kyoto as the illegitimate son of Emperor Go-Komatsu. His mother was forced to flee to Saga, Japan, where Ikkyu was raised by servants. At age five Ikkyu was separated from his mother and was enrolled as a monk at the Rinzai Zen temple, Ankokuji. The temple masters taught Chinese culture and language as part of the curriculum, a method termed Gozan Zen. He was given the name Shuken, and learned about Chinese poetry, art and literature.<br><br>[edit] Training<br>When Ikkyu turned thirteen he entered Kennin-ji in Kyoto to study Zen under a well known priest by the name of Botetsu. Here Ikkyu began to frequently write poetry which was non-traditional in form. He was openly critical of Kennin-ji's leadership in his poetry, disheartened with the social stratum and lack of zazen practice he saw around him.<br><br>In 1410, at age sixteen, Ikkyu left Kennin-ji and entered the temple Mibu, where an abbot named Seiso was in residence. He did not stay long, and soon found himself at Saikin-ji in the Lake Biwa region where he was the sole student of an abbot named Keno. It seemed Ikkyu had finally found a master that taught true Rinzai Zen as Ikkyu saw it. Keno was sporadic in his teaching style and was a strong believer in the supremacy of zazen. In 1414, when Ikkyu was 21, Keno died. Ikkyu performed funeral rites and fasted for seven days. In despair Ikkyu tried to commit suicide by drowning himself in Lake Biwa, but was talked out of it from the shore by a servant of his mother.<br><br>Ikkyu soon found a new teacher in a master named Kaso at Zenko-an, a branch temple of Daitoku-ji. Kaso was much like Keno in his style. For years he worked hard on assigned koans and he made dolls for a local merchant in Kyoto.<br><br>In 1418 Ikkyu was given Case 15 of the Mumonkan, Tozan's 60 Blows. One day a band of blind singers performed at the temple and Ikkyu penetrated his koan while engrossed in the music. In recognition of his understanding Kaso gave Shuken the Dharma name Ikkyu, which roughly means One Pause.<br><br>In 1420 Ikkyu was meditating in a boat on Lake Biwa when the sound of a crow sparked satori. Kaso confirmed this great enlightenment and granted Ikkyu inka. IkkyÂ¨Â± came up against the jealousy of Yoso, a more senior student who eventually came to run the monastery. In IkkyÂ¨Â±'s poems, Yoso appears as a character unhealthily obsessed with material goods, who sold Zen to increase the prosperity of the temple.<br><a href="http://&lt;br%20/&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikkyu" rel="nofollow"><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikkyu</a></div>
