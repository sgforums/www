Yes, Shinto has many sects, but like you said, not all of them are dark, so why generalise the whole Shinto religion as "dark"?<br><br>For example, Shinto places quite a bit of emphasis on respect for nature and its surroundings. Is that "dark"? Also, before the Meiji Restoration, Buddhism and Shinto were rather cohesive. It was not uncommon (even up to now) to have Shinto shrines in a Buddhist temple; and Shinto deities were actually regarded as manifestations of the various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. It was only after the Meiji Restoration that Nationalistic Shinto came into the picture and all the unwanted stuff with it until the end of WW2.<br><br>As to regards with the Yasukuni Shrine, i think, as non-Japanese it is really not our business to go and meddle or comment about it. To some if not a majority of Japanese, it is part and parcel of their culture. I neither condemn nor condone the Japanese PM worshipping there.<br><br>BTW, Tojo Hideki actually converted to Buddhism before he was exectuted. His chaplain was Hanayama Shoshin, a Jodo Shin priest and a previous Bishop of the Buddhist Churches of America.<br><br>As a Buddhist, one should practice wholesome speech and i think making judgements without knowing the reality is unwholesome, please reflect.<br><br>Gassho</div></blockquote>okay , all this aside .The fact that the World War II have killed million of people is a hard fact in history<br><br>and it the Japanese Government refusal to admit the mistake of the Altered History Books .that is quite unique in the japanese modern culture .<br><br>I am not practising wholesome speech ?

His religious writing, some fifty works, expound the esoteric Shingon doctrine, of which the major ones have been translated into English by Yoshito Hakeda (see references below). Kūkai is also said to have written the iroha, one of the most famous poems in Japanese, which uses every phonetic kana syllable.<br><br>Contents [hide]<br>1 Biography<br>1.1 Early years<br>1.2 The esoteric<br>1.3 Travel and study in China<br>1.4 Emerging from obscurity<br>1.5 Mount Kōya<br>1.6 The Tō-ji Period<br>1.7 Final years<br>2 Kūkai's significance to Japanese culture<br>2.1 Religion<br>3 References<br>4 External links<br><br>[edit] Biography<br><br>[edit] Early years<br>Kūkai was born in 774 in the province of Sanuki on Shikoku island in the present day town of Zentsūji. His family were members of a declining aristocratic family, a branch of the ancient Ōtomo clan. There is some doubt as to his birth name: Tōtomono (precious one) is recorded in one source, while Mao (True Fish) is recorded elsewhere. Mao is popularly used in recent writings. [Hakeda p.14]<br><br>Little more is known about Kūkai's childhood. At age fifteen, he began to receive instruction in the Chinese Classics under the guidance of his maternal uncle. In 791 Kūkai went to "the capital", (probably Nara), to study at the government university, the graduates of which were chosen for prestigious positions as bureaucrats. However, at some point Kūkai became disillusioned with the course of study at the university and resigned to take up a life of mendicancy.<br><br>Kūkai was born in a period of political turmoil with Emperor Kammu (r. 781-806) seeking to consolidate his power and to extend his realm. Earlier Imperial sponsorship of Buddhism, beginning with Prince Shōtoku (574-622), led to a general politicization of the clergy, along with an increase in intrigue and corruption. In 784 Kammu shifted his capital from Nara to Nagaoka in a move that was said to be intended to edge the powerful Nara Buddhist establishments out of state politics - while the capital moved, the major Buddhist temples and their officials stayed in Nara. Indeed, there was a steady stream of edicts issued from 771 right through the period of Kūkai's studies. Some edicts sought to limit the number of Buddhist priests and the building of clan temples. However, moving was to prove disastrous and was followed by a series of natural disasters including the flooding of half the city. In 785 the principal architect of the new capital and a royal favourite, Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, was assassinated and members of the Ōtomo clan were implicated. This was detrimental to the fortunes of Kūkai's family. Meanwhile, Kammu's armies were extending the boundaries of his empire. This led to an uprising and, in 789, a substantial defeat for Kammu's troops. Also, in 789 there was a severe drought and famine - the streets of the capital were clogged with the sick, people avoiding a military draft or forced labour. Many disguised themselves as Buddhist priests to avoid conscription. Then, in 794 Kammu suddenly shifted the capital again, this time to Heiankyō, which is modern day Kyoto. The new capital was started early the previous year, but the change was abrupt and led to even more confusion amongst the populace.<br><br>Kammu shored up his political rule by changing the syllabus of the university. Confucian ideology still provided the raison d'Ãªtre for the Imperial government. In 784 Kammu authorised the teaching of a new course on the Spring and Autumn Annals which were based on two newly imported commentaries: Gongyang and Guliang. These commentaries used political rhetoric and promoted a state in which the Emperor, as "son of Heaven", should extend his sphere of influence to barbarous lands, thereby gladdening the people. In 798 the two commentaries became required reading at the government university. This surely had an impact on Kūkai.<br><br>Buddhism had been introduced into Japan from Korea in 552. It had been adopted as the state religion partly to legitimise its rule and partly to assert its cultural superiority to rebellious rival clans. However, Buddhism's initial role was to chant magical formulas to prevent and mitigate disasters, in essence to pray for the well being of the Emperor and the empire. Ryuichi AbÃ© notes for example that in 824 the court ordered the fifteen great temples of the nation to recite the Greater PranjÃ±ā-pāramitā-sūtra to prevent the spread of drought and famine, as well as several other examples. [AbÃ© p.37]<br><br>Biographies of Kūkai suggest that he became disillusioned with his studies. As well as the militaristic ideology, Kūkai was also imbibing something of Buddhism. Yoshito Hakeda also suggests that the ructions with the Ōtomo clan also left him without a highly placed patron which dimmed his career prospects. Whatever it was, Kūkai went through a decisive transformation while at university that led to him abandoning his studies and becoming a wandering mendicant. Mendicants were despised by the government and the aristocracy, so Kūkai could hardly have been seen to fall further. The story of this transition is a little hazy. However, it is clear that at some point Kūkai was introduced to Buddhist practice involving chanting the mantra of the Bodhisattva Ākāsagarbha. During this period Kūkai frequently sought out isolated mountain regions where he chanted the Ākāsagarbha mantra relentlessly. But he also must have frequented the large monasteries of Nara. We know this because his first major literary work, Sangō shiiki (三教指歸; Indications of the Goals of the Three Teachings), composed during this period at the age of 24, quotes from a remarkable breadth of sources, including the classics of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. The Nara temples, with their extensive libraries, were the most likely place, perhaps the only place, where Kūkai could have found all of these texts.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo_Daishi<br></div>

Thus, orphaned at a young age he entered the priesthood at Mount Hiei, which was then the main center of Buddhist learning.<br>Here he was to stay for twenty years, practicing the most arduous of physical and mental disciplines. The principal teaching of the monasteries emphasized the purification of the self for the attainment of Enlightenment. Never did a young priest apply himself so wholeheartedly to all the disciplines. He soon became renowned for his scholarship and could have easily become head of one of the larger monasteries, but he was neither interested in position nor in the pursuit of knowledge. His main concern was Enlightenment. After two decades on Mt. Hiei, Shinran Shonin came to the sober realization that Enlightenment was impossible for the common man. The disciplines of Mt. Hiei made him acutely conscious of his own human weakness. His life was finite; his knowledge incomplete and his capacity for perfect goodness limited. Upon meditation he discovered that in all his activities the Three Poisons of greed, hatred and anger essentially motivated him.<br>In this state of mental anguish, Shinran Shonin renounced the life on Mt. Hiei. His descent form the mountain was the turning point in his religious pursuit. Shortly thereafter, he met a kindly priest, Honen shonin, who taught a single faith in Amida Buddha and the recitation of the Nembutsu as the very way of religious fulfillment. Honen shonin brought Shinran Shonin face-to-face with Amida Buddhas infinity Wisdom and Compassion. For the first time in his life Shinran Shonin found inner peace in the faith that Amida Buddha was primarily concerned with such as person as him. The Buddhist life he realized he could be lived by the man in the street without confinement to a monastery. The gate of lifes meaning was now open to all and thousands of people flocked to hear and accept the hopeful message of the Nembutsu.<br>The powerful monastic orders, however, feared a weakening of their long established tradition and prestige and convinced the Imperial Court to banish Honen shonin and Shinran Shonin, but the spiritual energy of the Nembutsu had been unleashed. The teaching soon gathered momentum as it spread from person to person and from village to village. Especially, during his years in exile, Shinran Shonin personally met with countless persons to awaken their faith in Amida Buddha.<br>Shinran Shonin finally settled in Inada and there completed the first draft of the Teaching, Practice, Faith and Attainment in 1224.<br>In 1232 when he was fifty-nine, he retired to Kyoto. During the intervening years until his death, he wrote many books, which are read and studied even today. He died on 16th January 1263 (28th day of 11th month, 2nd year of Kocho).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Works of Shinran Shonin </strong></span><br><br>(1) The True Teaching, Practice and Realization of the Pure Land Way (Ken Jodo Shinjitsu Kyogyosho Monrui)<br>(2) Hymns of the Pure Land (Jodo Wasan)<br>(3) Hymns of the Pure Land Masters (Koso Wasan)<br>(4) Hymns of the Dharma Ages (Shozomatsu Wasan)<br>(5) Passages on the Pure Land Way (Jodo Monrui Jusho)<br>(6) Notes on the Inscriptions On Sacred Scrolls (Songo Shunzo Meimon)<br>(7) Notes on Essentials of Faith Alone (Yuishinsho Mon-i)<br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Notes on Once Calling and Many Calling (Ichinen Tanen Mon-i)<br>(9) Gutoku's Notes (Gutoku Sho)<br>(10) Gatha on the Two Gates of Entering and Leaving (Nyushutsu Nimonge)<br>(11) Passanges from the Three Sutras on Birth in the Pure Land (Jodo Sangyo Ojon Mon-rui)<br>(12) Notes on the Two Kinds of Merit Transference (Nyorai Nishu Ekomon)<br>(13) The Virtue of the Name of Amida Tathagata (Mida Nyorai Myogo Toku)<br>(14) On the Forty-eight Vows (Shiju-hachi Daigan)<br>(15) A Torchlight to the Latter Age (Mattosho)<br>(16) Letters of Shinran (Goshosokushu)<br>(17) Sayings of Zendo (Zendo Kasho Gon)<br>(1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Notes Lamenting Differences (Tannisho) - A collection of Shinran's Teaching by Yuien<br><br></div>

It was during this era when the old order was crumbling, however, that Japanese Buddhism, which had been declining into formalism for several centuries, underwent intense renewal, giving birth to new paths to enlightenment and spreading to every level of society.<br><br>Shinran was born into the aristocratic Hino family, a branch of the Fujiwara clan, and his father, Arinori, at one time served at court. At the age of nine, however, Shinran entered the Tendai temple on Mt. Hiei, where he spent twenty years in monastic life. From the familiarity with Buddhist writings apparent in his later works, it is clear that he exerted great effort in his studies during this period. He probably also performed such practices as continuous recitation of the nembutsu for prolonged periods.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Conversion</span><br>After twenty years, however, he despaired of ever attaining awakening through such discipline and study; he was also discouraged by the deep corruption that pervaded the mountain monastery. Years earlier, Honen Shonin (1133-1212) had descended Mt. Hiei and begun teaching a radically new understanding of religious practice, declaring that all self-generated efforts toward enlightenment were tainted by attachments and therefore meaningless. Instead of such practice, one should simply say the nembutsu, not as a contemplative exercise or means of gaining merit, but by way of wholly entrusting oneself to Amida's Vow to bring all beings to enlightenment.<br><br>When he was twenty-nine, Shinran undertook a long retreat at Rokkakudo temple in Kyoto to determine his future course. At dawn on the ninety-fifth day, Prince Shotoku appeared to him in a dream. Shinran took this as a sign that he should seek out Honen, and went to hear his teaching daily for a hundred days. He then abandoned his former Tendai practices and joined Honen's movement.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Exile</span><br>At this time, however, the established temples were growing jealous of Honen, and in 1207 they succeeded in gaining a government ban on his nembutsu teaching. Several followers were executed, and Honen and others, including Shinran, were banished from the capital.<br><br>Shinran was stripped of his priesthood, given a layman's name, and exiled to Echigo (Niigata) on the Japan Sea coast. About this time, he married Eshinni and began raising a family. He declared himself "neither monk nor layman." Though incapable of fulfilling monastic discipline or good works, precisely because of this, he was grasped by Amida's compassionate activity. He therefore chose for himself the name Gutoku, "foolish/shaven," indicating the futility of attachment to one's own intellect and goodness.<br><br>He was pardoned after five years, but decided not to return to Kyoto. Instead, in 1214, at the age of forty-two, he made his way into the Kanto region, where he spread the nembutsu teaching for twenty years, building a large movement among the peasants and lower samurai.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Return to Kyoto</span><br>Then, in his sixties, Shinran began a new life, returning to Kyoto to devote his final three decades to writing. He did not give sermons or teach disciples, but lived with relatives, supported by gifts from his followers in the Kanto area. After his wife returned to Echigo to oversee property there, he was tended by his youngest daughter, Kakushinni.<br><br>It is from this period that most of his writings stem. He completed his major work, popularly known as Kyogyoshinsho, and composed hundreds of hymns in which he rendered the Chinese scriptures accessible to ordinary people. At this time, problems in understanding the teaching arose among his followers in the Kanto area, and he wrote numerous letters and commentaries seeking to resolve them.<br><br>There were people who asserted that one should strive to say the nembutsu as often as possible, and others who insisted that true entrusting was manifested in saying the nembutsu only once, leaving all else to Amida. Shinran rejected both sides as human contrivance based on attachment to the nembutsu as one's own good act. Since genuine nembutsu arises from true entrusting that is Amida's working in a person, the number of times it is said is irrelevant.<br><br>Further, there were some who claimed that since Amida's Vow was intended to save people incapable of good, one should feel free to commit evil. For Shinran, however, emancipation meant freedom not to do whatever one wished, but freedom from bondage to the claims of egocentric desires and emotions. He therefore wrote that with deep trust in Amida's Vow, one came to genuine awareness of one's own evil.<br><br>Near the end of his life, Shinran was forced to disown his eldest son Zenran, who caused disruptions among the Kanto following by claiming to have received a secret teaching from Shinran. Nevertheless, his creative energy continued to his death at ninety, and his works manifest an increasingly rich, mature, and articulate vision of human existence that reveals him to be one of Japan's most profound and original religious thinkers.<br><br>(from Nishi Hongwanji English website http://www2.hongwanji.or.jp/english/shinranshonin.html)[/img]<br><br><strong>Sanath's note:<br>Shinran Shonin's 750th Memorial Services will be held from April 2011 to January 2012 at the Nishi Hongwanji in Kyoto as well as various Shin temples in Japan and overseas.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.jodo.org/about_hs/img/teachings01.jpg"><br><br>Honen (also Honen Bo Genku) (1133-1212) is the founder of the first independent branch of Japanese Pure Land Buddhism known as Jodo Shu. Jodo is Japanese for 'The Pure Land' and shu is Japanese for 'sect'.<br><br>Early life<br>Honen was born in Mimasaka province to a prominent family. His father was Uruma no Tokikuni, a province official who headed up policing in the area. His mother was of the Hada clan, whose ancestry could be traced back to the silk merchants of China. Honen was originally named Seishi-maru after the bodhisattva Seishi (Mahasthamaprapta in Sanskrit). In 1141 Hōnen's father was assassinated by Sada-akira, an official sent to the province to govern by Emperor Toba. It is believed that Tokikuni's last words to his son were, "Don't hate the enemy but become a monk and pray for me and for your deliverance."[1] Fulfilling his father's wishes for him, Hōnen was initiated into his uncle's monastery at the age of 9. From then on, Honen lived his life as a monk, and eventually studied at the primary Tendai temple at Mount Hiei, located near Kyoto.<br><br>Honen was highly regarded by the other members of the Mt. Hiei community as both as wise and devout. Tendai training at Mt. Hiei was concerned with turning followers into clerics, underpinned by a notion that the clerics were spiritually superior to laypersons. Clerics took the bosatsukai (vows of the Bodhisattva) and then undertook 12 years of training at Mt. Hiei; a system which was developed by Saicho, founder of Tendai Buddhism in Japan.<br><br>Departure from Mt. Hiei<br>As Honen began approaching middle age at Mt. Hiei, he began to rethink the Tendai system. During this period, Honen read a work known as Kuan-ching shu (Kuan-wu-liang-shou-fo-ching-shu; "Commentary on the Pure Land Meditation Sutra", also referred to as Amitayur-dhyana-sutra, Kammuryoju-kyo or Kuan-wu liang-shou ching) authored by Chinese Pure Land master Shan-tao. This commentary persuaded Honen to believe that nembutsu was all one needed to enter Amida Buddha's Pure Land. He believed that it didn't matter what social, religious or intellectual ranks a person belonged to. Honen held that nembutsu was available for absolutely anyone. This new appreciation and understanding Honen held for nembutsu is what prompted him to leave Mt. Hiei and the Tendai tradition in 1175[2].<br><br>Honen relocated to the district of Otani[3] in Kyoto where he started addressing crowds of men and women, establishing a considerable following. According to legend, Honen attracted prostitutes, butchers, fortune-tellers, and other elements of society normally excluded from Buddhist practice. Honen also distinguished himself by not discriminating against women who were having their menstruation[citation needed]. Honen was a man of recognotion in Kyoto, and many priests and nobleman allied with him. Among them was an imperial regent named Kujo Kanezane (1149-1207). By 1204 Honen had a group of disciples numbering around 190[4], ranging from laypersons to samurai. This number is derived from the number of signatures found on his Shichikajo kishomon ('Seven Article Pledge'), a guideline for rules of conduct in the Jodo Shu. Shinran, of course, was a member of his following. Other key disciples include Shinku (1146-122<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, Genchi (1183-123<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, Ryukan (1148-1227), Kansai (1148-1200), Kosai (1163-1247), and Anrakubo (? -1207)[5].<br><br>Nembutsu Ban<br>[6]In 1204 other schools were also teaching nembutsu as a component of a broader practice, but Honen was teaching nembutsu as the one and only means of practice. Honen tried to keep his teachings somewhat secretive, as he understood the ramifications. This teaching meant that he was in opposition with all the other schools of Buddhism at the time, including those sects that had different interpretations of the Pure Land. This same year the monks at Mt. Hiei implored their head priest Shinso (1167-1230) to ban the teachings of exclusive nembutsu and to banish any adherents from their principality.<br><br>In 1205 the temple of Kofuku-ji, located in Nara, Nara, implored the Emperor Go-Toba to sanction Honen and his followers. The temple provided the emperor with 9 charges alleging unappeasable differences with the so-called eight schools. Honen's detractors cited examples of Honen's followers who committed vandalism against Buddhist temples that would pay homage to Buddhas other than Amitabha.<br><br>The clamour surrounding Honen's teachings grew fierce over the following years, when finally in 1207 Go-Toba implemented a ban against exclusive nembutsu, exiling Honen and Shinran and executing many adherents. Eight nembutsu priests were exiled along with Honen. Honen's response was characteristic:<br><br>"I have labored here in the capital these many years for the spread of the Nembutsu, and so I have long wished to get away into the country to preach to those on field and plain, but the time never came for the fulfillment of my wish. Now, however, by the august favor of His Majesty, circumstances have combined to enable me to do so."[7].<br><br>Honen was exiled to Tosa, but the movement in Kyoto had not thoroughly gone away. Also, the teachings spread abroad as a result of exiling the different teachers into different regions. In 1211 the nembutsu ban was ultimately lifted, and Honen was premitted to return to Kyoto. That following year in 1212 Honen died in Kyoto, never having seen Shinran since their exile in 1207.[8]<br><br><strong>Sanath's note:<br>Honen Shonin's 800th Memorial services will be held in 2011 at various Jodo Shu temples in Japan and overseas.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(split into two parts, continued from previous post)<br><br>Character<br>Analysis of various historical documents by the Jodo Shu Research Institute suggests several obvious characteristics of Honen's personality:[1]<br><br>a strict master<br>introspective and self-critical<br>a bold innovator<br>a critic of scholasticism<br>a man more concerned with solving the problems of daily life rather than worrying about doctrinal matters<br>On the latter point Honen expressed unusual concern over the spiritual welfare of women. In teaching to them, regardless of social status (from aristocracy to prostitutes), he particularly rejected the significance of menstruation; which wider Japanese religious culture considered to cause spiritual defilement. As a consequence the role of women in the Jodo Shu sects has often been greater than in some other Japanese Buddhist traditions.<br><br>About himself Honen reportedly said:<br><br>[I lack] the wisdom to teach others. Ku Amida Butsu of Hosshoji, though less intelligent, contributes in leading the people to the Pure Land as an advocate of the nembutsu. After death, if I could be born in the world of humans, I would like to be born a very ignorant man and to diligently practice the nembutsu. (Tsuneni Oserarekeru Okotoba - Common Sayings of Honen) [2]<br><br>Honen's teachings are briefly summarised in his final work, the Ichimai Kishomon (One Sheet Document):<br><br>"In China and Japan, many Buddhist masters and scholars understand that the nembutsu is to meditate deeply on Amida Buddha and the Pure Land. However, I do not understand the nembutsu in this way. Reciting the nembutsu does not come from studying and understanding its meaning. There is no other reason or cause by which we can utterly believe in attaining birth in the Pure Land than the nembutsu itself. Reciting the nembutsu and believing in birth in the Pure Land naturally gives rise to the three minds (sanjin) and the four modes of practice (shishu). If I am withholding any deeper knowledge beyond simple recitation of the nembutsu, then may I lose sight of the compassion of Shakyamuni and Amida Buddha and slip through the embrace of Amida's original vow. Even if those who believe in the nembutsu deeply study all the teachings which Shakyamuni taught during his life, they should not put on any airs and should practice the nembutsu with the sincerity of those untrained followers ignorant of Buddhist doctrines. I hereby authorize this document with my hand print. The Jodo Shu way of the settled mind (anjin) is completely imparted here. I, Genku, have no other teaching than this. In order to prevent misinterpretation after my passing away, I make this final testament."<br><br>Honen's practical advice on practicing the nembutsu can be summed up in these two statements:<br><br>"If, because it is taught that birth is attained with but one or ten utterances, you say the Nembutsu heedlessly, then faith is hindering practice. If, because it is taught that you should say the Name without abandoning it from moment to moment, you believe one or ten utterances to be indecisive, then practice is hindering faith. As your faith, accept that birth is attained with a single utterance; as your practice, endeavour in the Nembutsu throughout life."<br><br>"Only repeat the name of Amida with all your heart. Whether walking or standing, sitting or lying, never cease the practice of it even for a moment. This is the very work which unfailingly issues in salvation..." (Honen quoting Shan-tao)[9]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.dharmanet.com.br/amitabha/rennyo3.jpg"><br><br>Rennyo (1415-1499) was the 8th abbot of the Jodo Shinshu sect of Buddhism and is often referred to as the restorer of the sect (or, the second founder), and for this is also referred to as Rennyo Shonin ("eminent monk"). Rennyo is responsible for a revitalization period in Jodo Shinshu history where in which the religion was popularized for the masses. Despite being a pacifist, his populist attitude and charismatic preaching indirectly and inadvertently led into the IkkÃ´-ikki revolts in which mobs of monks, peasants and farmers launched organized attacks on their feudal rulers. He was also known as Shinsho-in, and posthumously Etoh Daishi.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Early life</span><br>Rennyo (1415-1499) was conceived out of wedlock. His life was both spectacular as well as troubled. At the age of 18 his father, Zonnyo, the 7th Abbott of Hongwanji, impregnated a servant (her name is not known). Being that Zonnyo was of a much higher ranking and stature in society, Rennyo's mother was sent away when he was only 6 years old. This estrangement had a long lasting impact on Rennyo throughout childhood and as an adult. Several times throughout his life he attempted to find his birth mother with no result. Rennyo also did not get along with his step mother, Nyeon.<br><br>Times were hard in Japan at the time even for the aristocracy. When Rennyo was to take over Hongwanji to succeed his father's role as head priest, his step mother Nyeon attempted to have her own son Ogen (1433-1503) installed as the head. Were it not for Rennyo's uncle Nyojo (1412-1460) scoffing at the idea, such a fate may very well have befallen him. So Rennyo's ascension unto power did not come without peril.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rennyo the Restorer</span><br>Following his installation as 8th head priest at Honganji in 1457, Rennyo demonstrated leadership capabilities. He immediately began mobilizing the sect's focus in the Omi Province and creating converts there, an area dominated by the Bukkoji and Kinshokuji branches of Shinshu. Honganji had a a good supporter in that region already established named Hoju, whom was head of the Katada congregation. He also had supporters in the town of Kanegamori, a network of friends that were of good status in society and crucial to his establishment as a competent leader. The monies generated in these regions really helped to solidify Hoganji's defenses from sectarian attack early in Rennyo's reign.<br><br>Soon Rennyo's influence spread into Mikawa Province, an area traditionally dominated by the Senjuji branch of Shinshu. He did this by making many appearances in these areas and presenting groups with his own commentaries on Shinran's works.<br><br>Enryakuji (the head temple of the Tendai School located on Mt. Hiei) was taking notice of all the ground being made by Rennyo in the provinces around Kyoto. In 1465, Mt. Hiei sent a band of sohei ("warrior monks") to the Hongwanji and destroyed the entire temple multiplex. The supposed justification given for the attack were claims that the Jodo Shinshu movement was heretical. The actual motivation for these attacks was financial. Mt. Hiei had significant interests in the Omi Province that included properties and businesses, and they felt they needed to prevent Jodo Shinshu's growth before they felt the economic effects. However, due to the wealth of the congregations Rennyo had converted in the area, enough money was raised to bribe the Mt. Hiei warriors in exchange for peace. The contingency to this was that Hongwanji must become a member of Mt. Hiei's temples, thus entering them into yearly dues they had to pay Mt. Hiei. Rennyo was very nervous during this period, for just when Hongwanji was at the pinnacle of uniting the disbanded factions of Shinran, Mt. Hiei reduced the Omi temple to rubble.<br><br>The years immediately following the attack of 1465 forced Rennyo to live a nomadic life. It was not until the Yamashina Hongwanji temple (Kyoto) was built in 1480 that he would be able to take permanent residence again. All of this was occurring at the height of the Ã”nin War in Japan, making security ever more an issue for Rennyo. He could not depend on any outside forces to protect his congregations. None of this stopped Rennyo's mission, as he continued to amass more converts in new areas such as Settsu Province and Yoshino Province. In 1469 he would make a trip to the KantÃ´ region, where he found the Shinshu orders there open to his new and refreshing teachings. This was despite the fact that Senjuji dominated the region. When pondering where to rebuild Hoganji, Rennyo made a pivotal move and decided to build it as far away from the influence of Mt. Hiei as possible.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(continued from the previous post)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hongwanji Rebuilds</span><br>Rennyo decided to rebuild Hongwanji in Echizen Province (the Hokuriku area), a remote area that showed a lot of promise as it was near a coastal route. Once established the place flourished and adherents from surrounding provinces came to hear Rennyo speak. The congregation became so big that along the way to the new Hongwanji there were hundreds of lodges set up and run by Shinshu priests to lodge the travellers. By 1475, Rennyo returned to the Kyoto provinces with such a following that Mt. Hiei could no longer pose a credible threat to Jodo Shinshu again. Rennyo had secured such status in the Jodo Shinshu ranks that he had to begin issuing pastoral letters (or, Ofumi) in place of appearances to congregations.<br><br>During this time, Rennyo established a new form of liturgy (gongyo), incorporating elements that would eventually become the core of Hongwanji Jodo Shinshu Buddhism. He also rewrote many Buddhist texts into kana, the simple, phonetic Japanese characters, making the texts more accessible for the common person. In 1496, Rennyo sought solitude and retired to a rural area at the mouth of the Yodo River, where he built a small hermitage. The area was known for its "long slope," or "O-saka" in Japanese. Contemporary documents about Rennyo's life and his hermitage were thus the first to refer to this place by the name Osaka. Rennyo's isolation did not last long, however; his hermitage grew quickly into a temple and surrounding temple town (jinaimachi) as devotees gathered to pay him homage and to hear his teachings. By the time of Rennyo's death three years later (in 1499), the complex had come to be known as the Ishiyama Hongwanji, and was close to the final shape which would prove to be the greatest fortified temple in Japanese history.<br><br>Meanwhile, the broader IkkÃ´ movement, being based on the power of commoners, governed itself, and grew of its own accord, growing in influence in Kaga and Echizen Provinces, and becoming increasingly resentful of the control of the secular authorities. In 1488, they drove out the Constable of Kaga, a daimyo by the name of Togashi, and effectively took control of the entire province. The IkkÃ´-ikki then went on to defeat the Asakura clan warriors from Echizen, who had been sent by the Shogunate to stop them.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Writings</span><br>Rennyo Shonin was the author of several works relating to Jodo Shinshu doctrine. His most influential work is his collection of letters to various Shin monto (lay groups), popularly known as Gobunsho. These letters have the status of scriptural texts and some are used in Shin liturgy; the most well-known letter is the Hakkotsu no sho ("Letter on White Ashes"), a reflection on the impermanence of life and the importance of relying on Amida Buddha's Vow. This letter is frequently read aloud during Shin funeral services.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Legacy</span><br>Such was Rennyo's importance in reviving Shinran's teachings that he is revered by devotees as the 'second founder' of the Jodo Shinshu tradition. At the same time, however, there is ongoing debate amongst sectarian scholars as to whether Rennyo's legacy was good for the Jodo Shinshu or not. On the one hand Rennyo gave the disorganized Shinshu movement a coherent structure, translated Shinran's teachings into simpler language, and developed a common liturgy. On the other hand the process of institutionalisation which Rennyo introduced arguably damaged Shinshu's egalitarian origins and led to a disjunction between priest-scholars and lay-devotees contrary to Shinran's intention, but more in common with other Japanese Buddhist traditions. Furthermore Rennyo undoubtedly introduced certain doctrinal elements of the rival Seizan Jodo Shu tradition into the Shinshu, and also tolerated Shinto Kami belief to a greater extent than Shinran. Ultimately though such debates are moot as without Rennyo's efforts the Shinshu would almost certainly have fragmented and been absorbed by other sects.<br><br>His 500th memorial service was observed in 1998.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Dengyo Daishi and the Tendai School</strong></span><br><br><img src="http://www.tendai.org/i_tendai_buddhism/images/saicho.jpg"><br><br>When Dengyo Daishi visited China in 804 CE, Buddhism had already existed in Japan for more than two hundred years. Traditions regarding when Buddhism was first introduced to Japan vary, with some saying it was in 538 CE and others in 552; but all sources agree that the first official Buddhist mission to Japan arrived from the Kingdom of Paekche (later known as Korea), and that the Â“KugeÂ” or aristocratic class of the Imperial Court adopted the new religion very quickly. Under the famous patronage of the Prince Shotoku, six of the principal schools of Chinese Buddhism were established in the Imperial city of Nara, Japan, each with their particular doctrines and practices. However, the practices of these Â“Nara SchoolsÂ” was limited to their monasteries and Temples, and the court aristocracy who patronized them.<br><br>The monk known as Saicho to his contemporaries (posthumously named Dengyo Daishi) was born in 767 in the city of Omi-no-Kuni in ancient Omi province, now in Shiga Prefecture. The son of a pious Buddhist, and probably descended from Chinese immigrants, Saicho was ordained as a priest of the Kegon school in the famous Todai-ji Temple in Nara. However, just three months after being ordained, Saicho left crowded Nara and ascended lonely Mt. Hiei in his native Omi province, and there built a secluded mountain hermitage that, in time, developed into the greatest complex of Buddhist temples in all of Japan. By constant observance of the Dharma and perhaps by interaction with the famous mountain mystics known as the Yamabushi, Saicho consciously purified his sense-faculties in preparation for the work of spreading the Dharma. While on Mt. Hiei, Saicho began studying the works of Chih-i, which had a decisive effect upon his religious orientation. When he eventually began to preach a series of lectures on the meaning of the Lotus Sutra, Saicho attracted the following of the powerful Wake clan, through whom the young monk came to the favorable attention of the Imperial court. When the Imperial court sponsored several promising monks for travel to China for advanced Buddhist studies, Saicho was already the most prominent name among those selected.<br><br>It is significant that the convoy of four ships that left Japan in 804 CE for China, included both Saicho (Dengyo Daishi), and Kukai (Kobo Daishi), two of the most revered founders of Japanese Buddhism. Saicho was senior to Kukai in both age and rank, but the young Kukai, destined to become the father of the Shingon school, was more charismatic and thus probably more likeable than the serious Saicho. When a storm struck the convoy and two of the four ships were lost, it was the good fortune of humanity that these two men survived the storm, each reaching China separately, thus ensuring that they would go separate ways in their pursuit of the Dharma. Saicho made his way directly to Mt. T'ien T'ai, and there studied the doctrines and works of Sakyamuni, Nagarjuna and Chih-i, while Kukai went on to study the Â“esotericÂ” forms of Buddhism in the city of CÂ’hang-an, eventually returning to Japan to establish the Shingon school of Buddhism.<br><br>On Mt. TÂ’ien TÂ’ai, Saicho received the Mahayana or Bodhisattva precepts from the sixth Patriarch of the TÂ’ien TÂ’ai school, as well as advanced Dharma instruction in the various chants, meditations and practices of the many schools of Chinese Buddhism. Carrying hundreds of sutras, treatises and commentaries with him, Saicho then set out to return to Japan. Along the road back, Saicho encountered the Chinese monk Shun-hsiao, a specialist in the esoteric forms of Buddhism, who duly initiated Saicho into the esoteric practices of mudras, mantras and mandalas. Thus, when Saicho finally returned to Japan, he carried with him the complete historical and philosophical legacy of the TÂ’ien TÂ’ai school, as well as knowledge of the esoteric rites of Buddhism, which henceforth became part of the Tendai legacy. It was this form of esoteric TÂ’ien TÂ’ai, for which the Imperial court authorized two new ordinands a year in 806 CE, thus officially marking the establishment of the Tendai school of Buddhism.<br><br>Central to Tendai thought as taught by Saicho, is the concept of Original Enlightenment (Hongaku shiso) - the idea that all beings are originally or inherently enlightened, and that liberation is immediately at hand if we can only awaken and cut through the delusions that keep us from seeing our true nature. The importance of this concept on the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism cannot be overstated, as much of that history was largely in response to Hongaku shiso. This concept, rooted in the central Buddhist belief that everything is interconnected, and expressed in phrases such as Â“1000 worlds in each momentÂ” (every person affecting everything and everybody at every moment), became seminal to the development of future Buddhism in Japan.<br><br>Saicho dedicated the rest of his life to the propagation of the Tendai school and Buddhism in general. Within a few decades, the Tendai school expanded far beyond the confines of Mt. Hiei, and Tendai temples were established as far away as the island of Kyushu in the south, and in the province of Shimotsuke in the north. After his death in 822 CE, Saicho was formally invested with the title of Dengyo Daishi or Â“Grand Master of the Propagation of the Doctrine.Â” Because the Tendai school later gave rise to all of the Kamakura-era schools of Japanese Buddhism, the effect of the life of Dengyo Daishi has been to propagate the Dharma in every part of the world where some form of Japanese Buddhism is practiced.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(from http://www.tendai.org/i_tendai_buddhism/history.html)</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tendai</strong> (Japanese: Tendai-shu) is a Japanese school of Mahayana Buddhism, a descendant of the Chinese Tiantai or Lotus Sutra school.<br><br>History<br>The Tiantai teaching was first brought to Japan by the Chinese monk Jianzhen (Jp: Ganjin) in the middle of the 8th century, but it was not widely accepted. In 805, the Japanese monk SaichÃ´ (also called DengyÃ´ Daishi) returned from China with new Tiantai texts and made the temple that he had built on Mt. Hiei, Enryakuji, a center for the study and practice of what became Japanese Tendai.<br><br>Philosophically, the Tendai school did not deviate substantially from the beliefs that had been created by the Tiantai school in China. However, what SaichÃ´ transmitted from China was not exclusively Tiantai, but also included Zen, esoteric MikkyÃ´, and Vinaya School elements. The tendency to include a range of teachings became more marked in the doctrines of SaichÃ´'s successors, such as Ennin and Enchin.<br><br>The Tendai sect flourished under the patronage of the imperial family and nobility in Japan; in 784, the Imperial capital was moved from Nara to nearby Kyoto. Tendai Buddhism became the dominant form of main-stream Buddhism in Japan for many years, and gave rise to most of the developments in later Japanese Buddhism. Nichiren, Honen, Shinran, and DogenÂ—all famous thinkers in non-Tendai schools of Japanese BuddhismÂ—were all initially trained as Tendai monks. Japanese Buddhism was dominated by the Tendai school to a much greater degree than Chinese Buddhism was by its forebearer, the Tiantai.<br><br>Due to its patronage and growing popularity among the upper classes, the Tendai sect became not only respected, but also politically and even militarily powerful. During the Kamakura Period, the Tendai school used its patronage to try to oppose the growth of rival factionsÂ—particularly the Nichiren school, which began to grow in power among the merchant middle class, and the Pure Land school, which eventually came to claim the loyalty of many of the poorer classes. Enryakuji, the temple complex on Mt. Hiei, became a sprawling center of power, attended not only by ascetic monks, but also by brigades of warrior monks (sohei) who fought in the temple's interest. As a result, in 1571 Enryakuji was razed by Oda Nobunaga as part of his campaign to unify Japan. Nobunaga regarded the Mt. Hiei monks as a potential threat or rival, as they could employ religious claims to attempt to rally the populace to their side. The temple complex was later rebuilt, and continues to serve as the head temple of the Tendai school today.<br><br>Tendai Doctrine<br>Tendai Buddhism has several philosophical insights which allow for the reconciliation of Buddhist doctrine with aspects of Japanese culture such as Shinto and traditional aesthetics. It is rooted in the idea, fundamental to Mahayana Buddhism, that Buddha-hood, the capability to attain enlightenment, is intrinsic in all things. Also central to Mahayana is the notion that the phenomenal world, the world of our experiences, fundamentally is an expression of the Buddhist law (Dharma). This notion poses the problem of how we come to have many differentiated experiences. Tendai Buddhism claims that each and every sense phenomenon just as it is is the expression of Dharma. For Tendai, the ultimate expression of Dharma is the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, the fleeting nature of all sense experiences consists in the Vairocana Buddha's preaching of the doctrine of Lotus Sutra. The existence and experience of all unenlightened beings is fundamentally equivalent and undistinguishable from the teachings of the Lotus Sutra.<br><br>This philosophical insight taken from Chinese Tiantai Buddhism allowed for Japanese practitioners to adapt Tiantai doctrine to several outside influences, which created the uniquely Japanese variant of Tendai. The first of these adaptations was the introduction of Shingon esoteric ritual (Mikkyo) into Tendai Buddhism. Eventually, according to Tendai Taimitsu doctrine, the esoteric rituals came to be considered of equal importance with the exoteric teachings of the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, by chanting Mantras, maintaining Mudras, or performing certain meditations, one is able to see that the sense experiences are the teachings of Buddha, have faith that one is inherently an enlightened being, and one can attain enlightnenment within this very body. This is very different from other Buddhist schools, particularly of Theravada Buddhism, which maintain that it takes many lifetimes to attain enlightenment.<br><br>Tendai doctrine allowed Japanese Buddhists to reconcile Buddhist teachings with the native religion of Japan, Shinto, and with traditional Japanese aesthetics. In the case of Shinto, the difficulty is the reconciliation of the heavenly pantheon of Japanese gods, as well as with the myriad spirits associated with places, shrines or objects, with the Buddhist doctrine that one should not concern oneself with any religious practice save the pursuit of enlightenment. However, priests of the Tendai sect argued that Kami are simply representations of the truth of universal buddha-hood that descend into the world to help and teach mankind. Thus, they are actually equivalent with Buddhas. This doctrine, however, regards Kami as more sacred. While Buddhas represent the possibility of attaining enlightentment through many lifetimes of work and devotion to Dharma, Kami are manifest representations of the universal buddha-hood. Therefore, they exemplify the ultimate truth that all things are inherently enlightened and that it is possible for a person of sufficient religious faculties to attain enlightenment instantly within this very body. Thus are they of more holy nature than Buddhas. Those Kami that Shinto regards as violent or antagonistic to mankind are considered as simply supernatural beings that reject the Buddhist law and have not attained enlightenment. Thus are they violent and evil.<br><br>The fundamental teaching of Buddhism is that one must shed away worldly attachments and desires in order to attain enlightenment. This has created a conflict with the culture of every society into which Buddhism was introduced. If one is to shed worldly pleasures and attachments, this requires that such flowers of culture as poetry, literature, and visual arts be discarded. By claiming that the phenomenal world is not distinct from Dharma, Tendai doctrine allows for the reconciliation of beauty and aesthetics with Buddhist teachings. Poetry, which once was a sin to be cast away, now in fact can lead to enlightenment. Contemplation of poetry, provided that it is done in the context of Tendai doctrine, is simply contemplation of Dharma. This same thing can be said of every other form of art. Therefore, it is possible to construct an aesthetic that is not in conflict with Buddhism.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(from Wikipedia)</span></div>

(Kyodo) About 15 mothers and children mash up boiled soybeans at the command of Joko Yoshii, a 33-year-old Buddhist priest clad in a black clerical garment. They are making miso at a class in a Buddhist temple north of Tokyo.<br><br><img src="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/images/photos2007/nn20070525f1a.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Mothers and kids make miso under the direction of Buddhist priest Joko Yoshii in the main hall of Zengyoji Temple in Kawaguchi, Saitama Prefecture, in February. KYODO PHOTO</span><br><br>Their final job in the main hall of Yoshii's temple, where the principal Amida Buddha statue is enshrined, is to mix the mashed beans with salt and "koji," a fermenting agent. The mixture will be left for half a year to produce miso, an indispensable part of the traditional Japanese-style breakfast.<br><br>"Miso-making was easier than I had expected. I had never visited any temple except during Bon. But I'm surprised at the openness of this temple," said Emiko Murakami, a 35-year-old housewife who was attending the class with her two sons.<br><br>Buddhist temples used to thrive on support from strong networks of local parishioners, but recently they have been criticized for entering people's lives only in times of death as community and family ties continue to fade in the shadow of Japan's postwar modernization.<br><br>Yoshii, the second son of a priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji branch of the Jodo Shinshu (True Pure Land) sect headquartered in Kyoto, started his working life as a tour conductor at a travel agency. He initially considered the idea of becoming a priest unattractive, but changed his mind when he turned 25.<br><br>He then got a job as a preacher at a temple run by Jodo Shinshu in Fresno, Calif., in 1999 after he passed a qualifying exam sponsored by the sect, which has nearly 7 million members, of whom about 80 percent are Americans of Japanese origin. He spent two years preparing for the exam.<br><br>Yoshii graduated from a Buddhist-affiliated university and launched his own temple, Zengyoji, in Kawaguchi, Saitama Prefecture, in June 2006 with support from Jodo Shinshu based on his five-year experience in Fresno.<br><br>Jodo Shinshu, founded by Shinran (1173-1263), is different and independent of the Jodoshu (Pure Land School) sect, which was founded by Honen (1133-1212). Its doctrine centers on absolute trust in Amida Buddha's saving power. Shinran was a disciple of Honen.<br><br>Along with preaching, Yoshii sponsors a series of traditional seasonal festivals and ceremonies at his temple, such as bean-throwing for "setsubun" (the seasonal divide) in spring to "drive out devils" and the pounding of "mochi" (sticky rice) for the New Year. The events used to draw just his wife and two sons, but now they average about 100 people a month.<br><br>"In the past, Buddhist temples had been playing the role of local community center in education and festival activities. I hope my temple becomes a place where neighbors talk to each other about both what brings them joy and pain. These events are to create such an environment," Yoshii said at the main hall, where children were running around chasing each other.<br><br>In his Fresno days, the temple where Yoshii served was a base for volunteer activities and fun events, such as dancing the hula and playing drums, with discussions on serious issues such as love and life and death.<br><br>A husband decided to change his career from lawyer to monk after his wife died saying a prayer to the Amida Buddha, who in Buddhist lore is believed to live in the Western Pure Land. Yoshii also quoted a former Christian member as saying, "Amida Buddha is to save the lives of all beings. That is love."<br><br>"The Fresno temple was not only for the aged but for local residents, who help each other and enjoy their life together as people did at Buddhist temples in Japan in the past," Yoshii said.<br><br>Noriyuki Ueda, 49, an associate professor of cultural anthropology at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, was shocked when he heard one of his students tell him that she visits a church rather than a temple when she needs help because a temple is "likely to shut the door on me."<br><br>"Modern Buddhism does not respond to our anguish," Ueda said. "The religion has to become a 'listening' one and not a 'preaching' one. The traditional communities have already collapsed in the face of the widening disparities. Buddhist temples currently number less than 80,000, but they could change Japan's mental scenery if they listen to people's troubles and embody a place to show mercy," the prominent anthropologist said.<br><br>A survey conducted by the Japan Buddhist Federation found that about 70 percent of resident monks at some 2,000 temples throughout the country said local people want the traditional Buddhist world to provide overall care, while only 30 percent said they believed it did so. In particular, they said not enough is done to help the weak and protect the environment, the survey said.<br><br>But when asked whether their own temples responded to such local expectations, some 60 percent of the polled said, "Yes."<br><br>"This gap reflects a sense of crisis and complaints about the present Buddhist leaders by resident monks, who are trying to respond to local hopes but feel the limits of their power," said Satoru Eguchi, director of public relations at the federation.<br><br>Kotaro Sugiura, a 58-year-old civil servant in Kawaguchi, paid a visit to Zengyoji at the end of November 2006 to ask for a Buddhist service for his elder son, who had died at age 24 one month earlier.<br><br>The service marked the 49th day since his death, a traditional memorial day for the recently departed in Japan. Sugiura had balked at using a priest introduced by a funeral company.<br><br>"I felt an absence of absolutes for the first time in my life and began to think about what religion is. I could not have taught a way of life to my late son. I hope to play a role in listening to others' anguish, while studying Buddhism," said Sugiura, who has started to go to Zengyoji monthly with his family.<br><br>Outenin Temple in Osaka's Tennoji Ward is one of many Buddhist temples like Zengyoji that aim to turn themselves into places for "learning, healing and fun." Since 1997, the Osaka temple, which has no parish or graveyard, has held more than 50 events such as symposiums, movies and plays at its theater hall, where about 30,000 youths attend annually.<br><br>"It will take much time until our ideal Buddhist temples are achieved. It took a century in the United States," Yoshii said. "I'm satisfied if our grandchildren feel knowledge of Buddhism to be useful a century from now."<br><br>The Japan Times: Friday, May 25, 2007<br></div>
