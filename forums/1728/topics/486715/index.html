              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">By Victor MacGill</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">How
                  we represent our world</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The
                  generally accepted wisdom is that our brain creates our mind, making our mind a
                  product of our brain. It says that the neural activity in our brain generates
                  all our thoughts, emotions and everything we would see as mind. This way of
                  seeing the relationship between the brain and the mind has held us back from
                  examining alternative ways our brain and mind might be connected. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">When
                  we perceive things in the real world, we assume that what we perceive is really
                  there. We see a chair, an apple, or a candle and automatically assume they are
                  real. Other people look at the same objects and also see a chair, an apple and
                  a candle, adding to our sense that they are real.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The
                  candle gives off light, heat and, if we listen carefully, sounds. Whatever
                  actually is there in the real world reflects or sends out waves of energy at
                  different frequencies. Our ears can pick up the sound waves, our eyes the light
                  waves and our skin can sense the warmth of the candle. What we perceive is the
                  waves of energy coming from the object. We do not perceive the object itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Next,
                  when the waves of energy from the object reach us, they are translated into
                  electrical signals to be sent along the neural pathways to the brain. The
                  impulses are then sent to various places in the brain to be processed. The
                  messages from the eye, for example, are transferred to different parts of the
                  brain with some parts focusing on recognising colour, others shape, others
                  edges etc. Our perceptions are then cross referenced with our memories, linked
                  to our values and a myriad of other factors within the mind. Somehow, all this
                  information is then combined to create a coherent representation of whatever is
                  out there in the real world. We therefore never perceive the outside world
                  directly “as it is”. Everything we perceive in our world, all the objects, all
                  the people, and all the places can only ever be representations we create
                  within ourselves of the outside world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">We
                  can say then that we cannot directly know anything about what is outside our
                  body. We can only ever be aware of the signals our own body generates and sends
                  to the brain in response to what happens in the outside world. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If everything we perceive from outside our body is
                  only a representation of a reality “out there”, then our perceptions of our own
                  body are also still only representations. If we feel pain, itchiness, a nervous
                  stomach, or a sense of joy, we are not perceiving our body as it is, but rather
                  through a representation our mind has created of our body based on the
                  electrical signals generated within the body and interpreted in the brain. We
                  are so attached to perceiving our body and its sensations as being who we are,
                  that we assume they are real, indeed more real than what is outside us. After
                  all, what could be more me than my own heartbeat; yet even this is just a
                  representation. That also means that our physical brain, as we are able to
                  perceive, it is only a representation of itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">This means there is no real difference between what is
                  inside us and what is outside us. Everything we perceive, no matter whether it
                  comes from inside us or outside is just electrical messages that we interpret.
                  While we believe we have a clear sense of ourselves in our body and what is
                  outside, for the brain there is no difference between the messages received
                  from the outside world and those received from inside the body. They are all
                  just electrical signals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Once
                  we have perceived the world and created our representation of ourselves and the
                  world outside, we must then interact with it. The representation we make of the
                  outside world must be a very close match to the outside world. When we move our
                  arm out to reach for an object, the representation of our arm must match our
                  arm in the real world. The object we reach out to must be where our representation
                  of it is. Then the representation of our arm can reach out to the
                  representation of the object and touch it just at the point where the real arm
                  meets the object in the real world. We therefore project our representational
                  world outward to overlap with the real world so we can interact effectively in
                  it. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The
                  brain chooses what to perceive</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Another
                  aspect to consider is the in influence of our interpretations on how we
                  perceive our world. The brain uses a large amount of energy to fulfill its
                  functions. At rest, around 15% of our blood is sent to the brain. That means
                  anything we can do to reduce the amount of energy being used by the brain
                  reduces the amount of food we must provided for ourselves and leaves more
                  energy for other critical tasks. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The
                  brain therefore selectively chooses what to take notice of so it can economise
                  on its energy use. It looks for patterns that allow it to take “short cuts”.
                  For example, objects that are nearer tend to appear larger and objects that are
                  far away tend to be smaller. An object that grows bigger in the visual field is
                  likely to be moving towards us and vice versa. It is a very useful “rule of
                  thumb”, which saves an enormous amount of processing and is correct almost all
                  of the time. We have a whole raft of such rules of thumb we use as best guesses
                  so we can react effectively to a rapidly changing world. Our brain creates the
                  world it expects from the data it chooses. It generally works very well, but
                  sometimes the brain’s assumptions are not warranted. Occasionally, those best
                  guesses do not match the outside reality and we misperceive the world. This
                  forms the basis of optical illusions. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">It
                  is more important that the way we perceive is functional than it is accurate.
                  For example, if a ball is thrown to us, when the ball has reached point A, it
                  will take time for us to gather all the information and form the representation
                  of the ball coming towards us. That means that by the time we have a perception
                  of the ball a point A, it has moved to a closer point, say point B. That gap
                  would make it virtually impossible to catch the ball, so the mind uses a trick.
                  It calculates where it thinks the ball will be by the time it has been
                  processed (point B) and the ball is placed there in the representation of the
                  situation. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The
                  way we perceive our world depends on the apparatus we have for perceiving the
                  world. That includes our eyes, ears, tongue, nose and skin and the brain for
                  bringing it al together. This apparatus has evolved over the millennia using
                  natural selection to evolve the modes of sensing that work best. Other
                  creatures have developed different ways of sensing our world that are just as
                  valid, but create a very different perception of the world. Bees see ultra
                  violet light we cannot see. Dogs hear high pitched whistles we cannot see and
                  bats and dolphins use radar. They live in the same world as us but they
                  experience it very differently. Even amongst humans we have people who are
                  colour blind or other reasons they perceive the world very differently from us.
                  Our perceptual apparatus evolved as a result of environmental forces over
                  endless millennia, but equally our perception of the world has evolved due to
                  the nature of our apparatus, because the apparatus changes the way we perceive
                  our world. Each affects the other in a strange dance. We are constructed by our
                  environment while at the same time, we construct our environment. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">We
                  have thoughts and emotions about all our experiences that influences how we
                  perceive and interpret our world. We make decisions on what is safe and what is
                  dangerous, what is pleasant and what is not and make so many other distinctions
                  that influence what information from the outside world we choose to pay
                  attention to. We are drawn towards what is pleasant and repelled by what is unpleasant.
                  These thoughts and emotions affect our perception of the world we live in. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">What
                  we experience depends on what we choose to put into our awareness. We pay
                  particular attention to the parts of our world that are more critical to us.
                  For the Inuit people of the arctic, being able to distinguish the many
                  different types of snow and ice is vital for survival and so they have many
                  words to describe these types of snow and ice. Indigenous people living near
                  the equator do not have the need for such distinctions and so only have words
                  covering all types of snow and ice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">We
                  tend to notice that which reinforces our existing perceptual and belief
                  systems, so we see the world through the glasses of our belief systems. We
                  notice what reinforces our existing world view and tend to deny, distort or
                  ignore whatever contradicts with the world as we see it. It is not just a
                  matter of perceiving what is there. We are very much making it up as we go.
                  This is why we struggle with new situations we have not previously encountered. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Communication
                  with others</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">If
                  we are to communicate with the other people we share our environment, the way
                  we conceptualise and make sense of the world must be sufficiently aligned to
                  the ways the others do or we will not make sense to each other. We must come to
                  a set of shared understandings about the world and what it is like. Through our
                  interactions we evolve language, customs, and rules. This is the beginnings of
                  culture. This too creates circular evolution. As individuals interacting we
                  create culture, but once it is formed the culture then creates us, especially
                  as we bring up new generations within the culture. Culture also affects how we
                  see our environment and how we interact with it, while the environment
                  continues to affect culture. We start to see that we cannot see ourselves just
                  as separate beings in an external world, but take cognizance of our
                  interconnectedness in a seamless unitary flow of experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The
                  brain is not separate from our body. We tend to see our brain as separate from
                  the rest of our nervous system, but it is actually all one continuous system.
                  The nerves in our toes are as much of our whole nervous system as the nerves in
                  our brain. The brain controls the endocrine system releasing different hormones
                  into the body that have an enormous impact on our behaviour. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">All
                  the systems of the body are so heavily interconnected that it is hard to see
                  any of them as separate. We cannot really talk about the brain without talking
                  about the circulatory system and the respiratory systems or the endocrine
                  system or the tegumentary system. We are a whole system of interconnected
                  systems that appear separate on first glance, but a closer examination reveals
                  that we are far more.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Humans
                  use tools. They extend us out into the world. A hammer extends the length of
                  our arm and allows us to exert a greater force out in the world. When we hit
                  something with the hammer we feel it through our hand. The hammer becomes a
                  part of who we are blurring the boundary between us and the outside world. Now
                  with a computer, we can easily send an email to the other side of the world
                  extending our self conceptually right across the globe. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">We
                  hop into a car. It also becomes an extension of who we are. We control it the
                  same as we control our hand. Other objects we “own” similarly become extensions
                  of our self. Our house, our music collection, our clothes, and even our town
                  and our country are a part of us. If somebody does something to something we
                  “own”, we feel as though it has been done to us. This way we extend ourselves
                  far beyond our skin and our minds extends our sense of self far into the
                  outside world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">We
                  also extend that to other people with my wife, my family, my friend and my
                  employees. This is particularly potent because the other people in our world
                  respond to us and we respond to them. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">We
                  define our identity by comparing ourselves to the outside world. We notice that
                  in comparison to others that we are perhaps tall, intelligent, athletic, and
                  creative. This external information is the basis of our internal sense of self
                  and who we think we are. We must also ascribe an identity onto all the
                  creatures and objects in the same way. The world defines us and we define our
                  world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">When
                  another person does something, the same neurons light up in our brain as would
                  have if we have actually done that thing ourselves. It also happen if we
                  imagine doing something. The same neurons fire as if we had actually done it,
                  but not as strongly. Our brain cannot easily tell the difference between what
                  is real and what is imaginary. The brain can create its own reality that it
                  perceives as being just as real as the world outside. When we imagine and event
                  or replay an event in our lives, we truly do relive the event because the brain
                  responds in the same way. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">We
                  have a sense of empathy because we can mirror the world of others. Culture
                  links us so we can feel what others feel. If we see distress on someone’s face,
                  we feel distress. We link it to our feelings of distress. This is accurate
                  enough for us to enter each other’s world. What we present to the world creates
                  a “dialogue” which may be verbal or non-verbal entwining our being into a
                  bigger sense of being so we overlap in to each other. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">As
                  we interact with others, we respond to each other second by second. We do not
                  know how the other person will react to our actions. The exact course of a
                  conversation cannot be predicted and thus does not exist until it happens.
                  Neither participant knows how it will run and must respond in the moment. All
                  our human interactions exist as a type of dance, where we again overlap into
                  each other and may form a synergy where the parts interact to form a new
                  emergent whole; a conversation that could not have been previously predicted.
                  Life becomes a dance in which we do not have ultimate control, but do have
                  influence and a vital part to play in the whole. “You are a child of the
                  universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.”<a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="http://www.vmacgill.net/mind.html#_ftn1"><span style="color: windowtext;">&lt;!--[if

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">If
                  the mind is not restricted to the brain and some form of intelligence permeates
                  the universe in which we live, then many things that have been automatically
                  assumed to be impossible may be a natural consequence of the existence of this
                  decentralized mind. It would not be unreasonable for individual minds to be
                  connected and therefore enable communication directly between minds without the
                  need for verbal or other commonly used modes of communication. If minds extend
                  beyond the brain then maybe death need not necessarily see the end of mind. It
                  would explain esp, communication with the dead, synchronicity and other such
                  manifestations of the paranormal.</span></p>

                  Jung talks of the collective unconscious as a great pool of consciousness we
                  all share filled with extremely potent symbols and archetypes that guide much
                  of our lives. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Immanuel
                  Kant came to the conclusion that consciousness creates mind as a way of
                  experiencing itself. Ervin Laslzo talks of the quantum vacuum, which is a field
                  from which everything is created and to which everything returns. He proposes
                  that this field is actually conscious in itself and is thus the ground of all
                  being. Our human brain has evolved to the point where it can link into this
                  great universal consciousness and experience it in time and space through our
                  lives. We become this strange mix of being separate beings living our
                  individual lives, while at the same time we are all one intensely interacting
                  synergistic experience. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Over
                  the millennia many wisdom traditions have described our world in a similar way.
                  Both the Hindu and Buddhists describe the world we live in as an illusion
                  created by the mind and that our true nature is pure consciousness. In the
                  Christian tradition we have statements like “I am in the Father and the Father
                  is in me” (John 14:11) and the existence of a “body of Christ” that is Christ
                  in the world that all people may become a part, which can be understood in a
                  new light with this understanding of the nature of reality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We now have a whole new vision of how the world fits
                  together that fundamentally challenges the way we thought the world is. The new
                  vision is an exciting vision that enables us to see ourselves, those about us
                  and the world in a whole new vibrant, interconnected and synergistic whole that
                  lends a whole new dignity to being alive and being human and behoves us to take
                  responsibility for our place in creation. </span></p>
