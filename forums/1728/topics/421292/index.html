              <p>For health reason. I wanna improve my health. One of the way to tweak our health, I think is from diet. At least thats one of the important factor. So, I want to use a simple Buddhist solution to improve my health. I think one meal per day might help. Buddha practice it, so it seems promising isn't it?</p>

              <p>Middle age. Not young anymore. So wanna geng, try and find a way to improve the health, so as to practice as long as possible here on this earth. And die peacefully when I am real old, could just go take a nap and pass on, something like that.</p>
              <p>Buddha practice one meal per day isn't it? It should be good for health... Never mind. I will try it for a 2-3 days, and see how it goes. The plan is simple. Morning, 1-2 cups beverages, plus breakfast. Afternoon, one meal, one beverage. Thats it. No more food or water intake until the next morning...</p>

              There are monasteries in Thailand, where the older monks take only one meal a day, however, for those who are newly ordained, they are allowed to have two meals a day.
              I think it boils down to individual metabolism. some will require more especially if lead a busy lifestyle eg. some Venerables active spreading the Dharma.
              I have a campmate who took tonsure in Thailand, he found monastic very tough going, subsisting on one meal a day among others.

              not right path is extreme starving, rather than one meal a day. one meal a day is according to middle way. muslim also have fasting period for example. we both call it æ–‹ã€‚
              
              btw, zentist, u vegetarian? TCM also advocate our mind need to avoid æ€¨ï¼Œæ�¨ï¼Œæ�¼ï¼ŒåŠªï¼Œçƒ¦ to be healthy.

There are many ways to improve health though, you might want to first start on basic things like avoiding animal fats in your foods and exercising every day. Start off slowly with lighter meals and slowly condition your body throughout a period of time. Rushing apparently doesn't help at all.</p></div>

              <p>Our body is a vehicle for our spiritual being to make progress. In my opinion, it is important to keep the body healthy though proper diet and regular moderate exercise so that the body remains strong to sustain life force and vitality in order to meditate and serve humanity.</p>
              <p>I for one, will never take 1 or 2 meals a day unless it is for very short term cleansing purpose. I believe in eating healthily and do regular exercise as to avoid sickness. So far, so good. I can meditate and work regularly. </p>
              <p>It would be great if I can reduce my thoughts to one a day. </p>

              <p>If you have that one meal at night, and then go to sleep, it is not good. As the energy consumed is not used and will be converted to fat.</p>
              <p>It is better to have tiny wholesome meals through out the day. </p>
