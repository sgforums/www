              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Buddha’s teachings offers the most satisfactory explanation of where man came from and where he is going. When we die, the mind, with all the tendencies, preferences, abilities and characteristics that have been developed and conditioned in this life, re-establishes itself in a new being. Thus the new individual grows and develops a personality conditioned both by the mental characteristics that have been carried over from the previous life and by the new environment. The personality will change and be modified by conscious effort and conditioning factors like education, parental influence and society but once again at death, it will re-establish itself as life in a new being. This process of dying and being reborn will continue until the conditions that cause it, the mental factors of craving and ignorance, cease. When they do, instead of being reborn, the mind attains a state called Nirvana <br><br><strong>How does the mind go from one body to another?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">When a person is dying, he begins to lose conscious control of his mental processes. There comes a time when his actions and habits locked away in his memories are released. In many instances, there arises in his mind a mental image. This image is totally involuntarily and is produced by his karma or past actions. Thus depending upon the nature of the particular karma that produces this image, the person may see dark shadowy figures, frightening images, or he may see his relatives or perhaps visions of scenic beauty. Quite often, he will cry out at these visions or remark about them to his visitors. Even though the physical body may be weak these thought units are very strong as death approaches. When the body finally breaks down at the point of death these energies are released as mental energy. As energy cannot be destroyed they have to re-establish themselves in a new body thus causing the phenomenon of rebirth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Think of it being like radio waves which are not made up of words and music but energy at different frequencies, which are transmitted, travel instantaneously through space, are picked up by the receiver from where the radio produces them as words and music. It is the same with the mind. At death, mental energy travels through space, is picked up by the fertilized egg of the future mother, is reborn as a new being and manifests as a new personality. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thus it is important that a dying person is comforted and reminded of his good deeds. He should not be made confused and visitors should not overtly grieve in his presence. Neither should unfamiliar ideas like a new religion be introduced to him. The Buddha advises that when one is fearful, he should recall to mind the <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/three_jewels.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha</span></a>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Is one always reborn as a human being?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">No, there are several realms into which one can be reborn. Some people are reborn in heavenly planes, some are reborn in hell planes, some may be reborn as ghosts and as animals. Heaven is not a place but a state of existence where one has a subtle body and where the mind experiences mainly pleasure. Some religions strive very hard to be reborn in a heavenly existence mistakenly believing it to be a permanent state. But it is not. Like all conditioned states, heaven is impermanent and when one's life span there is finished, one could well be reborn again as a human. Hell, likewise, is not a place but a state of existence where one has a subtle body and where the mind experiences mainly anxiety and distress. Being a ghost, again, is a state of existence where the body is subtle and where the mind is continually plagued by longing and dissatisfaction. So heavenly beings experience mainly pleasure, hell beings and ghosts experience mainly pain and human beings experience usually a mixture of both. So the main difference between the human realm and other realms is the body type and the quality of experience.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #cc0000;">"Those who imagine evil where there is none, and do not see evil where it is -- upholding false views, they go to states of woe. Those who discern the wrong as wrong and the right as right -- upholding right views, they go to realms of bliss. ~ Dhammapada 318,319"</span></p>
              <p><strong>What decides where we will be reborn?</strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The most important factor, but not the only one, influencing where we will be reborn and what sort of life we shall have, is <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/understanding_karma.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">karma</span></a>. The word karma means 'action' and refers to our intentional mental actions. In other words, what we are is determined very much by how we have thought and acted in the past. Likewise, how we think and act now will influence how we will be in the future. Just as radio waves will be picked up by a radio tuned to its particular frequency, the mental energies released at the time of death will naturally be re-established in a new material body that most suits it. Thus, the gentle, loving type of person shall be reborn in a heavenly realm or as a human being in a comfortable environment. The anxious, worried or extremely cruel type of person is reborn in a hell realm, or as an animal, or as a human being born in extremely difficult environment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Not only is there scientific evidence to support the phenomena of rebirth, it is the only after-life theory that has any evidence to support it. During the last 30 years parapsychologists have been studying reports that some people have vivid memories of their former lives. Professor Ian Stevenson of the University of Virginia's Department of Psychology has described dozens of cases of this type in his books. He is an accredited scientist whose 25 year study of people who remember former lives is very strong evidence for rebirth.</span></p>

              <p>In buddhism, rebirth in heaven is not the ultimate goal precisely because rebirth in the different levels of heaven, though are happy destinations, they are ultimately impermanent and therefore unsatisfactory.</p>
              <p>Our goal is not rebirth in a temporary realm but to liberate ourselves from all sufferings, afflictions, end the uncontrolled cycle of rebirth and attain complete awakening.
                                                  
                                That is why buddhas ä½› and bodhisattvas è�©è�¨ ï¼ˆlike é‡Šè¿¦ç‰Ÿå°¼ä½›ï¼Œé˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½›ï¼Œè§‚ä¸–éŸ³è�©è�¨ï¼‰ are very different from deities (ç¥žï¼‰</p>
              <p>Many people because they have no knowledge of buddhism, are unable to differentiate between buddhas and deities (ç¥žä½›ä¸�æ¸…ï¼‰. Buddha is known as the teacher of gods and men  ï¼ˆå¤©äººä¹‹å¸ˆï¼‰ , even celestial beings and deities take Buddha as their teacher. Gods are not above samsara and suffering, only enlightened beings like the buddhas, bodhisattva, and arahant (é˜¿ç½—æ±‰ï¼‰are liberated.</p>
              <p>Deities can still have craving, anger and ignorance and suffering. Enlightened beings do not. Therefore enlightened beings are worthy of refuge, not deities, because deities have not overcome suffering and attained the highest happiness and wisdom, so how can they lead us to everlasting liberation and happiness? in fact those deities people worship in temples and communicate with are guiï¼�shenï¼Œ means they are ghost deities. ghost deities are simply ghosts with better karma, nevertheless they belong to the three lower realms, even lower than human realm - human realm is one of the three lower realms. so as my master said, if those ghost deities themselves do not have happiness, how can they truly bring happiness to others?</p>
              <p>In fact many people are superstitious of deities, leading to a habit of reliance, superstitions, etc... This is very different from the Buddhist path of awareness and wisdom. We should not become superstitious over worldly gods.</p>
              <p>Even today, there are living bodhisattvas and arahants. We as buddhists all aim to attain enlightenment and liberation and the highest happiness, this is truly possible... Even people in this forum have and are getting enlightened. as buddhists, we aim to develope wisdom, awareness and achieve liberation and true happiness.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";'> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";'> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";'> </span></p>

Technically, a cockroach can re-become a human.  And that is what I want to know - whether Ian Stevenson’s research includes cockroaches.</span></p>

              <p>In Buddhism, there is a Bodhisattva called Ksitigarbha åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è–©. He had made a great vow that if the hell is not empty of hell-beings, he will not become a buddha.</p>
              <p>Most Buddhist who practised Chinese buddhism (influenced by Esoteric/Vajrayana Buddhism) will want to continuously chant the following:</p>
              <p>Ksitigarbha Bad Karma Extinguishing Mantra:</p>
              <h3 class="headline-2 bk-sidecatalog-title"><span class="headline-content">åœ°è—�è�©è�¨ç�­å®šä¸šçœŸè¨€ï¼š</span></h3>

              <p>Pinyin:  <strong>Om - Po La Mo Ni Tuo Nin, Suo Po He</strong></p>
              <p>Sanksrit: <strong>Om - Pra mardani - Svaha</strong></p>
              <p>There is also a famous sutra associated with Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva known as</p>
              <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Sutra of The Great Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva (<br></h1>
              <h1 class="title">åœ°è—�è�©è�¨æœ¬é¡˜ç¶“ï¼‰</h1>
              <p>Most Chinese Buddhist temples in Singapore will have dharma services (chanting services for Sutra of the Great Vows of Ksitigarbha bodhisattva) during the Hungry Ghost festivals.</p>
              <p>Chanting these mantra and Sutra helps to relieve a person and allow him to come out of hell, lessen his bad karmic reaction and allows his bodhicitta to grow. It awakens a person if one sentient being was found to degenerate in hell.</p>
              <p>You do see hell in the human world: a live prawn crying in pain when he was being boiled and cooked to death, a person suffering from pains of illness, a person being tortured and suffering in pain, the grounds of killing and war etc.</p>
              <p>In fact, I just went for dharma service in my temple to chant this great sutra for ksitigarbha last Sunday and dedicate all merits to all sentient beings.</p>

              <p><br>ya, it's always changing. like we see H2O, water or raining. it rain into the river and flow into the sea, then it gets evaporated and turn into clouds and fall back as rain again. though the "abstract" <span style="text-decoration: underline;">element</span> of water is always there, "Permanent". in buddhism the energy is divided into earth, water, air and heat.</p>

              <p>yes, most are from ghost realm. but some can also be deities dwelling on earth. sort of in-betweener. zhong gui, monkey king, na cha are sort of fairy tales, man-made, so some ghosts can <strong>pretend</strong> to be them and wanted people to worship them.  they "feed" on people's praying.</p>
              <p>kwan yin and guan gong got their position in Buddhism.  but kwan yin is not one but can be many as its related to anyone practicing great compassion. for example u study math in school. u can call the teacher tom, dick and harry. but Math is a subject. if u practice great compassion, u are also kwan yin! :)</p>
              <p>guan gong is from a real life story of romance of the three kingdom, china, but he had became a Dharma protector somewhere after he died.</p>

              <p>A curious man once asked to visit heaven and hell. Expecting hell to be a terrible, frightening place, he was amazed to find people seated around a lovely banquet table. The table was piled high with every delicious thing one could possibly want. The man thought, “Perhaps hell is not so bad after all.”<br>Looking closely, however, he noticed that everyone at the table was miserable.<br>They were starving, because, although there was a mountain of food before them, they had been given three-foot-long chopsticks. There was no way to carry the food to their mouths with such long chopsticks, and so no one could eat a bite.<br>The man was then taken to heaven. To his surprise, he found the exact same sit­uation as he had seen in hell. People were gathered around a banquet table piled with food. All the diners held a pair of three-foot-long chopsticks in their hands. But here in heaven, everyone was happily eating the delicious food, for the residents of heaven were using their extra-long chopsticks to feed one another.</p>

              <p>Well, may be you have taken rebirth too lightly. If you fully understand what is rebirth, you will not say that it is fine. May be you are like others, have the misconception that all Buddhists aim to have a good rebirth in 6 paths. The truth is most of the Buddhists aim to end the cycle of rebirth.</p>
              <p>I don't bet, I would rather find out what is the truth. The stake is too high.</p>

              <p>I read carefully what people write so as to find holes in them.  Holes hold no water.  Water is a compound make up of two elements - hydrogen and oxygen.  Water changes form moment to moment but it is permanent as H2O.  Until it breaks up its component, it is still H2O whether as ice or steam.  Likewise, energy.</p>
              <p>When explaining rebirth, some people have likened 'energy' to life.  My contention is energy is not life.  You make a terrible mistake by saying energy is part of life, that it remained after someone is dead and at the same time declare energy is not life.  Life here is taken as living beings.</p>
              <p>Your example of analog and digital signal is about transmission of electrical pulses.  This is physical science.  We are talking about natural life.</p>

              <p>Most people wont know what happen when they die cos its a experiencial thing and it varies from person to person and the replies wont make it to this thread if they really did pass on(sorry to be lame but lets get realistic) Personally i dont know the answer also because im still alive and no encounters with return from death experiences.</p>
              <p>To side track abit,If the change in states of water or does not deem it impermanent so there is something wrong with the dictionary? or should i blame my english and science teachers for teaching me the wrong things? perhaps i should invent a new term call half permanent or semi permanent..yeahh. Lastly if there is no change in energy of the H2O why will it change its state? the heat from H2O makes the fire hot and warmer??</p>
              <p>Heres a trick question:is mental energy created from the brain or another aspect of a human being? so is there a way to understand and determine if this energy changes/remains/die off/whatever when one dies(physically seen body decays)? no long quote and bickering pls.</p>

              <p>Because I no longer fear afterlife, I do not need to embrace the concept of god for insurance. By not dwelling on god, I do not need to mill around that issue anymore! So the fear of an unpleasant afterlife will slide off from a teflonlike coating!</p>

              <p>Thus, I bet on the Lord that just the living and the death.
