              Announces Decision to Disrobe, Marry Childhood Friend</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Craig Lewis Buddhistdoor
              Global | 2017-03-30 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">A
              senior Tibetan Lama, who has been at the center of a controversial dispute over
              one of the most important monastic offices in Tibetan Buddhism, has officially
              announced his decision to disrobe. A notice dated 29 March on the website of
              Trinley Thaye Dorje, 33, one of two claimants to the title of the 17th Gyalwang
              Karmapa, announced that the lama had married a childhood friend in a private
              ceremony in India.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Gyalwang Karmapa is the head of the Karma Kagyu, the largest lineage of the
              Kagyu, one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism—the others being
              Gelug, Nyingma, and Sakya. The Karmapa is considered the third most important
              figure within Tibetan Buddhism after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. The
              majority of Tibetan Buddhists recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the
              reincarnation of Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa, while an influential
              minority holds that Trinley Thaye Dorje is the 17th Karmapa.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              official notice included a message from Thaye Dorje explaining his decision:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">My
              role and activities as Karmapa will continue as before—with the single
              exception of conducting ordinations. This responsibility will pass on to His
              Eminence 4th Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, Karma Mingyur Dragpa Senge. As Karmapa,
              I will continue to protect and preserve our beloved lineage, and strengthen the
              monastic sangha through initiatives such as the new Karmapa Center of
              Education.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              have a strong feeling, deep within my heart, that my decision to marry will
              have a positive impact not only for me, but also for the lineage. Following the
              wishes of my parents, and having had time to reflect, I deeply feel that I am
              being true to both myself and the lineage. Something beautiful, something
              beneficial will emerge, for all of us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Buddhist way is to use karma for benevolence and benefit, regardless of the
              path we choose. For those who follow the path of an ordained life, we must
              encourage and respect this. In this 17th incarnation, for both the future of
              the lineage, and fulfilling the wishes of my parents, I have chosen a different
              path. At the same time, my commitment to protect and preserve the monastic sangha,
              and the lineage, remains paramount in my life, and my continued role as
              Karmapa.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              statement said Thaye Dorje had married his childhood friend, 36-year-old
              Rinchen Yangzom, who was born in Bhutan and educated in India and Europe, on 25
              March in the presence of close family members. Thaye Dorje was born in Tibet in
              1983. His father was a senior lama, while his mother was descended from Tibetan
              nobility.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              institution of the Karmapa is the oldest tulku lineage in Tibetan Buddhism,
              dating back to Düsum Khyenpa (1110–93). Historically, the Karmapas were based
              at Tsurphu Monastery in Tibet, but the 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje,
              rebuilt Rumtek Monastery (Rumtek had already been established as a center of
              learning in the mid-1700s by the 12th Karmapa, Changchub Dorje, but had since
              fallen into disrepair) in northern India to be his new seat in 1966 after
              leaving Tsurphu Monastery and Tibet.</span></p>
