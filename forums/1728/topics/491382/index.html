              politicking on the appointment of the new supreme patriarch</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">Recently
              there were quite a few articles on the subject of the appointment of Thailand future
              new supreme patriarch. Thailand Mass Media, especially the Bangkok Post
              published several articles from both its former and present editors. All these
              articles are critical of the lone nominee, Somdet Chuang for the post. Of course,
              we find the majority of the readers too joining in a chorus of disapproval on
              the appointment of Somdet Chuang as the new supreme patriarch.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">The
              reasons listed, ranges from his link to the Dhammakaya Sect, a sect whose
              teachings are supposed to be deem by the majority of Thai Buddhists as deviant
              from the fundamental teaching of the Theravada school. It follows that his
              refusal to defrock the abbot of Wat Dhammakaya, for criminal and civil offences
              that was dropped adds more fire to the whole issue as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">Never
              mind the recent demonstration by monks and nuns and some of their unruly
              behaviour in support of his appointment. It certainly adds more ammunition for those
              who are against his appointment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">Also, the
              perception of inaction on countless uncontrolled malpractice by monks and the so
              called widespread commercialization of the religion including the investigation
              on tax evasion charges do not in any way help Somdet Chuang himself.</span><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">   </span><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">The
              current furore has let to one reader commenting that the Sangha Supreme Council
              members are led by a bunch of out of touch, old folks, long overdue for retirement
              and should be place in some old folk home, left to enjoying their twilight
              years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">Of
              course one can draw clear conclusions on what the messages in these articles
              are putting forward; that the Sangha supreme council presently headed by Somdet
              Chuang are an incompetent lot, lacking in good judgment, bias, do not have the
              capability to control the flock of monks, that Somdet Chuang is lacking in
              moral virtue and would not be able to command the respect of lay followers as
              well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">But did
              it occur to the people writing these articles that since Somdet Chuang is able to
              rise to the very top in the hierarchy of the monastic order, he cannot be that incompetent
              or lacking in virtue in the first place. If that is so, than there must be
              something very wrong and defective in the whole Thai monastic structure and
              reforms are certainly needed to set the whole system right again. </span><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">The
              Sutta Pitaka should never be tempered with as it will always be right in the
              beginning, the middle and the end. The Abhidhamma Pitaka can be elaborated
              further where necessary, but the Vinaya Pitaka can certainly be amended and addition
              rules incorporated where necessary to meet with the changing time to deal with
              wayward monks. The parajika presently have three and one kind of False Speech of
              the five layman precepts as its transgressions. Maybe it is time for the other
              precepts of no consumption of intoxicants which would include the usage of drug
              and also False Speech of all kinds to be incorporated as part of the parajika
              offences.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; color: #101010; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Noting
              the rather complex nature of Thai social structure which comprises groups such
              as </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">the
              royalists, middle class, elites, working class, rural farmers and the Army,
              each with their different needs, wants and aspirations;</span><span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; color: #101010; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> it would be a huge task to appoint a Patriarch that would be
              acceptable to all these diverse and interest groups. What is surprising is that,
              no articles have tried to offer a conciliatory approach that could try to mend
              this rife.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">In
              fact, the interest groups should take this opportunity to sit down, list their
              demands and wants, and try thrashing out their differences; find common grounds
              that are agreeable instead of using all kind of reasons and excuses to prevent
              Somdet Chuang from being appointed as Supreme Patriarch. After all, if all
              parties can agree on whatever conditions that need to be met by Somdet Chuang,
              he would have to fulfill these obligations. He can also act as a tool and catalyst
              for reforms within the Monastic Order where necessary as stipulated.</span><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;">Remember,
              the destruction of the Sangha institution would also mean the demised of the
              religion which is not in the interest to Thai Buddhists and the country as a
              whole.</span><span style="color: #101010; font-family: charis_silregular, serif; font-size: 15pt; line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
