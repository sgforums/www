              <p>i like the VimalakÄ«rti SÅ«tra part, especially when the last 2 confrontation of MañjuÅ›rÄ« and VimalakÄ«rti. power! moving towards non-wandering thoughts, a step higher than non-duality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In the VimalakÄ«rti SÅ«tra (<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">ç¶­ æ‘© è©° ç¶“</span><span style="font-family: VU Times;">)</span><span style="font-family: VU Times; font-size: small;">, </span><span style="font-family: VU Times;">the Middle way which is called the not-two Dharma-gate, or the Dharma-gate of non-duality. A few passages discussed this topic in a great assembly of Bodhisattvas. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"At this time VimalakÄ«rti said to all the Bodhisattvas, "Good sirs, how can a Bodhisattva enter the Dharma-gate of non-duality? Each of you with your eloquence please tell it as you like. . . " </em></p>
              <p><em>Virtue-Top Bodhisattva said, "Defilement and purity make two. If you see the real nature of defilement, you [will realize that] purity has no form, then you conform to the character of cessation. This is entering the, Dharma-gate of non-duality. . ." </em></p>
              <p><em>Good-Eye Bodhisattva said, "One mark and no mark are two. If one knows that one mark is no mark, and yet does not cling to no mark, he penetrates into the state of equality, and is said to have entered the Dharma-gate of non-duality. . . Pusya Bodhisattva said, "Good and evil make two. If you do not arouse good or evil, but penetrate to the limit of no-form, thus attaining the full realization, you enter the Dharma-gate of non-duality. . ." </em></p>
              <p><em>Pure-Conviction Bodhisattva said, "The conditioned and the unconditioned dharmas make two. If one can depart from all numbers, his mind will be like empty space; with pure Wisdom he encounters no obstruction whatsoever. This is entering the Dharma-gate of non-duality..." </em></p>
              <p><em>Narayana Bodhisattva said, "Mundane and supra-mundane are two. The very nature of mundane is empty, which is the same as the supramundane. In them there is no entering, no coming out, no overflowing and no dispersing. This is entering the Dharma-gate of non-duality. . ." </em></p>
              <p><em>Good-Wit Bodhisattva said, "SamsÄ�ra and NirvÄ�na make two. When one sees the nature of samsÄ�ra, then there is no samsÄ�ra, no bondage, no liberation, no burning and no relieving. He who understands this enters the Dharma-gate of non-duality..." </em></p>
              <p><em>Lightening-God Bodhisattva said, "Insight and ignorance make two. The true nature of ignorance is insight itself. Insight cannot be grasped; it is beyond all numbers. To be equal in them without duality is to enter the Dharma-gate of non-duality. . ." </em></p>
              <p><em>Delight-Vision Bodhisattva said, "Form and Emptiness of form are two. However, form itself is empty, not when it ceases to be, but by its very nature. In the same way, feeling, conception, impulses and consciousness are empty. . . He who realizes this is entering the Dharma-gate of non-duality. . ." </em></p>
              <p><em>Jewel-Seal-in-Hand Bodhisattva said, "To like NirvÄ�na and to dislike the world make two. If one does not like NirvÄ�na nor loath the world, then there is no duality. Why is this so? Because if there is bondage, then there is liberation. If from the beginning there is no such thing as bondage, who would ever seek for liberation? He who realizes that there is no bondage and no liberation will have no likes or dislikes. This is entering the Dharma-gate of non-duality. . ." </em></p>
              <p><em>Truth-Lover Bodhisattva said, "Real and unreal make two. He who truly sees, does not even see the real, how much less the unreal? Why? Because this is not something that can be seen by the eye of the flesh. Only the Wisdom-eye can see it, and yet for this wisdom-eye there is nothing seen or unseen. This is entering the Dharma-gate of non-duality..." </em></p>
              <p><em>Thus, each and every Bodhisattva spoke in turn; then they all asked MañjuÅ›rÄ«, "Please tell us, what is the Bodhisattva’s entering the Dharma-gate of non-duality?" </em></p>
              <p><em>MañjuÅ›rÄ« replied, "According to my understanding, to have no word, no speech, no indication and no cognition, departing away from all questions and answers is to enter the Dharma-gate of non-duality." Thereupon MañjuÅ›rÄ« asked VimalakÄ«rti, "We have spoken, each for himself. Now, good sir, you must tell us what is the Bodhisattva’s entering the Dharma-gate of non-duality." </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then VimalakÄ«rti kept silent, without a word. Whereupon MañjuÅ›rÄ« praised him in earnestness, "Oh great, oh marvelousl Not to have even words or letters, this is truly entering the Dharma-gate of non-duality!"</p>

              <p>this stanza also good, "He who realizes that there is no bondage and no liberation will have no likes or dislikes."</p>
              <p>"Emptiness is not a theory, but a ladder that reaches out into the infinite. "</p>

              <span style="font-family: VU Times;"><span style="font-family: VU Times;">
              <p>The ÅšÅ«nyavadins take ‘existence’, ‘is’, ‘affirmation’, ‘being’ in the sense of absolute existence or ultimate reality; it means Eternalism. Those who maintain that the world exists are committing a great error because when we penetrate deep we find that this entire world with all its manifold phenomena is essentially relative and therefore ultimately unreal. And those who advocate non-existence or non-being are also committing a great error because they are denying even the phenomenal reality of the world. They are condemned by the ÅšÅ«nyavadins as nihilists (<em>nÄ�stikas, </em></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">è™› ç„¡ ä¸» ç¾© è€…</span><span style="font-family: VU Times;">). Eternalism and Nihilism are both false. Intellect which is essentially discursive, analytic and relational involves itself in contradictions. All that can be grasped by it is essentially relative. It gives us four categories—existence, non-existence, both and neither — and involves itself in sixty-two antinomies.</span><span style="font-family: VU Times; color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;"><em>415 </em></span><span style="font-family: VU Times;">It cannot give us Reality. Reality transcends all the categories and reconciles all the antinomies of intellect. It is to be directly realized through spiritual experience. It is the Non-dual Absolute in which all plurality is merged. We must rise above the subject-object duality of the intellect and the plurality of the phenomena. </span></p>
