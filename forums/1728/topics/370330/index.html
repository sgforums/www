              <p>4) Myths and truths</p>
              <p>a) Truth</p>
              <p>- Parents are loosing control due to children being more technically savy than them.</p>
              <p>- A lot of parents do not know what their children are surfing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) Myth</p>
              <p>Q: Stopping people from watching doesn't help, education helps.</p>
              <p>A: Why do people still lock their home door and car door all these years despite increase eduction on moral values and more people with higher education?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c) Myth</p>
              <p>Q: The more you stop people from watching, the more they want to watch.</p>
              <p>A: Have we often heard an addict saying "one last time?", "give me and I will stop."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>d) Myth</p>
              <p>Q: What are the fuss and hype about content filtering?</p>
              <p>A: If you really do not watch, do you LOOSE anything?</p>
              <p>If you do watch, you will have a lot more to worry.</p>
              <p>Face it, men (or even women) are visual creatures, the more we see/listen, they more we are inclinded to learn. Children learn even FASTER from what they see/do!</p>

              <p>I don't think content filtering will ultimately work since there are always very simple ways to get around it.</p>
              <p>I think education is most important.</p>
              <p>That said content filtering can still have some (limited) effects. I would be very interested if there is a solution that really prevents any backdoor ways to enter these sites.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">The search for freedom has been a search for freedom from the rigid
                  shackles of one’s instilled social identity and the search for peace and happiness has been a search for a means of finally
                  bringing an end to both personal and global malice and sorrow.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">The shamans and priests have commandeered this innate search with the promise of an
                  ultimate peace and happiness in a mythical ‘life-after-death’ should one bow down to and worship a particular God or follow a
                  particular teaching. This seductive promise of immortality for one’s ‘self’ or soul is a powerful lure that is passionately
                  fuelled by the basic fear that underlies the innate survival instinct – the fear of death.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">The Eastern religions further add the possibility of becoming a God-man whilst on earth
                  – a position of ultimate power and authority over others that is irresistibly appealing for many – and the resulting enslavery
                  inherent in the master-disciple system is the antithesis of freedom. The search for a ‘spiritual’ freedom, peace and
                  happiness, based on ancient superstition and metaphysical ‘other-worldly’ beliefs has been on-going for thousands of years and
                  has now had its day.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">It’s time for a pragmatic and practical approach to finding a genuine and actual
                  freedom from the Human Condition <em>in total. </em>A freedom from ancient belief and spiritual superstition. A freedom from the
                  necessity of forever attempting to obey pious morals and follow unliveable ethics in order to keep one’s instinctual passions
                  under control. And, finally, a freedom from the instinctual animal instinctual passions themselves – a freedom from the
              
                  instinctual passions of fear, aggression, nurture and desire.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">It’s now time to get to the very root of the real problem on earth –<br> the ancient, hoary and persistent belief that ‘you can’t change human nature’.</span></p>

                  genetic code, with a set of base or instinctual operating functions,
                  located in the primitive brain system which causes automatic
                  thoughtless passionate reactions, primarily those of fear, aggression,
                  nurture and desire, to be transmitted via chemical messages
                  to various parts of the body including the neo-cortex. Physiological
                  alterations that could eliminate this crude programming, as a
                  biological adaptation to changed circumstances, are well documented
                  within the animal species.</span></p>

                  that we have a large ‘modern’ brain, the neo-cortex, capable of thinking, planning and reflecting overlaying the primitive
                  reptilian brain – the source of the instinctual passions of fear, aggression, nurture and desire.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Recent studies by LeDoux and others empirically confirm that the ‘quick
                  and dirty’ instinctual passionate responses of the primitive brain are <em>primary </em>in that any instinctual response is so
                  quick and so strong that it invariably negates the possibility of thoughtful, considered responses of the neo-cortex.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">We are in fact genetically programmed to be driven, consumed or
                  overwhelmed by the animal instinctual survival passions. Thus, in spite of all our best and well-meaning efforts to keep our
                  malice and sorrow under control, to be ‘civilized beings’, we are but ‘brute animal’, at our very core.</span></p>

                  studies concern the relationship between
                  the thalamus (relay centre), the amygdala (primitive brain) and the
                  neo-cortex (modern brain). The most significant observation of
                  LeDoux’s experimentation is that the sensory input to the brain is
                  split at the thalamus into two streams – one to the
                  amygdala and one to the neo-cortex.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 25px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">The input stream to the amygdala is significantly quicker – 12
                  milliseconds as opposed to 25 milliseconds to the neo-cortex. Also, less information goes to the amygdala – it operates as a
                  quick primal scan to check for danger, or opportunity, which is why it is described as the ‘quick and dirty’ processing
                  pathway.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 25px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">This quick-scan pathway not only results in automatic thoughtless
                  instinctual-emotional responses but the amygdala also has a direct connection to the neo-cortex – thereby setting off a
                  secondary thoughtful instinctual-emotional selfish response.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 25px; margin-top: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">The resultant cocktail of chemicals set off by these responses serves to make the
                  emotions<em> </em>of fear, aggression, nurture and desire so palpable as to be compulsive and, very often, addictive.</span></p>

                  humans are instilled with an instinctual animal
                  ‘self’ that is the very core of the self-survival program. Although the
                  instinctual survival program is genetically-encoded in
                  animals so as to ensure the survival of the species and not the
                  individual, in humans the survival program is also ‘self’-centred.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 25px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 25px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Our instinctual-rudimentary ‘self’ is both palpable and potent
                  due to the surge of chemicals arising from the primitive brain. This ‘self’ is our instinctual ‘being’ at our very animal
                  core – instinctual, thoughtless and emotional.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-right: 25px; margin-top: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Further, this primitive ‘self’ is made more complex in human beings
                  by our ability to think and reflect and, as such, we have a more elaborated ‘self’ consisting of ‘who’ we think ourselves
                  to be as well as ‘who’ we feel ourselves to be. ‘Who’ we think and feel ourselves to be is both a psychological ‘self’
                  and an instinctual ‘self’ – both mental and emotional – manifest as a discordant and alien identity that appears to be
                  located as a thinker in the head and as a feeler in the heart and gut.</span></p>

                  has morphed into a sophisticated and cunning
                  psychological and psychic identity that appears to live within the
                  flesh and blood body, it is obvious that the instinctual animal
                  passions can only be eradicated by eliminating both the psychological
                  ‘self’ and the instinctual ‘self’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: normal;">The elimination of one’s ‘self’ needs to be total – both ‘who’ you think you are as a social identity and ‘who’

                  ‘self’-immolation seems madness in the extreme, but one only needs to
                  take a clear-eyed look at the Human Condition with the mayhem of malice
                  and sorrow and the frantic and futile attempts to rein it

                  real lure to do so is to be found in the glimpses of the innate purity and perfection of the physical universe itself that is
                  evident in temporary experiences of ‘self’-lessness known as a Pure Consciousness Experience (PCE).</span></p>

              <p>Oh I forgot to add Thusness's conversation. He has also told me quite some time ago that (in his experience) after realising/experiencing the auto arising and passing (I believe he is refering to self-liberation) of sensations, which he then agreed to be around Anagami territory, one will overcome sexual compulsions.</p>
              <p>Anyway this is the conversation I had with Thusness yesterday:</p>
              <p> <br>(6:24 PM) AEN: can one have negative emotions and be aware at the same time?<br>as in <br>(6:25 PM) AEN: will being aware itself dissolve negative emotions arising? <br>(10:17 PM) Thusness: this is a good question. <br>(10:17 PM) Thusness: though anatta is a seal, it also requires one to arise the insight to feel liberated. <br>(10:18 PM) Thusness: when a practitioner realizes the anatta nature of manifestation, at that moment without the sense of observer, there is no negative emotions. <br>(10:19 PM) Thusness: there is only vivd sensation of the all arising as presence <br>(10:19 PM) AEN: oic.. <br>(10:25 PM) AEN: hmm <br>(10:25 PM) AEN: but then some ppl say those emotions still arise... like mandi solk wrote<br>"In response to this, many passionate feelings arose, such as: shock; anger; disappointment; sorrow; yet those feelings were so ALIVE and even exciting. For instance when there was shock, the ‘shock-ness’ totally filled all space – and that’s all there was – there wasn’t a millimetre of the room where there wasn’t any shock – shock was all there was – shock was IT!<br>Next, emerged the red heat of anger arising, like a Volcano erupting taking up all space. Anger was all there was – anger was IT!<br>So these raw, fully alive, electric feelings were EVERYTHING - all that was going on, yet there was no-one ‘in’ to feel them –nobody home - feelings without a ‘feeler’. Nothing was suppressed – not anger, sorrow, tears, etc. – because there was no-one to suppress them – no-one to deny them. The feelings were allowed, (by no-one) – un-tampered with - un-interfered with, uninterrupted . In this natural unfoldment, the feelings combust and then burn out within minutes – often, seconds – just like ‘spontaneous combustion’ – a sudden eruption with absolutely nothing remaining. A burst bubble.’" <br>(10:26 PM) AEN: <br>Had there been an ‘I’ - the situation would’ve been taken very personally. When there’s still someone ‘in’, when the mind is playing the game of detachment, there is an unnatural suppression of the feelings. The game is: ‘I’m detached – nothing bothers me’. But this is just a ‘mind-made’ state – a ‘pretender to the throne’ – an impostor. There is still someone who believes they are a person who can choose to be detached and who therefore lives in a dead, joyless world created by thought. People who act detached are in fact the biggest seekers of all because they still believe there is something to be detached from!<br><br>This - just whatsoEVER is happening right now is IT: eating spaghetti; working on the computer; sitting on the toilet or washing -up. You've heard it may times, I know, but eventually, the mind may beocme so utterly sick of this message being consistantly banged home, that it may just give up, and then all that remains is the blessed refreshment of glorious, shining,thirst-quenching, crystal-clear, divine Presence."  <br>(10:26 PM) Thusness: yes<br>but that is not the experience of anatta at that moment.  It is only a recalling <br>(10:27 PM) Thusness: when u r angry, it is a split <em>(between subject and object, me and others, inside and outside, etc)</em><br>(10:28 PM) Thusness: when u realized its anatta nature, there is just vivid clarity of all the bodily sensations<br>even when there is an arising thought of something bad, it dissolves with no involvement in the content <br>(10:29 PM) Thusness: to be angry, a <br>a 'someone' must come into the content <br>(10:29 PM) Thusness: when there is no involvement of the extra agent, there is only recoiling and self liberations <br>(10:30 PM) AEN: oic.. <br>(10:33 PM) Thusness: one shoud differentiate arising thought from the active involvement of the content  <br>(10:34 PM) Thusness: a pratitioner that realizes anatta is only involved fully in the vivid presence of the action, phenomena but not getting lost in content</p>

              <p>Here's a practical article on Mindfulness practice.</p>
              <p>Richard:</p>
              <p><a href="http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/attentivenesssensuousnessapperceptiveness.htm">http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/attentivenesssensuousnessapperceptiveness.htm</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Attentiveness gets not
              infatuated with the good feelings nor sidesteps the bad as
              attentiveness is a non-feeling awareness; a
              sensuous attention. Attentiveness is not sentimental susceptibility for
              it does not get involved with affection or empathy or get hung up on
              mercurial
              imaginations and capricious intuitions or ephemeral auguries.
              Attentiveness does not register feelings and compare the validity of
              experience
              according to it ‘feeling right’ or ‘feeling wrong’. Attentiveness is an
              aesthetic alertness that takes place with minimised reference to self.
              With attentiveness one sees the internal world with blameless
              references to concepts like ‘my’ or ‘mine’. Suppose there is a feeling
              of
              sadness. Ordinary consciousness would say, ‘I am sad’. Using
              attentiveness, one heedfully notices the feeling as a natural feeling –
              ‘There is
              human sadness’ – thus one does not tack on that possessive personal
              concept of ‘I’ or ‘me’ ... for one is already possessed. Attentiveness
              is the observance of the basic nature of each arising feeling; it is
              observing all the inner world – emotional, passionate and calentural –
              which
              is whatever is presently taking place in the affective faculty.
              Attentiveness is seeing how any feeling makes ‘me’ tick – and how ‘I’
              react
              to it – with the perspicacity of seeing how it affects others as well.
              In attentiveness, there is an unbiased observing of the constant
              showing-up
              of the ‘reality’ within and is examining the feelings arising one after
              the other ... and such attentiveness is the ending of its grip. Please
              note that last point: in attentiveness, there is an observance of the
              ‘reality’ within, and such attention is the end of its embrace ...
              finish.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Here lies apperception.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">.............</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Apperceptiveness is a dispassionate discernibleness that
              does not take sides nor get hung up in what is apperceived ... it is a
              sensitive fascination.
              Apperceptiveness is the observation of everything occurring as for the
              first time. Apperceptiveness is possible because of attentiveness ...
              which is
              not analysis that is based on emotional and passionate recollection.
              Apperceptiveness is the immediate sensitive discernment of whatever is
              happening
              without the medium of feeling – it comes before the feeling-tones in
              the perceptual process – and thought may or may not be operating. If
              one is
              futilely attempting a reverie of yesterday’s sensorial delight, that is
              feeling-thought memorialising the moment gone by. When one then becomes
              aware that one is remembering yesterday’s experience, that is
              attentiveness.</span></p>

I don&amp;rsquo;t like to hear that! Although what you say is true, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to ... do you mean to say that nothing we have all tried has worked? I don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear that we have all been wasting our time for thirty years! Nothing that any human anywhere has tried has worked?<br><br>R: Where is there peace and tranquillity? Where is there happiness and harmony? Where is there an absence of malice and sorrow? How does one determine success? By looking around with clear eyes. There is no Peace On Earth, anywhere ... nor has there been at any time in human history.<br><br>By neither expressing nor repressing emotions, something new can happen. The emotion is put into a bind, it has nowhere to go. Next time anger, say, comes up in a situation, simply decline to have it happen. Observe it as it gets up to all kinds of tricks to have its way. Do not express it &amp;ndash; but do not repress it either. Watch what happens ... you will be surprised. Personally, I rid myself of anger in about three weeks when I started on this all those years ago. The more subtle variations like getting peeved, getting irritated and getting annoyed took a little longer, but losing my temper in an angry outburst ended after about three weeks. I kid you not. It all has to do with the determination to succeed, with patience and diligence born out of the pure intent garnered from a peak experience. You just know that it is possible to be peaceful because you have seen it for yourself. One will do whatever is required to be that experience, twenty-four-hours of the day.<br><br>Here we can start afresh. Here we can have success."</p>
