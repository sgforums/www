              why does the rat lead the pack, while the mighty tiger is third in line? And
              why is the dragon the only mythical creature in the zodiac? There are probably
              more legends that attempt to explain this than animals to which they relate.</span></p>

              Buddhism. Before his journey to the earth, Buddha called all the animals
              together. Only 12 followed the instructions, and by way of reward, they were
              each given a year of their own. The order in which the animals appear on the
              zodiac is the order in which they arrived at the designated meeting point.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">Another legend says
              God ordered a feast, which 13 animals were supposed to attend. They included
              the 12 mentioned above, and the cat - which did not turn up because the rat
              tricked it into believing the dinner was the next day. So the cat slept and
              dreamed of the banquet, while the others lined up in the order of their
              arrival, and ate their fill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">The cat - and again
              here, there are different takes on the tale - has never forgiven the rat for
              its ploy. It has been out to seek revenge - not only on rats, but mice too -
              ever since.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">The great race</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN"></span></p>

              story goes something like this: Since the beginning of time, cats and rats have
              been known as the worst swimmers in the entire animal kingdom. But they made up
              for this deficit by being particularly clever. So when the Jade Emperor called
              the animals together to determine the order in which they should appear in the
              zodiac, the cat and the rat came up with a ploy. Because they could not reach
              the meeting point without crossing a river, and because they were known to be
              such poor swimmers, they convinced the ox to carry them across on his back.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">Being a
              good-natured and short-witted creature, the ox agreed. But halfway across the
              water, the rat pushed the cat into the water, where it drowned. The ox, being
              the ox, didn't even notice - and when it reached the other side, the rat
              hurried down from its back and scurried off to become the first animal to join
              the emperor. In second place was the ox, who is next in line in the zodiac.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">A short while
              later, the tiger turned up wheezing and trembling with exhaustion, and
              complaining of currents strong enough to drag it under the water. It was only
              thanks to his mighty strength, the big cat explained, that he arrived alive.
              From then on, he was third in the zodiac.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">Following the tiger,
              no less happy but a little less exhausted, was the rabbit, who had crossed the
              river by hopping from one stone to the next. On one, however, he stumbled and
              almost slipped into the water. Only at the last moment was he able to grab hold
              of a tree trunk and make it to the other side.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">It is also said,
              however, that the dragon - who was next to arrive - helped the rabbit. When the
              Jade Emperor asked the dragon, who is a fast, winged creature, why he only made
              it in fifth place, he explained that he had repeatedly stopped to help others.
              He was, he said, a helpful creature. As helpful, indeed, as rats are sneaky. As
              he was approaching the destination, the dragon continued, he found the rabbit
              clinging helplessly to a tree trunk, and ensured his safe passage to shore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">The Jade Emperor
              was so delighted by the selflessness of the dragon, that he included him in the
              zodiac.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">At that point, the
              river swelled with the thunder of hooves that heralded the horse's arrived. The
              snake was wrapped around one of its legs, and when it jumped off, the horse was
              so stunned that it missed its footing, and its chance to be the sixth animal in
              the lineup - a spot the snake took. So the horse had to make do with seventh
              place.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">The grand finale</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN"></span></p>

              - and in quick succession - the goat, the monkey and the cockerel also reached
              the riverbank. They had helped each other across the water. Having spotted a
              raft, the cock asked the others to help him use it. Both the monkey and the
              goat were happy to oblige. And because they had worked so well together, the
              Emperor gladly gave them places eight, nine and 10 on the Chinese calendar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">The remaining two
              places in the group of 12 went to the dog and the pig. The former was the 11th
              to arrive - and although he was a good swimmer and could have been there
              sooner, he couldn't resist the opportunity to play in the water. Dogs will,
              after all, be dogs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     color: #3e3e3e;  ' lang="EN">Just as the Jade
              Emperor was about to declare the race finished, with 11 animals in the zodiac,
              he heard a pig squealing in the distance. Along it trotted, explaining as it
              reached the others that it had gotten hungry en route, and had therefore
              decided to take a short break. Short became long when the pig fell asleep.
              Nonetheless, it became the last of the chosen 12.</span></p>

                  interesting to note, the zodiac arose as a mnemonic for entertainment and
                  convenience, with 24 hours being representative of 12 periods, and the traits
                  of 12 animals.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Just as there are differences in animal traits,
                  characteristic traits between each and every one of us makes us special and
