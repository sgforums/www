              many of the world’s religious traditions, often representing the essence of
              life or a link between the human realm and that of the sacred. In the Buddhist
              tradition, a number of different trees play a critical role in the life of the
              historical Buddha, Shakyamuni, most notably at the moments of his birth, his
              enlightenment, and his death. In particular, the site of the tree under which
              the Buddha attained enlightenment, a pipal tree in Bodh Gaya, India, is still
              revered today as the locus of his spiritual awakening. Because of its powerful
              spiritual symbolism, the tree also figures prominently in Buddhist imagery.
              Unlike many other aspects of Buddhist art and iconography, trees are not depicted
              using specific rules and can vary greatly in their representation according to
              the regional styles employed; however, their symbolism as a bridge unifying the
              material and the spiritual is unchanging.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>According to Buddhist legend, Queen Maya, the mother of the prince
              who would later become the Buddha, Prince Siddhartha, gave birth to him in a
              miraculous manner in a grove of trees in Lumbini. When she knew that her time
              was due, she grasped a teak tree with her right hand, and the baby emerged from
              her right side. This tree is represented in both painted and sculpted scenes of
              the life of the Buddha, as in a fine Gandharan panel in the collection of the
              Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. In this carving, Queen Maya is depicted
              in the very sensual and elegant Indian triple-bend (Skt.<em>tribhanga</em>), or
              S-shaped, pose, and is surrounded by ladies-in-waiting on her left and male
              attendants on her right. Her arm is shown reaching up and grasping one of the
              curvaceous leaves of the tree above her, and from her right side emerges a
              miniature, fully formed figure of the Buddha. Since the scene represents a
              legendary moment, its symbolism is far more important than a sense of realism.
              The leaves of this tree more closely resemble the acanthus leaves of
              Greco-Roman sculpture than the simple oval leaves of a teak tree.  </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The young Prince Siddhartha grew up in a life of luxury, but
              around the age of 30 left his palace life behind to discover the truth about
              life and suffering, a journey that again led him to a tree. According to
              Buddhist tradition, although he studied for years under various spiritual
              teachers, he was unable to attain the spiritual enlightenment he sought until
              he arrived in the place now known as Bodh Gaya, where a pipal tree (L.<span> </span><em>Ficus religiosa</em>) had (supposedly)
              sprouted on the day of his birth. Somehow he recognized the tree, and sat down
              beneath it to meditate until he attained spiritual release. He is believed to
              have remained under the tree in a state of deep meditation for several days
              before achieving nirvana and becoming the Buddha. Thus the tree also became
              known as the Bodhi tree, or the tree of enlightenment. The moment of the
              Buddha’s awakening under this tree is portrayed in painting, sculpture, and
              manuscripts, particularly in Southeast Asia. A Thai Buddhist sculpture from the
              Mon-Dvaravati period (7th–9th century) shows the Buddha seated peacefully in
              full lotus position beneath the generous canopy of the tree. As in most
              depictions of the Bodhi tree, the leaves have the highly distinctive,
              heart-shaped leaves of the real pipal tree. </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'><br> <span style="border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">The final moments of the Buddha’s life are also represented under
              trees. When the Buddha was aged 80 or 81, he is believed to have suffered from
              food poisoning and retreated to a grove of sal or sala trees (L.<span> </span><em>Shorea rubusta</em>) in
              Kushinagara in modern Bihar. He advised his closest disciple Ananda to position
              him with his head to the north between two of the trees. There, lying on a bed
              and surrounded by his faithful disciples, he passed away and entered the state
              of final enlightenment, or<span> </span><em>parinirvana</em>.
              In many sculptures depicting the Buddha’s passing the trees are not
              represented, but in paintings of this scene, which are popular in Japanese
              Buddhist iconography, his deathbed is surrounded by tall, slender sal trees
              with gold or yellow leaves.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> </span></em></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Trees appear in other aspects of Buddhist art as well, including
              scenes of the Buddhist paradises, in which they are depicted laden with jewels,
              representing the spiritual wealth of those progressing towards enlightenment.
              There is also a tree, the Rose-Apple Tree, on the summit of Mount Meru at the
              very center of the Buddhist cosmos. This tree serves as a cosmic pillar
              connecting Heaven and Earth. Considering the central role of the tree in the
              Buddhist cosmos, it is not surprising that trees are central in the life and
              legends of the Buddha and his enlightenment and that they connect his material
              existence to his spiritual one. When the Buddha was born, he assumed his human,
              material form; when he attained enlightenment, he achieved a higher spiritual
              level; when he died, he shed his physical form and fully entered the spiritual
              realm. A tree was present at each of these moments, serving as an arboreal
              bridge between our material realm and enlightenment.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b;'></span></p>
