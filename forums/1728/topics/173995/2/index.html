If there is no intermediate state, then there cannot be near-death experiences taking place... or 'mind floating out of the body'.<br><br>Check the original forum topic on Antarabhava <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are cases where People who have amputated their arm and claim that they are able to feel their missing arm after months from the operation... It seemed to me that only those who are very attached to their body might probably feel painful durin post-mortem ( this is just my deduction ). Im also not sure whether the pain-killer the body emit can sustain till Post-mortem.<br><br>No matter what, whether you opted for organ-transplant or died unnaturally and has to under go Post-mortem. Death is Inevitable, unpredicatable and part of the nature cycle. I believe it will be good to accept it with Grace =) Thus with lesser attachment and less fear.<br><br>is it truth that a good person will have a better transition from death to rebirth? cos i heard a person who died in sleep mean there person has cultivated or has done good deeds before he died?<br><br>Even if one manage to escape all the ice hell and pain by delaying cold morgue and organ transplant, if one does not cultivated well and/or accumulated bad karma, one can still descended to hell and suffer.<br><br>Thus, it very important for us to strive to cultivate to attain enlightenment and awaken our buddhahood within..</div>
