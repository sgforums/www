            <div class='col-md body'>Venerable  Ajahn brahm gave a topic, what happens after death at PKS tonight, very interesting.<br><br>I suppose Theravada and Mahayana's teachings on what happens to one when one dies differ.<br><br>He said when one is about to die, some few minutes b4 death, or at death, one won't feel pain whatsoever, its a pain free condition.<br><br>He also talked abt Near Death Experiences and was documented in the prestigious British Medical Journal, that got people got out of body experiences. When that person was out of body, she was watching the doctors frantically trying to save her life at the operating theatre. When that person does revived, she lived to tell the tale of her out of body experiences.<br><br>In a way, he uses science to explain that when one is about to die, like a good few minutes, the body will release morphines like chemical and that no pain will occur. He also said he donated his organ before.<br><br></div>
