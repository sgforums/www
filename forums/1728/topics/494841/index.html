              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">How the West Is Trying to Recreate Myanmar’s Crisis in
              Thailand</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tony Cartalucci Global Research, October 13, 2017</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Media platforms either directly funded by the United States
              government or by their political proxies in Thailand, including US-funded
              Prachatai and Khao Sod English, have begun investing increasing amounts of
              energy into fueling a currently non-existent sectarian divide in Thai society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">They are concentrating their efforts in promoting the
              activities of a small anti-Muslim movement in Thailand’s northeast region often
              referred to as Issan. Issan – it is no coincidence – is also the epicenter of
              previous US efforts to divide and overthrow the political order of Thailand via
              their proxy Thaksin Shinawatra, his Pheu Thai Party, and his ultra-violent
              street front, the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD or
              “red shirts”). Shinawatra and his political proxies were ousted from
              power in 2014 by a swift and peaceful military coup.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Today, temples affiliated with Shinawatra’s political
              network are turning from a tried and tired, primarily class-based
              narrative, to one targeting Thailand’s second largest religion – Islam, in
              hopes of dividing and destroying Thai society along sectarian lines.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">From northern cities like Chiang Mai to the northeast in
              provinces like Khon Kaen, suspiciously identical movements, with identical
              tactics, organized across social media platforms like Facebook are protesting
              Mosques, calling for specific acts of violence against Muslims, and using the
              same sort of factual and intellectually dishonest rhetoric peddled by veteran
              Western Islamophobes used to fuel the West’s global campaign of divide, destroy,
              and conquer everywhere from the US and Europe itself, to Libya, Syria, Iraq,
              Afghanistan, and more recently, Myanmar and the Philippines in Southeast Asia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tools of Empire: Divide
              and Conquer </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Myanmar, which borders Thailand, currently finds itself at
              the apex of nationalist and racist-driven violence targeting its primarily
              Muslim Rohingya ethnic minority. Groups of supposed “Buddhists” who form a more
              deeply rooted version of what the US and its proxies are trying to create in
              Thailand, were used to both create a deep sectarian divide where once there was
              coexistence, and to help put the US and European-funded political network of
              Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) party into
              power.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The humanitarian crisis created in Myanmar serves several
              functions for the US and its European partners who have meticulously cultivated
              it over the course of several decades.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">First, it allows the West to continuously hold significant
              leverage over the current government – one who at any moment may be tempted to
              break away from its decades-long Western sponsors and collaborate with a more
              local, sustainable, and constructive partner like China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Second, because the Rohingya crisis is highly localized to
              Myanmar’s western state of Rakhine, <strong>it
              also presents a highly controlled conflict the US can use to introduce
              foreign-funded terrorism, and in turn, create a pretext for Western
              “counter-terrorism” </strong>assistance in the form of US and European troops,
              military assets, and even bases on the ground.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A small contingent of Saudi-funded and directed militants has
              already been introduced into Myanmar’s ongoing crisis and will likely be
              expanded until US military “assistance” and thus the first stage in
              establishing a permanent military presence in Myanmar can be justified.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This would fulfill a long-term goal the United States has
              sought to achieve in Southeast Asia – the permanent positioning of US military
              assets in a nation directly bordering China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A similar scenario is unfolding in the Philippines – a nation
              that was decisively shifting away from Washington – a one time colonial power
              over the Philippines – in favor of closer and more constructive ties with
              Beijing. The nation is now faced with a sudden surge in foreign-funded
              terrorists – a surge so significant, militants managed to take over the
              southern city of Marawi resulting in full-scale military operations
              including airstrikes in order to retake it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Amid the manufactured crisis featuring terrorists sponsored
              by the United States’ closest Persian Gulf allies – specifically Saudi Arabia –
              the US found itself with the perfect pretext to reassert itself militarily and
              geopolitically over an increasingly independent Philippines.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Daily Beast in its article, “The Philippines Is
              Destroying the City of Marawi to Save It From ISIS,” would attempt to portray
              the US-Saudi engineered crisis and subsequent pretext for the US military’s
              expanded role in the Philippines as more ironic and coincidental than part of a
              cynical plan, claiming:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Mautes have pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic
              State, and use many of the tactics that the terror group honed in years of
              conflict in Iraq and Syria. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Despite vehement antagonism toward the U.S. and its military
              expressed by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte back in December, after the
              Mautes moved on Marawi in May, The New York Times reported U.S. Special
              Operations Forces were here as advisers supporting Philippine operations in
              June.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Philippines represents the future of Myanmar once the
              crisis there reaches critical mass. For Thailand, the downward spiral of both
              the Philippines and Myanmar represents its own future should it allow the
              sociopolitical rot of sectarian divide take root at home.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For the US – it has sought for decades to encircle and
              contain China along multiple fronts. This includes across Southeast Asia where
              US policymakers envision a united front composed of US-backed client states
              used to box China in – or a series of failed and dysfunctional states that
              prevent China from developing any beneficial ties with its neighbors to the
              south.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Considering the success the US is having in the Philippines
              and Myanmar regarding its use of terrorism and reactionary sectarian division,
              it is logical that signs of US efforts in Thailand to do likewise are now
              appearing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">How the US and its
              Proxies Seek a Sectarian Divide in Thailand  </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Muslims and Buddhists have coexisted in Thailand for
              centuries, with Thai Muslims an integral component of Thailand’s history
              and cultural fabric. Halal restaurants stand side-by-side Thai and Thai-Chinese
              cuisine, including those serving pork, in markets across the country. Mosques
              stand side-by-side with Buddhist temples. Buddhists and Muslims work
              side-by-side in businesses big and small nationwide.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While Thailand has a violent insurgency raging in its
              southernmost Muslim-majority provinces, of Thailand’s 7.5 million Muslims, only
              1.4 reside in the deep south. The conflict is also seen as being primarily
              political, with militants targeting both Buddhists and Muslims in pursuit of
              their separatist goals. The rest live scattered across the country, and with
              significant communities coexisting in the capital of Bangkok itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For most Thais, the notion of Islamophobia is another facet
              of intolerance associated with a corrosive and declining Western culture – not
              Thai. Yet there are still fertile grounds of profound ignorance, gullibility,
              poor education and lacking economic prospects that make a fraction of the
              population still vulnerable to otherwise childish, crass propaganda seeking to
              divide and destroy Thai tolerance, unity, and culture – primarily among the
              dwindling support base of US proxy Thaksin Shinawatra.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Khao Sod – an unabashedly pro-US, pro-Shinawatra newspaper –
              recently published an article titled, “Rising Islamophobia in Thailand
              Irrational and Dangerous Scholars,” written by veteran pro-West commentator
              Pravit Rojanaphruk, which would claim:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After Muslims in Khon Kaen registered a converted home as
              their place of worship – the northeast province’s seventh such venue – a local
              Buddhist group cited terrorism in its petition asking the governor to deny it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The article continues by stating:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Last week, a Thai monk who has called for mosques to be
              destroyed in revenge for Buddhist deaths in the Deep South was seized by the
              military and flown to Bangkok to be forcibly expelled from the order. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pages such as No Mosques in Bueng Kan mix stories of violence
              in the Deep South with anodyne news stories involving Thai Muslims and toxic
              internet conspiracy theories about Muslims plotting to displace non-Muslim
              populations worldwide. The comments are filled with Muslim-bashing messages in
              Thai.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And while the article appears at first to be laying the
              ground work to unequivocally condemn calls for specific acts of violence,
              bigotry, and hate speech, it adds an essential caveat – one used by the United
              States and its front of faux-rights advocates worldwide to shield both
              terrorists it sponsors, and reactionary fronts it encourages to divide and
              destroy nations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The article states – in regards to the “monk” who called for
              the destruction of mosques, who was detained and defrocked by the current Thai
              government – that:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ekkarin said the junta’s detention and defrocking of radical
              anti-Islam monk Apichat Punnajanatho last week was wrong despite the hate
              preached by the monk because it resorted to using special power of the junta by
              detaining the monk at military camps first instead of going through the proper
              channel of having the Sangha Order investigates the matter. This, Ekkarin
              added, could lead to resentment by some Buddhists, particularly his supporters,
              and backfire.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The article, along with US-funded media front, Prachatai,
              appear to condemn the Thai government for its zero-tolerance stance on
              terrorsitic speech, bigotry, and hate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As the US and its network of media fronts around the world
              have done elsewhere, it is expected that attempts by the Thai government to
              stifle manufactured sectarian division will be systematically condemned by
              Western-funded fronts as violations of “human rights” and in particular,
              violations of “free speech.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Prachatai – a supposed “independent media
              platform” entirely funded by the US government – published its own
              article regarding Punnajanatho and his calls to burn down mosques titled,
              “Buddhist authorities to defrock monks with ‘inappropriate’ online behaviour.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In it, systematic complaints about the Thai government’s
              interference with Buddhism are made, in an apparent attempt to call government
              intervention inappropriate and unwarranted. For the US-funded scribes at
              Prachatai, Thailand’s best course of action appears to be to let the rot of
              sectarian division spread under the auspices of Western-style “free speech,”
              just as it has in neighboring Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Yelling Fire in a
              Crowded Theater is not Free Speech  </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In even the most liberal nations on Earth, threats of
              specific harm against others or their property is considered a crime. Threats
              of death can be punished under US law with up to 20 years or more in prison.
              Likewise, deceiving people – particularly in a manner that causes physical harm
              – is also illegal and not protected under free speech. The
              classic “yelling fire in a crowded theater” example illustrates the
              very real harm intentionally deceitful words have and why it is not protected
              by free speech.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Similarly, networks suspiciously overlaying US-proxy
              Thaksin Shinawatra’s political networks, buried deep within his former
              political strongholds making specific threats of violence toward Thailand’s
              Muslim communities is not “free speech.” It is a crime and it must be punished
              swiftly and severely.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Likewise, these networks propagating elementary lies about
              Islam in general, and about Thai Muslims more specifically, are designed to
              create social division and discord that will inevitably and intentionally lead
              to violence – as similar lies have done everywhere from across the West itself
              to neighboring Myanmar. It is the equivalent of “yelling fire in a crowded
              theater” with the specific goal of provoking dangerous and unwarranted
              hysteria, chaos, division, and bodily harm to those subjected to these lies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">US-funded media fronts attempting to frame this reality in
              any other way – particularly in a manner meant to hinder the government from
              addressing it before it spirals out of control – is merely another example of
              how the US and its proxies hide their self-serving political agendas behind the
              principles of human rights advocacy rather than genuinely upholding them. They
              position themselves as accessories to criminals using threats and lies to
              divide and destroy peace and stability in Thailand, and should likewise be held
              accountable.</span></p>

              Divide  </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While US-funded organizations and political networks run by
              their proxies in Thailand attempt to work one side of this engineered sectarian
              divide, the Thai government must be quick to spot and address US-Saudi attempts
              to spur similar lies, deceptions, and provocations from the other side – among
              Muslim groups or those posing as Muslims provided with foreign cash and
              directives to help fulfill the lies being used to divide Thai society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Just as is done in the US and Europe – where Western
              governments fund and perpetuate both terrorists and anti-Islam movements to
              create a sustainable strategy of tension between both, they seek to likewise
              create a self-feeding crisis in Thailand where eventually staged provocations on
              both sides transform into real violence fueled by reprisals and growing
              distrust among previously coexisting communities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Thailand and other nations facing foreign-funded attempts to
              divide their society must take a proactive stance on exposing these efforts
              through intelligence operations and national media that serve national
              interests, fostering national unity, and creating clear and effective laws to
              unambiguously define and punish threats and hate speech – especially speech
              specifically designed to divide society and create violence.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Failing to stop this sectarian divide from swallowing
              Southeast Asia may make the difference between a prosperous and peaceful future
              for the region, or perpetual violence and division as the West has successfully
              maintained in the Middle East since the end of World War 1.</span></p>
