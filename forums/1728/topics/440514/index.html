              the process of awakening, but in Zen Buddhism there are steps and 
              strategies. These introductory posts will explain my position, what I 
              discovered so far, and how it unfolds.<br><br>Having got hold of the ox,
               one has realized the One Mind. In Zen literature this One Mind has 
              often been compared to a bright mirror that reflects phenomena and yet 
              remains untouched by appearances. As discussed with one of Sheng-yen's 
              first Western students, this One Mind is still an illusion. One is not 
              anymore identified to the self-center, ego and personality, yet one (the
               man) is still holding to pure non-dual awareness (the ox). Having tamed
               the ox, the ox-herder must let go of the ox (ox forgotten) and then 
              forget himself and the ox (ox and man forgotten). <br><br>The problem is
               that we still maintain a subtle duality between what we know ourself to
               be, a pure non-dual awareness that is not a thing, and our daily 
              existence often marked by self-contractions. Hoping to get more and more
               identified with pure non-dual awareness, we may train concentration, 
              try to hold on to the event of awakening reifying an experience, or 
              rationalize the whole thing to conclude that self-contraction is not a 
              problem and that suffering is not suffering because our true nature is 
              ultimately beyond suffering. This explains why I got stuck in what Zen 
              calls "stagnating waters" for about a year. <br><br>This is however not 
              seen as a problem in other traditions such as Advaita Vedanta where the 
              One Mind is identified with the Brahman that contains and manifests the 
              three states of waking, dreaming and deep sleep within itself, yet 
              remains untouched by its dreamlike manifestation.</span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText"> </span><span id="textNode_40941650" class="threadText"><br>So what has been 
              puzzling me what the sense of presence, the sense of being and its 
              relation with the sense that things around me manifest their presence. 
              Over the months I realized that if this beingness seems to be located 
              as the center of our being, it is actually the flavor of all things.<br><br>Reading
               the blog "Awakening to Reality" that has become my main source of 
              inspiration, I realized that this presence felt as the presence of 'what
               is' is the *luminosity* that the Mahamudra teachings are talking about.
               Gradually, feeling my own sense of being has become feeling the 
              beingness of all things, leading to a deeper non-dual realization that 
              gradually colapsed the sense of a Primoridal Awareness, True Self, or 
              Bright Mirror into what is present here and now.<br><br>The conclusion 
              is that all phenomena are in themself empty and luminous, ungraspable 
              and self-aware, ever changing and alive. The conclusion is also that 
              there is nothing beyond that; no permanent pure potential beyond 
              phenomena, no true self that would be the source and substance of 
              phenomena and above all no primordial awareness or Consciousness that 
              would contain the five aggregates.<br><br>The whole universe is 
              contained and expressed in a the "cypress tree in the court", simply 
              because in the absence of a super Self in the background, the cypress 
              tree brightly present in this very moment is the absolute reality made 
              manifest in its suchness (tathata). Most Zen koans point to this 
              realization, together with Hui-neng poem "Fundamentally no wisdom-tree 
              exists, Nor the stand of a mirror bright. Since all is empty from the 
              beginning, Where can the dust alight". <br> <br>Surprizingly this 
              deconstruction leads to a deeper level of non-duality. Huang-po's "One 
              Mind' is starting to become Mazu's "No Mind, no Buddha".</span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <br><span id="textNode_40941808" class="threadText">Practically speaking this means:<br><br>1).
               becoming aware of one's sense of existence and focusing on it until it 
              starts to feel as if the only reality is this pure presence-awareness 
              containing everything;<br><br>2). shifting this sense of 
              being-existence-presence-awareness to apprehend the beingness of all 
              things, until everything starts to feel bright, luminous, present and 
              alive. At this stage, there is no more "self" and "other", nor is there 
              any subtle duality between primordial awareness and phenomena arising 
              and passing away within it. There is only "seeing seeing the seen" 
              without a seer, nor solid material objects behind the seen.<br><br>This 
              does not mean that there is absolutely no Primordial Awareness, Self or 
              One Mind. This would be an extreme position rejected by the Buddha. This
               explains why the Buddha remained silent when asked about the existence 
              of a Self. Answering "Yes" would mean that there is an eternal abiding 
              inherent essence beyond phenomena (eternalism), while answering "No" 
              would lead to nihilism, the other extreme view. The Buddha's way is the 
              middle way, between these two extremes. There is a self, but this self 
              is an conventional concept to describe something that appears to be and 
              is experienced as such, but it not an abiding ultimate reality.<br><br>There
               is a Mind, but this Mind is empty [of an abiding essence]. This Mind is
               the *non-abiding mind* of the Diamond Sutra. Therefore, *Mind* is *No 
              Mind*. </span><span id="textNode_40941650" class="threadText"> </span><br> <br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <span id="textNode_40942143" class="threadText"><br>This also means that
               the first step is to disembed from impermanent phenomena until the only
               thing that feels real is this all pervading uncreated all pervading 
              awareness that feels like the source and substance of phenomena. Holding
               on to it after this realization can hower become a subtle form of

               as it manifests at the 6 doors of the senses, we also realize that 
              everything that we can ever experience is contained within one of these 6
               streams of consciousness, including the 4 other aggregates that are 
              known through the agregate of consciousness and the arupa jhanas that 
              are in reality very subtle non-conceptual mind-states of the 
              cognizing-consciousness.<br><br>Arriving at this point, we can start to investigate the 5 aggregate as well as the sense of self.<br><br>If
               we start with the aggregate of form (the physical body), we realize 
              that our direct experience of the body is nothing more than stream of 
              images (seeing legs, arms, a nose), the other senses and above all 
              sensations. Exploring these sensations we realize that there is an 
              impermanent stream of sensations that more of less matches the images of
               the body. However, the stream of seeing-consciousness is always 
              distinct from the stream of  sensing-consciousness. One never sees a 
              sensation, but an unpleasant sensations can match the sight of a wounder
               arm. These stream are therfore seem as independent, yet totally 
              interdependent. A sound, can trigger a thought that can trigger a 
              sensations, that can trigger the images of a hand moving. Altogether, 
              these 6 impermanent every changing streams of consciousness create the 
              illusion of a solid substancial body. The same method applies to the 
              other aggregates.</span><br><span id="textNode_40941650" class="threadText"> </span> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText"> </span><span id="textNode_40958992" class="threadText"><br>When it comes to the
               investiation of the sense of self, we must first realize that, even 
              after what some have called technical 4th path, and even if we know that
               what we are is not any of the 5 aggregates, we still have a sense of 
              self, a sense of existence. The sense "I am" has not been overcome yet.<br><br>This issue is discussed in the Khemaka Sutta.<br>http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.089.than.html<br><br>In
               this text, Ven. Dasaka meets the Arhant Khemaka and tells him that 
              "there is nothing I assume to be self or belonging to self, and yet I am
               not an arahant. With regard to these five clinging-aggregates, 'I am' 
              has not been overcome, although I don't assume that 'I am this." (...) 
              ""Friends, it's not that I say 'I am form,' nor do I say 'I am something
               other than form.' It's not that I say, 'I am feeling... perception... 
              fabrications... consciousness,' nor do I say, 'I am something other than
               consciousness.' With regard to these five clinging-aggregates, 'I am' 
              has not been overcome, although I don't assume that 'I am this.'"<br> <br>The
               Arhat answers saying "friends, even though a noble disciple has 
              abandoned the five lower fetters, he still has with regard to the five 
              clinging-aggregates a lingering residual 'I am' conceit, an 'I am' 
              desire, an 'I am' obsession."<br><br>Abendoning the five lower fetters 
              means being an Anagami. Here the Arhant says that that even Anagami may 
              still have a residual sense of self that he calls, the  'I am' conceit, 
              an 'I am' desire, an 'I am' obsession."</span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40959003" class="threadText"><br>As to how this sense 'I am' is experienced, the Arhant asks: "then how would he describe it if he were describing it correctly?"<br><br>And
               the monk replies, "as the scent of the flower: That's how he would 
              describe it if he were describing it correctly." he sense of self is 
              like the scent of the flower. It is the flavor of being.<br><br>In order to get rid of this residual sense of self and become an Arahat, the sage explains:<br><br>"As
               he keeps focusing on the arising &amp; passing away of these five 
              clinging-aggregates, the lingering residual 'I am' conceit, 'I am' 
              desire, 'I am' obsession is fully obliterated.  Just like a cloth, dirty
               &amp; stained: Its owners give it over to a washerman, who scrubs it 
              with salt earth or lye or cow-dung and then rinses it in clear water. 
              Now even though the cloth is clean &amp; spotless, it still has a 
              lingering residual scent of salt earth or lye or cow-dung. The washerman
               gives it to the owners, the owners put it away in a scent-infused 
              wicker hamper, and its lingering residual scent of salt earth, lye, or 
              cow-dung is fully obliterated".<br><br>This means observing the arising 
              and passing away of the 5 aggregates until "the lingering residual 'I 
              am' conceit, 'I am' desire, 'I am' obsession is fully obliterated".</span><span id="textNode_40958992" class="threadText"> </span><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40959038" class="threadText">Practically 
              speaking, the above mentioned method works in the same way. One can 
              either split each of the 5 aggregates into 6 streams of consciousness, 
              to see how the sense of "a body" (aggregate of form) arises when all 
              senses working together create the illusion of substantiality, pretty 
              much like the images track and the sounds tracks of a movie that 
              together create the illusion of reality. Using the same method we can 
              also see how the illusion of a solid body dissolves when we look deeply 
              and see that what we had assumed to be a body is nothing more than an 
              illusion created by 6 impermanent, separate-yet-interdependent streams 
              of consciousness.<br><br>We can also investigate the sense of self as such.<br><br>In
               the seen, only the seen. We first realize that we cannot know the 
              objects seen as such, but only the seen (shapes, colors, textures, 
              etc.). We also realize that there is no separate entity that sees. There
               is seeing, but no seer. Seeing is seeing. Same with the other streams 
              of sense consciousness.<br><br>Then, what I do is to look for a sense of
               self, and see whether it is more assocated to one of these 6 streams of
               consciousness. It is generally associated with a physical sensation 
              around the solar plexus or gut, and is therefore related to the stream 
              of sensing-consciousness. When this is seen for what it is, the sense of
               self drops. There is nothing beside the spontanious functioning of the 
              senses.<br><br>Here the purpose is not to lock and make permanent a 
              special state of consciousness, but only to gain deeper and deeper 
              insights into Anatta and Shunyata until we become absolutely unable to 
              make anything into "me" or "mine".</span><span id="textNode_40941650" class="threadText"> </span><br> <br> <br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40959051" class="threadText">@giragirasol - and yes 
              the results experienced during meditation when we stop investigating and
               let go of clinging that what has been seen as an illusion does match 
              the traditional description of Rigpa. It first come for a brief moment, 
              until it eventually becomes the only game in town. This is no surpize, 
              since the Dzogchen teachings are basically about seeing the fruit (of 
              mainstream Buddhism) as its ground (view) and the path (practice). <br><br>But
               here one should clearly mention that there is absolutely no inherently 
              existing "Awareness" that is felt as existing separately from "phenomena
               arising witghin awareness", which would be Advaita Vedanta and maybe 
              Kashmir Shaivism, but not Dzogchen. The Dalai Lama was very clear about 
              that and insisted on the fact that Dzogchen can lead people astay if 
              they lack a clear understanding of no-self, emptiness, co-dependent 
              origination, interdependence, etc., recommending the in-depth study of 
              Longchenpa with a solid background rooted in Tsongkapa's Lam Rim or 
              other similar treaties.</span><br> <span id="textNode_40959051" class="threadText"> </span> <br> <br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <span id="textNode_40959082" class="threadText"><br>With respect

              evolves into a super non-dual Awareness seen as the source and substance
               of phenomena. Without further investigation, letting go is letting go 
              thoughts, sensations and perceptions, but unknowingly also holding on to
               the Witness, Awareness or some other illusory inherent self hanging 
              somewhere in the background. It is only when we investigate and look 
              deeply into this awareness that we become able to let go of clinging to

              it's pretty much on topic actually. On May 12, 2011, I was doing the 
              laundry after struggling for days on the fundamental koan "if you knew 
              that you couldn't do anything to gain elightenment, then what do you 
              do?" Suddenly, everything felt dreamlike, everything namely may life, 
              the universe, several past lives, everything felt like a dream, 
              something that never happened, something illusory arising from a great 
              void, a creative nothingness, unborn, uncreated, beyond birth and death,
               beyond time, non existing yet source and substance of all things; me, 
              awareness, consciousness was seen as being nothing more than its 
              projection that would then get identified with its projected dreamlike 
              appearences to create the illusion of a real life in a real world. As a 
              result of this event, everything felt perfect, whole and complete for 
              weeks. And something did shift permanently.<br><br>Now what is that? 
              Advaita Vedanta Jnanis told me you are That". You are a jnani. Zen 
              masters said, "you have seen the ox", the essence of the Mind. Reading 
              Christian mystics, it is clear that this event is seeing God as the 
              Ground of Being, the unmanifest source of all things. Nothing wrong with
               the experience. It is great, awesome, and enlightening in the sense 
              that it opened the an abiding non-dual state that some call technical 
              4th path.<br><br>But then, iis this the Buddha's awakening? Not so sure.
               Because although this event does validate the teachings of 
              Neoplantonism, Advaita Vedanta, Christian mysticsm, there is no real 
              insight into "Co-dependent origination" and most as the other things 
              that set the Buddha's teachings apart from other great Indian spiritual 
              traditions.</span><span id="textNode_40959051" class="threadText"> </span><br> <br> <br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <span id="textNode_40968115" class="threadText"><br>There remains a 
              duality between "That" and phenomena. "That" feels like an impersonal 
              uncreated clean mirror in the background that reflect phenomena, yet 
              remains untouched. As a matter of fact that is the Self that Raman 
              Maharishi talked about. That is the Arma (or Atta in Pali).<br><br>On a 
              later stage, we realize that "That" can self-contract or on the contrary
               expend. It is like zooming in an out. In reality, it never changes, but
               gets more or less identified with phenomena. Attending to this pure 
              presence-awareness, it naturally grows and overpowers phenomena to the 
              point where everything is seen as appearences reflected within it. Yet 
              "That" is the Self.<br><br>The problem is not the Self, but what we make
               out of it. Grasping at it tends to create a subtle duality, since we 
              can become more or less identified with its dreamlike projections. There
               is Awareness vs phenomena arising within awareness. Awarenees is IT. 
              Phenomena arising within it are Maya, illusions. We must cease 
              identification with, or disembed from illusory (empty, impermanent, 
              not-the-self) phenomena. This is precisely what great Advaita Jnanis 
              did, like Ramana Maharishi who meditated for years in a cave after his 
              awakening.<br><br>The problem is that the more we disembed as this 
              stage, the more we grasp at this pure non-dual Awareness, Absolute or 
              Self and fail to realize what the Buddha realized under the Bodhi Tree.<br><br>My
               conviction is that in order to realize No-Self (Anatta), the Buddha has
               realized the Self. He was already an accomplished yogi, a master in his
               own right. But he still wasn't satisfied, because it wasn't yet the end
               of suffering. Why, because as long as there remains any tiny sense of 
              "me" or "mine" either in relation with body and mind, or with a Self, 
              primordial awareness, Consciousness, Brahman, the One Mind, God, etc. 
              there will be suffering.</span><span id="textNode_40959051" class="threadText"> </span><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <span id="textNode_40968141" class="threadText"><br>My guess is that the
               Buddha first realized the Self and then started deconstructing it. He 
              took this non-dual awareness and thought, "how can I be sure that this 
              will not perish with the body?", "isn't awareness nothing more than 
              something that arises as the result of sense contact"; "can awareness or
               consciousness exist beyond the 5 aggregates?", "what is the sense of 
              self, being, existence?", "how does it arise?", "why is it still there 
              after self-realization?", "why is it still there in the highest arupa 
              jhanas?", "how can it be extinguished without dying?"<br><br>Then one 
              day, Gautama awakened to impermanence, co-dependent origination, no-Atma
               (antta), emptiness, suchness, etc. and knew that, "this is the end of 
              suffering", "the holy life has been lived, there is no more coming and 
              going, etc.".<br><br>I am far from that, but I am starting to realize 
              that the Buddha did go beyond what everybody saw (and still seem to see 
              -even Buddhists- as enlightenment, awakening or self-realization. 
              Something that implies the realization of the Self, but goes further.</span> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br>  <span id="textNode_40968479" class="threadText"><br>So what is this 
              pure, unborn, empty, timeless and nondual Awareness? As I see it now, it
               is just the non-arising, unsupported, empty and self-luminous nature of
               what is that the mind grasps and imagines to be an essential sustancial
               inherhent ultimate reality beyond phenomena. Seeing a white ox on a 
              while empty field covered with snow (common Zen simile for the 
              experience of the One Mind), the mind assumes that there is a pure 
              "Whiteness" beyond all white objects.<br><br>Why? Because when the mind 
              is not yet freed from ignorance, it needs to hold on to some kind of 
              stable reference point, reifying its unconditioned and nonabiding nature
               realized in a moment of total surrender into seeing the eternal Source 
              and substance of all things.<br><br>As I am starting to see it now, 
              there is no clean mirror behind the images reflected in the mirror.The 
              mirror cannot be separated from its reflected images. The reflected 
              images are the mirror. Reality is like a lucid dream, but there is no 
              dreamer, nor dreamed reality beyond the dream. There is just an timeless
               flow of dream images dreaming themselves within the dream. In dreaming,
               only the dream / in seeing, only the seen / in hearing, only the heard.</span><br> <span id="textNode_40968479" class="threadText"><br></span><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <span id="textNode_40969161" class="threadText"><br>Padmasambhava's take on the same subject (where we see that Dzogchen and Vajrayana do not contract Pali Buddhism):<br><br>"The mind that observes is also devoid of an ego or self-entity.<br>It is neither seen as something different from the aggregates<br>Nor as identical with these five aggregates.<br>If the first were true, there would exist some other substance.<br><br>This is not the case, so were the second true,<br>That would contradict a permanent self, since the aggregates are impermanent.<br>Therefore, based on the five aggregates,<br>The self is a mere imputation based on the power of the ego-clinging.<br><br>As to that which imputes, the past thought has vanished and is nonexistent.<br>The future thought has not occurred, and the present thought does not withstand scrutiny."</span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40976585" class="threadText"><br>The suggestions that
               I have received were to acquire 'right view'. The mind needs to acquire
               some form of conceptual model that allows it to accept the possibility 
              of its own non-abiding ungraspable empty nature.  Right view is 
              therefore required to facilitate the shift of perspective from "I am 
              Awareness, everything is in me" to "nothing whatsoever is me or mine, 
              all dharmas are empty". <br><br>A good start would be Walpola Rahula's 
              classic "What the Buddha Taught: Revised and Expanded Edition with Texts
               from Suttas and Dhammapada". It can be completed by  "The Way to 
              Buddhahood: Instructions from a Modern Chinese Master"  by Ven. 
              Yin-shun. A great autoritative summary of the Mahayana path. Then, based
               on a solid understanding of the core insights of Buddhism, Dakpo Tashi 
              Namgyal's "Clarifying the Natural State" (if still in print, or anything
               from the same great 16th century yogi) will be the best introduction to
               the Mahamudra and indirectly to the the sem-de series of Dzogchen.<br><br>The logical progression is therefore:<br><br>- Advaita Vedanta<br>- Pali Buddhism<br>- Mahayana Buddhism<br>- Mahamudra, Dzogchen<br><br>If
               we skip Pali and Mahayana Buddhism and jump directly to Mahamudra or 
              Dzogchen, the risk is to interpret Mahamudra or Dzogchen as a Buddhist 
              version of pop-neo-advaita, equating emptiness and rigpa with awareness.<br><br>This
               is very common nowadays and some Western lamas seem to encourage this 
              trend to water-down the Dzogchen teachings, as always in order to appeal
               to a larger public.

              defined as the union of emptiness and clarity. In Zen we call it the 
              inseparability of the empty essence and luminous function of the mind.<br><br>What does it mean exacty and how is it related to practice.<br><br>As
               I see it, the practice of what Kenneth called 1st and 2nd gear (noting 
              vipassana and self-inquiry) allows us to witness the impermanent nature 
              or phenomena that are gradually seen as being dreamlike, impermanent and
               ungraspable. As a result, we disembed from our identification to 
              phenomena and wake up to our existence as pure awareness, first as the 
              silent witness untouched by thoughts, then as an impersonal 
              presence-awareness somehow detached from phenomena (3rd path) and 
              finally as a non-dual awareness [that is not a thing] that includes 
              phenomena and manifests as phenomena (4th path).<br><br>Through this 
              process, the witness crystalizes the *clarity* aspect of what is, while 
              phenomena manifest the *emptiness* aspect of what is. When the 
              separation is complete, empty phenomedna are seen as dreamlike 
              apprearences within pure clarity apprehended as non-dual awareness.<br><br>In
               the Direct Mode (3rd gear?) some have noticed that phenomena become 
              more alive, luminous, clear, in a way hyper-real, while the sense of an 
              observing witness tends to dissolve.</span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40976841" class="threadText"><br>Why? Because at this
               stage the direct mode shifts the our attention for the witnessing 
              position beyond or behind phenomena towards phenomena and objects on the
               foreground. As a result phenomena (the seen, the heard, etc.) become 
              more clear, alive, actual and hyper-real revealing its *clarity* aspect,
               while the sense of self, the witness, the observer or the sense of 
              existing as a pure impersonal univolved awareness dissolves and fades 
              away, revealing the *emptiness* aspect.<br><br>In both cases, *emptiness* and *clarity* are present but are somehow divided into two opposites sides:<br><br>a).
                The subject is the only reality: the all pervading witnessing non-dual
               awareness (clarity) on one side, and empty impermanent phenomena 
              reflected within awareness on the other (emptiness), or<br><br>b.)  The 
              objects are the only reality in the absence of a knower: the "actual" 
              world bright clear and luminous out there (clarity) and no self, witness
               or presence on the other side (emptiness).<br><br>Both states are valid
               point of views as long as we understand that everything is both *empty*
               and *luminous*. Then there is no opposion or conflict between cycling 
              mode and direct mode, this or that. Gaining freedom from fixed views we 
              gradually realize the union of emptiness and clarity.<br><br>Zen master Linji (Jap. Rinzai) illustrates a). and b). as the 1st and 2nd of his Four Positions:<br><br>1). Remove the objects, not the man (non-dual awareness that is both the source and substance of all things)<br>2). Remove the man, not the objects (no sense of self or agency, all that remains is the functioning of the six senses)<br>3). Remove both man and objects (emptiness of both self and phenomena)<br>4). Remove neither man, nor objects (traceless enlightenment beyond enlightenment)</span><br> <span id="textNode_40976618" class="threadText"><br></span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText">.............</span><br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText"> </span><span id="textNode_41015515" class="threadText"><br>What is nibbana?<br><br>"If
               we wish to go by the Buddha's words, there is an easy principle that 
              the Buddha taught to a disciple named Bahiya. "O Bahiya, whenever you 
              see a form, let there be just the seeing; whenever you hear a sound, let
               there be just the hearing; when you smell an odor, let there be just 
              the smelling (...) When you practice like this, there will be no self, 
              no "I". When there is no self, there will be no running that way and no 
              coming this way and no stopping anywhere. Self does not exist. That is 
              the end of dukkha. That itself is nibbana". Whenever life is like that, 
              it's nibbana. If it's lasting, then it is lasting nibanna; if it is 
              temporary, then it is temporary nibanna. In other words, there is just 
              one principle to live by".<br><br>- Buddhdassa Bhikkhu, 'Heartwood of the bodhi Tree'</span><br> <span id="textNode_40933247" class="threadText"> </span><br> <br> <span id="textNode_40976585" class="threadText"><br></span><br> <span id="textNode_40976585" class="threadText">For more, see the original link</span></p>

              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: small;">So any thoughts and beliefs you have are just conditions. But I'm not saying that you shouldn't believe in anything, I'm just pointing out a way to see things in perspective so you're not deluded by them. We won't grasp the experience of emptiness or the Unconditioned, the Deathless, as a personal attainment. Some of you have been grasping that one as a kind of personal attainment, haven't you? I know emptiness. I've realised emptiness' - patting yourselves on the back. That's not sabbe dhamma anatta - that's grasping the Unconditioned, making it into a condition. Me' and Mine'. When you start thinking of yourself as having realised emptiness, you can see that also as a condition of the mind.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: small;">Now sabbe dhamma anatta: all things are not-self, not a person, not a permanent soul, not a self of any sort. That's very important to contemplate also, because sabbe dhamma includes all things, the conditioned phenomena of the sensory world and the Unconditioned, the Deathless.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: small;">Notice that Buddhists make no claim for Deathlessness as being a self either! I have an immortal soul, or God is my true nature!' The Buddha avoided any statements of that nature at all. Any possible conceiving oneself as anything at all is an obstacle to enlightenment, because you attach to an idea again, to a concept of self as being part of something. Maybe you think there's a piece of you, a little soul, that joins the bigger one at death. That is a conception of the mind - isn't it? - that you can know. We're not saying it's untrue, or false, but we're just being the knowing, knowing what can be known. We don't feel compelled to grasp that as a belief, we see it as only something that comes out of the mind, a condition of the mind, so we let even that go.</p>
