            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jan Nattier in her article "American Buddhists: Who are they?</strong> confirms this socioeconomic assessment of the Western Buddhist, which she has termed Elite Buddhism. She claims that the <strong>American Buddhist is upper-middle class, well educated, financially comfortable and overwhelmingly of European-American constituency. </strong>Recent statistics and information seems to confirm this assessment. While 2.5% of the American population are of the Jewish faith 25% of the American Buddhist population were formally of the Jewish faith. <strong>The concentration of Jewish Buddhist then is 10 times more in the Buddhist population than in the average American population</strong>. In general Jewish Americans are well educated, financially comfortable and most definitely at the high end of the socio-economic scale.<br><br>In the last decade the Western media has also focused its attention on Buddhism. Several years ago the C.B.C. radio programme, Tapestry, announced that <strong>Buddhism was the fastest growing religion in North America</strong>.

In fact the Brahma was still worshipped nowadays. Brahma was known to be "The Supreme One, the All-mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of All".<br><br>In Buddhism, the Mahabrahma resides in the 1st Jhana plane, the first plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There were higher realms above where he lives that he was unaware of, and above it all, beyond the 8 Jhanic planes and all Samsaric planes, is Nirvana. Nevertheless all the devas below the 1st Jhana planes considered him as the Creator God. Buddha did not subscribe to the belief of such a notion that the Universe and its Inhabitants were the Creation of the Mahabrahma. He met with the Brahma, asked him questions which he could not answer. Eventually he has taken refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.<br><br>The Buddha was also known to have said this,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why does he order such misfortune<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br>And he such inequity and injustice create?<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br>Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</span><br><br>When the previous universe was destroyed and this universe was formed, the Mahabrahma was first to be reborn. Other subsequent brahmas/devas were to be reborn.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'On this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to himself: " I am BrahmÃ , the Great BrahmÃ , the Supreme One, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days the Father of all that are and are to be. 'These other beings are of my creation. And why is that so? A while ago I thought, 'Would that they might come!' And on my mental aspiration, behold the beings came." DN 1 2:5</span><br><br>In reality, the universe works by the law of Karma and he has no control over the system of karma.<br><br>The Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk of the first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He states that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of transformations, he cannot actually create independent creatures, change the kammic law of cause and effect, or keep anyone from growing old or dying. Brahma can use his special powers to transport a man to the brahma plane for a short visit, but he cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.<br><br>from <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm</a>:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When he came to know about Sakyamuni Buddha in the human world who speaks of the universal truth, he was curious and arrived at the human world with the intention to debate with the Buddha. The Buddha, with his ability to know another's mind, knew his intention and asked, "You claim to be the creator of the human race and all things in the universe, is this a fact?"<br><br>The king replied, "Yes, it is."<br><br>Buddha continued to question him, "Since you created life, why did you also create death? Is death created by you too?"<br><br>The king paused for while, and thinking that everyone loves life and nobody welcomes death, he replied, "I did not create death."<br><br>Buddha asked him again, "All human beings experience sickness, did you create sickness also?" The king knew that nobody likes to be ill, and he replied, "I did not create illness."<br><br>Buddha asked many questions in succession, but the king denied that he created them. Eventually, he admitted that he did not create the universe and all things in it, and certainly not the human race. The king of heavens was full of regrets and he felt ashamed. Finally, he accepted Buddha as his teacher and invited Him to spread the Dharma in the heavens.</span><br><br>-----------------------------<br><a href="http://www.mahindarama.com/e-library/whybuddhism2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mahindarama.com/e-library/whybuddhism2.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"To those who talked about the first cause of this world, the Buddha responded by saying that it is impossible to find a first cause since everything is changing, interdependent and conditioned by other things. Something that acts as the cause in the present may become the effect in the future. Later that same effect may again become the cause. Such phenomenon continues ad infinitum. It is called the universal law of Anicca or impermanency.Â”</span><br><br>However, Buddhism is largely Agnostic rather than Atheist.

"My Buddhist practice has actually made me a stronger Jew."</span><br><br>While Buddhism has enriched Topol's Judaism Â— giving her a deeper sense of spirituality, she says Â— it has produced confusion in fellow Jubu David Grotell. Grotell, 41, is so worried about breaking Judaism's ban against idol worship that "although I have a meditation spot in my home, as a Jew I just can't allow myself to put a statue of Buddha there."<br><br>Grotell's conundrum and Topol's confidence show how diverse the JuBu experience can be, even inside one Zen Buddhist center in Santa Monica, <strong>Calif. It also underlines how a new, American hybrid of Buddhism is blossoming, fed by a large representation of Jewish practitioners.</strong><br><br>No one knows for certain how many JuBus there are; the last surveys were conducted in the 1970s. A large majority of the 3 million Buddhists in the United States are Asian, but by some estimates at least 30 percent of all newcomers to Buddhism are Jewish. (By comparison, U.S. Jews number 6 million.)<br><br>Alan Lew, who studied Buddhism for a decade before changing course to become a rabbi, calls the paradoxical blend of Judaism, which bows to one God, and Buddhism, which has no supreme being,<span style="color: blue;"> "a fruitful and beautifully creative meeting of two religious streams that came together in the United States."</span><br><br>"Most people don't go very far into Buddhism; they just want to feel a little better," said Michael Shiffman, founder of L.A. Dharma, a nonsectarian Buddhist organization in Los Angeles. "But can you be Jewish and not believe in God? Good question."<br><br>Others, however, would say it all depends on an individual's definition of God.<br><br><strong>Essentially, Buddhism creates a solitary and quiet path away from suffering and toward a moral life based on an all-inclusive vision of interconnectedness, wisdom and compassion. A method for achieving that awareness is daily meditation.</strong><br><br><strong>Being nondogmatic, Buddhism does not require that adherents join anything or reject anything Â— even the notion of God.</strong><br><br>So in this regard it differs vastly from Judaism, a community-based tradition that relies on observances, laws and prayers such as the mourner's kaddish Â— the prayer for the dead Â— to connect adherents with a personal god.<br><br><strong>So what is it that Jews find so attractive about Buddhism?</strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">"Suffering is at the heart of the matter," suggested David Gottlieb, whose autobiographical book Letters to a Buddhist Jew examines the life of a "Zen Jew" struggling to resolve his two identities. "Judaism, at its best, embraces suffering and, at its worst, enshrines it. Buddhism explicitly seeks to end suffering and doesn't look to the past."</span><br><br>Lee Rosenthal, 59, of San Diego found that powerfully appealing. He'd just returned from the Vietnam War and was facing the deaths of his two children shortly after they were born, and then his wife's cancer.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"I couldn't buy into the spiritual answers I was getting from people for why my little babies passed away," he recalled. "But I picked up a book on Buddhism and it spoke to me, streetwise and honest."<br><br>"Instead of sugarcoating things, it gave me a plain explanation for why I was suffering: Life is painful and difficult," he said. "It said also you can't run away from it. Deal with it."</span><br><br>As the world's leading Buddhist, the Dalai Lama, likes to say:<span style="color: blue;"> If there is a problem and there is nothing you can do about it, there's no use worrying. If there is something that can be done, there's no use worrying. And with that understanding can come contentment, even joy.</span><br><br>Rosenthal went on to become a Buddhist priest, which his mother, Rosalie, came to terms with a few years ago in a poignant meeting.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"My mother has Alzheimer's disease and thinks I'm a kid who lived down the street from us in the 1950s," he said. "So one day I asked her, 'Rosalie, how's your son Lee doing?' She sat up straight in her wheelchair and with a proud look in her eye said, 'He's a Buddhist priest.' "<br><br>"I got teary-eyed," </span>he said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/jubu-topol.jpg"><br><br>A majority of JuBus, as they call themselves, are baby boomers who were raised in loosely religious families and began to feel unfulfilled in the tumultuous and experimental 1960s and '70s. They joined the legions of other young men and women searching for spiritual nourishment and ended up turning to Buddhism, a welcoming meditative practice devoid of the cultural stigmas contained in, say, Christianity or Islam.<br><br>And many, like Alan Senauke, now a Buddhist priest in the San Francisco Bay Area, discovered the two traditions combined easily, almost on their own.<br><br>Although he no longer celebrates Jewish holy days, with the exception of Passover, Senauke said, "<span style="color: blue;">My Judaism and Buddhism are like vines so entangled they are not separate."</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">"Because of my Jewishness, I'm faulty as a Buddhist, and because of my Buddhism, I can never really be a practicing Jew," he said. With a smile, he added: "I'm comfortable with that."<br><br>"Look at it this way," said Senauke, who is also a noted bluegrass guitarist. "I've been playing Southern music for 45 years, but I'll never be a Southerner. I'm a New York Jewish boy. But this is my music, it resonates in my heart, and I play it as authentically as I can."</span><br><br><strong>The boom in Buddhism has left some Jewish leaders wondering how they could better serve their people</strong>.<br><br>"I'm encouraged that people want to find something more spiritual," said Rabbi Bentzion Kravitz of a group called Jews for Judaism. "But I'm also disillusioned that they have not found it in Judaism. Maybe we haven't done a good enough job of making Jewish mysticism accessible to the masses."<br><br>But Marc Lieberman, a San Francisco ophthalmologist who helped arrange a historic dialogue between Jewish leaders and the Dalai Lama in 1989, calls the JuBu phenomenon a fine example of "good old American innovation."<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"I'm a healthy mosaic of Judaism and Buddhism," Lieberman said. "Is that fair to either religion? Fair schmair! It's what I am.</span><br><br>"My Jewish side is a tribal sensibility, a reflexive identity with the pain and agony of my people and the pride and glories of their traditions," he said. "But my Buddhist side asks, 'Does that exclude others in the world?' "<br><br>How all those clashing religious notions affect JuBus is illustrated in the paths taken by Lew and his lifelong chum Norman Fischer. In the 1970s, they lived in Buddhist monasteries and studied under Berkeley Zen master Sojun Mel Weitsman, an ethnic Jew.<br><br>Their friends figured that Lew, a freewheeling intellectual, would become a Buddhist priest, and Fischer, who was always a studious rabbi's pet, would become a rabbinical scholar.<br><br>Instead, the opposite happened. But their theologically competing spiritual realms have acquired a lot of the curlicues and ambiguities that are characteristic of JuBus.<br><br>Lew, for example, said, "I don't believe one can be both Jewish and Buddhist; your central commitment should be clear.<br><br>"Personally, my roots are more Buddhist than Jewish, but my spiritual practice is Jewish."<br><br>He also firmly believes in God.<br><br>But Fischer, a high-ranking Buddhist priest whose first name is now Zoketsu, suggested that a "person can be a faithful Jew and practice Buddhism."<br><br>Topol would tend to agree with Fischer.<br><br>Six years of Buddhist training at the Santa Monica Zen Center, where reconciling with one's religion of origin is emphasized, has only deepened her appreciation and respect for her Jewish roots.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"I've found that Buddhism has broken apart my fixed beliefs and notions," she said, "so that I can approach Judaism with a fresh eye."</span><br><br>For Topol, that means viewing biblical descriptions of God's active presence in human affairs not as literal history but as meditation tools and spiritual instructions for coping with daily life.<br><br>Rising from a meditation pillow after a Sunday-morning Buddhist service, Topol said, "I even look at the writings of the Old Testament, such as Moses' conversations with God, as Zen koans; that is, as questions and statements to be used as meditation disciplines along the lines of 'What is the sound of one hand clapping?' "<br><br><strong>What happens next is anyone's guess. But some JuBus are predicting the emergence of a unique American-style Buddhism.</strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">"Jews value education, hard work, innovation and strong commitment to family, all of which they are bringing to American Buddhism," said Charles S. Prebish, a professor of religious studies at Penn State University. "What you get is some kind of a hybrid."</span><br><br></div>

The museum's website says "the works on display range from the earliest representations of Buddha and his attendants in India to later forms developed in China and Japan.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/israel-buddha-statues.jpg"><br><br>Along with the various Buddhas, deities, and sages, Tibetan ritual objects are also on display. Together, the worksÂ—some of which are shown to the public for the first timeÂ—convey the many facets of Buddhist art, its multiple meanings, and its visual richness."<br><br>Buddhism didn't have one form. During the years, it went through many changes, split into various sections, absorbed and was assimilated by the local culture and religious system of the places where it was spread. Buddhist arts similarly experienced various changes. But in spite of the differences and variety, the items in the exhibit share many things in common.<br><br>Buddha Sakyamuni (literally, "the wise one from the clan of the Sakya" ) was born to a ruling family and, as Prince Gautama Siddhartha, lived a life of comfort and pleasure. When exposed to the suffering and tribulations of human existence, he decided to abandon his royal life and pursue answers to some of life's perplexing questions: Why was man doomed to suffer? How can one escape suffering? After six years of wandering, he sat down and mediated under a bodhi tree until he enlightened to the eternal truth of the universe.<br><br>From that time forward, Buddha Sakyamuni wandered around India and taught his teachings. Buddha Sakyamuni lived as human being with a flesh body, and became enlightened through his will and seeking. He found answers to life's questions, rose above human concerns and penetrated eternity. Buddha Sakyamuni awakened to wisdom and became a high-level being with heavenly powers. It is said that Buddha Sakyamuni left the earth for an existence much higher than the specific person who lived in India 2,500 hundred years ago.<br><br>Since Sakyamuni's departure from the earth by way of nirvana, other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas joined the pantheon of Buddhist belief. They had their own characteristics and specific existence. For example, Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara became known as the goddess of mercy and is especially honored in Tibet. The Buddha of Healing is regarded as one who watches over physicians.<br><br>For the believer, a sculpture of the Buddha is not merely an artistic item, but an object that carries with it a spark of the divine being it represents. It is the image of the god, and the presence of this god in this object gives it holiness.<br><br>Buddhist religious art wasn't meant to provide an aesthetic experience for the beholder. Rather, the sacred image was meant to offer a spiritual solace and to protect those who honored and respected the artwork. Buddhist artwork represents a kind of ritual object, that is, an aid in one's spiritual journey to the Truth.<br><br>The exhibition at the Israel Museum opens a window to another culture, with its mystery and sacredness. Explanations and descriptions of each object help the observer to understand sacred symbols and how they relate to the mundane world.<br><br><strong>The Enlightened One: Buddhist Art in the Israel Museum Collection is currently being shown at the Nathan Cummings 20th Century Art building, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, until August 31, 2006.</strong></div>
