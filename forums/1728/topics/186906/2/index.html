KARFELD, Cleveland Jeweish News, Aug 12, 2006</span></span><br><strong>Cleveland, Ohio (USA)</strong> -- The first thing that grabs you is his gravelly voice, growling out poetic lyrics or rumbling articulate pronouncements on life. When Leonard Cohen emerged on the folk-pop scene nearly four decades ago, his raspy sound became his signature as much as the elegant phrases and soulful music he created.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/l-cohen.jpg"><br><strong>Songwriter Leonard Cohen, left, and U2Â’s Bono flank Lian Lunson, who directs the documentary Â“Leonard Cohen IÂ’m Your Man.Â”</strong><br><br>In her enthralling documentary, Â“Leonard Cohen IÂ’m Your Man,Â” opening August 11 at the Cedar Lee Theatre, Australian director Lian Lunson lets us hear that eloquent voice.<br><br>She effectively weaves together interviews, archival footage, and performances of CohenÂ’s best-known songs at a tribute concert in Sydney, Australia, in January 2005. Added to the mix are CohenÂ’s personal photos and accolades from the musical artists he inspired.<br><br>The Montreal-born troubadourÂ’s haunting ballads of love and longing, sex and spirituality, are timeless, LunsonÂ’s film attests. Passionately covering CohenÂ’s classics at the Sydney Opera House are such headliners as Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Bess Orton and Martha Wainwright. CohenÂ’s songs like Â“Suzanne,Â” Â“Sisters of Mercy,Â” and Â“HallelujahÂ” move us just as they spoke to earlier generations.<br><br>Lunson cuts between interviews with Cohen, who reveals a beguiling honesty about his life and work, and performances of each of his songs. While the singer-songwriterÂ’s musings at times can veer toward the pretentious, he continually deflates them with his wry humor and self-deprecating manner.<br><br>Of the ups and downs of his career, he says, Â“Things got easier when I no longer expected to win. You abandon your masterpiece and sink into the real masterpiece.Â” Then he reads his modest preface to a Chinese translation of a volume of his poetry: Â“Dear reader, please forgive me if IÂ’ve wasted your time.Â”<br><br>When he was living in Montreal, Cohen and fellow poets used to severely critique each otherÂ’s work. Â“We thought the most important thing was good writing,Â” he says. Â“Poets were Â‘the unacknowledged legislators of the worldÂ’ (borrowing from Shelley). We thought it was terribly important what we were doing. Maybe it was.Â”<br><br>He notes that his indiscreet song Â“Chelsea Hotel No. 2Â”, about a sexual liaison with Janis Joplin, wouldnÂ’t have bothered the late rock icon. Â“My mother would have minded,Â” he deadpans.<br><br>Although he was known as a lothario, Cohen confesses, Â“My reputation as a ladiesÂ’ man was a joke. I laughed bitterly through the 10,000 nights I spent alone.Â”<br><br>Among the performers who shared personal reminiscences of Cohen, Rufus Wainwright recounts first meeting the usually sartorially splendid songwriter. Cohen was dressed only in his underwear as he attempted to feed regurgitated noodles to a baby bird he was reviving.<br><br>Other artists, such as Bono and U2 bandmate the Edge, mostly just gush over Cohen. Bono calls Cohen, who turns 72 in September, Â“our Shelley, our Byron.Â” The Edge compares Cohen to Moses bringing down the stone tablets.<br><br>While celebrating CohenÂ’s work, the film also reveals intriguing, albeit too few, tidbits about his life. His father, who died when he was 9, owned a clothing store. Thus began CohenÂ’s lifelong fondness for stylish suits. He tried wearing jeans, he says, but just wasnÂ’t comfortable in them.<br><br>Religion is a major interest in CohenÂ’s life. The first poetry that affected him came from Bible stories and synagogue liturgy. Then he undercuts this lofty image, noting he also found inspiration in Marvel Comics.<br><br>Although he was raised a Jew, Cohen sampled other religions, moving for a few years to a Zen monastery on Mt. Baldy in California in the 1990s. There he studied Buddhism and was ordained as a monk. He recalls his first winter, and how Roshi, the Zen master, was Japanese and the head monk was German.<br><br>Â“It was the revenge of World War II,Â” Cohen quips. Â“An American walking in sandals in the snow, beaten with sticks.Â”<br><br>Serious again, Cohen notes that Roshi didnÂ’t care about his past or who he was. Â“So who I was began to wither. The less I felt who I was the better I felt.Â”<br><br>The film is produced by Lunson, Bruce Davey, and Mel Gibson, who made headlines recently when he was stopped for drunk driving and uttered an anti-Semitic rant to the arresting police officer. Flush enough to bankroll film projects since the huge financial success of his Â“The Passion of the Christ,Â” Gibson claims in the documentaryÂ’s production notes to have always been a major Cohen fan.<br><br>Unfortunately, we only hear the inimitable Cohen sing once. In the documentaryÂ’s last musical number, staged for the movie at a New York club, Bono and U2 play backup on CohenÂ’s 1988-released Â“Tower of Song.Â” The dour poet-songwriter is elegantly garbed in his trademark suit, his eyes are closed, and his chiseled features could be immortalized on a newly minted Buffalo head nickel. As he talks and lip-syncs his way through the lyrics, his aging voice explores mortality and posterity with deep irony and wit.<br><br>Bono applauds the performance, and Cohen gruffly recites from one of his poems: Â“I had the title poet, and maybe I was one for a while. Also the title singer was kindly accorded me, even though I could barely carry a tune.Â”<br></div>

But all that is hopefully going to change.<br><br>The Israel Center for the Study of Buddhism (ICSB) is a non-profit, interdisciplinary and intercultural research institution that wants to Â“bring the Far East to the Middle EastÂ”. ItÂ’s main mission is to bring an understanding of the fundamentals and the history of Buddhism as a whole from the earliest times up to the present so that Israeli society can better understand the Far East. This will hopefully pave the way for increased cooperation between the two Asian extremities in the future.<br><br>The ICSB is unique in two ways. First of all it will be the only academic institute from Morroco to Afghanistan and from Turkey to Yemen researching Buddhism and its cultural backgrounds (India, SE Asia, China and Tibet) individually as well as a whole, from the distant past up to today. Secondly, it will try to better acquaint the Far East, (especially China and India) with Judaism and the part it plays in the State of Israel. These two opposite paths, one internal and the other external in their outlook, are what make the Israel Center for the Study of Buddhism extraordinary.<br><br>Communication is the best means of mutual cultural understanding. To better understand the Far East, the ICSBÂ’s major educational areas will be language and literature. <strong>The first major project will be to translate the Tipitaka (Pali, Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist Scriptures) into Hebrew</strong>. This will form a firm base of departure for East Asian research, especially the teaching of the Chinese, Tibetan, Sanskrit and Pali languages. From the opposite end translations of traditional Jewish literature such as the Mishnah and the Talmud into the above mentioned languages will help Buddhists better understand their Jewish counterparts.<br><br>Other areas of research will include the native histories, arts and archaeology of the respective countries. Lectures will also be held to bring scholars and sages together to exchange modern and traditional views. These exchanges will be published through different means especially in the Hebrew language.<br><br>The Israel Center is still in its organizational stages. Just collecting the books needed for this endeavor is one major undertaking which needs a lot of financial support. But as it was said somewhere in ASIA (Middle East or Far East, depending on your point of view), Â“the longest journey always starts with the shortest stepÂ”.<br><br>For more information on what the Israel Center for the Study of Buddhism wants to accomplish, please view their web site at www.israel-center.org.<br><br>Shmuel Ben Or is the Founder and Director of the Israel Center for the Study of Buddhism. For more information on how to help support the ICSB please contact him at director@israel-center.org<br></div>

Tenzin, originally from London, came for the first time at the end of September to teach courses and lead retreats for three weeks. The lectures and retreats were held in various locations across the country, most of them at Kibbutz Tuval in the North.<br><br>The final retreat began this week, focusing on a meditation study program directed at understanding the nature of the mind as the basis of all our experiences. The retreat, which lasts for five days, is held in complete silence.<br><br>Tenzin, who speaks with a soft British accent and gently emphasizes her words with delicate hands, expressed a familiarity with Judaism and an excitement to be in Israel, "I was brought up in a Jewish district of London and my sister in law is Jewish. It is interesting for me to finally see the places you hear about," she said.<br><br>Her journey to the Buddhist nunnery began during her teenage years. "As a child I knew I always needed more," she said. "I tried reading the Bible and the Koran, but I realized that I was not theistically inclined."<br><br>In pursuit of her spiritual path, she traveled to India in 1964 at 20. She found her place in the community of Himachal Pradesh, where she studied with the eighth Khamtrul Rinpoche, eventually being ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist nun.<br><br>Tenzin remained at this community for six years until she was instructed to pursue a more intense practice, ultimately finding the quiet and peacefulness she longed for in a cave; she remained there for 12 years, the last three in strict retreat. "The hardships didn't matter; I was just happy to be there," she said.<br><br>Now she directs her energies to the administration of a nunnery, which she founded in 1999, traveling globally to raise support for it. The nunnery focuses on the spiritual development of women, teaching them philosophy, rituals, English and other practical skills.<br><br>The religiously charged environment of Israel and the broader Middle East reinforce a fundamental aspect of Tenzin's approach. "Buddhism is open because it is not based on the idea of a chosen people. It's based on a different perception... The problems here are based on the fact that everyone thinks they are right, they believe God is on their side, and it's ironic because everyone is talking about the same God. Buddhism comes as a relief to this because it is outside of the picture; it's not a part of this ancient strife," she said.<br><br>Tenzin lamented the current growth of fundamentalism. "Society is the most educated it has ever been, yet we've retreated behind the most primitive beliefs," she said, suggesting that certain Buddhist beliefs counteract the march toward fundamentalism, especially the belief in reincarnation and Buddhism's openness to other means of spiritual enlightenment.<br><br>She dismissed any conflict between the participants' Jewish beliefs and her teachings. "One can be a perfectly good Jew and learn to meditate and calm the mind," she said.<br><br>Her lectures focused on the power and importance of meditation. "Normally we are not conscious of how agitated our mind is," she explained. "Meditation is a two-step process; first you have to quiet the mind, then you look into the nature of the mind itself."<br><br></div>
