              <p>Best not to lie at all. Once we are used to telling white lies, we may start to be ok with grey lies, and then black lies... Even if we were to tell only white lies, it will already implicate the trust that other people give us.</p>
              <p>Use another method, keeping silent, or just say you don't want. There is no obligation to give a reason or to be forced to drink in any situation.</p>

This life you are a 'man' (or 'woman'), when you turned into bones and ashes, who are 'you'?<br><br>From the diamond sutra...<br>"...no mark of self, <br>no mark of others, <br>no mark of sentient beings, <br>and no mark of a life span..."<br><br>Let go of the notion of self and others. Then there will be no one to around to piss you off, and no one to be piss off.<br><br>Something extra...<br>An interesting extract from one of Venerable Master Hsuan Hua's talks...<br>A cultivator should not have the mark of self, the mark of others, the mark of living beings, or the mark of a life span. Not having the mark of self doesn’t mean that when it’s time to work, you make everyone else work. Not having the mark of others doesn’t mean when it’s time to eat, you say, "I have no mark of others, so it’s no problem if I eat more." You may not have the mark of others, but other people do have the mark of others. Or perhaps when you are fighting, you claim to have no mark of living beings, or when you eat meat, you say you have no mark of a life span. That’s wrong. Those are all improper ways of thinking. What’s the right way?<br><br>Have no mark of self: Don’t be arrogant, and don’t scheme for your own benefit. <br><br>Have no mark of others: Don’t impede or obstruct other people. If something does not benefit others, don’t do it.</p>
              <p>Have no mark of living beings: Regard all creatures as being of the same substance. Everyone has the right to live.</p>
              <p>Have no mark of a life span: Don’t take the lives of other people or other beings.<br><br>So in cultivation, we should never seek anything for ourselves or scheme for our own benefit. We should always try to think on behalf of others.</p>

              <p>Actually, instead of analysing the symptoms, why not look at it from a more fundamental angle:</p>
              <p>Like attracts Like. If our social circle is mainly of a certain 'pattern' that we're not totally comfortable with, then perhaps it's time to think what sort of person are we, and what sort of person do we want to be?</p>

              <p><br>Hmm TS stated that he was forced to drink in a social gathering.... How bout friend's wedding dinner? Sometimes don't drink seems not giving face to friends...</p>
              <p>I think it's more important to be ourselves... but we must be "mentally resistant" to external pressure...</p>

              <p>If you value the company you are keeping, tell them you don't drink up front, but accept the offer of beers or other graciously. Anyway, take sips that don't allow the glass to be topped up.The message will get through, eventually.  Don't treat the alcohol like poison, as it is off putting socially. </p>

              <p>You should feel comfortable in a group setting, and not to be made uncomfortable by having to conform to peer pressure. However, there should be certain conformity which attracts you to the group in the first place! </p>
              <p>Anyway,if  a group gets drunk all the time is not healthy place to be in !</p>
