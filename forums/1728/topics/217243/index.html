It can be minimized, but not eliminated.<br><br>I believe everything is a matter of degree... Bad things are of course, bad. But too much of a good thing can also be bad! Equality of opportunities is what I believe in to inspire individual effort and contribution. This contrasted markedly with the centrally planned economic model a.la. Communist systems, where there is equality of outcomes.<br><br>However, there must be something in the former system that inspires people to work hard... and that poverty unfortunately, is one of that "something" .... In other words, there must be 'losers' for there to be 'winners', and it is this that inspires people to strive. However, if we carry this attitude too far, elitism will result (reminded me of the most recent incident where a young lady of exalted background and education made an extremely arrogant and elitist post in her personal blog). Conversely, if we have too much "handouts" to totally remove poverty, individual contribution and effort will be stifled.<br><br>The key in my opinion, is to strike a balance between these 2 extremes, to find the "sweet spot" as they say.<br><br>This situation is of course, still unsatisfactory, as alluding to the First Noble Truth. So all the more we should heed Buddha's teaching to end this vicious cycle of unsatisfactory state of existence.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my opinion...<br><br>I think to look deep into a current issue, we may have to suspend all acquired concepts, manmade or otherwise.<br><br>What is poverty?... Poverty is the end result of a very very long series of cause of effect. End of poverty will not be the end of cause.<br><br>Basically IMO... poverty is affected by 2 main factors:<br><br>1. money as a system for resource flow and exchange<br>2. the need of the body to constantly sustain itself for body survival.<br><br>However, money as a resource transaction is created out of human invention and has grown to its current complexity. Sadly, we are now so deeply entrench in a system that we cannot think or imagine other possibilities.<br><br>In the past era of light-sound being (ancient ancestors of humans)... poverty is an unknown concept. Firstly, light-sound being, like plants, only requires sun-light to sustain itself. Without the need to look for food, there was no need for a resource transaction system like money. It was after much changes and evolution(de-volution) that human acquired the desire for eating. So, in a way, our instinct for eating and all the other biological function are not something that can easily be dissolved or transmuted. It controls the survival of the current body type through intense desire...and it operates outside the 'sense of self'. That may be why, even in 'no-self' state, all the biological functions are still strongly intact. The human form is composed of all desires that hold it from disintegration. The desires are in place (through cause and effect-evolution) to ensure bodily survival... because... long into the past... self/existence becomes identified to body. Physical pain is a desire, the frequency is different from that of emotion, it is much faster. Pain is there to ensure bodily survival or indication that prevent the body from dying. Therefore dying entails pain because it is the instinct to fight bodily death.<br><br>So... my conclusion is... solving poverty will not solve the fundamental dynamics. Perhaps... only the long and gradual unfoldment will reveal all the cause and effects that leads to our current state of being.<br><br>But... even in its current state... original essense is never lost...<br></div>

Buddha &amp; Bodhisattvas (They) respects the nature of "Cause &amp; Effect". They will not distrub this flow of cause &amp; effect without a pure Good Cause.<br><br>2. Buddha &amp; Bodhisattvas (They) will only help those who looking to be cultivated to absolutely "GOOD" &amp; not deviated from "GOOD".<br><br>3. Buddha &amp; Bodhisattvas (They) do not want to use their power to mislead people into their practices. They want people to see Truth not be entangle into these by-product of Mind Powers.<br><br>4. Buddha &amp; Bodhisattvas (They) want people to work hard in life &amp; practices. To cherish this preious time here been rich or poor or clever or non-clever or man or women.<br><br>5. To experiance or take the "Effect" is a very effective way to lesser of Karma. To distinguish Fire, best way is to stop supplying fuel &amp; let it burn down together.<br><br>6.
