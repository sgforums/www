              <p>From Shangpa Rinpoche's blog. In general, this is something we know but i feel that it helps to be reminded of it now and then. </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In general, I think my birth itself is nothing great but I feel the person who gave birth to me is in fact very important. And that is my mother. She has gone through so much physical suffering while she carried me in her womb and at the time of delivery. Nonetheless, she was mentally so happy and eager to see her child. That selflessness love and care is so great it seems unfathomable in our normal state of mind. So during this birthday, I remember the kindness and love from my mother and pay great respect to her. I am also suggesting to my disciple and reader of this blog that if your mother is still around, then consider it your golden period and try to cherish and treasure your mother by thinking of her selfless love towards you in many ways. So you should love her and give her your full care and gratitude especially when she is getting older and need more of your support. And you should not hesitate to give her your hand. It is an opportunity for you to pay the immense debt of kindness to her. If your mother is no more with you, then you should still think of her with good aspirations and when you see any old lady who needs help or assistance, just give her your helping hand regardless of who she is. When you give your love and care to her, I am sure you will start to see your mother’s love from her. Its great isn’t it? In fact every sentient being is our mother in general so we can show our love and compassionate act by assisting anyone. This is also paying the debt of kindness to mother.</p>
