              <p>In Buddhist culture we talk about "Sui Yuan" aka fate.....a person must have faith and understand buddhism, buddha teaching, then it would be beneficial to the person and start cultivating himself...</p>
              <p>There is no point in persuaing people to convert to a religion when the person do not have that kind of inspiration faith in the teaching....Sui Yuan is important in cultivating in buddhism...it is a chance open to many people, but how many people would willing take up this chance....if you miss this lifetime, you have to wait for some other lifetime to grab the opportunity again...</p>

              <p>Anyway, I think buddhists should always try to share dharma with other people as much as possible. In the first turn of dharma wheel, buddha actually take the initiative to approach the 5 people and spread dharma to them.<br>I sometimes also talk about dharma with my close friends, unless they are those staunch christians, then no point, because I don't want them to make bad speech karma.</p>

              <p>ç¼˜ is not something mysterious or difficult to understand.  It is simply phenomena that is caused by the ripening of conditions.  It is when suitable conditions congregate that the phenomenon can be resulted.  When even one of these conditions fail to exist, then no matter what, that particular phenomenon cannot happen.</p>
              <p>It is important to note that ç¼˜ is not the action; it is just the right conditions.  Therefore it is not passive.  We cannot sit around and wait for ç¼˜ to happen. </p>
              <p>For example, if somebody wants to commit suicide, we cannot say that we leave it to his destiny whether he dies or not.  His intention to die is formed because the right factors are there, and so there is ç¼˜, but by executing his intention, he is actually creating the next ç¼˜ to happen, and that ç¼˜ is that he'll go to hell.  If he always does good deeds or practise Dharma, then before he's about to kill himself, there just might be one thought that comes to him, telling him about the illusory nature of all, and that single thought could just be the factor causing the conditons to die to fail.</p>
              <p>When a love one passes away, we should look at it in similar fashion.  The conditions for him to live have simply stopped to exist, so how could he live?  And thus your ç¼˜ with him has ended, as simple as that.  Any breakups in a relationship should also be looked upon as such.  The conditions for him to love you or for you to love him have vanished, maybe because of lack of communications, which causes the right conditions for a beakup.</p>
              <p>When spreading the Dharma, when the right conditions (ç¼˜) do not exist, no matter how we preached, it'll never go into their ears.  For us, we understand that the right condiitons do not exist and so we should not be too pushy or åŸ·ç�€.  But at least we sow the seeds in their mind so that in their future rebirths, somehow these seeds will ripen and together with the right conditions, they'll practise the Dharma. </p>
              <p>When talking about ç¼˜, we should not forget about the å› .  å›  is the action, or thinking, that causes the ç¼˜ to happen.  If we attribute everything to ç¼˜, and we live passively, then what is going to contribute the the future ç¼˜?  And thus we must always be mindful of our present actions and be confident that it'll affect our ç¼˜ in the future.  At the same time, when things do not go our way, we note that the right conditions are not there and we remind ourselves not to be åŸ·ç�€.</p>
              <p>I hope I'm not being long-winded here.  Metta.</p>

              <p>ç¼˜ is not something mysterious or difficult to understand.  It is simply phenomena that is caused by the ripening of conditions.  It is when suitable conditions congregate that the phenomenon can be resulted.  When even one of these conditions fail to exist, then no matter what, that particular phenomenon cannot happen.</p>
              <p>It is important to note that ç¼˜ is not the action; it is just the right conditions.  Therefore it is not passive.  We cannot sit around and wait for ç¼˜ to happen. </p>
              <p>For example, if somebody wants to commit suicide, we cannot say that we leave it to his destiny whether he dies or not.  His intention to die is formed because the right factors are there, and so there is ç¼˜, but by executing his intention, he is actually creating the next ç¼˜ to happen, and that ç¼˜ is that he'll go to hell.  If he always does good deeds or practise Dharma, then before he's about to kill himself, there just might be one thought that comes to him, telling him about the illusory nature of all, and that single thought could just be the factor causing the conditons to die to fail.</p>
              <p>When a love one passes away, we should look at it in similar fashion.  The conditions for him to live have simply stopped to exist, so how could he live?  And thus your ç¼˜ with him has ended, as simple as that.  Any breakups in a relationship should also be looked upon as such.  The conditions for him to love you or for you to love him have vanished, maybe because of lack of communications, which causes the right conditions for a beakup.</p>
              <p>When spreading the Dharma, when the right conditions (ç¼˜) do not exist, no matter how we preached, it'll never go into their ears.  For us, we understand that the right condiitons do not exist and so we should not be too pushy or åŸ·ç�€.  But at least we sow the seeds in their mind so that in their future rebirths, somehow these seeds will ripen and together with the right conditions, they'll practise the Dharma. </p>
              <p>When talking about ç¼˜, we should not forget about the å› .  å›  is the action, or thinking, that causes the ç¼˜ to happen.  If we attribute everything to ç¼˜, and we live passively, then what is going to contribute the the future ç¼˜?  And thus we must always be mindful of our present actions and be confident that it'll affect our ç¼˜ in the future.  At the same time, when things do not go our way, we note that the right conditions are not there and we remind ourselves not to be åŸ·ç�€.</p>
              <p>I hope I'm not being long-winded here.  Metta.</p>

When one can live in the moment with expectations in harmony with experiences one has achieved the greatest mental contentment possible.
