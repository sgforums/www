              <p><em>The following Question and Answer with Daniel Ingram, was 
              taken from a longer interview that happened last year.  This question 
              did not make it into the final episode, due to its length.  Because of 
              the technical nature of the conversation, you may want to listen to some
               of our <a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/author/danielingram/">earlier
               interviews with Daniel</a>.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Vince:</strong> Just to get into a little bit of the 
              enlightenment models, which we’ve talked about before, but I don’t think
               we’ve discussed this.  One way you’ve talked about the process that you
               just described is this “ditching the split”. That the split somehow is 
              there. And then, as you go along, it starts to become smaller and 
              smaller. And that there’s some changes in the practitioner, on the 
              person who’s doing this process, as a result and then finally the split 
              is ditched.  Could you talk about that particular way of looking at this
               process?</p>
              <p><strong>Daniel:</strong> Yeah.  So, from what I’ll call a simple 
              model point of view, though it’s hard for me not to throw in some path 
              numbers, but called the simple model which is essentially the first 
              thing is you go through the cycles of insight and you go up through the 
              stages and you get stream entry.   And when you’ve got stream entry, you
               can get your fruitions and you can get your hits and you can go through
               your cycles.  And you can see all these things and you know all these 
              things in a way you didn’t know before.  And you can talk about the 
              dharma. You can talk about emptiness. But it’s not much of a living 
              experience most of the time for most people.  You’re walking around, you
               still seem to be basically the same.  Reality seems to be pretty dual 
              and I do really seem to be here somewhere in my head or my heart or my 
              body, looking out at a world out there that’s happening to me.  Or I’m 
              trying to do something with it.  Which is all reasonable ways to look at
               the world.  I’m not saying these don’t have their pragmatic point of 
              view.  But from a baseline experience point of view, there’s a lot more 
              that can be done.</p>
              <p>And so as people start to go through more insight cycles and new 
              territory, they may get into what I’ll call second path or the second 
              stage [of enlightenment] which is now they’ve completed a whole new 
              progress of insight.  They’re abandoned the previous stages and started 
              looking at more layers of mind and re-gone through the process of seeing
               the true nature of those and a new set of insight stages, <em>vipassana
               jhanas</em> or <em>nanas</em> or whatever you want to call them.  And 
              has gotten a new fruition. And gone, “Okay. So now I know how to abandon
               previous territories.  Start looking at new territory, new layers of 
              mind” and they are now what are called “second path” or the second stage
               in the simple model.  And their experience is all about, “Oh, this 
              fractal and this territory. Oh, this new thing and this experience.” 
              Particularly if they’re geeky people like myself. Now some people are 
              not geeky model-based people may not… but it’s what their experience may
               be. They cycle and they are seeing deep levels and deeper integrations 
              of the mind and not doing some things it used to do.  And doing some new
               things that it didn’t do before that they think are good.</p>
              <p>Then they begin to go, “Well it still seems like the point of my 
              practice is to get my fruition and get my hit. Sort of reset my mind.  
              But walking around, I’m not really seeing what I think I should be able 
              to see.”  And that gets more and more frustrating.  So people being to 
              incline their minds towards what I’ll call a less cycle-fixated approach
               and a more right-here-right-now, it’s got to be now or never kind of 
              dharma-awakening approach. And they begin to see more and more of what 
              I’ll call emptiness in real time.  Where, as they go deeper into more 
              cycles and stages and more really investigating how things are, just 
              moment to moment, same good, old foundation technique stuff. They begin 
              to notice, “Wait a second. The center point really doesn’t seem to be 
              such a big deal anymore.   The sense of subject seems to be becoming 
              more integrated with the field. Or it seems to become less important.” 
              Or they seem to see I’m seeing more of what I’ll call “luminosity of 
              phenomenon”. That they’re just showing themselves over there.  Because 
              that’s showing itself over there, maybe this is just showing itself over
               here.  And they begin to make those connections in terms of their 
              experience and begin to notice as an obvious living, direct, 
              non-theoretical but just sort of baseline sense processing experience.  
              Wow, this field really seems to be more and more integrated.  There 
              seems to be more and more just a sense of this is just what’s happening 
              and it’s all wide open and it’s all just part of the field of attention 
              and the sense of subject and center point and watcher or me, whatever 
              you want to call it,  at that level is not such a split off thing.  So 
              you can get to <em>anagami</em> stages, tend to be a lot like that. And 
              as you get towards the high end of the anagami territory, you start to 
              notice, “this seems to be really pretty complete and kind of done.”</p>
              <p>I remember when I was a late anagami, I don’t know how many stages I 
              went through thinking I was an Arhat and was so wrong. I would walk 
              around for a few weeks and everything seems centralist and luminous and 
              like it was happening on its own in some completely non-dual way. And 
              then I’d cross another arising and passing way and hit a new dark night 
              and realize I was completely delusional.  But it was kind of nice while 
              it seemed to last. And it sort of gave me hints of what would come next.</p>
              <p>So one begins to have…one’s experience become more and more 
              completely like that.  And then finally one can get to a place where one
               simply understands it has to be now and it has to be all the time and 
              there must be some truth that I’m missing.  And one finally begins to 
              see through the subtle anagami traps of wanting a super space—that some 
              transcendent space they can come into. Or wanting this to be some 
              super-watcher or wanting everything to be luminous in a wondrous “Oh 
              it’s all luminous, wonderful kind of way”. And as the golden chains of 
              the high levels, or mid-, high levels of realization start to fall away 
              and they end up coming back down to earth.  Finally they abandon even 
              those subtle things and subjects and wanting to be the subtle watcher 
              that is simultaneously empty and luminous and wanting to be the subtle 
              enlightened being that is the whatever…  The transcendent super being or
               something. And as that all finally falls away and is seen through as 
              being just preposterous and unrealistic, one understands, “Oh. This is 
              it.”  And when one finally comes all the way back down to earth, the 
              split can dissolve. That usually takes good work and strong 
              concentration and all the standard supports for insight and 
              investigation and all that. But finally one knows, “Oh yeah. This is 
              done.” And the sense of subject-object duality does not arise again once
               one is stabilizes in that. And the whole field is just happening and 
              life is just going on, bodies just moving, thoughts are just coming.  
              All aware or just manifesting where they are.  And concepts like 
              luminosity and awareness even seem extraneous.  There’s just the 
              sense-field , really at a basic, ordinary, human level. And yet there is
               something remarkable about that.  But it’s way more down to earth than 
              everybody thinks it’s going to be.  That’s my basic outline of the 
              stages of insight from that point of view.</p>
