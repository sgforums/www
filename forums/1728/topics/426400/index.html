In the grouping of Consciousness, six kinds are classified. They are the consciousness of Sight, Hearing, Smell, Taste, sense of Touch and Mental or Intellectual consciousness. </span></p>
              <h1 style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 3.25pt;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;  "><span style="font-family: Cambria;">The dynamic nature of consciousness and existence can be compared to a river which, while continuously flowing still preserves its relative identity. The Theravadins called this stream ‘bhavanga-sota’, the subconscious stream of existence or of becoming in which all experiences or contents of conciousness have been stored since beginningless time, to reappear in active, waking consciousness whenever the conditions and mental association call them forth. The observation of this continuity is what give rise to our self-consciousness, which to the Vijnanavadins is a function of our Mind (manas), the seventh class of Consciouness. It is different from the co-ordinating and integrating of sense-impression in the Thought or Mental consciouness (mano-vijnana)</span></span></h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style='font-family: "Cambria","serif"; font-size: 10pt;  '>Thus the object of the seventh class of consciousness (manas) is not the sense world, but the ever flowing stream of becoming or our depth consciousness, which is neither limited by birth and death nor by individual form of appearance. Birth and death are only the doors between one life and another with the continuous stream of consciousness flowing through them. This consciousness contained on its surface the causally conditioned state of existence and also the sum total of all experiences of a beginningless past. To the Vijnanavadins, this is the eighth, the Universal or Storehouse Consciousness (alaya-vijnana). The sixth consciousness which is term the Intellectual or Empirical consciousness <span>(mano-vijnana)</span>, sort and judges the result of the five kind of sense consciousness, followed by attraction or repulsion and the illusion of our objective world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style='font-family: "Cambria","serif"; font-size: 10pt;  '>The eighth, the Universal Consciousness is compared to the ocean, which on the surface, current and wave forms, while its depth remains motionless, pure and clear. It transcends all limits, it is pure, unchanging, undisturbed by our ego, without distinctions, desires and aversions. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style='font-family: "Cambria","serif"; font-size: 10pt;  '>Between the Universal Consciousness and the individual Intellectual Consciousness is the Spiritual Consciousness (manas), which takes part in both sides. It is the centre of balance and reference for these two consciousnesses and is of double characteristic. It is the cause for the conception of egohood in the unenlightened individual being who mistake this relative point for the real and permanent centre of his personality. It is our intellect, our mental consciousness (mano-vijnana) which conceives our seventh consciousness (manas) as our Ego. In this state, it is termed the ‘defiled mind’, the nature of which consists in an uninterrupted process of ego creating thoughts and discrimination. On the positive side, the intuitive side of manas is one with the Universal Consciousness participating in Transcendental Intelligence. When manas is directed from the Universal Consciousness towards the individual or self consciousness, it becomes a source of error. When directed from the Empirical towards the Universal Consciousness, it becomes a source of highest knowledge. </span></p>

There is the ‘I’ and the object observed. The other, is a vision of another who gazes into the vast expense of space or heaven, which free him of all object perception and thus from the awareness of his own self as he is only conscious of the infinity of space. The ‘I’ here loses its position through a lack of contrast or opposite with nothing to grasp or differentiate itself. </span></p>

Liberation hence consists in the reversal of this process, in the progressive annihilation of these limitations. Annihilation here does not mean the suppression of sense consciousness, but a new attitude towards them, consisting in the removal of arbitrary discriminations, attachments and prejudices, i.e., the elimination of karmic formations which create the illusion of samsara, of birth and death. When there is a turning away from the outside world of objects to the inner world of oneness and completeness we have enter into the stream of liberation. </span></p>

              <p>the eight storehouse conciousness is a unique and personal consciousness. the notion of universal cosmic consciousness is non buddhist</p>
              <p>"We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein. But we must be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual level. Likewise, when we speak of karma as the cause of the universe we eliminate the notion of a unique entity called karma existing totally independently. Rather, collective karmic impressions, accumulated individually, are at the origin of the creation of a world. When, in the tantric context, we say that all worlds appear out of clear light, we do not visualize this source as a unique entity, but as the ultimate clear light of each being." - hhdl, http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html</p>
              <p>"Now, depending on whether this consciousness without dualistic thought is defined as fundamental and over-arching, or unique and personal, we have the distinction between Hindu Vedanta and the mind-only position of Indian Buddhist Cittamatrins. It could even be the svasamvedana of the Buddhist logicians, the non-conceptual self-knowing mind." - loppon namdrol, http://www.atikosha.org/2010/11/rigpa-ii.html</p>
              <p>"Glossary (from http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/Yogacara_glossary.html):
                                *Alaya-vijnana, or "store consciousness" -- one of the central technical terms of Yogacara (Vijnanavada, Vijnaptimatra) philosophy of Mahayana Buddhism. Early Buddhists taught about existence of six-fold consciousness, that is the conciousness of five types of perception (visual, audial, etc.) and of "mind" (manovijnana). The Yogacarins analysing the source of consciousness added two more kinds of consciousness. They are: klistamanovijnana, or manas, that is the ego-centre of an empirical personality, and alaya-vijnana which is the source of other kinds of consciousness. Alaya-vijnana is above subject-object opposition but it is not a kind of absolute mind: alaya-vijnana is momentary and non-substantial. Every sentient being with the corresponding to this being "objective" world can be reduced to its "own" alaya-vijnana. Therefore, classical Yogacara states the existence of many alayas.
                                The Alaya-vijnana is a receptacle and container of the so-called "seeds" (bija), or elementary units of past experiences. These bijas project themselves as an illusionary world of empirical subjects and corresponding objects. All other seven types of consciousness are but transformations (parinama) of alaya-vijnana. In the course of its yogic practice a Yogacarin must empty alaya-vijnana of its contents. Thus the Yogacarin puts an end to the tendency of external projections of alaya-vijnana changing it into non-dual (advaya) wisdom (jnana) of Enlightened mind."</p>
