              ceremony drew large crowds of believers over the weekend, including many
              Westerners, to a Buddhist temple known for its lineage of revered masters.</span></h2>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>A heavily tattooed Thai man trembles as he releases a
              full-throated animal scream. He struggles to his feet, seemingly against his
              will, and charges forward, only to be restrained by the brute force of temple
              officials.<br> <br> The man is experiencing a trance state commonly witnessed at an annual ceremony
              that pays respect to a late sacred Thai tattoo master and former temple abbot.<br> <br> Tens of thousands of believers over the weekend crowded onto the grounds of Wat
              Bang Phra in Nakhon Pathom, some 50 kilometres west of the Thai capital, to
              re-energize their tattoos’ spiritual powers.<br> <br> They gathered under a sweltering sun, sitting cross-legged on plastic mats,
              some with their heads bowed in meditation, and waited hours fora blessing from
              the temple’s current tattoo masters.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>The spectacle of followers in
              trance states was constant. They roared like tigers, howled like monkeys and
              shouted like men possessed,assuming the animal powers of their magical ink.<br> <br> Pongsakorn Yodchumpong, 30, whose body is covered in mystical insignia, was
              among those who entered such a state. His body shook,he growled, and he tried
              several times to stampede through the crowd.<br> <br> His girlfriend later sat behind him, rubbing his ears to calm him down.<br> <br> "I have no idea what caused it to happen," he said, his eyes still
              red and watery from the trance. "I was sitting there listening to the
              speaker, and it slowly came on. I attend the ceremony every year, and it
              happens every year."<br> <br> Temple officials reminded visitors over a loudspeaker that the masters did not
              encourage them to enter a trance.<br> <br> "They only want you to be grateful for the blessing," they said.<br> <br> Thailand’s sacred tattoos are believed to bring different types of good
              fortune, including protection, power, good luck and prosperity.<br> <br> To harness the power of the sacred ink, disciples are instructed to follow
              basic Buddhist precepts, including not taking life and not consuming
              intoxicants, among others.<br> <br> Still, few seemed sure what exactly causes the trance state.<br> <br> "In theory, the ’wicha’ is being awakened, the magic implanted in them,
              this metaphysical substance that’s been planted in their bodies by the
              master," said Joe Cummings, the author of Sacred Tattoos of Thailand and a
              recent TEDx Talk speaker on the subject.<br> <br> "When they first have their tattoos done, they go into trance, and then
              when it’s recharged, it happens again because it’s being reawakened," he
              told dpa.<br> <br> In recent years, the popularity of traditional Thai tattoos, known as"sak
              yant," has extended beyond the country’s borders, and many Westerners now
              appreciate their magical import.<br> <br> Scattered throughout the crowd at Wat Bang Phra were many foreigners whose
              bodies were covered in Thai sacred tattoos.<br> <br> "My German family thinks I’m crazy," said Frank Kruppa, whose chest,back
              and upper arms are inked with 108 tattoos from the temple.<br> <br> "But the tattoos have been very helpful for me, very powerful."<br> <br> Of the trances, Kruppa said he felt capable of entering such a state himself,
              but that he’s "afraid of what would happen."<br> <br> "I want to control my emotions. It’s better for me," said the Berlin
              native, who is now a longtime resident of Bangkok.<br> <br> The Hollywood star Angelina Jolie helped popularize Thai tattoos around the
              world when she had a "ha taew" (five lines) design inked on her left
              shoulder blade in 2003.<br> <br> Jolie returned the following year and had a large, Thai-style tiger tattooed on
              her lower back.<br> <br> The first tattoo given to disciples at Wat Bang Phra is known as the"gao
              yord," which translates as the nine peaks, representative of the
              cosmological Mount Meru in Hindu and Buddhist mythology.<br> <br> The interest in Thai tattoos has grown such that one high-end Bangkok resort,
              The Siam Hotel, created its own tattoo salon on site where a master from Wat
              Bang Phra inks guests.<br> <br> "We’ve done (actress) Michelle Rodriguez, NBA basketball stars, it’s
              great," said Jason Friedman, the former general manager of The Siam Hotel
              who oversaw the project.<br> <br> Friedman attended the ceremony at Wat Bang Phra with hotel guests,and he rolled
              up his short sleeves to reveal intricate Thai tattoo patterns covering his
              upper arms and shoulders.<br> <br> "I get a tingle when they chant, but I’ve never gone into a trance,"
              Friedman said.<br> <br> An Italian man who asked not to be identified said he personally experienced the
              trance in previous years.<br> <br> "I still haven’t figured it out," he said. "I consider myself to
              be very grounded. I was in shock. When it happened to me, I went through a
              stage like I was in and out of a dream.<br> <br> "It was like I kept coming and going in a conscious state of being."</span></p>
