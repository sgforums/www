              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>BENGALURU:
              The island nation of Sri Lanka forms part of a Buddhist circuit that is very
              popular and attracts devotees as well as tourists from far and wide. On my
              visit to Sri Lanka, on the itinerary was a visit to a site where an ancient
              relic, the tooth of Lord Buddha, has been preserved and worshiped for more than
              2,000 years. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>The
              Temple of Tooth Relic is situated in the heart of Kandy town. Situated next to
              a lake amid rolling hills, the temple is based in the royal palace complex of
              the former kingdom of Kandy. It is surrounded by lovely gardens and one can
              relax in the various sitouts that spread across the place. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>This
              temple came under sustained bombardment of the LTTE during the strife in 1998,
              however, it was restored immediately, but one can still see many a ruined
              structure strewn about in the park area.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>We
              visited the temple during morning hours,  when just the second round of
              prayers had begun with young and old thronging the prayer hall in all devotion
              and offering flowers of every colour and hue to Lord Buddha. We also saw
              mothers getting their babes blessed by the monks. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>The
              aroma of incense sticks, flowers and continuous drumming added to the intense
              devotion of thousands of people who were waiting to get a glimpse of the holy
              relic which has been housed in this township for two to three centuries. It was
              not just to see the relic but also to see at close quarters how Buddhism is
              practised in various forms outside India, the birthplace of this religion. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>A
              two-storied structure, the main shrine is decorated with lot of motifs,
              paintings, sculptures, while the entrance door is carved in ivory. The tooth is
              preserved in seven golden caskets (styled as a stupa) that is engraved with
              precious gemstones but which one hardly gets to see. It is covered by a crown
              so the relic is barely visible. The casket is opened only during prayers or
              offerings and revealed only three times a day – 5.30, 9.30 and 6.30 pm.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>The
              golden canopy over the main shrine is an added attraction here as pointed out
              by our guide. Facing the shrine, is a huge table with offerings of flowers
              while the air is thick with their perfume. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>Wall
              paintings in the temple interiors depict the history behind the tooth relic,
              how it was brought from India, hidden and then installed at various places by
              successive kings and disciples. The entire story of Lord Buddha and the relic
              has been depicted through a series of oil paintings inside the main shrine.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>The
              Tooth Relic temple is, in fact, a massive complex with huge halls, an audience
              hall, and of course, a series of museums. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>There
              is lot to see in the royal palace complex with the collection of art works,
              photographs, wooden carvings in the audience hall, a stuffed elephant, the
              temple of the tooth museum, the National Museum and even a bird sanctuary. The
              historical records of how the tooth relic was preserved for centuries has been
              maintained in one of the new museums.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #5c5c5c;'>Make
              it a point to visit the temple only during early morning hours as, after this,
              it becomes very crowded and it is impossible to see the magnificence of the
              temple interiors. A guide is easily available for just 200-300 Sri Lankan
              rupees who will explain in detail the history behind this world heritage site.
              The entry fee to the temple iss`500 for visitors from SAARC countries while
              `1,000 from other countries.</span></p>
