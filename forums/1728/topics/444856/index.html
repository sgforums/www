              <p><strong>*More 'Buddhist Question &amp; Answers On 2012'*</strong><br> <br> 'The Truth About 2012' can be seen clarified by NASA (America's<br> astronomical science authority) in the video at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/7463829">http://vimeo.com/7463829</a> Though<br> NASA already openly reassures that nothing particularly terrible will<br> happen in 2012, some '2012-doomsday- or-disaster' propagators claim that<br> their source of information was leaked from NASA, that NASA is concealing<br> their findings due to fear of causing panic. If so, is their information<br> officially from NASA or not? If official information of impending disaster<br> did leak from NASA, it should be proved traceable to NASA by the<br> propagators. If this is not proved by them, what ground is there to believe<br> them? If it is agreed that panic should not be caused, why should the<br> propagators do exactly that?<br> <br> We should be mindful not to rely on others’ words based on blind faith, but<br> to investigate personally. If one simply believes what another says due to<br> the person’s reputation, one is relying on a personality and not the truth<br> itself. This is going against the Buddha’s teachings in a very fundamental<br> way. One should ask oneself if one will believe the same ideas if they are<br> propagated by another person instead. <strong>Some think that propagating 2012<br> ideas might be a skilful means to urge everyone to buck up our spiritual<br> practice. However, there are clearly much more skilful means to do so, such<br> as using the Buddha’s teaching of immediacy - to live each moment well due to unpredictability of the next.</strong><br> <br> On the idea that there will be major disasters with some survivors in 2012,<br> it is worth noting that many die in disasters every year. For each<br> individual who suffers as a result, it is already a ‘doomsday’ or disaster<br> day. We are thus already survivors of sorts. Although these disasters were<br> not ‘the end of the world’ for us, the possibility of facing a deadly<br> disaster is already present in every moment for everyone. There is no way<br> to say for sure who will die when. Being attached to the idea that one will<br> die or suffer only in 2012 can thus lead to dangerous spiritual<br> complacency. As such, we should live each moment fully, with as much<br> mindful compassion and wisdom as we can.<br> <br> To read the full article, where the above excerpts are from, please see<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://thedailyenlightenment.com/2011/12/buddhist-questions-answers-on-2012">http://thedailyenlightenment.com/2011/12/buddhist-questions-answers-on-2012</a></p>
              <p>This does not claim that everyone will be alright in any particular year or on<br> any day. What this says is that based on scientific and Buddhist<br> perspectives, 2012 is not particularly special. As life is always<br> unpredictable, we should live each moment best we can. No one can go wrong<br> with this advice, while clinging only to a particular year or day being a<br> ‘doomsday’ or a disaster day is unhealthy. <strong>May fellow Buddhists and Dharma<br> teachers be mindful of not causing the Dharma they share and themselves to lose credibility by sharing any unskilful ideas on 2012. May this be a<br> spiritually fruitful new year for all.</strong><br> <br> Namo Amituofo : Shen Shi'an</p>

              <p>yes. 2012 end of the world lol. the earth is at least 6 billion years old, what are the odds of the earth not surviving for another 1 billion years, 100 million years, 10 million years? what is the lifespan of a planet like earth? earth will just end in 2012 like that? give me a break. those ancient soothsayers, ignore those ignorant ancient few thousand years of culture and beliefs, where science and technology were non existent in that era.</p>
              <p>come one, we live in an era where science and technology are supposed to be advanced compared to 100 years ago. even if a meteorite the size of NY were to crash into earth, earth will still survive, but I am not sure if humans can survive on impact. after impact, there will be no sunlight for many many years, thereby killing all plant life and thus no food on earth. plants depend on sunlight for growth.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Like what I've said in the other post. Those so call signs of end of the world (natural disasters, wars etc.) happen throughout our history. Humans had survived World War I, World War II, Black Death, Spanish Flu etc. These disasters which happened hundreds of years ago were worse than what we are facing now. So, stop believing in signs of end of the world.</p></div>

              <p>I agree that the year 2012 is not "end of the world". However, I will disagree that if you think that "no major changes will happen in 2012 and no preparations will be needed".</p>

              <p>As for whether there are major changes or not, just wait and experience it for yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> .
