            <div class='col-md body'>Just to post here as the old thread had expired.<br><br><strong>Japanese monks try to promote Buddhism through fashion, rap music</strong><br><br>By MARI YAMAGUCHI,Associated Press Writer AP - Sunday, December 16TOKYO - Japanese monks and nuns held a fashion show _ replete with rap music and a catwalk _ at a major Tokyo temple Saturday to promote Buddhism.<br><br>In the "Tokyo Bouz (monk) Collection" held at Tsukiji Honganji, nearly 40 monks and nuns from eight major Buddhist sects joined in the event aimed at winning back believers.<br><br>Following a rap version of a Buddhist sutra, five monks from each school walked on the runway, then chanted prayers and wrapped up in a grand finale with confetti resembling lotus petals.<br><br>"We wanted to show the young people that Buddhism is cool, and temples are not a place just for funerals," said Koji Matsubara, a chief monk at Tsukiji.<br><br>More than 1,200 years after it first arrived from mainland Asia, Buddhism in Japan is in crisis, priests say.<br><br>Almost three-quarters of Japan's population of 120 million are registered as Buddhist, but for many, the only time they enter a temple is to attend a funeral. That has sent many of the country's 75,000 temples into financial trouble.<br><br>"Many of us priests share the sense of crisis, and a need to do something to reach out to people," said priest Kosuke Kikkawa, 37, one of the organizers of Saturday's event. "We won't change Buddha's teachings, but perhaps we need a different presentation that can touch the feelings of the people today."<br><br>The Tsukiji Honganji offers theological seminars in English for foreign visitors, and has fitted its main hall with a pipe organ for Western-style weddings to attract young couples. Some other temples have also introduced cafes, art galleries and other innovations to reach out to young people who are interested in a different lifestyle.<br><br>Japan's aging population has meant more funerals, but the declining population and birth rate means fewer young people to share the bill to keep temples afloat.<br><br>Buddhist monks traditionally wear simple black robes.<br><br>But to appeal to more fashion-conscious youth, the monks wore green and yellow clothes, some with gold embroidery. Others wore elaborate, multilayered robes.<br><br>"Their robes were gorgeous," said Sayaka Anma, one of the audience in her 20s, after the monks' show. "I was a bit surprised in the beginning, but it was very moving."<br><br><img src="http://ca.c.yimg.jp/news/20071216074018/img.news.yahoo.co.jp/images/20071216/hsk_gz/20071215-00000000-hsk_gz-l13-view-000.jpg"><br><img src="http://ca.c.yimg.jp/news/20071215193058/img.news.yahoo.co.jp/images/20071215/jijp/20071215-00000030-jijp-soci-view-000.jpg"></div>
