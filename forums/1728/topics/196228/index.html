            <div class='col-md body'>Ten Doubts about Pure Land<br>By Tien Tai Patriarch Chih I<br>Translated by Master Thich Thien Tam<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/sinweiy/TenDoubtsaboutPureLand.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/sinweiy/TenDoubtsaboutPureLand.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Question 3<br><br>All the Pure Lands of the Buddhas of the ten directions have equal qualities and virtues. Their Dharma Nature is also the same. Therfore, the practitioner should meditate on all the virtues of the Buddhas and seek rebirth in the various Pure Lands of the ten directions. Why should he specifically seek rebirth in the Pure Land of one particular Buddha (i.e., Amitabha)? Is this not contrary to the truth of "equally in seeking rebirth"?<br><br>Answer<br><br>All the Pure Lands of the Buddhas are, in truth, equal. Nevetheless, since the majority of sentient beings in our world generally have dull faculties and defiled, scattered minds, it will be difficult for them to achieve samadhi, unless they concentrate exclusively on one realm.<br><br>The practice of constantly focussing on Amitabha Buddha is the "Single Mark Samadhi". Because the Mind is exclusively devoted to one thing, the practitioner achieves rebirth in the Pure Land. In the Sutra Rebirth According to One's Vows, Buddha Sakyamuni was asked by a Bodhisattva, "Honored One! There are Pure Lands in all ten directions. Why do you especially extol the Western Pure Land and urge sentient beings to focus continuously<br>on Amitabha Buddha, seeking rebirth in His Land?"<br><br>The Buddha replied, "Sentient beings in this Saha World generally have polluted, scattered minds. Therefore, I only extol one Pure Land in the West, focussing their Minds on a single realm. If they meditate on all Buddhas, the scope of attention will be too broad, their Minds<br>will be lost and scattered and they will find samadhi difficult to attain. Thus, they will fail to achieve rebirth in the Pure Land.<br><br>"Furthermore, seeking their virtues of one Buddha is the same as seeking the virtues of all Buddhas -- as all Buddhas have one common Dharma Nature. That is why to focus on Amitabha Buddha is to focus on all Buddhas, to be born in the Western Pure Land is to be born in all Pure Lands."<br><br>Thus, the Avatamsaka Sutra states:<br><br>"The bodies of all the Buddhas / are the body of any one Buddha. / They have the same Mind and the same wisdom. / They are also equal in power and fearlessness."<br><br>The Avatamsaka Sutra further states:<br><br>"It is like the full moon, round and bright, its image reflected in all rivers and ponds. Although the reflection is everywhere, there is but a single moon. So it is with ... (the Buddhas). Although they appear in all realms, their bodies are non-dual."<br><br>In summary, based on these examples, the wise will understand the truth that "one is all, all is one". When this truth is grasped, concentrating on one Buddha is precisely concentrating on all<br>Buddhas.<br><br>Question 4<br><br>There are many Buddhas and Pure Lands in all the ten directions. Even if sentient beings in this world have polluted, scattered minds and dispositions, so that focussing on many Buddhas makes it difficult for them to attain samadhi, why should they not recite the name of any Buddha, as they wish, and seek rebirth in any Pure Lamd, in accordance with their vows? Why concentrate specifically on Amitabha Buddha and seek rebirth in the Land of<br>Ultimate Bliss?<br><br>Answer<br><br>Common people lacking in wisdom should follow the teaching of the Buddha rather than acting arbitrarily on their own. This is why, from time immemorial, Pure Land practitioners have all diligently recited Amitabha Buddha's name.<br><br>What does it mean to follow the Buddha's teaching?<br><br>During his entire preaching career, Buddhs Sakyamuni constantly enjoined sentient beings to focus on Amitabha Buddha and seek rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.<br>This is mentioned in such sutras as the Longer Amitabha Sutra, the Meditation Sutra, the Amitabha Sutra, the Lotus Sutra, the Avatamsaka Sutra ... In numerous sutras, the Buddha constantly urged us to seek rebirth in the Western Land. This is not only true of the sutras; in their commentaries, the Bodhisattvas and Patriarchs unanimously<br>advise us to seek rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.<br><br>Moreover, Amitabha Buddha possesses the power of His forty-eight compassionate vows to rescue sentient beings. The Meditation Sutra states:<br><br>"Amitabha Buddha possesses 84,000 signs of perfection, each sign has 84,000 minor marks of excellence and from each minor mark 84,000 rays of light shine forth, illuminating the entire Dharma Realm (cosmos) to gather in, without exception, all sentient beings who practice Buddha Recitation. If any sentient being recite His name, there will be correspondence between cause<br>and response, and he will surely be reborn."<br><br>Furthermore, the Amitabha Sutra, the Longer Amitabha Sutra, etc., teach that when Sakyamuni Buddha preached these sutras, the Buddhas of the ten directions, numerous as the grains of sand in the River Ganges, all "extended their tongues to cover the entire universe", bearing witness to the truth that any sentient being who recites Amitabha Buddha's name shall be assured of rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, thanks to the great, compassionate vow-power of the Buddha.<br><br>We should know that Amitabha Buddha has great affinities (causes and conditions) with this world. As the Longer Amitabha Sutra states:<br><br>"In the Dharma-Ending Age, when all other sutras have disappeared, only this sutra will remain for another hundred years to rescue sentient beings and lead them to the Western Pure Land."<br><br>This demostrates that Amitabha Buddha has strong affinities with sentient beings in this defiled world.<br><br>Although one or two sutras have, in a general way, urged rebirth in other Pure Lands, this cannot be compared to the fact that numerous sutras and commentaries have earnestly pointed out to the Land of Ultimate Bliss as the focus of rebirth. </span><br>/\<br><br></div>

All their senses shall be perfectly restored, and they shall not suffer from diseases.'<br><br>The seventh vow. 'I vow that, after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment, those who are tormented by diseases, who have nobody to whom they can seek for help, without a refuge, without a doctor, without medicine, without relatives, without a home; these poor and miserable beings shall all of them be free from diseases and troubles, and shall enjoy perfect health of body and mind, once my name reaches their ears. They shall have families, friends and properties a-plenty, and shall all be brought to the supreme Enlightenment of Buddha.'<br><br>The eighth vow. 'I vow that, after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment, women who are tormented by the hundred of sufferings of the female sex, who are much wearied of life and long to make bodily sacrifice, shall all of them, when they hear my name, be transformed into men instead of women, in the next re-birth, they shall get the form of manhood and shall in the end attain the supreme Enlightenment of Buddha.'<br><br>The ninth vow.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">The Great Dharma King Amitabha Buddha<br><br>by Venerable Master Hsuan Hua </span><br><br>This four characters: A Mi Tou Fwo (Amitabha Buddha) means inconceivable, so it says,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Buddha Amitabha is the great Dharma king,<br>universally gather all various faculties of living beings to the West.<br>Day and night, hold his name, with sincerity recite it.<br>At all times, in contemplation, think upon it well.<br>With one herat unconfused, you realize samadhi.<br>when all creation's void, you'll enter the Lotus Land.<br>Suddenly enlightened to the non-production, the Buddha appears in person.<br>A wonderful enlightenment fruition is naturally attained.</span><br><br>This eight verse praises Amitabha Buddha as the great Dharma king. Heng Chang wrote me a letter and addressed me as " Venerable Master Dharma king", Is master a Dharma king? that is not for sure, but Amitabha Buddha definitely is a great Dharma king, so his name is Amitabha Buddha. Amitabha is a Sanskrit word, which means" limitless life" , also means" limitless light". Limitless life is symbolizing his unlimited blessing, and limitless light describes his unlimited wisdom, so it means both blessing and wisdom are unlimited.<br><br>The blessing is completed, the wisdom is completed. With both blessing and wisdom are perfected, he is named the Buddha of limitless life and wisdom. Limitless life can cause all living beings also to obtain limitless life. Limitless light can make all living beings to attain limitless light too. Why is it? Because Buddha is not selfish, he did not say," AH! only me can monopolize the limitless life, you can't have it.", or he won't say, " Only I have this limitless light, living being can share none of it.".Whoever recites the name of Amitabha Buddha will gain the limitless life. Whoever recite Amitabha can gain limitless light. The unlimitless life and light could be obtained by everyone. Hence the words "Amitabha Buddha" are inconceivable, so he is called great Dharma King. Amitabha Buddha is the king within Dharma, not only he is the king within the Buddha Dharma but is a great Dharma King, so you see how great he is! those who recite the name of Amitabha Buddha have good roots; Those who have no good roots will not encounter this dharma door. How simple this Dharma door is! All you have to do is reciting. <span style="font-style: italic;">Just by reciting the name of Amitabha Buddha, you can become Buddha,</span> which without spending money or effort. As long as you can recite it, you too can attain limitless life and light. Why could we gain this just by reciting ? Isn't this a bit too much of a bargain for us to be able to learn this dharma door without making any effort!<br><br>The reason for it is because in the past lifes, Amitabha Buddha cultivated all kinds of dharma doors without success. He had cultivated this and that dharma door for several great kalpas without being able to obtain Buddhahood. He had been precticing various dharma doors, and had undergone bitter experiences. Because of this,<strong> he then made the vow, " Since I had undergone such a difficulty while I was cultivating the Buddha Dharma, I want to make a vow to cause all living beings to accomplish Buddhahood easily, I don't want them to go through the same hardship as I did.". So Amitabha Buddha made forty-eight vows,which universally gather all living beings . All living beings of the ten directions, as long as you can recite " Na Mo A Mi Ta Bha Buddha", the name that I accomplish the Buddhahood, then I will assure to take you and to become Buddha. If you don't become Buddha, then I myself neither will become Buddha nor attain enlightenment.</strong><br>Amitibha Buddha had made the forty-eight great vows, therefore, any living being of the ten directions, whoever could recite the name of Amitabha Buddha,has deeply tied up the dharma condition with him. Once the dharma conditon has been tied up,Wao, you will be in the West before you are aware of it. So it says, " Universally gather all beings of various faculties ". Yet you still don't know how did you make it to get there. You may wonder, " Gee! I did not buy any airline ticke to come here-the West? I did not purchase any train, or boat, or bus ticket. I buy none of it and I come to Western Ultimate Bliss Land already.". Don't you think that you got a great deal of it? Amitabha Buddha in the former life had made a great effort and cultivated many ascetic practices to be able to become Buddha. Now, we just only need to recite the name of Amitabha Buddha, and we can go to the land of Western Ultimate Bliss. Don't you think that it is a good bargain? There is nothing more expedience, more convenience than this, it is truly" easy! easy! easy! you could realize the patriach's mind on the tip of myriad grass." it is too easy, it is extremely easy. So it is said," universally gather all living beings" , you could see that we here all have a connection with Amitabha Buddha like radio. If you recite Amitabha Buddha, your shadow will be reflected on the radar of Amitabha Buddha. If we say it more advanced, it is like T.V., we send a fax to him. Amitabha Buddha will know and catch the wave whoever recites his name,that person's mind telegram will be sent to Amitabha Buddha.  Isn't it really wonderful? So it is said, " universally gather all faullties of living beings to the West."<br><br>"Morning and night, hold his name, with sincerity recite it": To recite the name of Amitabha Buddha day and night. In movement and stillness, you recite his name. While moving you can recite and change the motion into stillness; while still you can recite and change the still into motion. When there is neither movement nor stillness, at this state, your telegram to Amitabha has gotten through and you have received his response. "hold his name" means you concentrately hold the name of Amitabha Buddha- Na Mo A Mi Ta Bha Buddha, Na Mo A Mi Ta Bha Buddha..., don't lose it, don't forget about it, remember it by heart. If you maintain your recitation morning and night without stopping, you may recite to the point that you don't realize moving when you walk, you don't know the stillness when you sit, you don't feel thirst when you are thirty, you don't feel hunger when you are hungry, you don't know freezing when you are cold , you don't experience the warmth when you are warm, There is nothing at all. At that time, you recite to the state of both people and dharma are empty, Amitabha becomes you, and you are Amitabha Buddha, there is no way to seperate, there is no way to put it down. That is what it means by " morning and night, hold his name, with sincerity recite it."<br><br>Recite it single-minded and sincerely without false thoughts. You don't think how is China nowadays, how is Japan rescentantly, how is Mahatma Gandhi, the prime minister of India,right now. What for to think of all these worthless matters? If you do not strike up all these false thoughts, you are singlemindly and sincerely in recitation. To recite and uphold the name concentrately to the point that you were ask," what is the day of today?", You don't know. "what is the date of tomorrow?' You don't know.To recite till not knowing anything, then you arrive at a miraculous state.<br><br>You may ask," But isn't this stupid?" " Stupid?" It trains you to become wise. It's said, "If you can train to become great dolt, then you become clever", If you are stupid to the extreme point, then you come to be talent and clever. "If you can learn to be stupid, then the marvel appears.". Look at Yan Yuan, for example, Confucius said, " I have spoken with Hui for a whole day and he has not contradicted me, as if he were a stupid." Hui had acted like a very stupid person. "But I have examined his actions when he retired from me and found that he puts the teachings into practice, Hui is not stupid!". Confucius said that after Hui went back to his room, I had been watching and examining him, I found that Hui brought what he had learned into fully play, Hui was not stupid at all. If you are able to learn to be stupid like this then it's not bad at all.<br><br>cont'd</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cont'd<br><br>When mentioned this, it reminded me of being arrogant before. I remember when I was young and first started school, I was very slow and dull at the very begining, I could not remember my lessons. If I had managed to learn and memorize my lesson clearly, when I stood before the teacher to recite it , I was just like seeing King Yama,and I forgot them all. Because our teacher was holding something similar to the incense board in his hand, and stood there waiting for you seriously , and was looking at you. Seeing him in that way, you are already scared out of your wits. There is a Chinese old way of school teaching, it was too severe, It scared the child and made the child cry who usually doesn't cry. After I have found the skillful way of study, I could study fast and well, and could master in an hour what took other students even more than five days to learn. My teacher said to me,"Wau! You are really like Yen Hui, it really can't tell that you are such a smart one! You are really clever!" I became arrogant when I heard he praised me and I thought," Oh! I am the same as Yen Hui. Would I die the same age as he did? En, I am going to give myself a name." what was it ? it was called " semblance of stupidity." means someone is like a stupid.That is the name of arrogance.<br><br>If you can recite the Buddha's name to the point that you can let go of everything and like a stupidity, I don't mean that to be a stupid like the one who was taking drugs, it doesn't count, then you will suddenly penetrate and be enlightened.So it is said, "morning and night, hold his name, with sinceriety recite it."<br><br>" <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>At all times, in contemplation, think upon it well.": </strong></span>At all times you are in contemplation, of what you contemplate? you contemplate,"Amitabha's body is the color of gold, the splendor of his hallmarks has no peer, the light of his brow shines round a hundred world, wide as the four great seas are his eyes pure and clear, shining in his brilliance by transformation are coundless Bodhisattvas and infinite Buddhas,his forty-eight vows will cross all living beings, in nine lotus- stages we reach the farest shore "<span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>To contemplate the splendor of Amitabha Buddha's hallmark, this is the meaning of contemplation. At all times contemplate and don't lose track. "Think upon it well</strong></span>", you should think upon the wholesome state of Amitabha Buddha, don't bother to think of unnecessary matters, then that is the meaning of " think upon it well."<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>With one heart unconfused recitation, you'll realize samadhi</strong></span>." If I dan recite with one unconfused heart, I can enter samadhi. With one unconfused heart,which lead to attain the samadhi, is like to be stupid. Whoever follows and learns from me should remember, not to practice the dharma door of arrogance like I had before. I was very arrogant, so now I feel that everybody is better than me. I have put down the arrogance, and the more people are better than me, the happier I am, the more pleased I am! I will not be jealous, why is it? If people are better than you , of course it is fine! Why does it have to be that I am better than others? I don't need to be better than other people, I am worse than anybody. This is my principle.<br><br>"<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">When all creation's void, you enter the lotus Land</span></strong>", all creation's void means there is not grief, all worry are void, all thoughts are void. Myriad thoughts are empty, there is not a single false thinking arise, there is no worry, there is no affliction. "enter the Lotus Land", means to enter the world of Lotus flower, the country-side of Lotus flower. when you reach that state, then you " suddenly enlightened to the non-production" : you immediately enlighten to the patience of the non-production Dharma, which means to thoroughly understand the origional face. "the Buddha appears in person" : At that time the Buddha manifest the Dharma body, "The wonderful enlightenment is natually attained" : the wonderful enlightenment is the Buddha's fruition. You are able to shoulder the Buddha's position directly. You may say, " Oh! I am the Buddha now." It doesn't meant that you think you are a Buddha, then you are a Buddha already, the Buddha does not come by thinking. You have to truly attain the Buddha's dharma body, truly certify to the Buddha's fruition, then you can be considered as a Buddha. So it doesn't mean that you think of being a Buddha, you are a Buddha already. <span style="font-style: italic;">what about if you think you are a ghost, then you really are a ghost. </span>So everybody should work hard to cultivate this dharma door of Buddha's recitation.<br><br>What I have talk about today, if you can recite to the point of being single mindly without confusion, all creation's void, then at this very moment, you gain some benefits, at that very moment it is pure. So the dharma door of Buddha's recitation is wonderfully inexpressible. What would it be like of reciting? It is like a child eats candy. After eating candy, the child tastes the sweetness of it, and he still keeps on thinking to eat it again without being able to put it down. We should apply the same way to the Buddha's recitation. To taste the flavor of recitation is like eating candy. In fact it is not like taste sweet, it is truly that way. If you have recited enough to have gained some skill, oh! you will feel as if you were drinking sweet dew that were never ended. Gwan Yin Bodhisattva had seen you recite the Buddha till your throat gets dry, he then gives you a bit of sweet dew so it tastes sweet. Those people who know how to recite the Buddha have sweetness in their mouth. But you don't become to attach the sweetness, if you attach to it," Oh! how sweet is it!", well, it is not sweet anymore. <span style="font-style: italic;">This dharma is such inconceivable. Once you conceive of it, it is not what it is</span>. Do you understand? why if you attach to it, and it become disappeared? Because if you attach the sweetness, you have greedy mind and you think," I like to eat this now,An! it is so sweet, I don't need to buy any candy to eat, it saves money." . The Bodhisattva saw you are so greedy and stingy, he doesn't want to give it to you, so it become sweetless. Whoever has this kind of state, remember not to think whether it is sweet or not, you only need to recite Buddha's name, the true the better. If you can recite the Buddha ceaselessly, then you will have accomlishment. Either you will see light, see flower. or see the Buddha, these are all good states. But don't be greedy for these states either or in your attachment they will disappear, it will be ended same as the sweet dew.<br><br>This is the first day of the session, there are still six days to go and you have many opportunities. There are six days left in the first session, and togather with the second session, there are thirteen days left. You will have many chances to obtain a single unconfused mind. But you should not be lazy and think," Oh! I have planty of chances, I can wait!" Don't wait, especially in the evening, during the Great Transference ceremony. When kneeling down to recite the Buddha's name and the verses for contemplation during the transference, you need to be earnestly sincere.To be extremely sincere. To offer up in all sincerity, but how sincere ? to render ten thousand out of ten thousand. Don't say hundred persent ot ten thousand , the more the better. You have to determine to attain benefit, or insteadyou come to attain this session in vain. Otherwise, you have undergone all these bitterness for nothing, wouldn't that be a shame!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Vow To Be Born In The Western Pureland<br><br>To end birth and death in the world is not easy.<br>Only that you will not be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss,<br>once there, you will never turn away</strong><br><br>by Venerable Master Hsuan Hua<br><br>Any question you want to ask? To understand this problem, one has to understand Armita's day in his previous life before enlightenment when he practised all kinds of dharma doors, none of which was easy to accomplish. He therefore made a wish saying since all beings of the ten directions practise buddhism(dharma) so difficult as the way I did, I now make 48 vows, each of which is to lead them to my land. What is the advantage of being born in my land? It is to see the Buddha when born as the lotus blossoms. This is not the birth from the impure conditions of parents but is transformed as lotus when being born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, forming a body within it and this body will only emerge as a man, no woman. It is therefore no women in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>When born in the Western Pureland, one is out of the cycle of birth and death, and thus go beyond the realm of the six paths in this cycle, and in his life he dwells in the Buddha land, he will never turn away. It is definite that one will become buddha when born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, so the 48 vows Armita Buddha made, each is to lead and guide living beings to become Buddha, this birth is different from the birth and death of the lay people. In this very life in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, one will never fall into the three evil destinies, never withdraw, this is the condition that would determine one be a Buddha in the future. </strong></span>So everyone should recite and seek to be born in the Pureland. Unlike this saha world mingled in sufferings and evils. It never like that. It is a place free if sufferings but joy. All you heard, all you see are dharma, it is a realm of dharma, always have Armibita's preach of dharma. Even the birds there they will preach the five roots, the five powers, the seven Bodhi shares, the eight sagely shares, all they sing are dharma. Thus so, even the waterflow, the wind movements, these are also means of preaching dharma. It is so different in the Pureland and so is the birth here. The birth here ends all births and deaths, the layman's births and deaths and there will be no more birth and death. What the difference to be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss is this birth is different from those of the layman. One of Armita's 48 vows is quoted as saying " All living beings of the ten directions, if ever they recite my name," the name after I have attained my Buddhahood, they will all be born in my land. Once born here they will see Buddha when the lotus blossoms and get awakened to the dharma of patience with unproduced. If ever anyone is not enlightened, I will not take my Buddhahood. Shakyamuni Buddha, knowing his vows, told Shuriputra, all arhats should raise this dharma door to all living beings. So anyone of us wishes to be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss will never turn away.<br><br>There is a number of good cantos quoted as saying: VOW TO BE BORN IN THE WESTERN PURELAND - <strong>This Western Pureland is different from the other pureland. </strong>Why not born in the Eastern Lapis Lazuli Land? Because living beings there are still in the cycle of births and deaths. Why not in the Southern Land of Precious Life? Precious Life Buddha in the South did not make such a big vow as Armita Buddha did to guide and take living beings . So when it says vow to be born in the Western Pureland , THE NINE GRADED LOTUS AS PARENTS - the nine grades refers to uppermost grade, upper middle grade, upper lower grade, upper middle grate, middle grade, lower middle grade and the lowest grade. Thus this nine graded lotus would be our parents, not born from bodily fresh and blood, but emerge from the lotus. <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>AWAKENED TO PATIENCE WITH NON PRODUCED WHEN THE FLOWER BLOSSOMS - Once this lotus blossoms, the buddha nature emerges from it in the form of a body, it comes out to see Armitaba Buddha in person and to get enlightened, </strong></span>attaining the not-growing but not -extinguishing, the not impure but not pure. the not-increasing but not-deminishing Buddha nature. So to be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss is to end births and deaths as it is not easy to have it accomplished in this world. Only that you cannot be born there, once there, you will never withdraw. So when the flower blossoms you get enlightened - THE IRREVERSIBLE BUDDHASATTVA BE THE COMPANION - All friends and relatives in the Land of Ultimate Bliss are Buddhasattvas, they are all irreversible buddhas they are all our dharma relatives, our real friends.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>There we also have the dharma door of the Pureland, this is easiest dharma doors of all</strong></span>. In the past, all Buddha praised the practice for the dharma door of the Pureland, like ManJusuri Buddhasattva praised the way of reciting . Universal Worthy Buddha (in the Shurangama Sutra - the chapter UNIVERSAL WORTHY BUDDHA'S PRACTICE &amp; VOWS) - was to take living beings of the ten directions to the Pureland. He recited Buddha's the name and sought to be born in the Pureland. Guan Yin (Budhasattvas Avalokteshavara) too practised recitation, same as for the Great Strength Buddhasattva. Those who read (the Shurangama Sutra) it should know ( the chapter Great Strength Buddhasattva s Recitation Method). It says this is a very good dharma door and was praised and practised by most Buddhasattvas in the past. All patriarchs in the past investigated CHAN and practise recitation. Having englightened after CHAN investigation, they concentrated in recitation. A transformed Armita Buddha appears each time he recited. This was the case for the Great Chan Master Yung Ming, and recently, Great Venerable Master Yin Guang even recommended this dharma door, Great Master Shui Yun suggested the dharma door of recitation too. So this is the easiest dharma door, the most convenient, the the simpliest and the most perfect one. So for this dharma door, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">if you don't believe, don't slander it, you don't slander it, you believe it.</span></strong></span><br>This is a dharma door praised by all Buddhas of the ten directions. You see, (in Armita Sutra) Buddhas of the six directions, all appeared in long and wide tongues, covering the three thousand great world to praised this dharma door. If this is not true and right, why approved by the Buddhas of the six directions. From this point, it proves this is the best dharma door for us to practise especially in the , everyone should cultivate. However, we are in the Right Dharma period, if you don't recite and practise recitation, you have to practise CHAN with all your efforts. Don't be scared by the sufferings. So when the 7-day Chan session starts this week? Friday evening. I don t care about this, I don't know which day. I just like living in the mountainous place without a calendar, going through the cold seasons without knowing the years passed. If you say today is the first day of the lunar month, it is. You said it is the fifteenth day, it is. the twentieth, so it is the twentieth. You tell me today is Christmas, December 25th, then it is the 25th. Our Recitation Assembly ends this Friday and the Chan Session kicks in, you see, we are here, if you don't believe recitation, you can try CHAN, waking up at 2 in the morning, going for rest at 12:00 in the evening. See if you can take it. If you can't,you run. If you can take it, you would be enlightened.<br><br>We make a fire in the ice box melting the ice into water. It <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">is the wave of your buddha nature calms down, once calmed down, it just like water ruffled to become wave and flattened to become wave becomes water</span></strong>. So water becomes ice and ice becomes water. If you can return to your original form and see your original appearance, how it looks, you will understand. By then, you have to suffer cold in this ice box - which is worthwhile and it has a value in it. So that is why so many people are willing to go for this ice box. If you ever died of cold, nobody dares to go.<br></div>

Tathagata is one of the ten titles of all Buddhas. "Past Vows" refers to the vows to achieve Bodhi that Medicine Master Buddha made before he became a Buddha. If we sincerely make vows, we will certainly reap the fruits of those vows. They won't be in vain. Vows are also a form of karma. If we make good vows, we will reap good results; bad vows bring bad results. Each person must make his own vows of his own initiative. Once we have made vows, there will be a driving force pushing us to accomplish those vows. Medicine Master Buddha made wholesome vows in his past lives, so he accomplished wholesome karma and reaped wholesome results.<br><br>His vows are wholesome because he made them for all living beings. He didn't vow, "When I become a Buddha, I'll enjoy my blessings and forget about other living beings." Having attained the greatest happiness, the Buddha wants to share it with all beings. He perfected his wholesome karma by practicing the Bodhisattva path in life after life. He made a great Bodhi resolve to benefit, enlighten, and rescue all beings. Forgetting themselves and thinking only of living beings, Bodhisattvas make wholesome vows, create wholesome karma, and reap the wholesome result of Buddhahood. When they become Buddhas, they are not arrogant. A Buddha is just the same as the other living beings, except that he has wisdom. He has truly left confusion behind and returned to enlightenment</strong></blockquote></div>
