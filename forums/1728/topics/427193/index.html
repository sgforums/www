              <p>One evening, after my Zen teacher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunryu_Suzuki">Shunryu Suzuki</a> had finished his talk, a student raised his hand.  "You've been talking
               about Buddhism for nearly an hour," he said with some agitation, "and I
               haven't been able to understand a thing you said.  Could you say one 
              thing about Buddhism I can understand?"<br> <br> Suzuki waited patiently until the nervous laughter died down and then quietly said, "Everything changes."<br> <br> A scientist might say, "Gold does not change, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium">plutonium</a> has a half-life of 24,000 years.  Not everything changes; some things 
              change very slowly."  But Suzuki was speaking not as a scientist, but as
               a religious teacher.  From his religious point of view, "everything 
              changes" means that everything and everyone we love and care about, 
              including our own precious selves, is bound to age, pass away and 
              disappear.  Because we cling to what we love, we suffer.  This is the 
              First Noble Truth, and the starting point of all Buddhist teaching.<br> <br> But there is another, more positive aspect of change.  In <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Mind-Beginners-Shunryu-Suzuki/dp/1590308492/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301780561&amp;sr=8-1">Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</a></em>, Suzuki also says:  <br></p>
              <blockquote>"'That things change' is the reason why you suffer in 
              this world and become discouraged. [But] when you change your 
              understanding and your way of living, then you can completely enjoy your
               life in each moment. The evanescence of things is the reason you enjoy 
              your life."</blockquote>
              <p><br> <br> What a startling thought: that the very evanescence of things can be a 
              cause for joy, and a way to see this ever-changing, ever-aging world as a
               thing of beauty.  A plastic flower is superficially pleasing, but only 
              the living flower, shedding its petals and fading away at the very peak 
              of its blossoming, is truly beautiful.  This insight is the aesthetic 
              dimension of Buddhist teaching and also a source of its ethics. When we 
              appreciate every person and thing as fragile and precious, we don't want
               to hurt them.  Instead, we practice the first precept -- non-harm -- 
              and aspire to be more careful and kind.<br> <br> In this regard, I am reminded of the legend of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas">King Midas</a>.
                According to Greek myth, Midas, granted one wish by the god Bacchus, 
              wished  that everything he touched might be turned to gold.  He soon 
              discovered, of course, that this gift was really a curse. He couldn't 
              eat or drink; the food and water turned to gold as soon as he touched 
              them. Even the thing he loved and cared for the most -- his own daughter
               -- turned to gold when he touched her. "Midas' touch" was really the 
              touch of death. Gold has been a standard of wealth and value from 
              ancient times to the present day, precisely because it seems never to 
              change. But it isn't alive.<br> <br> In that sense, when Suzuki said that "everything changes," he simply 
              meant that everything is alive.  Midas, like each of us, wanted wealth, 
              security and happiness, but he was looking in the wrong place.  He 
              didn't understand that the "evanescence of things is the reason you 
              enjoy your life."  In the end, Midas gave up his power to make things 
              unchanging and permanent.  He realized that true happiness could not be 
              found there.<br> <br> I reflect on all of this as I read with fascination and horror the daily
               reports from the damaged nuclear reactor in Japan.  Plutonium, these 
              news stories reminds us, remains radioactive and dangerous for tens of 
              thousands of years. It is a gift, but like Midas' touch, also a curse --
               capable of poisoning our food and drink and taking the lives of those 
              we love.  I'm not sure what the Buddhist attitude might be with regard 
              to this or any of the myriad technological miracles we have created, 
              often with the best of intentions.<br> <br> Does Buddhist teaching imply that we should go back to living in huts or
               caves, with none of the marvels of modern life that have made us so 
              much more comfortable? Indeed not, we would say, but the deeper answer 
              remains elusive. We are all in the process of working it out. I love 
              living in a house with electricity, and I have made my living designing 
              computer software; what's more, I would not be here at all but for 
              modern medicine's cancer treatments, which included radiation. But one 
              day my beloved wife will die; one day so will I. Neither gold, nor 
              plutonium, nor any other clever invention will change that.  The truth 
              of universal change and passing away is timeless; so is the need for 
              human beings to treat each other with kindness and respect.</p>
