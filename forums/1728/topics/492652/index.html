              <p>The Non-existence of Discriminative Perception </p>
              <p>Ananda's wrong viewâ€¨Ananda was moved to tears by the Buddhaís compassion and profound Teaching, brought his two palms together and said: </p>
              <p>After hearing the Buddhaís wonderful Dharma, I have realized that the wondrous Bright Mind is fundamentally perfect, so that I always dwell in my Mind-ground. But if my awakening has been due to the Buddha's preaching, I have (really) used, my causal mind to hear it with reverence, thereby merely realizing that mind. I dare not pretend that it is the fundamental Mind-ground. Will you be compassionate enough to enlighten me so as to remove my (remaining) doubts so that I can return to the Supreme Tao?</p>
              <p>Unreality of illusory causes </p>
              <p>The Buddha said: You are still using your clinging mind to listen to the Dharma; since, however, this Dharma is also causal, you fail to realize the Dharma-nature. This is like a man pointing a finger at the moon to show it to others who should follow the direction of the finger to look at the moon. If they look at the finger and mistake it for the moon, they lose (sight of) both the moon and the finger. Why? Because the bright moon is actually pointed at; they both lose sight of the finger and fail to distinguish between (the states of) brightness and darkness. Why? Because they mistake the finger for the bright moon and are not clear about brightness and darkness. </p>
              <p>Likewise, if you mistake your (intellect which) hears my preaching voice for your (true mind), the latter's discerning nature should be independent of that differentiated voice. For instance, when a traveller spends the night at an inn, he does so for a time and then leaves, not staying there for ever: as to the inn-keeper, he has nowhere else to go for he owns the inn. It is the same with your mind. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Falseness of both sense organs and consciousness </p>
              <p>If it is your True Mind, it has nowhere to go. Then why in the absence of speech has it no discerning nature of its own? This discriminating (intellect) does not arise only when I speak, but also when you discern my appearance; it has no discerning nature of its own when there is no form. (It is not True Mind) even when you reach the state in which all discrimination ceases, a state that is neither form nor Voidness, which the heretics call Primordial Darkness. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All phenomena returnable to causes are unreal </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If that which has no discerning nature of its own ceases to exist in the absence of causal conditions, how can the (so-called) nature of your mind be an (independent) Host if it disappears when it returns to its (illusory) causes? </p>
              <p>:))</p>
