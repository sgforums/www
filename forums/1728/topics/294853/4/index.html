Karma is volitional and is a form of consciousness. Karma means intentional action -- without intention there is no karma. Buying the meat off the shelf doesnt come with the direct intention to kill the animal but nevertheless there is karma for supporting the killing indirectly. If you order seafood it happens that the sea creatures are still alive and by stating your intentions to eat them you are also giving an order for them to be killed. By witnessing the killing of the animal you ordered to be killed it also forms karmic imprints and by eating the meat you witnessed (being killed) it also forms karma because you are accepting that deed of killing by eating it.<br><br>But one with real compassion would not even buy meat as it supports killing. He has constant compassion for all sentient beings out there.<br><br>Of course if one can cut down on meat it will be the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Nope. Cos Karma comes by intention. Karma is volitional and is a form of consciousness. Karma means intentional action -- without intention there is no karma. Buying the meat off the shelf doesnt come with the direct intention to kill the animal but nevertheless there is karma for supporting the killing indirectly. If you order seafood it happens that the sea creatures are still alive and by stating your intentions to eat them you are also giving an order for them to be killed. By witnessing the killing of the animal you ordered to be killed it also forms karmic imprints and by eating the meat you witnessed (being killed) it also forms karma because you are accepting that deed of killing by eating it.<br><br>But one with real compassion would not even buy meat as it supports killing. He has constant compassion for all sentient beings out there.<br><br>Of course if one can cut down on meat it will be the best.</div></blockquote>okie snowflag<br><br>I am much impressed you hold a debatable point on the issue of killing<br><br>Let me explain to you taken from the 5 Precepts .<br>AEN , look at this answer<br><br>According to the 5 precepts study on killings<br><br>to satisfy breaking the precepts ,the conditions must be made<br>1.intention to kill<br>2.life lost<br>3.human [heaviest karma ] must be a live animal[lighter]<br>4.weapon is used<br><br>the 5 precepts study on killing stated clearly ,ordering of already died animal not seeing it , hearing it or it die by the clear reason due to self (human ) inflicted is considered as not insurmountable to breaking the precepts of killings<br><br>so ,snowflag , I respect you for bringing this point ,so it brings me to talk abt the study of the Precepts of Killing .<br><br>Hmm , maybe can be a skype topic ? anyone game ?<br><br>My answer is that whether u order the meat or non-meat ,the volition of karma is there still .but .......<br><br>life is full of buts <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>it is lesser than u actually hear it killed ,see it killed and it dies as a result of you<br><br>Buddha goes straight to the point of intention , not the issue of whether order or not<br><br>Order or not is a mundane concept , intention is a mind concept .<br><br>with Sincerity,<br>Bohiruci<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the difference of karma for the butcher, eater and witnesser, my opinion is:<br><br>1) Do it yourself or not<br>If one kill the animal himself, the impression to his mind and 8th conscious will be deeper. Over time, he will become more violent and develop the habit of killing easily.<br>If you ask the meat eater go and slaughter the animal himself, he rather pay extra to buy from supermarket because he feel terrible and sad to see the animal suffer. At least he still has a little bit compassion. Due to this difference in mind and attitude, the bad karma that they get will also be different.<br><br>2) Buy a packaged one or live one<br>If let's say the customer buy a live chicken to be killed. For sure, the chicken is going to suffer and die because of this. But if he buy from supermarket instead, the supermarket may have extra stock that even if the demand increase by let's say 1%, the number of chicken to be slaughtered at the butcher will remains the same. Anyway, the unsold chicken once reach expiry date, will be disposed.<br><br>3) Witness or not witness<br>Likewise, if you witness a animal to be killed because of your ordering, then you are the one who directly contribute to its death and suffering. If you witness it and feel happy seeing the fish to be slaughtered, you will have equal bad karma or even more than the butcher who kill it.<br>Worse is, after a few times witnessing without any regret, you become used to it and become the next butcher<br><br>So, it is all in the mind. You can claim that even though you choose which fleshy chicken to be killed, witness the killing or even do it yourself but in your heart you feel sad for the chicken. But even if the whole world including you cheated by yourself, you will still suffer the same bad karma.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With more people getting into this thread, I would like to point out that the whole issue of this discussion is that a guy quote the following, saying that by doing so, the meat is clean and so bad karma for the act is lesser<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br></div></blockquote>If you read my 1st post, you will see that the point is I wanted to bring up is that when we buy the meat, the slaughter is committed for our sake liao.<br><br>Why this is so? The slaughter is committed for the consumers. You form part of the consumers when buy or eat it.<br><br>Let me compare the olden and modern times.<br><br>In Buddha's times, the 5 rules was preached to the monks, who may encountered these situations when they get their alms. The monks don't want to eat the meat in the 1st place.<br><br>In modern times, people use the 5 rules to justify themselves to eat the so call clean meat. But the meat intake doesn't reduced.<br></div>
