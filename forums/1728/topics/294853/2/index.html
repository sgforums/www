Secondly, by witnessing the killing of our food, also makes the meat impure.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm" rel="nofollow">Five Clean Sources of Meat (article)</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Buddha understands the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have accumulated from aeons of their many past lives. In order to provide sentient beings with an expedient means of embracing Buddhism, those who are not able to convert to a vegetarian diet on a long term basis are permitted to consume meat provided:<br><br>(1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter...</span><br><br>That is why ordered seafood is not Pure Meat. Frozen meat can at least be considered 'clean meat' -- it is not direct killing, so the karma is not so strong. Nevertheless it is still killing so being vegetarian is best. But not everyone wants to be a vegetarian, so the least is we must try eat only the 5 clean meat. I myself try to abide by this, as I am not a vegetarian.</div></blockquote>Why does eating vegetables not constitute bad karma?<br>Maybe vegetables also know pain?</div>
