            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to share with you what I saw yesterday at this Sheng Shiong supermarket at bedok.<br>They have this live seafood department showing live fishes, prawns and crabs for sale. In order to attract customers and to show that their fishes is very fresh, they go and get a fish, still live one, chop off the tail and put it in front to show to the crowd.<br>The scene is super gross...the fish with its tail gone, struggling desperately for oxygen, with the blood slowly coming out of the vein.<br>I really pity the pain that the fish has to go through, furthermore considering the big size, the physical pain will be more.<br>Can't the seller give it a quick death instead of chopping it into halves and slowly let it suffocate? Do they think that the fish doesn't feel pain at all?<br>In fact, there are more tailless live fish in the store waiting for the potential buyer.<br><br>There was nothing I can do that time other than chanting mantra silently hoping these helpless beings can quickly die and liberate from the suffering.<br>I really can't believe such a barbaric act still happen in our society.<br><br>Let's hope we can one day become more capable to prevent this from happening again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there is no other way to kill live fish. You may not like what u see here but what other better ways can u think of.<br><br>As for the life issue. I see it that we need to accept the fact that a life has been taken for the benefit of another (all humans incl. you and me). A benefit has been received as a result of this sacrifice and so what are we doing to contribute back to this society?

Ending that imperfect state of existence is one of the aims of a Buddhist.</div>
