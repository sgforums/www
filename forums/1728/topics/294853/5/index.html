The butchers have intentions to sell frozen meat to you but you do not have intention to kill the animal to eat the meat, and that is why, it is not against the 5 clean meat.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Nope. Cos Karma comes by intention. Karma is volitional and is a form of consciousness. Karma means intentional action -- without intention there is no karma. Buying the meat off the shelf doesnt come with the direct intention to kill the animal but nevertheless there is karma for supporting the killing indirectly. If you order seafood it happens that the sea creatures are still alive and by stating your intentions to eat them you are also giving an order for them to be killed. By witnessing the killing of the animal you ordered to be killed it also forms karmic imprints and by eating the meat you witnessed (being killed) it also forms karma because you are accepting that deed of killing by eating it.<br><br>But one with real compassion would not even buy meat as it supports killing. He has constant compassion for all sentient beings out there.<br><br>Of course if one can cut down on meat it will be the best.</div></blockquote></div>

It seeks to help people comprehend, its not about conforming to the rules, but to comprehend the philosophy.<br><br>However, philosophy is a very grey area, and a lot of teachings can be interpreted in different ways by different people.<br><br>Coming back to your views above:<br>2,500 years ago, Science is nowhere near to what it is today. Who is to say maybe many years later, Science finds that plants do 'react' in a certain way to being fried 'alive', or being steamed 'alive'?<br><br>Consciousness is a human way of explaining something in the universe. Its our perspective, and not a perspective from another being or animal. Thus, our perspective may be wrong.<br><br>Referring back to your voting by one person. You are now saying that one person's demand for meat is negligible. But another person will tell you that its the accumulation of everyone's demand that results in a huge demand. Every vote counts. Currently, there's this green campaign to get everyone to use less plastic bags, coz every effort counts. By your view above, does it mean that you think one person effort is negligible, so we can just continue to do what we do?<br><br>And the Sun rises in the East because we perceived North to be a fixed point at the top of our planet. That's a perception. If you define North to be a fixed point on the bottom of our planet, then the sun rises in the West.</div>

He did extensive studies of the sutras and found that the misleading sutras indicate that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buddha gradually phased out the permission of meat eating</span>. When the Buddha began teaching most of the people followed some version of Hinduism and many of them still ate meat.

We all know that Vinaya says it's ok to eat certain kinds of meat; that Mahayana sutras say it is strictly negative, and meat-eating is permitted in Vajrayana with certain qualifications. There is really nothing about which we need to debate on these scores.<br><br>I further think that solely relying on some religious text to define our conduct around the issue of meat consumption when confronted with the environmental and health issues surrounding the modern consumption of meat is canonical myopia.<br><br>In other words, I think the decision concerning whether one eats meat or not must be made from the point of view of modern environmental, health, economic and social concerns. When these factors are taken into consideration it is pretty clear that the practices that are used in producing meat in this day and age are terrible, costly, and that Buddhists should not participate in that economy as much as we can possible avoid it since the buying and selling of meat is quite clearly wrong livelihood.<br><br>If you must eat meat: make sure it comes from a humane farm, and that the animal whose flesh you are consuming was slaughtered as kindly as possible (there is no kind form of slaughter in truth). Eat this meat with loving kindness, compassion and gratitude for all those sentient beings whose bodies sustained from you in life after life from time without beginning. And at least twice a month try to refrain from eating any meat at all. If you are a Mahayana practitioner, then please try to observe the Mahayana fast day vows on the full moon and new moon, refraining from eating any meat on those days.<br><br>When it comes to dairy, also be aware that most dairy is produced under horrible conditions. Please avoid dairy from factory farms, and only buy dairy from confirmed organic humane dairy farms. And yes, spend more if you have to [just consider how much food a month you probably waste already]. You can consider it a kind of dana to mother Earth.<br><br>When it comes to vegetables, please be aware that there are tremendously harmful practices in agriculture i.e. the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides. Please buy organic foods, don't waste your food [cook and freeze what you can't eat today], and generally please understand that while the buying and selling of organic food is not wrong livelihood, conventional produce is not virtuous food at all.<br><br>Please learn how to grow some of your own food. Please stop using plastic. Please recycle.<br><br>Please be aware.<br><br>Kunga Namdrol </span></blockquote>/\<br><br></div>

Did we compare against the chimpanzees, orang utans, bononbos? They are mainly herbivores but always suppliment their diet with meat. Considering the protein intake versus muscle exhaustion and social competition, it is required to do so. Human are the closest living relations in anatomy to the above apes but nevertheless we are never primary carnivores but anatomical omnivores as we usually take in vegetables with meat in our diet.</div>
