I've been asked this many times but is unable to give an intelligent reply.<br><br>'Vegetables also living things what.

Then I was watching one of my taiwanese teacher's talks the other day and he explained that plants also have awareness/dharma nature, but they are not the same sort of sentient being as us because they do not have discriminative function. But they do respond to environment, sunlight, etc, and that is also due to awareness. Our forummer Thusness also agreed with this.<br><br>So if they have awareness why can we eat them? Because they do not have dualistic consciousness, discriminative mind of a sentient being and do not create karma or undergo rebirth, they do not suffer. But by killing an animal, we are causing them to suffer because of their dualistic identification, discrimination, and attachment. They will attach to pain and their body and cause suffeng. So we must never kill a sentient being.</div>

Awareness is your Buddha-Nature, it is natural and spontaneous every moment.

You feel the pain first, or rather more accurate, feeling arises first as pure awareness before you 'know' or mentally perceive the pain. The pain is simply a spontaneous manifestation of your own nature.<br><br>Next, it is true that any form of impure meat that is consumed has heavier karma. It does not however mean that eating frozen meat is totally free from karma -- it is just less because it is indirect and not direct killing.

Frozen meat can at least be considered 'clean meat' -- it is not direct killing, so the karma is not so strong. Nevertheless it is still killing so being vegetarian is best. But not everyone wants to be a vegetarian, so the least is we must try eat only the 5 clean meat. I myself try to abide by this, as I am not a vegetarian.</blockquote></div>

Saving the fish may or may not be a good thing.<br>It could help or it could cause more harm.<br><br>However, I agree with you that if we should eat a fish, we should give it a quick death. That is what differentiates us from animals.<br><br>For instance, an animal uses its instinct to bring a quick death to a prey because it wishes to quickly take it down and bring it away so that other predators do not come along to snatch the carcass. However, in the event which they cannot give a quick death, they will just eat the prey alive. I guess this is Nature's way of attempting to reduce pain to the victim (by giving an instinct to the predator to kill quickly)<br><br>But for us humans, we should give it a quick death because we do not wish the animal to suffer. Abstaining totally from meat is not perceived by me as the correct thing to do. In this sense, I agree with other forumers here on the issue of INTENTION.<br><br>I personally minimize (and moving towards abstain) eating live drunken prawns (the type where the prawn is thrown alive into the wok, etc), because there are less painful ways of eating prawns.</div>

In order to attract customers and to show that their fishes is very fresh, they go and get a fish, still live one, chop off the tail and put it in front to show to the crowd.<br>The scene is super gross...the fish with its tail gone, struggling desperately for oxygen, with the blood slowly coming out of the vein.<br>I really pity the pain that the fish has to go through, furthermore considering the big size, the physical pain will be more.<br>Can't the seller give it a quick death instead of chopping it into halves and slowly let it suffocate? Do they think that the fish doesn't feel pain at all?<br>In fact, there are more tailless live fish in the store waiting for the potential buyer.<br><br>There was nothing I can do that time other than chanting mantra silently hoping these helpless beings can quickly die and liberate from the suffering.<br>I really can't believe such a barbaric act still happen in our society.<br><br>Let's hope we can one day become more capable to prevent this from happening again.</div></blockquote>I think what you did is perfectly right as a Buddhist ie to chant silently in such a situation. This is the least we can do. I think others who don't agree hv their own reasons n logic n whatever, but I can only say that Justdoit n others like him are to be respected for their kind thoughts - this thought of true compassion for the weaker sentien beings, the sentient beings in distress. Non- Buddhists, I perfectly understood their reactions n we all  can argue till the end of the world, no point <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ; but as for fellow Buddhists, we must know that this is the first step to cultivate Compassion n should be encouraged.<br><br>Yes, I also hope that the world will become more civilised one day. I realised that civilisation has advanced, but the human race has somewhat moves backwards; in fact many have become more primitive in thoughts n actions. Just look at some of the gruesome crimes  commited tdy, the types of food we come out with, the way of processing,  preparing, farming  for certain food, staple or for coats n bags etc. We r actually  behaving like cave-men, but with better clothing n better excuses for our actions that's all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So Justdoit, pls continue to cultivate such Compassion.<br><br></div>

What do you think about this?<br><br>Â“This would mean that you wouldnÂ’t eat anything and let the people die. If you<br>say you were going to go for a week without killing insects through the food you eat, then you would die. If you die, this precious human life is being wasted. So if you just let your body be destroyed, that means you are taking your own life, which is killing in itself. You can always take the insect from the rice when you see it and let it free outside. You donÂ’t necessary have to kill beings to eat. Although, when we walk we crush many insects under our feet. We may not see them or observe them, but still we must be killing them. Not being aware doesnÂ’t mean that we have not created any sin.
