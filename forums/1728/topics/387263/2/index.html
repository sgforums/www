              If you are an animal(not literally!), you use whatever within your ability to survive, and to care for your offspring.

              <p>Wow I did not expect this to become a thread with so many comments.</p>
              <p>Anyway I wish to comment a bit on some points raised so far:</p>
              <p>My personal opinion is that inside humans, we do have some instincts that would put us in the same category of animals or maybe worse, as some suggested here..</p>
              <p>For example, we can now get to read or hear about news of natural fathers sexually abusing their own daughters...</p>
              <p>Now, how many fathers would do that to their own flesh and blood? Why is the natural paternal instinct of a father unable to overcome the sexual perversions?</p>
              <p>Without the concept of karma as explained in Buddhism, I would find it very hard put to convince myself logically and emotionally, after seeing and hearing such shocking news.</p>
              <p>These are some of those many moments that I thank myself for having the chance to be in touch with Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Followings are some of the LAW OF KARMA which I believe many people (including myself) who have misunderstood in the past :</p>
              <p>1) Good deeds cannot redeem bad deeds. They are accounted for separately. For eg, a man who is very rich but short life. Reasons being he was very generous in donations in his past life but had committed a lot of killings. His generousity could not redeem his killings.</p>
              <p>2) Sins cannot be eliminated, it can only be lightened by repenting sincerely in front of Buddha. Repenting sincerely means one has regretted what one had done and will not do it again.</p>
              <p>3) There are many people who said it is not fair for they have to suffer for something they cannot remember (past life). It is just like killing someone while drink driving or one falls down and breaks a pair of legs while drunk. When one sobers up, one has to face the consequence of a pair of broken legs even though he cannot recall what he had done when he was drunk.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Additional Information: How do we overcome our past evil kamma? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">To overcome past evil kamma, the Buddha said that we have to do a lot of good deeds now.  The Buddha gave a beautiful simile of salt and water (</span><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.099.than.html"><span style="color: #000000;">A.N 3.99 Lonaphala Sutta: The Salt Crystal</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">During the time of the Buddha, there was no fine salt like the kind we have, but they have lumps of salt. So the Buddha said that suppose a man took a lump of salt and put it into a cup of water, stirred the water, and drank it. The water would definitely taste salty.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">However, if the person took the same lump of salt, and put it into the river, and stirred the river water, and drank it, it would not taste salty because of the large amount of water in the river.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Buddha said that the water represents good kamma and the salt represents evil kamma.  So a lot of good kamma dilutes the effect of the evil kamma.  Therefore it is very important that we do a lot of good to overcome our past evil kamma.  What is past, we cannot change; we can only take care of the present.  To take care of the present, we have to do a lot of good (which includes avoiding evil, i.e. keeping the precepts).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">All kamma that we do have the potential to ripen.  </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>However, not every kamma will ripen.</strong>  The Buddha said that if every kamma has to ripen, then we cannot get out of samsara (round of rebirths).  This is because our kammic account is so great due to our uncountable lifetimes of kamma</span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The author then gives the example of Venerable Angulimala </strong> <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.086.than.html">["Angulimala Sutta: About Angulimala" (MN 86)</a>]</span></p>
              <p>...Then Angulimala strove very hard and became an Arahant.  Just think of that! He did not have to be reborn in hell for many hundreds of thousands of years to repay his kammic debt!</p>
              <p>The merit of striving in the holy life and attaining ariyahood is so great as to free us from rebirth in the woeful places.</p>
              <p>So we can see that of the three bases of meritorious actions, development of the mind (bhavana) surpasses moral conduct (sila) and charity (dana).</p>

              <p>For those of you who doubt if there's such thing as karma or Law of Karma, the answer is yes. I'm speaking this from a spiritual point, not of any religion per say.</p>
              <p>Whatever we do, say or even think have the possibility to create karma, which is really cause and effect. People's current lives are so, because they choose to learn from their past. However, we should not assume all suffering people as being repaying past bad karma. It could be that they are old souls who wish to learn from a tougher experience.</p>
              <p>The point is: we should not live our lives constantly worrying about what karma we're creating or repaying. It's all a matter of rebalancing of Life and energy. We should just live our lives caring about people around us in general, and all that should happen will happen. If we lead our lives doing good deeds simply because we are afraid of creating more bad karma, we've not understood truly the meaning of Life and cause and effect. Goodness should come from our true heart, not of fear.</p>

              <p>there are people in this world who constantly do things which are harmful to others, but at the same time, try to donate more to charity. The only reason is they think that will help balance their bad karma, and they fear retribution. They are not doing good deeds out of their goodness of their heart, but out of fear. I personally doubt their donations will be of much use for such cases, no matter how much the money is, or how many times.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>"...Generosity associated with wisdom before, during and after the act is the highest type of giving.</p>
              <p>Three examples of wise giving are:</p>
              <p>giving with the clear understanding that according to the kammic law of cause and effect, the generous act will bring beneficial results in the future;</p>
              <p>giving while aware that the gift, the recipient and the giver are all impermanent;</p>
              <p>and giving with the aim of enhancing one's efforts to become enlightened.</p>
              <p>As the giving of a gift takes a certain amount of time, a single act of giving may be accompanied by each of these three types of understanding at a different stage in the process.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">...The Buddha teaches that in the practice of giving, as in all bodily and verbal conduct, it is the volition accompanying the act that determines its moral quality</span>. </strong></p>
              <p>If one is offering something to a monk, doing so without adopting a respectful manner would not be proper. Throwing a coin to a beggar in order to get rid of him would also be considered a defilement of giving.</p>
              <p>One should think carefully about the <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">relevance and the timing</span></strong> of a gift for it to bring the best results. A gift given through an intermediary — for example, having a servant give food to a monk rather than giving it by one's own hand — also detracts from the value of the gift.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">When one gives without realizing that one must experience the results of one's deeds, an act of giving again diminishes in meritorious potency</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>If one only plans on giving a donation but does not fulfill one's plan, the merit earned will be very slight. Thus we should always follow up our intentions of generosity expeditiously, unless something intervenes to prevent our doing so. If, after having given a gift, we should subsequently regret our action, much of the merit of the deed will be lost.</p>
              <p>A moral person gives politely and respectfully. Whether the gift is spontaneous or planned, he or she will make sure that the timing and contents of the gift are appropriate for the receiver. Many housewives in Buddhist countries regularly invite a few monks to their homes to receive almsfood early in the day. Before feeding the family, these women always offer the food to the bhikkhus with their own hands.</p>
              <p>One might contribute to a certain cause from fear that friends would disapprove if one did not give. Giving in response to such social pressures will have weak, though still beneficial, results. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Charitable actions undertaken to gain a good reputation are also selfish and hence not a very valuable kind of giving</span></strong>. Nor can it be praiseworthy when one gives merely to return a favor or in expectation of a reward. The former is like repaying a debt, the latter analogous to offering a bribe.</p>

              <h2><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">Chapter Seven: Benefitting the Living and the Dead</span></h2>
              <p>"When men or women laden with offenses who failed to plant good causes die, even they can receive <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">one-seventh</span></strong> of any merit dedicated to them by relatives who do good deeds on their behalf.</p>
              The other <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">six-sevenths</span></strong> of the merit will return to the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>living relatives</strong></span> who did the good deeds.
