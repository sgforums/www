              wonderful,” Liu Cixin, China’s most celebrated science fiction author,<span> </span></span><a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/11/11/the-big-idea-liu-cixin/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #eb1414; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>wrote</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">in 2014. “This set off the

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Liu’s series — the
              best-selling sci-fi novels in China in decades — has attracted much attention
              both domestically and internationally: The White House announced last year that

At the end of Liu’s
              series, aliens extinguish the Earth and the sun. In Chinese fiction,
              “destroying the world is fine,” Liu told me in an interview. But destroying
              China is not.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The American canon
              is rich in apocalyptic literature. It boasts Jack London’s 1912<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The
              Scarlet Plague</span></em>, a tale of 2073 San Francisco after disease has
              eradicated much of humanity; Ray Bradbury’s 1950 short-story collection,<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The
              Martian Chronicles</span></em>, about the colonization of Mars by Americans
              fleeing the Earth’s atomic wasteland; and 2006’s<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The
              Road</span></em>, Cormac McCarthy’s novel of a father and son pushing a
              shopping cart across a denuded hellscape, among many others. But while the
              Chinese have on occasion written apocalyptic fiction, with few exceptions its
              authors can never bear — or dare — to destroy their country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Probably the
              closest the Middle Kingdom comes to cratering in Chinese literature is a
              cautionary tale of corruption and incompetence. In 1991, as aftershocks from
              the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square massacre continued to reverberate, the
              Beijing-based writer Wang Lixiong published the novel<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Yellow
              Peril</span></em>. The novel imagines the country in 1998: Economic reform
              fails, China descends into civil war, and the instability forces hundreds of millions
              of Chinese to flee to Russia, Europe, and the United States. The aftershocks of
              Tiananmen, Wang predicted, would destroy the ruling Chinese Communist Party and
              perhaps take China down with it. (After the novel was published in Chinese in
              Canada, police arrested Wang, releasing him soon after with a warning.) In an
              article published roughly a decade after the book’s publication, Wang
              apologized for being wrong. “If you were grading<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Yellow
              Peril</span></em><span> </span>on its powers
              of divination, it deserves a ‘zero,’” he<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.hjclub.info/bbs/viewtopic.php?printertopic=1&amp;t=36380&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=desc&amp;vote=viewresult&amp;sid=70723bb0ff8d65f4d6b75fd46f2fa142"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #eb1414; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>wrote</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">. “In what era have men of learning
              not worried that China will perish?” China, he belatedly realized, has always
              survived. “Throughout several thousand years of history, the boat keeps moving
              forward. How could it hit a reef and sink today?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The irony is stark.
              The United States is a stable, raucous democracy, whose only real flirtation
              with chaos was the bloody American Civil War.<span> </span><span class="fppquote"><span style="border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">China’s 5,000 years of history, on the other hand, are lousy with
              apocalypses: cycles of destruction and rebirth, plateaus of peace and
              prosperity punctured by eras of stagnation and disease, of natural and man-made
              disasters robbing the rulers of the Mandate of Heaven and catalyzing wrenching
              dynastic changes.</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In U.S. film and
              literature, however, it seems like every month flesh-craving zombies attack the
              White House and destroy civilization as we know it.<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Independence
              Day: Resurgence</span></em>, now<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1628841/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #eb1414; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>playing</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">in theaters, and which features aliens wiping out much of the
              Eastern Seaboard, is only the most recent example. Like Bill Murray in<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Groundhog
              Day</span></em>, the United States in pop culture has been poisoned, frozen,
              burned, and electrocuted; it’s been overrun by werewolves, invaded by aliens,
              devastated by plague, and brought low by Nazi cyborgs. Especially in this
              decade of uncertainty, disaster stories reign. In the prosperous and stable
              1990s, “no one wanted zombies,” Max Brooks, the author of<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>World
              War Z</span></em>, told me. “When things are good, no one wants to see the
              world ending,” Brooks, whose book imagines zombies overrunning the world, said.
              “When things are bad, Americans need a place to put all those apocalyptic
              anxieties.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Part of the reason
              Chinese writers haven’t written fiction about the destruction of their country
              involves religion: China does not follow the Judeo-Christian tradition that
              foretells the apocalypse and rapture. “The Christian tradition is linear. There
              is an end, a judgment day,” said Mingwei Song, an expert on Chinese literature
              at Wellesley College. “Whereas in China, there is a circle, a change of
              dynasty, but not a change of the world.” The Analects of Confucius, the closest
              thing Chinese civilization has to a founding text, advocates harmony,
              continuity, and order, and the strong Buddhist and Taoist traditions call for
              an escape from society. “If the human world becomes too corrupted to live in,
              you can always withdraw to nature,” said Sheng Yun, a contributing editor at
              the<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Shanghai Review of Books.</span></em><span> </span>Instead of wishing for a great fire or
              flood to cleanse corruption or immorality, as persists in the Western
              tradition, the Chinese reaction is to retreat to an often fantastical earthly
              paradise, she said. (That’s not to say China lacks a substantial fantasy
              tradition: The mercurial Monkey King is the protagonist of 1592’s<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Journey
              to the West</span></em>, one of the country’s most famous novels.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">But while China may
              lack a Judgment Day, its literary tradition is ripe with doomsday prophets and
              dreamers who reached deep into Chinese history and society to criticize its
              present — from the Taoists to Mao Zedong to China’s burgeoning sci-fi novelists
              who satirize Communist China with their dystopian visions. The Chinese don’t
              need zombies to destroy their country. Their history’s ghosts are devastating
              enough.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Culture, chaos, and rebirth</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The earliest work
              about a Chinese apocalypse may be<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The Divine Incantations Scripture</span></em>,
              a Taoist meditation thought to have been written as a response to the chaos of
              4th-century China. The Taoists, a religious sect formed a few hundred years
              before the birth of Jesus Christ and preaching allegiance to the “way,” or the
              natural order of the universe, were worried about their society. Some wanted to
              return to the peace and stability of the Han dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220),
              widely seen as a golden age of peace and prosperity. But like all dynasties,
              its rulers eventually grew corrupt, the people rebelled, and a series of wars
              splintered the country. “Epidemic demons are killing people,” wrote the text’s
              unknown authors. “The world abounds in vice and lacks goodness.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The text, however,
              was not published in full until the early 10th century, just after the end of
              the Tang dynasty, another golden age. The scripture’s editor was Du Guangting,
              a prominent Taoist scholar so outwardly supportive of the regime that Emperor
              Wang Jian<span> </span></span><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hIgyZyIMprgC&amp;pg=PT376&amp;dq=du+guangting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rPJ0U_P4IceTqAaot4KwDA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=du%20guangting&amp;f=false"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #eb1414; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>awarded</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">him the prestigious title of
              “grand counselor with golden seal and purple ribbon.” The tyrant Wang claimed
              his kingdom was yet another high point in history. But Du’s publication of
              apocalyptic visions of an earlier era was a subtle dissent. The people and
              their ruler must follow the Tao, the text says. Otherwise, “the great ghost
              king will come and annihilate all of them.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Probably the most
              famous line about the destruction of China comes from the poet Du Fu, born in
              712, at the height of the Tang dynasty. Changan, the dynasty’s capital where Du
              lived in his later years, was at the time the world’s largest city, boasting
              more than 1 million inhabitants. But the 755-763 An Lushan Rebellion, an
              eponymous coup by a formerly trusted general, snuffed out that prosperity. In<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The

              an uncovering, an illumination unveiled precisely at the very moment of the

              “country shattered mountain river here” — also speaks to the permanence of

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The depredations of
              the An Lushan Rebellion soon ceased, eventually paving the way for the glory of
              the Song dynasty — whose prosperous government issued the first paper money —
              but which, weakened by infighting, fell to the invading Mongols. The

              a title meaning he had to gather material from “tales and events told by common
              folk,” according to the scholar Stephen West. Yuan was the best-known writer of
              a genre known as “death and destruction” poems that spoke to the destruction of

              awaken from its chaos. Lu Xun, the country’s most prominent 20th-century

              windows, absolutely indestructible, with many people fast asleep inside who
              will soon die of suffocation.” (Society is dying, but the country would
              survive.) Lu’s writings on the need for change in China influenced Mao Zedong,
              who<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/05/23/chinese_military_liberation_novels"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #eb1414; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>bought into the idea</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">of constructing a future
              mortgaged on the present. Perhaps more than any other leader in history, Mao
              sought to bring the “end of days” to his country — so that a new one could rise
              up from its ashes. In other words, Mao believed he could create an ideal new
              China — by destroying the current one.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Of course, a
              greater influence on Mao was Karl Marx, from whom Mao adapted the idea that
              when Chinese society came to embrace communism, it would break the cycle of
              history. Some messianic cults in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam believe in
              the necessity of a great fury of cleansing violence to purify the earth for the
              Messiah. Similarly, Mao destroyed the old order to make way for the new: After
              winning the civil war in 1949, he oversaw the death of millions of landlords,
              rich peasants, and sympathizers of the defeated Nationalists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Communism is an
              apocalypse novelist’s dream. It’s a shame that during its heyday, no one was
              allowed to portray it in fiction. During the anarchic 1966-1976 Cultural
              Revolution, and especially the demonic 1958-1961 Great Leap Forward, Mao rent
              the fabric of society. In the Cultural Revolution, citizens decided that red
              traffic lights could no longer mean “stop,” but, because red is the color of
              the revolution, had to mean “go.” Children murdered their parents, employees
              revenged themselves on their bosses, and students killed their teachers. During
              the Great Leap Forward, an estimated 45 million people died of starvation,
              overwork, and beatings, as Mao urged the country to transform itself into a collectivist
              industrial machine. Because of the ideological controls of the era, the best
              contemporaneous description of its apocalyptic monstrosities can be found in
              the chairman’s poems. “Gunfire licks the heavens, shells pit the earth,” he<span> </span></span><a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/poems/poems36.htm"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #eb1414; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>wrote</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">in 1965, one year before

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">China’s dystopian
              writers didn’t arrive en masse until after the pivotal year of 1989, later than
              the West by a few centuries. (Li Jie’s 1999 novel<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The
              End of Red Chinese Dynasty</span></em><span> </span>is
              one example.) But the history from which they draw stretches back millennia.
              “If we pull back far enough to view human history from a more elevated
              perspective, we can see that society builds up, invents, creates
              utopias—sketches of perfect, imagined futures,” Chen Qiufan, one of China’s
              most promising young dystopian novelists,<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.tor.com/2014/05/15/the-torn-generation-chinese-science-fiction-in-a-culture-in-transition/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #eb1414; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>wrote</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">in a blog post, “and then,
              inevitably, the utopias collapse, betray their ideals, and turn into
              dystopias.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The miasma of
              censorship enveloping China still prevents true apocalyptic satire of the Mao
              years — or the present, for that matter. Wu Yan, a professor at Beijing Normal
              University and an expert in science fiction, told me that, generally speaking,
              works about “the destruction of China or Beijing [are] not really allowed to be
              published.” Chen was more direct: “Everyone avoids the word ‘doomsday’ in
              modern China,” he told me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And yet, there have
              been some attempts. The journalist Han Song’s 2000 novel<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>2066:
              Red Star Over America</span></em><span> </span>sees
              the United States riven by anarchy under the thumb of a revolutionary dictator.
              A Chinese genius wanders through the pockmarked United States, trying to save
              it. It’s subtle — necessary when writing in China about the sensitive subject
              of the Cultural Revolution — but the madness of 2066 America reminds one a lot
              of another country, 100 years earlier.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">There is something
              viscerally satisfying in watching your country fall apart. “Most apocalyptic
              themes have a sense of reckoning, which is a human need,” said Sheng of the<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Shanghai
              Review of Books</span></em>. And with these kind of movies, there’s often a
              great “visual impact and thrill.”<span> </span><span class="fppquote"><span style="border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">There’s something cathartic about the chaos, something peaceful
              about the post-apocalyptic quiet.</span></span><span> </span>American apocalyptic movies are popular
              in China, Wu said — and those that show China saving the world, like the film<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #eb1414; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>2012</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">, doubly so. And yet the apocalyptic movies screened in China are
              all U.S. imports. “An American audience can watch a disaster movie and say, ‘We
              have an incompetent president, or a deadlocked Congress, and we’ll vote them
              out,’” Brooks said. In China, it’s far too sensitive for the Communist Party to
              be criticized, even implicitly, for the country’s destruction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Of course, that’s
              not to say the party is blameless. In a discussion forum on the popular Chinese
              question-and-answer website Zhihu, an anonymous commenter </span><a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/22475107"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #eb1414; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>asked</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">why China has so few apocalyptic movies and fiction. “One day your
              house could be torn down, and you’d be left with no compensation, nothing. Does
              that count as the apocalypse,” another commenter replied. For those at the
              bottom of Chinese society, life is about survival, this commenter added. And apocalyptic
              fiction is about as useful to them as “knitting wool.”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Like in the United
              States, there are thousands of Chinese sci-fi novels published online that
              barely get noticed. Liu, the author of<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The Three-Body Problem</span></em>, said it’s
              likely there’s some apocalyptic fiction online where China gets destroyed, but
              he’s never come across it. For him, the destruction of the Earth and sun at the
              end of his<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Three-Body</span></em><span> </span>trilogy “just made sense,” he said.
              But humanity survives. “It wasn’t that pessimistic,” he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Of China’s
              extremely small canon of apocalyptic literature, Wang Lixiong’s book is the
              bleakest. “<em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Yellow Peril</span></em><span> </span>was too dark,” Chen told me. “I got
              depressed for quite a long time after reading it. That all this so-called 5,000
              years of history would end up in this very cynical way — us behaving like
              cavemen, struggling for living in the jungle.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Chen’s own
              dystopian contribution,<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";   border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The Waste Tide</span></em>, is less
              pessimistic, but still dark: It tells of a village in wealthy 2020’s China
              where a technologically proficient group of cyberpunks enslave an underclass of
              humans from poor regions of Guangdong province, forcing them to sift through
              toxic recycling materials. Chen says China’s<span> </span></span><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/03/26/china-is-one-of-most-unequal-countries-in-the-world-imf-paper-says/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #eb1414; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>immense wealth gap</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">and a trip to a nearby
              impoverished village influenced him. “Different groups of people in modern
              China have their own vanities, their own struggles,” he said. “I want people to

              can’t shake the feeling that disaster may be imminent. “Whether what I wrote
              about will come to pass, I cannot answer,” Wang wrote in his blog. “We can only
              wait for ‘the will of heaven’ — if China is not supposed to be destroyed, the
              elements it needs will appear.… Even if the mythical power beasts that rule
              China can still hold onto power for another 30 years, it’s just a bubble in the
              long river of history.”</span></p>
