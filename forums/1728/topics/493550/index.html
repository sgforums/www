              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">MATTHEW TOSTEVIN and COD
              SATRUSAYANG 24 February 2017 </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">BANGKOK
              (Reuters) - A stand-off between security forces and monks at Thailand's biggest
              temple has exposed a struggle as much about power as religion in the
              predominantly Buddhist country, where the junta has shut down dissent since a
              2014 coup.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              the past week, some 4,000 police and soldiers have surrounded the Dhammakaya
              temple, which practices a form of Buddhism at odds with conservatives. It is
              widely seen as linked to the populist movement of former prime minister Thaksin
              Shinawatra - which the temple firmly denies - and its size makes it
              increasingly influential.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dhammakaya
              has created the most visible challenge to the authorities since the coup by
              refusing for months to hand over its former abbot - wanted for money laundering
              - and by frustrating a police search.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">"It
              is trying to create unrest and subverting state power," said Paiboon
              Nititawan, a former senator appointed by the military to a council on solving
              Thailand's problems.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Thai
              society traditionally has three pillars: nation, monarchy and religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              establishment controls the first two through the junta and King Maha
              Vajiralongkorn, who appointed a conservative as Supreme Patriarch for
              Thailand's 300,000 monks days before the temple confrontation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dhammakaya
              is of a different scale to over 40,000 other temples. Its headquarters outside
              Bangkok covers nearly 10 times the area of the Vatican and is completed by a
              UFO-shaped golden temple dome. Since 1970, it has established over 90 branches
              in 35 countries.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              temple runs television stations, slick websites and active social media
              accounts. It holds choreographed ceremonies of tens of thousands of people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Yet
              Dhammakaya's millions of adherents are still a minority within Thailand's almost
              entirely Buddhist population.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">MEDITATION
              AND MONEY</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Its
              fundraising has made Dhammakaya much richer than other temples - and angered
              critics who say it has deserted Theravada Buddhist teachings to shun material
              possessions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Parallels
              are drawn to China's Falun Gong and Turkey's Gulenists. Both were fast growing
              religious groups using modern methods, which were suppressed when their
              influence grew too great.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A
              spokesman for the Department of Special Investigation said the government's aim
              was only to bring in the temple's influential former abbot, Phra Dhammachayo,
              in a way that respects Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              temple says the 72-year-old monk is very ill and has not been seen for months.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              questions charges against him, some of which relate to money allegedly
              embezzled from a credit union that lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Monks
              say they have cooperated fully with the search.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">"We
              have never been involved in any political affairs," said Phra Pasura
              Dantamano, a senior monk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">"Every
              project we have conducted is transparent. If anyone fears a threat, itâ€™s only
              those who obtained power improperly," he said. "All we do is teach
              monks, teach self discipline, meditation. Is that wrong?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              temple rejects any link to former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra or his
              'red-shirt' followers. Weng Tojirakarn, a red shirt leader, also told Reuters
              there was no link.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Regardless,
              both groups represent newcomers whose power threatened - or could threaten -
              the establishment's hold.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dhammakaya
              is explicit that giving brings merit. When that "bears fruit", it
              brings more wealth, which means more donations - to support Buddhist
              activities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Such
              activities have expanded Dhammakaya's influence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">By
              helping temples in hard times, it has brought dozens into its orbit. That in
              turn increased its support on the Sangha religious council, Buddhism's
              governing body.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Critics
              say its influence grew too great.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">"Nirvana
              is for sale and the more you give, the better you become," said Mano
              Laohavanich a former Dhammakaya monk but now a strong critic. "Itâ€™s like a
              parasite, which has taken control of Thai Buddhism."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Three
              members of the Sangha council declined to comment on Dhammakaya. So did the
              government's National Office of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">SHOWDOWN</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              showdown for control began last year when the Sangha recommended a candidate
              for Supreme Patriarch with links to Dhammakaya and was under investigation over
              taxes on a vintage car.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              junta rejected that candidate. Then, when the new king took the throne in
              December, the law was changed to let him choose a patriarch and ignore the
              Sangha's wishes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Four
              days after a new patriarch, chosen from Thai Buddhism's more austere
              fraternity, was installed the junta declared emergency powers over Dhammakaya.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              problem for police is how to pass through chanting, saffron-robed monks when
              violence against them would be taboo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Police
              have raised the pressure with more forces, rolling out razor wire and
              threatening more temple leaders with arrest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              temple's adversaries believe charges of scandal and the scenes at the compound
              will at least discourage Thais from joining Dhammakaya. Longer term, other
              steps are being considered.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">"Assets
              owned by the Dhammakaya Foundation should be transferred to the temple and the
              leadership of the temple needs to change," said Paiboon, the former
              senator. "Someone outside the temple must be appointed to steer the temple
              back to the right path."</span></p>
