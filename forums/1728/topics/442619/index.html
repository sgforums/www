              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a id="anathapindika" name="anathapindika">Anathapindika's Monastery</a>.
               Then the Blessed One, early in the morning, put on his robes and, 
              carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. And Ven. 
              Rahula, early in the morning, put on his robes and, carrying his bowl 
              and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms following right behind the 
              Blessed One.<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag " name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> Then the Blessed One, looking back at Rahula, addressed him: "Rahula, 
              any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or 
              external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every form 
              is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not 
              mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.'"</p>
              <p>"Just form, O Blessed One? Just form, O One Well-gone?"</p>
              <p>"Form, Rahula, &amp; feeling &amp; perception &amp; fabrications &amp; consciousness."</p>
              <p>Then the thought occurred to Ven. Rahula, "Who, having been exhorted 
              face-to-face by the Blessed One, would go into the town for alms today?"
               So he turned back and sat down at the foot of a tree, folding his legs 
              crosswise, holding his body erect, &amp; setting mindfulness to the 
              fore.</p>
              <p>Ven. Sariputta saw Ven. Rahula sitting at the foot of a tree, his 
              legs folded crosswise, his body held erect, &amp; with mindfulness set 
              to the fore. On seeing him, he said to him, "Rahula, develop the 
              meditation<a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag " name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html#fn-2">[2]</a> of mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing. The meditation of mindfulness
               of in-&amp;-out breathing, when developed &amp; pursued, is of great 
              fruit, of great benefit."</p>
              <p>Then Ven. Rahula, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, 
              went to the Blessed One and, having bowed down, sat to one side. As he 
              was sitting there he said to him, "How, lord, is mindfulness of 
              in-&amp;-out breathing to be developed &amp; pursued so as to be of 
              great fruit, of great benefit?"</p>
              <p>"Rahula, {any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; 
              internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near:
               every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 
              'This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.' There 
              are these five properties, Rahula. Which five? The earth property, the 
              water property, the fire property, the wind property, &amp; the space 
              property.</p>
              <p>"And what is the earth property? The earth property can be either internal or external. What is the internal earth property?}<a id="fnt-3" class="noteTag " name="fnt-3" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html#fn-3">[3]</a> Anything internal, within oneself, that's hard, solid, &amp; sustained 
              [by craving]: head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, 
              tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes, spleen, 
              lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach, 
              feces, or anything else internal, within oneself, that's hard, solid, 
              and sustained: This is called the internal earth property. Now both the 
              internal earth property &amp; the external earth property are simply 
              earth property. And that should be seen as it actually is present with 
              right discernment: 'This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my 
              self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right 
              discernment, one becomes disenchanted with the earth property and makes 
              the earth property fade from the mind.</p>
              <p>"And what is the water property? The water property may be either 
              internal or external. What is the internal water property? Anything 
              internal, belonging to oneself, that's water, watery, &amp; sustained: 
              bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, oil, saliva, mucus, 
              oil-of-the-joints, urine, or anything else internal, within oneself, 
              that's water, watery, &amp; sustained: This is called the internal water
               property. Now both the internal water property &amp; the external water
               property are simply water property. And that should be seen as it 
              actually is present with right discernment: 'This is not mine, this is 
              not me, this is not my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is 
              present with right discernment, one becomes disenchanted with the water 
              property and makes the water property fade from the mind.</p>
              <p>"And what is the fire property? The fire property may be either 
              internal or external. What is the internal fire property? Anything 
              internal, belonging to oneself, that's fire, fiery, &amp; sustained: 
              that by which [the body] is warmed, aged, &amp; consumed with fever; and
               that by which what is eaten, drunk, chewed, &amp; savored gets properly
               digested; or anything else internal, within oneself, that's fire, 
              fiery, &amp; sustained: This is called the internal fire property. Now 
              both the internal fire property &amp; the external fire property are 
              simply fire property. And that should be seen as it actually is present 
              with right discernment: 'This is not mine, this is not me, this is not 
              my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right 
              discernment, one becomes disenchanted with the fire property and makes 
              the fire property fade from the mind.</p>
              <p>"And what is the wind property? The wind property may be either 
              internal or external. What is the internal wind property? Anything 
              internal, belonging to oneself, that's wind, windy, &amp; sustained: 
              up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the stomach, winds in the 
              intestines, winds that course through the body, in-and-out breathing, or
               anything else internal, within oneself, that's wind, windy, &amp; 
              sustained: This is called the internal wind property. Now both the 
              internal wind property &amp; the external wind property are simply wind 
              property. And that should be seen as it actually is present with right 
              discernment: 'This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self.' 
              When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment, 
              one becomes disenchanted with the wind property and makes the wind 
              property fade from the mind.</p>
              <p>"And what is the space property? The space property may be either 
              internal or external. What is the internal space property? Anything 
              internal, belonging to oneself, that's space, spatial, &amp; sustained: 
              the holes of the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the [passage] whereby 
              what is eaten, drunk, consumed, &amp; tasted gets swallowed, and where 
              it collects, and whereby it is excreted from below, or anything else 
              internal, within oneself, that's space, spatial, &amp; sustained: This 
              is called the internal space property. Now both the internal space 
              property &amp; the external space property are simply space property. 
              And that should be seen as it actually is present with right 
              discernment: 'This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self.' 
              When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment, 
              one becomes disenchanted with the space property and makes the space 
              property fade from the mind.</p>
              <p>"Rahula, develop the meditation in tune with earth. For when you are 
              developing the meditation in tune with earth, agreeable &amp; 
              disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen will not stay in 
              charge of your mind. Just as when people throw what is clean or unclean 
              on the earth — feces, urine, saliva, pus, or blood — the earth is not 
              horrified, humiliated, or disgusted by it; in the same way, when you are
               developing the meditation in tune with earth, agreeable &amp;

              disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen will not stay in 
              charge of your mind. Just as when fire burns what is clean or unclean — 
              feces, urine, saliva, pus, or blood — it is not horrified, humiliated, 
              or disgusted by it; in the same way, when you are developing the 
              meditation in tune with fire, agreeable &amp; disagreeable sensory

              or disgusted by it; in the same way, when you are developing the 
              meditation in tune with wind, agreeable &amp; disagreeable sensory

              <p>"Develop the meditation of compassion. For when you are developing the meditation of compassion, cruelty will be abandoned.</p>

              you are developing the meditation of the perception of inconstancy, the 
              conceit 'I am' will be abandoned.</p>
              <p>"Develop the meditation of mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing. 
              Mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, when developed &amp; pursued, is 
              of great fruit, of great benefit.</p>
              <p>"And how, Rahula, is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing developed &amp; pursued so as to be of great fruit, of great benefit?</p>
              <p>"There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to 
              the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs
               crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore.<a id="fnt-4" class="noteTag " name="fnt-4" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html#fn-4">[4]</a> Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.</p>

               out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' [3] He trains 
              himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains 
              himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' [4] He

              <p>"[13] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy.'
               He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy.' [14]

              <p>Hi, you should focus on one at a time.</p>
              <p>The Buddha taught that by mindfulness of breathing, that alone leads to the fulfillment of 4 foundations of mindfulness and the 7 factors of enlightenment, i.e. mindfulness of breathing alone leads to liberation.</p>
