              <p>You said 'Don't know mind', and Zen Master Seung Sahn would say, just keep this don't know mind! This don't know mind is at the same time, clear mind. It is not a 'confused' mind. It does not mean you are not aware, in fact 'dont know mind' is clear, and aware. And when we can dissolve that mind completely, that 'me', we can 'be' everything -- table, screen, trees, are just one 'substance'.</p>
              <p>Whenever we think we are something, question it and the thought dissolves back into Reality itself. And the thought itself is a manifestation of that Reality.</p>

              <p>We can 'be' everything because we already are everything, just that we contract into the false sense of an observer due to delusions.</p>
              <p>You can contemplate on:<span lang="EN-US"><br><br>There is thinking, no thinker<br>There is sound, no hearer<br>Suffering exists, no sufferer<br>Deeds there are, no doer</span></p>
              <p>By contemplating as such, Thusness got a breakthrough insight into Anatta.</p>
              <p>But this is not just an intellectual exercise. You have to truly feel and observe that this is so, that there is no observer apart from observed.</p>

              <h3>CASE 53 OF  THE BLUE CLIFF RECORDS</h3>
              <h3>HYAKUJO AND A WILD DUCK</h3>
              <p><strong>ENGO'S INTRODUCTION</strong>  The universe is not veiled; all its activities
              lie open.  Whichever way he [Baso] may go, he meets no obstruction. 
              At all times he behaves independently.  His every word is devoid of
              egocentricity, yet still he has the power to kill others.  Tell me,
              where did the ancient worthy come to rest?  See the following...</p>
              <p><strong>MAIN SUBJECT</strong>  When Baso (d. 788) was out walking with Hyakujo
              (d. 814), he saw a wild duck fly past.  Baso said, "What is it?" 
              Hyakujo said, "It is a wild duck."  Baso said, "Where is it?" 
              Hyakujo said, "It has flown away."  Baso at last gave Hyakujo's nose
              a sharp pinch.  Hyakujo cried out with pain.  Baso said, "There,
              how can it fly away?"</p>
              <p><strong>SETCHO'S VERSE:</strong> <br>The wild duck!  What, how, and where?
              <br>Baso has seen, talked, taught,
              <br>and exhausted
              <br>The meaning of mountain clouds
              <br>and moonlit seas.
              <br>But Jo doesn't understand  --
              <br>"has flown away."
              <br>Flown away?  No, he is brought back!
              <br>Say!  Say!</p>
              <hr>
              <p><br>        This story is about Hyakujo
              who became a famous Zen master in his own right, but in this case he is
              learning from his master Baso.  We find them in a natural setting
              where a wild duck passes by, and Baso uses this environment to illuminate
              Hyakujo to the true nature of things.</p>
              <p>        Everything, everywhere is
              constantly revealing the underlining nature of the universe.  When
              the historical Buddha had his first great awakening upon seeing the morning
              star Venus on December 8th some 2,500 years ago, he realized that everything,
              everywhere was always naturally manifesting Buddha Nature Activity.</p>
              <p>        When our eyes are truly open,
              we realize how astounding it is for a tree to be a tree, a mountain to
              be a mountain, an animal to be an animal.  A river is water flowing. 
              A duck passing is truly just wild duck now passing.</p>
              <p>        Zen realization includes
              the capacity to know ourselves as mountain, river, tree or wild duck. 
              In other words, while sitting here in the form of a human being, we have
              the capacity to know mountain, river, tree, or duck from the inside. 
              This is possible because on a fundamental level nothing is really separate
              from anything else.</p>
              <p>        In this story Baso and his
              student Hyakujo are most likely walking around the gardens enclosed or
              adjacent to the temple grounds.  While walking, imagine that their
              steps startle a wild duck in the brush, which bursts forth and flies off. 
              Baso then says, "What was that?"  Hyakujo responds, "A wild duck,
              master."  Baso queries, "Where did that duck just go?"  Hyakujo
              looks a little puzzled and points out, "It flew off this way master." 
              Baso is not pleased with this response.  Hyakujo by his second descriptive
              answer reveals that he was trapped within his own rational discriminating
              consciousness, failing to penetrate through the veil of subject and object
              thinking.  Therefore, Baso seizes this opportunity to push his student's
              perception to a new level by harshly tweaking Hyakujo's nose, making him
              squawk with pain.</p>
              <p><img src="http://home.comcast.net/%7Ezenquaker/duck.gif" border="0" alt="" width="344" height="336"></p>
              <p>        Baso's teaching was very
              kind.  After making Hyakujo squeal, Baso said, "See that duck has
              gone nowhere, it is still here before me."  Hyakujo surely understood
              what his teacher was getting at.  Even so, Baso probably concluded
              the encounter with a great "Katsu!" or Zen shout, to illustrate that all
              things in this singular moment of eternity are subtly yet profoundly united,
              and that from this fundamental level there can be no coming or going.</p>
              <p>        When I was a young boy under
              the tutelage of Gempo Roshi, he would sometimes, when  displeased
              with me for some reason, grab me by the ear and pull me to where he wanted
              me to go.  And, of course, I would be yelping or quacking quite a
              bit along the way.  Sometimes, I would not even know what Roshi was
              angry about.   When Baso tweaked Hyakujo's nose, we must understand
              it to be like the sharp slap of the <em>keisaku</em> (teaching stick), which
              is not meant as punishment, but used as a device to wake up the receiver
              to a broader, non-attached awareness of Reality.</p>
              <p>        Baso's point is that you
              and the wild duck are both manifestations of Buddha Nature.  Buddha
              Nature is fundamentally indivisible.  There is only one kind of Buddha
              Nature activity though it reveals itself in myriad ways.  When our
              consciousness is able to open up to the underlining heart/mind we immediately
              realize that nothing can be lost or found, nothing can really come or go.</p>
              <p>        Rinzai, the ninth century
              Zen Master and founder of our lineage of Zen practice, when asked by his
              students, "What is the essential point of Zen?", would often respond by
              saying, "You here now listening to this discourse are none other than Buddha."  
              Zen Master Gutei when asked, "What is the essence of Zen?"  would
              not speak at all, but would simply hold up one finger.</p>
              <p>        Gutei never exhausted his
              one finger Zen; however, here in America, one finger Zen is insufficient
              to become a citizen.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service wants
              finger prints of all my fingers.  In fact I have had to give them
              my finger prints four times now.  The last time I was sent to a Chinese
              video store to get my "official" finger prints, because they had misplaced
              the first three copies.  It is my understanding that today the I.N.S.
              is beginning a whole new system to collect finger prints; they seem to
              understand that they are having some problems.   I am skeptical
              that even now all my fingers will do.</p>
              <p>        Baso would have been happy
              to see Hyakujo reveal some understanding that was not so attached to his
              ego bounded perception.   How could Hyakujo have done this to
              Baso's satisfaction?  How can we reveal that we realize and know in
              our heart that nothing is separate, yet each thing profoundly unique, each
              moment singular?</p>
              <p>        If our Zen practice is limited
              to the Dokusan (Interview) room, the Zendo (Meditation Hall), or even sesshin
              (Zen retreat), we are really missing the point.  As students of Zen,
              it is our duty to make every action an opportunity to be fully present,
              fully aware, fully involved.  For Zen practice to be meaningful, everyday
              actions in our daily life must become a demonstration of our understanding
              that everything, everywhere reveals the universal.</p>
              <p>        Do not be fooled; being fully
              present, fully aware and fully involved in each activity is simple to talk
              about, but not so easy to do.  It takes years of training to move
              naturally, spontaneously, and compassionately through the real encounters
              and circumstances of our lives.  Zen training, Aikido training and
              other developmental arts are in some ways just a good start on this process. 
              As complex creatures, it is hard for us to learn how to let go and be natural
              in a world of such rich and varied possibilities.</p>
              <p>        Recently, I have heard of
              a machine that makes sushi (Japanese rice and fish cake).  There is
              very little Japanese culture in Montana.  Perhaps Joshin (Leslie)
              and I could buy a sushi machine and make a good business for ourselves,
              because no one in Montana knows how sushi is really supposed to taste. 
              Sushi made by hand, with the skill and heart connection of a master will
              be delicious.  It can not possibly compare in taste to sushi that
              is made as a copy of a chef's work.   Even if made well by a
              robot, how dull it would soon become, without the master's heart/mind.</p>
              <p>        Someday, there will likely
              be a computer that will be able to spit out "answers" to koans (Zen parables). 
              What a joke that will be.  I would be happy to give you the answers,
              but they won't do you any good unless your heart/mind sees through them
              clearly.  Without a heart/mind response, a koan "answer" has no meaning
              and caries no understanding of the true nature of things.  At best,
              a computer one day may be able to make an "intellectual" or "rational"
              response, and this might count for 10% of the koan's true meaning.</p>
              <p>        A few years ago when I practiced
              with Joshu Sasaki Roshi in New Mexico, he related to me that several of
              his Zen students were giving strange inadequate responses to his koans. 
              I said, "Oh yes, recently I had seen an English publication of koan answers." 
              He said, "Ah, now I understand.  I'll just have to make up some new
              koans."   No one can teach you Zen, how much less can you then
              learn from a book, but with enough effort and guidance you can realize
              it for yourself.</p>
              <p>        To penetrate a koan, or gain 
              Zen understanding, just sit, sit, sit.  Here on the cushion, face
              all the trials of pain, fatigue and mental disquiet, and learn how not
              to be distracted or disturbed.  Then, and only then, will your own
              gut-cleansed understanding bubble up to your awareness. Learn how to be
              undisturbed and you will gain direct access to your own powerful, creative,
              compassionate, core energy.</p>
              <p>        Life is our teacher, our
              only teacher.  When we learn how to fully face life just as it is,
              without clinging to our likes or running from our dislikes, then we will
              realize our human potential to meet life and death, times of confusion
              or clarity, without flinching.</p>

              <h4>Anger</h4>
              <p><em>The following article was adapted from a talk by Toni Packer
                          on Day 5 of the September 1998 retreat.</em></p>
              <p>Let's talk about anger. Everyone experiences it at one time or
                          another. Can something be done about anger?</p>
              <p>A retreatant reported experiencing lots of energy during
                          sittings, mostly generated by feeling angry about the sitting
                          itself. Thoughts were running about wasting her time here while
                          there was so much work to do at home. "What should I do with all
                          this energy? At times I feel like screaming! Is it all right to
                          scream?"</p>
              <p>We have all agreed to maintain outward silence during retreats.
                          Screams are disturbing. If one really feels like screaming that's
                          OK, but maybe one can find a ravine in the woods where it would not
                          impact others. But it's a good question, what to do with powerful
                          energy like anger. My immediate response to the questioner was,
                          "Let it be awareness! Awareness is energy!"</p>
              <p>Years ago a man came to see me before applying for retreat,
                          asking if it would be all right to express anger during a meeting.
                          I said it was all right. So one day he entered the meeting room
                          with a tense, flushed face, asking if he could vent his anger at me
                          right then and there. I nodded, and quietly asked: "Have you ever
                          looked at it directly?" No answer came just a charged silence. We
                          sat wordlessly for what seemed to be an eternity, and then he burst
                          out laughing: "It doesn't have to be expressed!" When a powerfully
                          driving emotion gives way to simple awareness, it is like a
                          miracle. What emerged from awareness wasn't screams, but laughter
                          and insight.</p>
              <p>Psychological theories about what to do with anger abound and
                          change with time. I do not know if anger should be expressed or
                          shouldn't be. The fact is that we do get angry, and it expresses
                          itself instantly, verbally as well as non-verbally, throughout the
                          body. So what is this anger? Can we go beyond the question, "What
                          should I do with it?" and beyond answers like, "I should feel it in
                          my body, or I should express it verbally, physically, or I ought to
                          control it."</p>
              <p>There is plenty to feel when we're angry. It mobilizes the
                          entire organism, mentally and physically no single cell remains
                          unaffected. Storylines run wildly, keeping the agitation going. Can
                          we feel all these amazing physical and mental manifestations
                          without resistance? If resistance is there, then feel it, look at
                          it. Don't try to shut it down by telling yourself that it is
                          dangerous to experience anger, or try to convince yourself that we
                          are wholly justified in what we are feeling. We really don't know.
                          Every thought, every judgment about it intensifies confusion and
                          agitation! Can simple awareness shed light, create space?</p>
              <p>Trace anger as it is happening! Why am I getting angry? What is
                          at the base of it? Can it be irradiated with attention? By looking
                          at it, questioning it, observing it in the light of the question,
                          what reveals itself is that we function in rigid patterns that do
                          not want to be interrupted. Memory structures in the brain and
                          throughout the body about how we are, how things ought to be, what
                          is right and what is wrong keep us functioning fairly smoothly, but
                          when they are interfered with, anger results.</p>
              <p>These memory structures are wired into us from day one. Even an
                          infant, who does not yet understand the spoken word, understands
                          judgments conveyed by mother's and father's voice, eyes, and touch.
                          What brings smiles, warmth, and protection is good, is right, is
                          worth repeating over and over again. What brings rejection,
                          hardness, sadness, or pain is bad, wrong, must be avoided. So, from
                          early on, memory structures solidify organismically about what is
                          right and what is wrong to do, to be, to feel, to think, to say.
                          Schools, churches, and daily living together reinforce these
                          structures. What we want and what has given us pleasure becomes the
                          dominating pattern that needs to be maintained, incessantly
                          fulfilled, and defended against disturbance.</p>
              <p>When what we want is interfered with or thwarted, or when
                          somebody transgresses what is deeply felt to be right, the energy
                          that keeps the system intact explodes. "What they did was wrong!!!
                          How dare they!" I could see something like this happening in our
                          grandchildren. Our little grandson was quite obedient, having
                          learned through punishment and reward what his parents felt to be
                          right and wrong, what to do and what not to do, and, above all,
                          what not to touch. Several years later when his little sister came
                          toddling along, playing with the buttons on the stereo that he had
                          painfully learned to leave alone, he would get furious with her,
                          slapping her little hands. He could not tolerate seeing her do what
                          for him had become a rigid pattern of "No!" Anger was the result of
                          the disturbance. And so it is with all of us. Observing someone do
                          what the brain has encoded as wrong triggers an eruption of energy
                          that wants to keep the pattern intact. It feels as though we had
                          been personally injured.</p>
              <p>I have been wondering about this for a long time: why do we get
                          angry when someone else acts in a "stupid" way? What reveals itself
                          upon examination is that we easily feel irritated toward somebody
                          who "doesn't get it," like a parent or schoolteacher getting
                          exasperated at a child. This sort of anger isn't questioned very
                          much it seems justifiable. We feel righteous anger toward those
                          whose ways are in collision with our own. Can we question this
                          deeply?</p>
              <p>I remember feeling uncomfortable at the Zen Center when we
                          recited the precept not to become angry. How could we make this
                          vow, knowing full well that we would become angry again? And then
                          get angry about having transgressed a vow! I also wondered about
                          the teacher's saying that there were appropriate, righteous angers
                          not included in the vow. What is anger? This was my query, tracing
                          it to its very foundation. Why do we get angry? Not making
                          explanations or excuses or accusations, but watching directly what
                          is actually taking place. Why do we keep on being angry, what
                          maintains the agitated mood after the explosion has happened? Does
                          it necessarily have to continue for any length of time?</p>
              <p>We may assume that we continue being angry because of a deep
                          reservoir of rage established within us over time that can only be
                          depleted over time. But I have actually observed that physical
                          agitation dissipates amazingly fast if the personalized picture
                          story about what has happened to us is clearly seen as story, and
                          is understood as the culprit that keeps the anger burning. With
                          ever-fresh insight the brain can actually cease composing agitating
                          scenarios, abstaining wisely from picturing ourselves as
                          sacrificial victims of other peoples' stupidity or meanness.
                          Without clear insight, incendiary storylines keep running, fueling
                          the anger time and time again.</p>
              <p>With insight we may realize that there exists a tenacious
                          attachment to our stories and to the resulting anger. We actually
                          feel good in this powerful release, even though remorse may set in
                          when the storyline changes: "After this they won't like me
                          anymore!" But, it is an ever-amazing discovery that emotions can
                          dissipate when the story is seen and ends in the seeing. Some
                          physical sensations may linger for a while, but need not become a
                          problem. Watch the stories and let them go! The body has an amazing
                          ability to establish harmony when left alone.</p>
              <p>You may be thinking right now, "Aren't there situations in which
                          we ought to stand up for what is right, feel outrage against
                          exploitation or abuse?" I do not know what we ought to feel, ought
                          to do. Establishing <em>oughts</em> and trying to live by them
                          doesn't lead to insight into what is. What does happen when we are
                          exploited, abused, humiliated, made fun of, or when we see it
                          happening to others?</p>
              <p>We have never learned a wise way to deal deeply with this stuff
                          because we are so used to either putting up with it, suffering from
                          it, fighting it, or exploding over it. Either we continue darkly in
                          our conditioned patterns, or there is an awakening of interest in
                          what is going on for all of us, the abuser as well as the abused.
                          This has nothing to do with sanctioning hurtful behavior, excusing
                          it, or allowing it to continue.</p>
              <p>Can we simply behold each other as we are from moment to moment?
                          See ourselves, see everyone, as results of millennia old
                          conditioned patterns which have rigidly governed our behavior even
                          though we do not consciously want it to be so? Not just an
                          intellectual understanding of this, but direct insight into the
                          power of our overwhelmingly strong conditioning. Then, maybe, we
                          can begin to question things together and communicate with each
                          other in a new, intelligent, and compassionate way. Anger, with its
                          chemical toxins, is not conducive to clearly examining and
                          investigating. On the contrary, it spells confusion in the
                          mind.</p>
              <p>What is needed is unpolluted looking into what is happening for
                          all of us. Out of clear insight comes the energy to act in a clear
                          way. Such action is difficult for us because we are so heavily
                          conditioned in our patterns of reacting that we are not even
                          cognizant of them most of the time. But that is not an immutable
                          state of affairs. There can be ever-increasing awareness of how we
                          react and how others react to us because of our reactions to them.
                          We are all entangled together in chain reactions! Bring them to
                          light! Realize that when you talk to someone with an angry demeanor
                          they are likely to respond in kind, triggering further irritation
                          in you and, then again, you in them, and on and on.</p>
              <p>Most of us are scared of people who are angry, shouting,
                          attacking, blaming. Out of fear, we respond angrily ourselves. This
                          immediately touches memories of our childhood, years of
                          helplessness and utter dependence on adults who often exploded in
                          incomprehensible ways. Fear of angry people makes us not want to be
                          near them it is too upsetting, too intimidating. So, turning it
                          around again, can we question, while we are angry, whether we are
                          actually upsetting and intimidating other people? Maybe we don't
                          really want to upset other people. A moment of clarity and insight
                          brings astonishing sensitivity and care.</p>
              <p>As a child I was very scared of my mother's anger, particularly
                          when it was vented against my brother or the cook or nanny. I was
                          deeply attached to all of them. My brother was often sullen, moody,
                          obstinate, and did poorly in his schoolwork. I felt excruciating
                          pain every time he was scolded, punished, or humiliated. Later, in
                          my teens, I told my mother that I had been afraid of her anger all
                          my life. She was visibly shocked. She didn't realize at all that I
                          could have felt that way. It obviously did not fit the image she
                          had of herself.</p>
              <p>Memories now arise of times when I was not afraid of mother. We
                          would sometimes go together into town to do shopping. We often
                          walked quite a distance, and she would hold my hand, and it was
                          such a wonderfully happy feeling. Sometimes I would arrange my
                          small hand in hers in a special way, and she would go along with
                          it. One time we were walking through a department store, passing
                          through many narrow isles with merchandise tables left and right,
                          and I felt my mother's deep sadness, looking for something she
                          couldn't find.</p>
              <p>Just to complete that story, we visited my parents in
                          Switzerland after I was married. One day I saw my mother in the
                          dining room alone, looking toward me, and suddenly there was just
                          this beautiful woman standing there without any images. So much
                          love in this moment without images. No feeling that I had to be
                          anything she may have thought of me. It was completely natural.
                          From that moment on, our relationship changed.</p>
              <p>So, can we have infinite patience with our own anger and the
                          anger of others? Can our habitual reactions for or against someone
                          be replaced with a wondering awareness that does not know? Can we
                          try to understand each other on the deepest level, without images?
                          We are the only laboratories for unfolding this understanding anger
                          wells up in all of us. Why? Not that it shouldn't, but just WHY?
                          Let it reveal itself fully in awareness beyond limitation.</p>

              <p>Well, a few moments ago, i feel the anger feeling arise in me. Stories begin to run through my mind about this particular thing. Then i realise that the thought that i'm having are just stories. Whatever, i perceive or interpret are really just stories.. what are truth or not in this stories, i don't really know .. However, i have clearly experienced a rush of feeling and thought such as " what the fuck.. i don't even want blah blah blah " that i couldn't almost stay mindful with. I could have acted out with anger and stayed there for a period of time.</p>
              <p>Amazingly, when i stand back just now and observe the entire thing, almost instantly, i just figure out that it is really a small thing or nothing to get angry with. I could have thought how silly i could be afew years down the road... getting angry and wasting my energy over it -_-</p>

              <p><br>This is something that my Dharma teachers have mentioned before. The advice given has generally been this: While this is an encouraging sign for us as practitioners, try not to fall victim to a sense of victory as this happens. Because it is easy to get rid of anger and negative thoughts - these are things that we do not like. However, it is harder to get rid of the sense of 'achievement'. That kind of attachment is much more stickier than anger. Our goal is not just to get rid of anger. Our goal is enlightenment, which is beyond all contrived emotions. Continue meditating/watching your mind as your anger disappears. Jia you!! :)</p>

              <p>Yes.. this is a moment of insight, a moment of stepping out of the habitual reaction of thought that is both habitual and hypnotic, and seeing the stories for what it is... more thoughts, clouds arising and passing by in this vast sky but nothing sticks... and that seeing is also known as awareness.</p>
              <p>Awareness is ever-present, reflecting, shining on everything without judgement or attempting to push away any experience. Everything just reveals itself in the light of awareness effortlessly, the feeling of anger, the energy that surges throughout the bodymind, is being seen and experienced as it is. But it is not occuring to a 'me', there is no reference point to which there is an experience.</p>
              <p>Everything is simply happening on its own, revealed in clarity. Aliveness is shimmering in the bodymind but not confined to this body
              -- it is in the sound of air con humming, it is shimmering everywhere
              in this room, the table, the chair, everything. Non-dual Presence becomes obvious when we dissolve into total openness unreservedly.</p>
              <p>And everything is experienced fresh and doesn't stay for even a moment -- arising and passing moment to moment, and all our emotions and thoughts eventually dissolve in its own accord into silence when there is just a simple attending/awaring of what's going on, no more further habitual reactions through conditioned thought. But the point is not to push away any experience, even of suffering, but to see it for what it is, allowing it, surrending to what is.</p>

              <p>Yes.. and the insight of yesterday is of no value at all. Any insight or understanding can only be of value now, where fresh insights can appear. To try to cling to any achievement or understanding is merely conceptual and leads to no where. Even the Buddha himself had said he had no attainment, ultimately.</p>
              <p>Understanding, insight, is alive in the immediacy, as you said, watching your mind... this is an ongoing process that never ends. The idea of having reached a goal or a victory is simply more erroneous concepts. Reality is ever changing, ever becoming. True insight and understanding is an ongoing process of knowing, not a dead "I understand" or "I know".</p>
