              <p>I keep dogs so maybe i can help.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>First of all, must remove the fear. This fear stems from the wrong concept that all dogs are ferocious or all dogs bite and attack.</p>
              <p>Yes, certain breeds are dangerous when left alone with kids or strangers, but not all breeds are like this. And dogs bite or attack with a reason eg when provoke, sudden shock by loud noise like shouting, screaming or big bodily movement like moving too close to them or raising the hand to their head, or when faced with unfimilar objects etc. Sick dogs are another story.</p>
              <p>So, can start by introducing puppies to him. Puppies are playful but gentle, they may bite with their baby teeth( sometimes quite sharp!) but no harm done, just pick them up. Then slowly progress to adult dogs that are well trained or naturally docile. He should realised that his fear is unfounded once he found out the true nature of dogs.  </p>
              <p> So i guess this is also what Buddha taught us that all sufferings come from our own ignorance.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>So yes, for ppl like me the bitter emotions are hard to put down. We understand that all things are transient and clinging to falsehoods is the way to sufferings, but to attain such true wisdom is still a long way. So naturally would go with our defiled minds easily. But no excuses, haven't attained doesn't mean we shouldn't try our best, at least must always make ourselves remember the phenomenon of nature. Life is short, no time to loose over attachments.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.springwatercenter.org/teachers/packer/articles/anger/">http://www.springwatercenter.org/teachers/packer/articles/anger/</a><br></h4>
              <h4><br></h4>
              <h4>Anger</h4>
              <p><em>The following article was adapted from a talk by Toni Packer on Day 5 of the September 1998 retreat.</em></p>
              <p>Let's talk about anger. Everyone experiences it at one time or
              another. Can something be done about anger?</p>
              <p>A retreatant reported experiencing lots of energy during sittings,
              mostly generated by feeling angry about the sitting itself. Thoughts
              were running about wasting her time here while there was so much work
              to do at home. "What should I do with all this energy? At times I
              feel like screaming! Is it all right to scream?"</p>
              <p>We have all agreed to maintain outward silence during
              retreats. Screams are disturbing. If one really feels like screaming
              that's OK, but maybe one can find a ravine in the woods where it would
              not impact others. But it's a good question, what to do with powerful
              energy like anger. My immediate response to the questioner was,
              "Let it be awareness! Awareness is energy!"</p>
              <p>Years ago a man came to see me before applying for retreat, asking
              if it would be all right to express anger during a meeting.  I said it
              was all right. So one day he entered the meeting room with a tense,
              flushed face, asking if he could vent his anger at me right then and
              there. I nodded, and quietly asked: "Have you ever looked at it
              directly?" No answer came just a charged silence. We sat
              wordlessly for what seemed to be an eternity, and then he burst out
              laughing: "It doesn't have to be expressed!" When a
              powerfully driving emotion gives way to simple awareness, it is like a
              miracle. What emerged from awareness wasn't screams, but laughter and
              insight.</p>
              <p>Psychological theories about what to do with anger abound and
              change with time. I do not know if anger should be expressed or
              shouldn't be. The fact is that we do get angry, and it expresses
              itself instantly, verbally as well as non-verbally, throughout the
              body. So what is this anger? Can we go beyond the question, "What
              should I do with it?" and beyond answers like, "I should
              feel it in my body, or I should express it verbally, physically, or I
              ought to control it."</p>
              <p>There is plenty to feel when we're angry. It mobilizes the entire
              organism, mentally and physically no single cell remains
              unaffected. Storylines run wildly, keeping the agitation going. Can we
              feel all these amazing physical and mental manifestations without
              resistance? If resistance is there, then feel it, look at it. Don't
              try to shut it down by telling yourself that it is dangerous to
              experience anger, or try to convince yourself that we are wholly
              justified in what we are feeling. We really don't know. Every thought,
              every judgment about it intensifies confusion and agitation! Can
              simple awareness shed light, create space?</p>
              <p>Trace anger as it is happening! Why am I getting angry? What is at
              the base of it? Can it be irradiated with attention?  By looking at
              it, questioning it, observing it in the light of the question, what
              reveals itself is that we function in rigid patterns that do not want
              to be interrupted. Memory structures in the brain and throughout the
              body about how we are, how things ought to be, what is right and what
              is wrong keep us functioning fairly smoothly, but when they are
              interfered with, anger results.</p>
              <p>These memory structures are wired into us from day one. Even an
              infant, who does not yet understand the spoken word, understands
              judgments conveyed by mother's and father's voice, eyes, and
              touch. What brings smiles, warmth, and protection is good, is right,
              is worth repeating over and over again. What brings rejection,
              hardness, sadness, or pain is bad, wrong, must be avoided. So, from
              early on, memory structures solidify organismically about what is
              right and what is wrong to do, to be, to feel, to think, to
              say. Schools, churches, and daily living together reinforce these
              structures. What we want and what has given us pleasure becomes the
              dominating pattern that needs to be maintained, incessantly fulfilled,
              and defended against disturbance.</p>
              <p>When what we want is interfered with or thwarted, or when somebody
              transgresses what is deeply felt to be right, the energy that keeps
              the system intact explodes. "What they did was wrong!!! How dare
              they!" I could see something like this happening in our
              grandchildren. Our little grandson was quite obedient, having learned
              through punishment and reward what his parents felt to be right and
              wrong, what to do and what not to do, and, above all, what not to
              touch. Several years later when his little sister came toddling along,
              playing with the buttons on the stereo that he had painfully learned
              to leave alone, he would get furious with her, slapping her little
              hands. He could not tolerate seeing her do what for him had become a
              rigid pattern of "No!" Anger was the result of the
              disturbance. And so it is with all of us. Observing someone do what
              the brain has encoded as wrong triggers an eruption of energy that
              wants to keep the pattern intact. It feels as though we had been
              personally injured.</p>
              <p>I have been wondering about this for a long time: why do we get
              angry when someone else acts in a "stupid" way?  What
              reveals itself upon examination is that we easily feel irritated
              toward somebody who "doesn't get it," like a parent or
              schoolteacher getting exasperated at a child. This sort of anger isn't
              questioned very much it seems justifiable. We feel righteous anger
              toward those whose ways are in collision with our own. Can we question
              this deeply?</p>
              <p>I remember feeling uncomfortable at the Zen Center when we recited
              the precept not to become angry. How could we make this vow, knowing
              full well that we would become angry again? And then get angry about
              having transgressed a vow! I also wondered about the teacher's saying
              that there were appropriate, righteous angers not included in the
              vow. What is anger? This was my query, tracing it to its very
              foundation. Why do we get angry? Not making explanations or excuses or
              accusations, but watching directly what is actually taking place. Why
              do we keep on being angry, what maintains the agitated mood after the
              explosion has happened? Does it necessarily have to continue for any
              length of time?</p>
              <p>We may assume that we continue being angry because of a deep
              reservoir of rage established within us over time that can only be
              depleted over time. But I have actually observed that physical
              agitation dissipates amazingly fast if the personalized picture story
              about what has happened to us is clearly seen as story, and is
              understood as the culprit that keeps the anger burning. With
              ever-fresh insight the brain can actually cease composing agitating
              scenarios, abstaining wisely from picturing ourselves as sacrificial
              victims of other peoples' stupidity or meanness. Without clear
              insight, incendiary storylines keep running, fueling the anger time
              and time again.</p>
              <p>With insight we may realize that there exists a tenacious
              attachment to our stories and to the resulting anger. We actually feel
              good in this powerful release, even though remorse may set in when the
              storyline changes: "After this they won't like me anymore!"
              But, it is an ever-amazing discovery that emotions can dissipate when
              the story is seen and ends in the seeing. Some physical sensations may
              linger for a while, but need not become a problem. Watch the stories
              and let them go!  The body has an amazing ability to establish harmony
              when left alone.</p>
              <p>You may be thinking right now, "Aren't there situations in
              which we ought to stand up for what is right, feel outrage against
              exploitation or abuse?" I do not know what we ought to feel,
              ought to do. Establishing <em>oughts </em>and trying to live by them
              doesn't lead to insight into what is. What does happen when we are
              exploited, abused, humiliated, made fun of, or when we see it
              happening to others?</p>
              <p>We have never learned a wise way to deal deeply with this stuff
              because we are so used to either putting up with it, suffering from
              it, fighting it, or exploding over it. Either we continue darkly in
              our conditioned patterns, or there is an awakening of interest in what
              is going on for all of us, the abuser as well as the abused. This has
              nothing to do with sanctioning hurtful behavior, excusing it, or
              allowing it to continue.</p>
              <p>Can we simply behold each other as we are from moment to moment?
              See ourselves, see everyone, as results of millennia old conditioned
              patterns which have rigidly governed our behavior even though we do
              not consciously want it to be so?  Not just an intellectual
              understanding of this, but direct insight into the power of our
              overwhelmingly strong conditioning.  Then, maybe, we can begin to
              question things together and communicate with each other in a new,
              intelligent, and compassionate way. Anger, with its chemical toxins,
              is not conducive to clearly examining and investigating. On the
              contrary, it spells confusion in the mind.</p>
              <p>What is needed is unpolluted looking into what is happening for all
              of us. Out of clear insight comes the energy to act in a clear
              way. Such action is difficult for us because we are so heavily
              conditioned in our patterns of reacting that we are not even cognizant
              of them most of the time. But that is not an immutable state of
              affairs. There can be ever-increasing awareness of how we react and
              how others react to us because of our reactions to them. We are all
              entangled together in chain reactions! Bring them to light! Realize
              that when you talk to someone with an angry demeanor they are likely
              to respond in kind, triggering further irritation in you and, then
              again, you in them, and on and on.</p>
              <p>Most of us are scared of people who are angry, shouting, attacking,
              blaming. Out of fear, we respond angrily ourselves.  This immediately
              touches memories of our childhood, years of helplessness and utter
              dependence on adults who often exploded in incomprehensible ways. Fear
              of angry people makes us not want to be near them it is too upsetting,
              too intimidating. So, turning it around again, can we question, while
              we are angry, whether we are actually upsetting and intimidating other
              people? Maybe we don't really want to upset other people. A moment of
              clarity and insight brings astonishing sensitivity and care.</p>
              <p>As a child I was very scared of my mother's anger, particularly
              when it was vented against my brother or the cook or nanny. I was
              deeply attached to all of them. My brother was often sullen, moody,
              obstinate, and did poorly in his schoolwork. I felt excruciating pain
              every time he was scolded, punished, or humiliated. Later, in my
              teens, I told my mother that I had been afraid of her anger all my
              life. She was visibly shocked. She didn't realize at all that I could
              have felt that way. It obviously did not fit the image she had of
              herself.</p>
              <p>Memories now arise of times when I was not afraid of mother. We
              would sometimes go together into town to do shopping.  We often walked
              quite a distance, and she would hold my hand, and it was such a
              wonderfully happy feeling. Sometimes I would arrange my small hand in
              hers in a special way, and she would go along with it. One time we
              were walking through a department store, passing through many narrow
              isles with merchandise tables left and right, and I felt my mother's
              deep sadness, looking for something she couldn't find.</p>
              <p>Just to complete that story, we visited my parents in Switzerland
              after I was married. One day I saw my mother in the dining room alone,
              looking toward me, and suddenly there was just this beautiful woman
              standing there without any images. So much love in this moment without
              images. No feeling that I had to be anything she may have thought of
              me. It was completely natural.  From that moment on, our relationship

              <p>So, can we have infinite patience with our own anger and the anger
              of others? Can our habitual reactions for or against someone be
              replaced with a wondering awareness that does not know? Can we try to
              understand each other on the deepest level, without images? We are the
              only laboratories for unfolding this understanding anger wells up in
              all of us. Why? Not that it shouldn't, but just WHY? Let it reveal
              itself fully in awareness beyond limitation.</p>

              <h4>Anger</h4>
              <p><em>The following article was adapted from a talk by Toni Packer
              on Day 5 of the September 1998 retreat.</em></p>
              <p>Let's talk about anger. Everyone experiences it at one time or
              another. Can something be done about anger?</p>
              <p>A retreatant reported experiencing lots of energy during
              sittings, mostly generated by feeling angry about the sitting
              itself. Thoughts were running about wasting her time here while
              there was so much work to do at home. "What should I do with all
              this energy? At times I feel like screaming! Is it all right to
              scream?"</p>
              <p>We have all agreed to maintain outward silence during retreats.
              Screams are disturbing. If one really feels like screaming that's
              OK, but maybe one can find a ravine in the woods where it would not
              impact others. But it's a good question, what to do with powerful
              energy like anger. My immediate response to the questioner was,
              "Let it be awareness! Awareness is energy!"</p>
              <p>Years ago a man came to see me before applying for retreat,
              asking if it would be all right to express anger during a meeting.
              I said it was all right. So one day he entered the meeting room
              with a tense, flushed face, asking if he could vent his anger at me
              right then and there. I nodded, and quietly asked: "Have you ever
              looked at it directly?" No answer came just a charged silence. We
              sat wordlessly for what seemed to be an eternity, and then he burst
              out laughing: "It doesn't have to be expressed!" When a powerfully
              driving emotion gives way to simple awareness, it is like a
              miracle. What emerged from awareness wasn't screams, but laughter
              and insight.</p>
              <p>Psychological theories about what to do with anger abound and
              change with time. I do not know if anger should be expressed or
              shouldn't be. The fact is that we do get angry, and it expresses
              itself instantly, verbally as well as non-verbally, throughout the
              body. So what is this anger? Can we go beyond the question, "What
              should I do with it?" and beyond answers like, "I should feel it in
              my body, or I should express it verbally, physically, or I ought to
              control it."</p>
              <p>There is plenty to feel when we're angry. It mobilizes the
              entire organism, mentally and physically no single cell remains
              unaffected. Storylines run wildly, keeping the agitation going. Can
              we feel all these amazing physical and mental manifestations
              without resistance? If resistance is there, then feel it, look at
              it. Don't try to shut it down by telling yourself that it is
              dangerous to experience anger, or try to convince yourself that we
              are wholly justified in what we are feeling. We really don't know.
              Every thought, every judgment about it intensifies confusion and
              agitation! Can simple awareness shed light, create space?</p>
              <p>Trace anger as it is happening! Why am I getting angry? What is
              at the base of it? Can it be irradiated with attention? By looking
              at it, questioning it, observing it in the light of the question,
              what reveals itself is that we function in rigid patterns that do
              not want to be interrupted. Memory structures in the brain and
              throughout the body about how we are, how things ought to be, what
              is right and what is wrong keep us functioning fairly smoothly, but
              when they are interfered with, anger results.</p>
              <p>These memory structures are wired into us from day one. Even an
              infant, who does not yet understand the spoken word, understands
              judgments conveyed by mother's and father's voice, eyes, and touch.
              What brings smiles, warmth, and protection is good, is right, is
              worth repeating over and over again. What brings rejection,
              hardness, sadness, or pain is bad, wrong, must be avoided. So, from
              early on, memory structures solidify organismically about what is
              right and what is wrong to do, to be, to feel, to think, to say.
              Schools, churches, and daily living together reinforce these
              structures. What we want and what has given us pleasure becomes the
              dominating pattern that needs to be maintained, incessantly
              fulfilled, and defended against disturbance.</p>
              <p>When what we want is interfered with or thwarted, or when
              somebody transgresses what is deeply felt to be right, the energy
              that keeps the system intact explodes. "What they did was wrong!!!
              How dare they!" I could see something like this happening in our
              grandchildren. Our little grandson was quite obedient, having
              learned through punishment and reward what his parents felt to be
              right and wrong, what to do and what not to do, and, above all,
              what not to touch. Several years later when his little sister came
              toddling along, playing with the buttons on the stereo that he had
              painfully learned to leave alone, he would get furious with her,
              slapping her little hands. He could not tolerate seeing her do what
              for him had become a rigid pattern of "No!" Anger was the result of
              the disturbance. And so it is with all of us. Observing someone do
              what the brain has encoded as wrong triggers an eruption of energy
              that wants to keep the pattern intact. It feels as though we had
              been personally injured.</p>
              <p>I have been wondering about this for a long time: why do we get
              angry when someone else acts in a "stupid" way? What reveals itself
              upon examination is that we easily feel irritated toward somebody
              who "doesn't get it," like a parent or schoolteacher getting
              exasperated at a child. This sort of anger isn't questioned very
              much it seems justifiable. We feel righteous anger toward those
              whose ways are in collision with our own. Can we question this
              deeply?</p>
              <p>I remember feeling uncomfortable at the Zen Center when we
              recited the precept not to become angry. How could we make this
              vow, knowing full well that we would become angry again? And then
              get angry about having transgressed a vow! I also wondered about
              the teacher's saying that there were appropriate, righteous angers
              not included in the vow. What is anger? This was my query, tracing
              it to its very foundation. Why do we get angry? Not making
              explanations or excuses or accusations, but watching directly what
              is actually taking place. Why do we keep on being angry, what
              maintains the agitated mood after the explosion has happened? Does
              it necessarily have to continue for any length of time?</p>
              <p>We may assume that we continue being angry because of a deep
              reservoir of rage established within us over time that can only be
              depleted over time. But I have actually observed that physical
              agitation dissipates amazingly fast if the personalized picture
              story about what has happened to us is clearly seen as story, and
              is understood as the culprit that keeps the anger burning. With
              ever-fresh insight the brain can actually cease composing agitating
              scenarios, abstaining wisely from picturing ourselves as
              sacrificial victims of other peoples' stupidity or meanness.
              Without clear insight, incendiary storylines keep running, fueling
              the anger time and time again.</p>
              <p>With insight we may realize that there exists a tenacious
              attachment to our stories and to the resulting anger. We actually
              feel good in this powerful release, even though remorse may set in
              when the storyline changes: "After this they won't like me
              anymore!" But, it is an ever-amazing discovery that emotions can
              dissipate when the story is seen and ends in the seeing. Some
              physical sensations may linger for a while, but need not become a
              problem. Watch the stories and let them go! The body has an amazing
              ability to establish harmony when left alone.</p>
              <p>You may be thinking right now, "Aren't there situations in which
              we ought to stand up for what is right, feel outrage against
              exploitation or abuse?" I do not know what we ought to feel, ought
              to do. Establishing <em>oughts</em> and trying to live by them
              doesn't lead to insight into what is. What does happen when we are
              exploited, abused, humiliated, made fun of, or when we see it
              happening to others?</p>
              <p>We have never learned a wise way to deal deeply with this stuff
              because we are so used to either putting up with it, suffering from
              it, fighting it, or exploding over it. Either we continue darkly in
              our conditioned patterns, or there is an awakening of interest in
              what is going on for all of us, the abuser as well as the abused.
              This has nothing to do with sanctioning hurtful behavior, excusing
              it, or allowing it to continue.</p>
              <p>Can we simply behold each other as we are from moment to moment?
              See ourselves, see everyone, as results of millennia old
              conditioned patterns which have rigidly governed our behavior even
              though we do not consciously want it to be so? Not just an
              intellectual understanding of this, but direct insight into the
              power of our overwhelmingly strong conditioning. Then, maybe, we
              can begin to question things together and communicate with each
              other in a new, intelligent, and compassionate way. Anger, with its
              chemical toxins, is not conducive to clearly examining and
              investigating. On the contrary, it spells confusion in the
              mind.</p>
              <p>What is needed is unpolluted looking into what is happening for
              all of us. Out of clear insight comes the energy to act in a clear
              way. Such action is difficult for us because we are so heavily
              conditioned in our patterns of reacting that we are not even
              cognizant of them most of the time. But that is not an immutable
              state of affairs. There can be ever-increasing awareness of how we
              react and how others react to us because of our reactions to them.
              We are all entangled together in chain reactions! Bring them to
              light! Realize that when you talk to someone with an angry demeanor
              they are likely to respond in kind, triggering further irritation
              in you and, then again, you in them, and on and on.</p>
              <p>Most of us are scared of people who are angry, shouting,
              attacking, blaming. Out of fear, we respond angrily ourselves. This
              immediately touches memories of our childhood, years of
              helplessness and utter dependence on adults who often exploded in
              incomprehensible ways. Fear of angry people makes us not want to be
              near them it is too upsetting, too intimidating. So, turning it
              around again, can we question, while we are angry, whether we are
              actually upsetting and intimidating other people? Maybe we don't
              really want to upset other people. A moment of clarity and insight
              brings astonishing sensitivity and care.</p>
              <p>As a child I was very scared of my mother's anger, particularly
              when it was vented against my brother or the cook or nanny. I was
              deeply attached to all of them. My brother was often sullen, moody,
              obstinate, and did poorly in his schoolwork. I felt excruciating
              pain every time he was scolded, punished, or humiliated. Later, in
              my teens, I told my mother that I had been afraid of her anger all
              my life. She was visibly shocked. She didn't realize at all that I
              could have felt that way. It obviously did not fit the image she
              had of herself.</p>
              <p>Memories now arise of times when I was not afraid of mother. We
              would sometimes go together into town to do shopping. We often
              walked quite a distance, and she would hold my hand, and it was
              such a wonderfully happy feeling. Sometimes I would arrange my
              small hand in hers in a special way, and she would go along with
              it. One time we were walking through a department store, passing
              through many narrow isles with merchandise tables left and right,
              and I felt my mother's deep sadness, looking for something she
              couldn't find.</p>
              <p>Just to complete that story, we visited my parents in
              Switzerland after I was married. One day I saw my mother in the
              dining room alone, looking toward me, and suddenly there was just
              this beautiful woman standing there without any images. So much
              love in this moment without images. No feeling that I had to be
              anything she may have thought of me. It was completely natural.
              From that moment on, our relationship changed.</p>
              <p>So, can we have infinite patience with our own anger and the
              anger of others? Can our habitual reactions for or against someone
              be replaced with a wondering awareness that does not know? Can we
              try to understand each other on the deepest level, without images?
              We are the only laboratories for unfolding this understanding anger
              wells up in all of us. Why? Not that it shouldn't, but just WHY?
              Let it reveal itself fully in awareness beyond limitation.</p>

              <p>Questioner: In certain situations in life I feel blocked by a
                                      fear which prevents me from acting. How can I be free from this
                                      obstacle?<br> <br> Jean Klein: First free yourself from the word, the concept, 'fear'.
                                      It is loaded with memory. Face only the perception. Accept the
                                      sensation<br> completely. When the personality who judges and controls is
                                      completely absent, when there is no longer a psychological
                                      relationship with the<br> sensation, it is really welcomed and unfolds. Only in welcoming
                                      without a welcomer can there be real transformation.<br> <br> We are in essence one with all existence; when we truly observe
                                      ourselves there is ultimately no observer, only observation -
                                      awareness.</p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p>“In simple openness which is welcoming you will come to accept
                                      and get to know your negative feelings, desires and fears. Once
                                      welcomed and nondirected attention to these feelings will burn
                                      themselves up, leaving only silence. “</p>

              <p>As I see it, any form of self identification is the cause of suffering. As someone once said, "All views are based on the belief of something as inherently existing, and necessarily lead to suffering because not in accord with reality." Similarly as long as you associate yourself with someone believing that the 'self' is inherently existing, it necessarily leads to suffering because it is not in accord with reality.</p>
              <p>It is not thinking that is a problem, it is identifying and believing in a story of 'me' and 'things' as having some reality/inherency that is a problem. But upon investigation you realise that the 'self' cannot be found, it is a mirage -- they are merely thoughts, and that thought is made of, and is the miraculous activities (å¦™ç”¨) of Buddha-Nature. Like a mirage, it's just made of the same awareness-intelligence-energy (buddha-nature) vibrating into the various forms as thoughts, words appearing on screen, sound of music, everything. But being a mirage it has no inherent existence. It is in essence that awareness-intelligence-energy that is at the same time empty. Luminous-emptiness.</p>
              <p>So, a thought itself is Buddha-Nature. All thoughts and experiences, which are appearances, are the play of Buddha-Nature, but we mistake the mirages/appearances as having some sort of inherent reality. And because we imagine that there is some sort of inherent reality out there, we grasp on them, not realising that all appearances are simply thoughts/experiences arising and vanishing spontaneously according to conditions -- utterly empty of inherent, graspable existence.</p>
              <p>So the moment we <span style="font-size: small;">ç�€ç›¸, that is<strong> </strong></span><span style="font-size: small;">å¦„ and leads to suffering. Means you grasp on appearances, thinking it has some sort of inherent reality.<br></span></p>

              <p>It is like falling asleep and entering the dream state, even though you are sleeping and the dream isn't real but there is ongoing identification and belief in a 'you', 'experiencer' and what is happening in the dream is almost hypnotic -- it blinds us and makes us believe in the story as having some inherent reality -- and there being a 'me' who is seeing 'a monster in front of me' -- and as a result you undergo all sorts of samsaric emotions even in dreams -- fear, happiness, anger, sadness, and so on.</p>
              <p>It operates on a dualistic basis, that you are a separate self who is experiencing unpleasant states or pleasant states. But in reality, there is simply experience, but no separate experiencer. And the experience is empty, simply being thoughts and sensations arising and vanishing according to conditions.</p>
              <p>So liberation is in seeing through the sense that there is a continuous, separate, or special controller, doer, observer, or centerpoint that is "who they are" in a very direct perceptual way that is not merely an intellectual or conceptual understanding. And the sensations that seemed to imply these to be just more sensations arising and vanishing according to conditions as they always have been. And because this is realised, everything is simply spontaneously arising according to conditions -- and self-liberate immediately! Thoughts have no sticking power, it's only when you believe that there is some essence or inherent reality that you grasp on the thought.</p>
              <p>So in this way, in seeing through the reality of a separate self and the inherency/solidity of our experience, the stories of a self are no longer seen to have any reality and so can no longer cause us sufferings. Dispassion arises and there is naturally no more grasping, only spontaneous arising of Dharma.</p>

              <p>The essence of meditation practice in Dzogchen is encapsulated by these four points: <br><br>• When one past thought has ceased and a future thought has not yet arisen, in that gap, in between, isn't there a consciousness of the present moment; fresh, virgin, unaltered by even a hair's breadth of concept, a luminous, naked awareness? -- Well that is what Rigpa is! <br><br>• Yet it doesn't stay in that state forever, because another thought suddenly arises, doesn't it? This is the self radiance of that Rigpa. <br><br>• However if you do not recognize this thought for what it really is, the very instant it arises, then it will turn into just another ordinary thought, as before. This is called the "chain of delusion," and is the root of samsara. <br><br>• If you are able to recognize the true nature of the thought as soon as it arises, and leave it alone without any followup, then whatever thoughts that arise all automatically dissolve back into the vast expanse of Rigpa and are liberated. <br><br><br>____________________________________ <br><br>From <em>The Tibetan Book Of Living And Dying</em> by Sogyal Rinpoche.</p>

              <p>Someone asked me if I coined the term 'intelligence-energy', actually nope.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bob: That separate entity, the belief in that entity or person, has
                          never done a damn thing! It never can and never will. You must realize
                          that you have been lived. That body-mind that you call 'you' is being
                          lived, and it is being lived quite effortlessly. As Christ said, 'Which
                          of you, by taking thought, can add one cubit to his stature?' That
                          separate entity can’t do a bloody thing.</p>
              <p class="quote"><em>Q: What does
                              that mean in terms of choice, conscious free-will, willing choices that
                              people make or don't make? If I'm following you, there isn't anyone who
                              makes the choice.</em></p>
              <p>Bob: No, there isn't. Choices
                              are made, but there is no choice-maker. What seems to be choices are
                              made. Like, you think you will do something, and you turn around doing
                              something else. That is all coming from that pure functioning. But we
                              take delivery of it and believe 'I am the choice-maker' or 'I have got
                              free-will'. But we have just seen that if you look at it closely the
                              thoughts 'I am' or 'I'm this or that' haven't got the power to do any
                              of those things. You haven't even got the power to think that thought,
                              itself. Thinking happens. It is the same with seeing. Seeing is
                              happening right now. What do you have to do to see?</p>
              <p class="quote"><em>Q: Nothing.</em></p>
              <p>Bob:
                              It is spontaneously happening. Be that presence-awareness that is
                              spontaneously happening of itself. It is effortless. If that 'I
                              thought', that image you have about yourself, were running the show,
                              what would be the most important thing you would do?</p>
              <p class="quote"><em>Q: I have got no idea!</em></p>
              <p>Bob:
                              Well, I do! The first thing I would do is make sure I take the next
                              breath, or make sure my heart has got another beat in it. But all those
                              things are happening quite effortlessly. We talk about choices. But if
                              you are the choice maker, why would you ever have an unhappy thought,
                              if you could choose your thoughts? Why would you ever be miserable or
                              sad?</p>
              <p class="quote"><em>Q. So, the intelligence-energy is vibrating into all these different<br> forms.</em></p>
              <p>Bob: Exactly.</p>

                  couldn't care less. We think we are so important, but we are only small
                  in the scheme of things. Looking from out in space down on this earth
                  what would you be? You would be even less than a microbe on someone's
                  face! Yet, because we are here, we give ourselves so much importance.
                  In the scheme of things, life is continually living on life. Life
                  appears in all sorts of forms and shapes. But it is still the same
                  life, the same intelligence-energy. And you are that life.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>As I see it, any form of self identification is the cause of suffering. As someone once said, "All views are based on the belief of something as inherently existing, and necessarily lead to suffering because not in accord with reality." Similarly as long as you associate yourself with someone believing that the 'self' is inherently existing, it necessarily leads to suffering because it is not in accord with reality.</p>
              <p>It is not thinking that is a problem, <span style="color: #0000ff;">it is identifying and believing in a story of 'me' and 'things' as having some reality/inherency that is a problem.</span> But upon investigation you realise that the 'self' cannot be found, it is a mirage -- they are merely thoughts, and that thought is made of, and is the miraculous activities (å¦™ç”¨) of Buddha-Nature. Like a mirage, it's just made of the same awareness-intelligence-energy (buddha-nature) vibrating into the various forms as thoughts, words appearing on screen, sound of music, everything. But being a mirage it has no inherent existence.</p>
              <p>So, a thought itself is Buddha-Nature. All thoughts and experiences, which are appearances, are the play of Buddha-Nature, but we mistake the mirages/appearances as having some sort of inherent reality. And because we imagine that there is some sort of inherent reality out there, we grasp on them, not realising that all appearances are simply thoughts/experiences arising and vanishing spontaneously according to conditions -- utterly empty of inherent, graspable existence.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It is like falling asleep and entering the dream state, even though you are sleeping and the dream isn't real but there is ongoing identification and belief in a 'you', 'experiencer' and what is happening in the dream is almost hypnotic -- it blinds us and makes us believe in the story as having some inherent reality -- and there being a 'me' who is seeing 'a monster in front of me' -- and as a result you undergo all sorts of samsaric emotions even in dreams -- fear, happiness, anger, sadness, and so on.</p>
              <p>It operates on a dualistic basis, that you are a separate self who is experiencing unpleasant states or pleasant states. But in reality, there is simply experience, but no separate experiencer. And the experience is empty, simply being thoughts and sensations arising and vanishing according to conditions.</p>
              <p>So liberation is in seeing through the sense that there is a continuous, separate, or special controller, doer, observer, or centerpoint that is "who they are" in a very direct perceptual way that is not merely an intellectual or conceptual understanding. And the sensations that seemed to imply these to be just more sensations arising and vanishing according to conditions as they always have been. And because this is realised, everything is simply spontaneously arising according to conditions -- and self-liberate immediately! Thoughts have no sticking power, it's only when you believe that there is some essence or inherent reality that you grasp on the thought.</p>
              <p>So in this way, in seeing through the reality of a separate self and the inherency/solidity of our experience, the stories of a self are no longer seen to have any reality and so can no longer cause us sufferings. Dispassion arises and there is naturally no more grasping, only spontaneous arising of Dharma.</p>

              <p>It's not easy. Because our karmic propensities of seeing dualistically and inherently are so deeply rooted, our tendency is to grasp on appearances is always there.</p>
              <p>So we need to be mindful at all times, and I remember mentioning about a lucid nightmare where 'I' overcome the fear in the nightmare itself (dreamt of some ghost or monster coming towards me and a surge of fear suddenly became very very strong -- more than what I probably ever felt) by suddenly becoming aware that the fear is actually a false projection, and I stopped believing in its reality. And because I was becoming so mindful and aware in the dream, even though there is still this tense feeling I was aware that the dream monster was actually my own projection, and I stopped believing in it. I was also aware if I lose my mindfulness and started believing in the seeming reality of the dream, I will return to the nightmare again.</p>
              <p>And I just maintain that bright presence-awareness in the dream itself and also feel whatever feelings and emotions are arising, but I do not project a story, and so I stopped projecting the dream -- so everything disappeared into a white light and I woke up.</p>
              <p>As I pasted in the other post on fear, "Face only the perception." If we can face only that perception without projecting more stories, believing in the reality of the me-story (someone is going to get me, I'm going to get hurt, etc), then that fear can dissolve in its own accord. But there is no attempt to try to push away that feeling, it dissolves on its own accord in its own time.</p>
              <p>Reacting to fear with fear simply perpetuates the belief in the me-story further, and worse, -- now there's 'fear' to fear, or unpleasant feelings that I want to push away -- instead of Facing What Is -- Reality in bare, without mental commentary.</p>

              <p>Yes, in reality you cannot know who you are! Because who you are is not an object that can be grasped (because whatever object grasped or anything that can be observed is by definition not you!), and all belief in a self are simply more thoughts arising about an apparent separate and inherent self... how can it be who you are? How can you be a separate self you believed to be?</p>
              <p>You said 'Don't know mind', and Zen Master Seung Sahn would say, just keep this don't know mind! This don't know mind is at the same time, clear mind. It is not a 'confused' mind. It does not mean you are not aware, in fact 'dont know mind' is clear, and aware. And when we can dissolve that mind completely, that 'me', we can 'be' everything -- table, screen, trees, are just one 'substance'.</p>
              <p>Whenever we think we are something, question it and the thought dissolves back into Reality itself. And the thought itself is a manifestation of that Reality.</p>

              <p>I said who you are cannot be an object of knowledge, but even so there is an undeniable sense of presence-awareness. It's not something 'out there' separate from you (but it is all-pervasive), you can't objectify it and make it an object of knowledge or observation.... but it is a self-evident, self-shining, self-felt Presence. You cannot observe it from the perspective of a separate observer or self. The Presence just Is.</p>
              <p>Is that who you are? In a sense yes but to even form the concept 'I am' is to miss its action. 'I am' sounds like there is a constant being. But that Presence is as much being as it is be-coming, because it is not apart from the transient flow of phenomenality. And it is non-separate, there is no boundary which you can separate the 'you' from the 'not-you' -- it is also the trees, the table, the sounds, the thoughts also. But there is a constant presence-ING. Like the wind blowing, the river flowing, ungraspable, empty, and yet undeniably present.</p>
              <p>Trying to grasp 'me' is like trying to grasp the wind, can it be grasped? No, but nevertheless its Presencing flows.</p>
