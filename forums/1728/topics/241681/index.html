            <div class='col-md body'><strong>faith</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Faith is one of the Eleven Wholesome Dharmas of the One Hundred Dharmas (see entry for latter); it is also one of the Five Faculties (faith, vigor, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom).<br>"Faith is necessary in whatever it is one does. One needs to have a sense of belief, an attitude of faith. First, one needs to have faith in oneself. What kind of faith? One needs to have faith that one certainly can become a Buddha. One has to believe that there is no difference between the Buddha and oneself. Yet that lack of difference is in one's Buddha-nature. Cultivation is still required in order to actually become a Buddha. If one cultivates, one will become a Buddha. In order to do so, one must have an initial belief in this principle.<br><br>"Second, not only is it necessary to believe that one can become a Buddha oneself, but also to believe that all people can become Buddhas. Moreover, not only can all people become Buddhas, one should believe that all living beings have the Buddha-nature and are capable of becoming Buddhas. If one has that kind of faith, then one should begin by following the rules oneself. To follow the rules means to hold the moral precepts. First one holds the precepts, and then one can become a Buddha. One does it oneself and also encourages others to do so as well.<br><br>"Faith must be solid, like a rock, firm and sturdy. Faith shouldn't be like a pile of ashes which seems to have some substance to it but which crumbles at the slightest disturbance. Don't be too soft. One's faith must be strong and solid." (HD 44 45)<br><br>THE IMPORTANCE OF FAITH<br><br>"Faith is the foundation of cultivation of the Way and the mother of merit and virtue, because it is capable of nourishing wholesome roots. The Buddhadharma is like a vast sea; only by faith can it be entered. Therefore, the single word 'faith' is the essence of escape from birth and death and is the wonderful means for returning to the source. It is a precious raft on the stream of affliction, a torch in the dark cave of ignorance, and a guide who leads us out of the path of confusion. It is a compass for those floundering in the waves on the sea of suffering, and a sagely teacher for those in the Three Paths (Arhat, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva) and Eight Difficulties ( ). It is the origin of awakening for the Four Kinds of Creatures born (from wombs, eggs, moisture, and transformation) within the Six Paths (see entry). Faith cannot be ignored. An author of ancient times said, 'If a man has no faith, I do not know what can be made of him.'<br><br>"Once two bhikshus were travelling to see Shakyamuni Buddha, the World-Honored One. As they travelled they became extremely thirsty but could not find any water. As they walked they happened upon a human skull containing water in which some small bugs were swimming, enjoying themselves tremendously. One of the bhikshus picked up the water and offered some to his companion. The companion replied, 'This water contains bugs, and the moral precepts do not permit drinking such water. I would rather die of thirst than to violate the precepts in order to stay alive.' After this incident he died of thirst.<br><br>"When the bhikshu who had drunk the water reached the place where the Buddha was residing, he bowed and said to the Lord, 'Your disciple was travelling in the company of another bhikshu who perished of thirst on the road. I hope the Buddha will be compassionate and rescue him.'<br><br>"The Buddha said to the bhikshu who had drunk the water, 'Because he stringently maintained the moral precepts and was so firm in his faith that he would not violate them even in the face of death, he received the awesome power of the Buddhas and arrived here before you. He has already seen the Buddha and heard the Dharma before you. He is a bhikshu who has true faith in the precepts."

I have a different understanding and I am not sure if others share this understanding.<br><br>When a person is born in pure land, his karma is already <span style="font-style: italic;">pure</span>. While it is true that he "brings his karma" to pure land, he does not bring wholesome or unwholesome karma to pureland. He brings <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pure karma</span> to pure land. <strong>When he is at pure land, he can be forever at pure land and no longer needs to come back to samsara</strong>. The only reason why he would come back to samsara would be to carry out his Bodhisattva vows and save sentient beings.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol7no4d.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol7no4d.htm</a><br><br><strong>All forms are illusions</strong><br>Rebirth in the Pure Land is only possible through pure karma<br><br>The Pure Land School of Buddhism advocates that when people die, they bring with them the karma that they had committed to be reborn in the Western Pure Land. This led to a lively debate on the subject. Some people argued that it means that regardless of the virtuous or evil karma [1] that one has committed, a person only needs to wholeheartedly recite Â“Amitabha BudhhaÂ” to the extent that he resonates with the power of the Amitabha BuddhaÂ’s vow, then he will be reborn in the Western Pure Land.<br><br>On the other hand, others advocated that people must bring with them virtuous karma in order to be reborn in the Western Pure Land, but not when they bring evil karma. Yet, others advocated that a person cannot be reborn in the Western Pure Land as long as he has karma and rebirth in the Pure Land can occur only when all the karma have been eliminated.<br><br>In reality, all people will be reborn according to their karma. The kinds of karma and the corresponding realms of rebirth are as follows:<br><br>* Karma of extreme evil leads one to be reborn in the hell realm<br>* Karma of ignorance and foolishness lead one to be reborn in the animal realm<br>* Karma of superstition leads one to be reborn in the ghosts and deities realm<br>* Blessings of observing the Five Precepts lead one to be reborn in the human realm<br>* Blessings of performing the Ten Virtuous Deeds lead one to be reborn in the heaven realm<br>* Actions or karma from hatred, anger and fighting lead one to be reborn in the asura realm<br><br>These are called Â“rebirth according to oneÂ’s karmaÂ”.<br><br>To be reborn in the Western Pure Land requires pure karma. Besides the pure karma, rebirth in the Western Pure Land is not possible at all with whatever kinds of virtuous and evil karma. Therefore, there is no basis to speak of rebirth in the Western Pure Land and then returning to this Saha world to bear the retribution of the karma that they had committed. Only the Bodhisattava, with the power of his vow, can return to this Saha world.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>[1] karma: A deed or action (either positive or negative; intentional or unintentional) of our thoughts, speech or body and its consequences. These consequences may manifest immediately or at any time in the future. Positive karma will generate pleasant consequences and vice-versa.</blockquote>However, my Master also said regarding this topic that it is possible to change our karma into pure karma. It is said in the sutras that even though one is very sinful and has done many misdeeds can be reborn in pure land, so it is possible even for such person to change their karma. I think it is not very difficult with many expedient means that Buddha provided... and my Master himself has successfully brought many people to be reborn in Pure Land (it is said that all those who died with my Master around gets reborn in Pure Land, while some others get reborn in heaven because they are enticed after seeing the celestial beings). And it is said that chanting Amitabha can purify aeons of karma (if I am not wrong do correct me). Let's not forget that Angulimala can also attain enlightenment and nirvana after killing 999 people.</div>

Besides chanting Amitabha Buddha, what else should one practise?<br><br>Practitioners of the method of chanting the Buddha's name not only recite "Amitabha Buddha", but in addition should also cultivate merits. It is stated in the Amitabha Sutra that rebirth in the Western Pure Land is not possible via conditions that are lacking in virtuous roots, blessings and merits. For instance, when we have practised and perfected the Six Parameters (1. Observing the Precepts, 2. Endurance, 3. Giving, 4. Zeal and Progress, 5. Meditation, and 6. Wisdom), then to be reborn in the Western Pure Land is a simple matter. If you have accomplished a mind that is as pure as the Amitabha Buddha's, then there is no necessity for Amitabha Buddha to come and guide you to the Western Pure Land. At that time you are already a great Bodhisattva. Not only can a great Bodhisattva go the Western Pure Land; he can go to any pure land as he pleases. </blockquote></div>
