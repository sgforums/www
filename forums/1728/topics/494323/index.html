              Strengthening Roots of Buddhism in Australia</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Craig Lewis Buddhistdoor
              Global | 2017-07-13 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Recently
              published data from Australia’s 2016 census offers a revealing insight into the
              country’s rapidly evolving religious landscape, with an encouraging outlook for
              Buddhist communities in the antipodean nation. While overall the data indicated
              a marked shift toward no religious affiliation among the population over the
              last 25 years, the number of people identifying as Buddhists continued to grow
              steadily as the third most common religion in the nation of more than 23
              million.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              number of Australians reporting no religious affiliation rose from 13 per cent
              in 1991 to 30 per cent in 2016, while the number people identifying as
              Christians, the most common religion in Australia, dropped to 52 per cent from
              74 per cent over the same 25-year period. Buddhism, meanwhile, climbed to 2.4
              per cent in 2016, from 0.8 per cent in 1991, while Hinduism increased from 0.3
              per cent to 1.9 per cent, and Islam from 0.9 per cent to 2.6 per cent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">However,
              some Buddhists believe the percentage of practitioners could in fact be higher
              as increasing numbers of Australians practice Buddhism without formally identifying
              with the label. Pairoj Brahma, a former Buddhist monk from Thailand who lives
              on a farm in northern New South Wales where he teaches meditation, observed
              that many Australians who practise Buddhism do not necessarily view themselves
              as religious.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Buddhism
              is growing rapidly in Australia because the core Buddhist teaching is somehow
              suitable to logical thinking and intellectual minds,” Pairoj noted. “You can
              practice mindful living in everyday life without officially calling yourself a
              Buddhist. It’s about cause and effect, not things coming from the air. It's
              about seeing interconnectedness and how things are related to each other.” (ABC
              News)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Although
              the first clear example of a Buddhist settlement in Australia dates back to the
              1850s, Buddhism first began to gain a widespread foothold in the late 1970s,
              largely as a result of immigration from Southeast Asia in the wake of the war
              in Vietnam, but also with the spread to Western countries of Tibetan Buddhism.
              According to 2016 data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Buddhism is
              now the third most popular religion in Australia behind Christianity and Islam,
              with some 563,000 Buddhists in the country of 23.4 million. This number has
              been growing rapidly—doubling between 1996 and 2006. Roughly 75 per cent of
              Australia’s Buddhists are Buddhist families originating from Asia who have
              migrated to Australia in recent decades, with the remaining 25 per cent mostly
              Australian-born Caucasians who identify as Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Australia’s
              numerous Buddhist communities could be witnessed observing an equally diverse
              host of festivals and celebrations over the past weekend. </span></p>

              communities across the country—especially those with ties to Cambodia, Laos,
              and Thailand—gathered to commemorate the first sermon of Shakyamuni Buddha.
              Buddhist monk Phramaha Weraphong Ritchumnong led celebrations in a rural
              community in New South Wales, where Thai Buddhists typically congregates to
              eat, chant, and meditate. “It’s an important day because it was the foundation
              of the core concept of the Buddha’s teaching, cause and effect,” the monk
              explained. (ABC News)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Also
              in New South Wales, another community of Buddhists held a ceremony to mark the
              enlightenment of the bodhisattva Guanyin. “Guanyin is the enlightened being who
              hears the sounds or the cries of the people,” said Nan Tien Temple director
              Reverend Maio You. “Without Guanyin, Buddhists will not have their cries heard
              and their sufferings liberated. It’s a significant day for Buddhists.” (ABC
              News)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Among
              Australia’s Tibetan community, former monk Yeshi Sangpo, his wife Pema Tso, and
              their 17-year-old daughter Yangkyi Sangpo joined other Tibetan Buddhists in
              celebrating the birthday of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Yangkyi, who fled
              China with her family after Yeshi escaped from a police detention center, said
              the celebrations helped Tibetans maintain a connection with their religion and
              culture. “It’s not about individual prayers and stuff, it’s about how we treat
              other people, about how you control your mind,” she said. “You be nice to
              people and be compassionate to people and that’s what we strive to do every
              single day.” (ABC News)</span></p>

              teacher Pairoj emphasized that the diversity of celebrations and observations
              demonstrated underlined that Buddhism is not a one-size-fits-all religion.
              Pairoj, who noted that he generally chose not to participate in Buddhist
              ceremonies, observed: “Nowadays [many] people seem to follow traditions and
              cultures and rituals blindly with no investigation and inquiry, which is the
              opposite of the teachings of the Buddha.” (ABC News)</span></p>
