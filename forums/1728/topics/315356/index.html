                            comprehensive and profound. They recognise and revere the truth of the Buddha-dharma 
                            as soon as they encounter it. However, they face a common dilemma: they 
                            hesitate to take refuge in the Three Treasures because they do not wish 
                            to be vegetarians. For this reason, some ponder at the gate of Buddhism 
                            for a long time and are afraid to take that step forward. Others arrive 
                            at the crossroad of religion, some took the wrong turn and ended up with 
                            some cults or unorthodox ways. They do not realise that it is not easy to 
                            be born a human, and it is even harder to have the opportunity to encounter 
                            the Buddha-dharma. Having been born a human, it is indeed a waste of opportunity 
                            not to embrace Buddhism as it knocks at our door.</span></em></span></td>

                              Buddha-dharma is infinite and there are in reality more than 84,000 Dharma 
                              doors, or methods by which we can embark to learn and practise Buddhism. 
                              Vegetarianism is just one of the many methods. To refrain from killing 
                              is merely a means of assisting us to progress in our cultivation. As a 
                              medicine, meat is permitted in the Buddhist precepts if it is required 
                              to cure a particular sickness. Buddhism cherishes compassion. However, 
                              killing and causing harm to life have their retributions. The world has 
                              no peace as victims and villains engage in a vicious cycle of vengeance 
                              and revenge, culminating in calamities and disasters, and inflicting suffering 
                              and misery across the world. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha understands 
                              the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have accumulated from 
                              aeons of their many past lives. In order to provide sentient beings with 
                              an expedient means of embracing <em><strong><span style="color: #003399;">Buddhism, 
                              those who are not able to convert to a vegetarian diet on a long term 
                              basis are permitted to consume meat provided:</span></strong></em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">(1) That he did not 
                              slaughter the animal personally<br> (2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br> (3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br> (4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br> (5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter <br> <strong><span style="color: #cc0000;"><em><br> </em></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">To 
                              refrain from killing is fundamental to Buddhism. Regardless of life forms, 
                              we must not kill, we must not instruct others to kill, and it must not 
                              be killed for our sake, for example, to celebrate our birthday or because 
                              we were coming to dinner. These are three sources of clean meat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In Confucianism, benevolence 
                              also means to refrain from killing. It is said that heaven has the virtue 
                              of loving life. It cannot bear to witness the loss of life, let alone 
                              eat the flesh of those whose cries in death we have heard. Buddhism advocates 
                              compassion and loving-kindness to all sentient beings, regardless of their 
                              relation to you. It is only appropriate that we do not kill for our livelihood 
                              or for the purpose of celebrating occasions, such as births, birthdays, 
                              funerals or weddings. Meats are no different from the other foodstuffs 
                              purchased from the market if people do not witness the killing or hear 
                              the cries of the animal that is being slaughtered. If a differentiation 
                              between the two kinds of purchases and the taste of the meat do not exist 
                              in the mind, then the guilt is lighter. Together with the three mentioned 
                              earlier, these constitute the five sources of clean meat. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Meat eating however 
                              is a pre-condition to killing. If people refrain from eating meat, there 
                              will be no killing of animals for meat. Sadly, the human race has committed 
                              killings for aeons and is engaged in an endless cycle of vengeance and 
                              revenge over their past lives. For one who is slaughtered for meat in 
                              this life, it is probably because he had done the same to others in the 
                              past. The score is even, no more and no less. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">People who eat meat 
                              from the five clean sources are advised to learn to chant the Buddha's 
                              name and the Buddhist mantras, so as to transfer the merits to those whose 
                              meat they are eating. They should also wish them an early rebirth in the 
                              human realm, to eliminate any thoughts of vengeance, to nurture their 
                              virtuous roots to benefit all sentient beings and together build a peaceful, 
                              caring and blissful pure land in this world. Only when this is promoted 
                              across the entire world, will we be able to eliminate hatred and vengeance, 
                              and enhance a mind of compassion and loving kindness. In this way we will 
                              be able to transform this Saha world into a pure land.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Some people misperceived that one who practices Buddhism must be a vegetarian. So people who cannot stop eating meat misunderstood that they are not ready to learn Buddhism. Please do not think that one must be a vegetarian in order to learn the Dharma. To practice Buddhism and be a vegetarian are two separate issues. To those compassionate Buddhists, vegetarian diet is just a way of manifesting one’s compassion to sentient beings only. And this issue shouldn’t deter others who are non-vegetarians from learning the Dharma. We can take meat if it falls under the 3 conditions as stated below:</span></p>

              <p>In
              frozen meat, the karma of killing is not the same or direct as that of
              the one who is killing the animal himself because such a person is
              accumulating action karma of killing. Demanding the killing is also
              karma, like speech karma. That is why Buddha allowed meat on the 3 or 5
              conditions in which you neither kill, demanded or witnessed the
              killing. The karma is generally lighter.</p>
              <p>Of course by eating or buying meat there is also karma but the karma is not the same as personally killing or causing the suffering of the animal. By eating or buying meat you are creating the karma for allowing the industry to thrive. By killing, you are creating the karma of killing. Thats my understanding.</p>

              <p>In which I replied:</p>
              <p>You did not read his story. This Maha Siddha eats only the parts of
                                  fish which were discarded by the fisherman -- i.e. the organs and lower
                                  part of the fish which nobody eats. He purposely ONLY eats fish-gut
                                  because he want to get rid of his dualistic preconception of attachment
                                  to eating 'pure stuff' or his attachment to only eating things conceived by his judgmental mind as more desirable than the other -- so eating fish gut becomes his practice of
                                  getting rid of his discrimination and attachment. His ultimate aim through eating disgusting things is to realise the One Taste (luminous-emptiness) nature of all appearances, which he achieved later on.</p>
              <p>But he is in this way not at all supporting the killing of
                                  fish, he only ate the unwanted discards left by the fishermen. On the other hand by eating and buying fish we are being the demand and
                                  indirect cause of the killing of the fish -- i.e. causing the industry
                                  to thrive.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>For
                                  the rest of us, who are not even Maha Siddhas, the most appropriate
                                  thing is to become a wholehearted vegetarian and show compassion to all
                                  animals, and not think of excuses such as thinking one can dedicate
                                  merits or chant a mantra to elevate an animal's sufferings. That is
                                  only what Maha Siddhas can do, and even very enlightened people usually
                                  avoid doing that. We are not at that level to be able to deliver these
                                  sentient beings, so it is irresponsible for us to feed on a living
                                  being's body.</p>
              <p>The most important thing all Mahayana and Vajrayana
                                  is Bodhicitta. Without Bodhicitta, one cannot even be a true Mahayana
                                  or Vajrayana practitioner. Developing compassion through avoiding meat
                                  is the first step. Lankavatara Sutra says that eating meat destroys the
                                  seed of compassion. If you are truly compassionate you will not be able
                                  to feed on an living being's body.</p>
              <p>Contrary to the Maha Siddha's
                                  story you gave above, which is that he is trying to overcome his
                                  attachment to preconceived dualistic notions of purity and impurity,
                                  the reason why we eat meat is certainly NOT because we want to
                                  "overcome the judgment and discrimination of purity", but because we are
                                  completely attached to the taste of sentient being's body. There is
                                  totally no other reasons why most of us would want to eat meat, other
                                  than to satisfy short term desire for the taste of a sentient being's
                                  body, which is due to a complete lack of compassion. Vegetarian diets
                                  are suitable and even healthier for most people out there, most of us
                                  are certainly not even eating meat for 'medicinal purposes'. So it is
                                  completely wrong to use the Maha Siddha's story out of context.</p>
              <p>I shall not say too much otherwise I will be hypocrite, because
                                  I am not full vegetarian yet. But I think being a vegetarian is
                                  certainly good to aspire for. I hope to become a vegetarian some day.</p>

              <p>In which I replied:</p>
              <p>You did not read his story. This Maha Siddha eats only the parts of fish which were discarded by the fisherman -- i.e. the organs and lower part of the fish which nobody eats. He purposely ONLY eats fish-gut because he want to get rid of his dualistic preconception of attachment to eating 'pure stuff' or his attachment to only eating things conceived by his judgmental mind as more desirable than the other -- so eating fish gut becomes his practice of getting rid of his discrimination and attachment. His ultimate aim through eating disgusting things is to realise the One Taste (luminous-emptiness) nature of all appearances, which he achieved later on.</p>
              <p>But he is in this way not at all supporting the killing of fish, he only ate the unwanted discards left by the fishermen. On the other hand by eating and buying fish we are being the demand and indirect cause of the killing of the fish -- i.e. causing the industry to thrive.</p>

              <p>For the rest of us, who are not even Maha Siddhas, the most appropriate thing is to become a wholehearted vegetarian and show compassion to all animals, and not think of excuses such as thinking one can dedicate merits or chant a mantra to elevate an animal's sufferings. That is only what Maha Siddhas can do, and even very enlightened people usually avoid doing that. We are not at that level to be able to deliver these sentient beings, so it is irresponsible for us to feed on a living being's body.</p>
              <p>The most important thing all Mahayana and Vajrayana is Bodhicitta. Without Bodhicitta, one cannot even be a true Mahayana or Vajrayana practitioner. Developing compassion through avoiding meat is the first step. Lankavatara Sutra says that eating meat destroys the seed of compassion. If you are truly compassionate you will not be able to feed on an living being's body.</p>

              <p><br>So very well said.</p>
              <p>As buddhists we should try to eat less meat, even if it is not easy to give up such attachment to taste. Go slowly at your own pace, eat one piece/slice/chunk/portion less from your normal intake.</p>
              <p>And frankly speaking, it is actually not that difficult after a while. Anybody can do it.  I realise that after reducing meat consumption, our preference for taste changes; in which one may build a very natural instinct to avoid meat, as natural as one would avoid eating cow dung, or as in one would move away his hand when torched by a flame. This was my initial reaction towards meat, like a child who refuses to eat his greens, they just taste bad. And after some time of viualisation of where and how these meat of sentient beings became food on our dinning table, the feeling of compassion arises naturally. It is not easy to go back to consuming meat again.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think there are many ppl out there who feel the same, or have similar reactions as mine. It's just that they are afriad to say it for fear of being labelled a hypocrite or religion fanatics. </p>

              <p>In frozen meat, the karma of killing is not the same or direct as that of the one who is killing the animal himself because such a person is accumulating action karma of killing. Demanding the killing is also karma, like speech karma. That is why Buddha allowed meat on the 3 or 5 conditions in which you neither kill, demanded or witnessed the killing. The karma is generally lighter.</p>
              <p>Of course by eating or buying meat there is also karma but the karma is not the same as personally killing or causing the suffering of the animal. By eating or buying meat you are creating the karma for allowing the industry to thrive. By killing, you are creating the karma of killing. Thats my understanding.</p>
