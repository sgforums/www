(Lost Years &amp; Last Years)</a>). If we look into the mystical/higher teachings.. i.e Gospel of Thomas and other mystical teachings, we find even more similarities. Apart from the 'higher teachings', Jesus taught many teachings as 'skillful means' as well due to the conditions of the people at that time, most teachings are only up to the level of doing good. Enlightened people however will be able to see the deeper essence of Jesus's teachings. Jesus's greatest virtue is in 'Xi2 She3'.. means something like sacrificing all he has for others. A lot of his teachings is about this. However to learn from Jesus's bodhisattva kind of spirit and attain enlightenment, it is through practising Buddhism that we can accomplish all these. (And anyway I believe Jesus had practised Buddhism in his lifetime as well)<br><br>Lao Tzu is similar case. Lao Tzu taught Tao Te Ching which is about "Qing Jing Wu Wei".. a few other Taoist practitioners followed his original teachings, including Chuang Tzu (Lao Tzu's disciple).. who I believe is also highly awakened (although not the Buddhist level of awakening). Lao Tzu may be the only awakened person in the entire Taoist lineage.<br><br>The problem with Taoism is that a lot of superstitious elements is added in, Taoism is not just about Lao Tzu but a full host of alchemy, magical, mediumship practises, and deity worshipping, that has nothing to do with Lao Tzu's teachings. All these things are going after worldly benefit, nothing to do with liberation. Therefore my general advise is to avoid those practises that do not lead to liberation.<br><br>One virtue of most religions is that they teach about avoiding evil and doing all good. But these religions generally lack the part about 'purifying the mind'. So it is through practising Buddhism that we can attain liberation.</div>

In any fact, they are not liberated, just pyschotically out of whack. (Aka the infamous mental paradigm shift)</blockquote>Just a rough number, at the times of Buddha, there are at least a few thousand Arhats (i.e 4th stage of arhatship) and many more who attained 1st, 2nd, 3rd stage of arhatship, in many instance 1250 fully liberated arhats were present at a single assembly, and at the time of the first council a few weeks after Buddha's parinirvana, there were 500 arhats present to hear and witness the recitation of Buddha's teachings. During Buddha's times alone there were several thousand liberated beings, after that there are a lot more. Even today, there are a lot of enlightened practitioners and teachers. Just that you didn't quite open your eyes, and choose to "be the frog that stays in the well", and choose to be in refusal to hear the teachings of the Buddha and practise the teachings of the Buddha.<br><br>It is also very absurd to say that liberated persons are psychotically out of whack. There is nothing at all which suggests and proves that enlightened people are psychotically out of whack. This is the worse kind of assumptions and slander, due to your long held dogmas, you are unable to accept the fact that there are enlightened beings in the world.<br><br><blockquote>I have been reading sutras and treatises but definitely I would say any religion is just more problems than it is worth.</blockquote>More assumptions.<br><br>Countless Buddhists can testify that their practise has helped them a lot in life.<br></div>
