              <p>I find it hard to share it with people... because it doesn't

              that letting go is a symptom of being unmotivated in life,
              work.What i am trying to say is that, happy things just come and
              go... It cannot last and becomes very "empty", nothing much to look
              forward to. (&lt;---my views)</p>

              Letting go is simply a way for you to let go of something you hold so tightly in your life because you make it like your own life. Without it you technically speaking, you will "DIE" and simply unable to move on to the future. You should let go and by letting go you will see greater and happier things in your life as you move on to your next stage in life......its like growing up from the day you are born until your sojourn on earth ends.

              The text below was extracted from the book "A Path With Heart", written by Jack Kornfield. I discovered this book in April 2004 at the library and I found it very loving and compassionate. Thanks Jack. You are a good writer.
                      
              "An old Chinese Zen monk who, after many years of peaceful meditation, realized he was not really enlightened. He went to the master and said, "Please, may I go find a hut at the top of the mountain and stay there until I finish this practice?" The master, knowing he was ripe, gave his permission. On the way up the mountain the monk met an old man walking down, carrying a big bundle. The old man asked, "Where are you going, monk?" The monk answered, "I'm going to the top of the mountain to sit and either get enlightened or die." Since the old man looked very wise, the monk was moved to ask him, "Say, old man, do you know anything of this enlightenment?" The old man, who was really the Bodhisattva Manjusri - said to appear to people when they are ready for enlightenment - let go of his bundle, and it dropped to the ground. As in all good Zen stories, in that moment the monk was enlightened. "You mean it is that simple; just to let go and not grasp anything!" Then the newly enlightened monk looked back at the old man and asked, "So now what?" In answer, the old man reached down and picked up the bundle again and walked off toward town."

              I never heard of Prophet Muhammad saying that in the quotation book of his written by his follower...where you get that? Anyway, my interpretation of a close mind is like ......A stagnant stream. When a stream is stagnant and there is no constant flow of fresh water, it will become dirty. Whereas the unstagnant stream that have constant flow of fresh water, it is clear of debris and the water is clean.

              <p>The text below was extracted from the book “A Path With Heart”,
              written by Jack Kornfield. I discovered this book in April 2004 at
              the library and I found it very loving and compassionate. Thanks
              Jack. You are a good writer.</p>
              <p>“An old Chinese Zen monk who, after many years of peaceful
              meditation, realized he was not really enlightened. He went to the
              master and said, “Please, may I go find a hut at the top of the
              mountain and stay there until I finish this practice?” The master,
              knowing he was ripe, gave his permission. On the way up the
              mountain the monk met an old man walking down, carrying a big
              bundle. The old man asked, “Where are you going, monk?” The monk
              answered, “I’m going to the top of the mountain to sit and either
              get enlightened or die.” Since the old man looked very wise, the
              monk was moved to ask him, “Say, old man, do you know anything of
              this enlightenment?” The old man, who was really the Bodhisattva
              Manjusri – said to appear to people when they are ready for
              enlightenment – let go of his bundle, and it dropped to the ground.
              As in all good Zen stories, in that moment the monk was
              enlightened. “You mean it is that simple; just to let go and not
              grasp anything!” Then the newly enlightened monk looked back at the
              old man and asked, “So now what?” In answer, the old man reached
              down and picked up the bundle again and walked off toward
              town.”</p>

              Ah...I see. How about doing something good for those in need of your help. Like visiting the orphanage and see how your feelings like after visiting them.
