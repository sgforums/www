He is the first 'documented' pilgrim in Indian
              history. According to local inscriptions, he travelled from Sri Lanka in the
              1st century BCE, to Bodhgaya, in Bihar, located a 100 kilometres from modern
              Patna, to see the famous bodhi or pipal tree under which Buddha got his
              enlightenment. Of course, during his visit, he would not have seen the 180 feet
              tall pyramidal Mahabodhi temple, full of images of Buddha, Bodhisattvas, fierce
              gods and goddesses such as Yamantaka and Vajravarahi who are part of later
              Mahayana and Tantrik Buddhism. This brick structure was built only five hundred
              years after his visit, in Gupta times.<span> </span><br> <br> Today when we visit Bodhgaya as part of the Buddhist tourist trail and
              encounter people from China and Japan and Korea and Thailand, and Europe, and
              America, we assume this pilgrim spot was always there, since 2,500 years ago,
              when Siddhartha Gautama of the Sakya clan attained enlightenment here. But that
              is not so. In fact in the early 19th century, no one in India had any idea
              about Buddhism. Buddha, at best, was an avatar of Vishnu mentioned in some
              Puranas. The Mahabodhi temple and the lands around had been since 16th century
              under the control of a Hindu mahant.<span> </span><br> <br> It was British historians and archaeologists who played a key role in the
              re-discovery of Buddhism. Sir Edwin Arnold wrote the Light of Asia that told
              the story of Buddha's enlightenment. Sir Alexander Cunningham played a key role
              in identifying the Buddhist nature of the dilapidated structures in Bodhgaya.
              And Anagarika Dharmapala of Sri Lanka played a key role in restoring the site
              to his glory. He initiated a legal process to enable Buddhists to reclaim the
              site in the late 19th century. He died in 1933 and it is only in 1949 that the
              Government of India, acknowledged it as a Buddhist shrine. Over the years,
              there are claims and counter claims in matters of its administration, with some
              Hindus claiming it is also a Hindu shrine, though increasingly the management
              is being given to Buddhists, not just those from India, but from all over the
              world. Now Bodhgaya is a UNESCO World heritage site.<span> </span><br> <br> Two thousand five hundred years ago, when Siddhartha, a Nepalese prince of the
              Sakya clan, from Kapilavastu, came to this region he described it thus,
              "There I saw a beautiful stretch of countryside, a beautiful grove, a
              clear flowing river, a lovely ford and a village nearby for support. And I
              thought to myself, 'Indeed, this is a good place for a young man set on
              striving.'" Nearby was the village of Uruvela on the banks of the
              Neranjara (Phalgu) river. Later this village was reamed as Sambodhi, Mahabodhi,
              and finally, by the 18th century, as Bodhgaya.<span> </span><br> <br> The prince was determined to discover the cause of suffering. He had lived a
              sheltered life, and only after marriage had he encountered death, disease and
              old age. Traumatised, he had left his wife and newborn son, and spent years
              wandering in the forests, meeting sages and hermits, as a seeker. He came to be
              known as the ascetic Gotama. They told him that fasting was a way of gaining
              wisdom. So the prince stopped eating and drinking until he was too weak to even
              walk. That is when a lady called Sujata gave him some milk and honey, revived
              his health. A few days later, after deep meditation under the peepal tree,
              awareness dawned. He suddenly 'woke up' in realisation. He had become the
              Buddha.<span> </span><br> <br> Based on local legend, and the architecture of the Mahabodhi temple, we are
              told that after enlightenment, Buddha sat under the tree for a week. Then stood
              before the tree staring unblinkingly at it for a week. Then he paced up and
              down, eighteen times, along a path where lotus flowers bloomed. Then sat under
              nearby trees, meeting local sages, priests and merchants, who fed him, and
              heard what he had to say. In the seventh week he sat near a pond and was
              protected by the hood of Vasuki, king of serpents, during a thunderstorm. Today
              there are shrines to mark all these places.<span> </span><br> <br> Ashoka visited this site in the 3rd century BCE and established the Vajrasana,
              or the diamond seat. One of Ashoka's wives became so jealous of the king's
              fondness for the Buddhist religion that she had the holy tree poisoned or cut.
              Luckily, Ashoka's daughter, Sanghamitra, had taken a sapling of this tree to
              Sri Lanka and so sent a sapling back to be replanted here. Today, there are
              sandstone railings around this tree dated to 100 BCE with images of the sun-god
              Surya, and wealth-goddess Lakshmi, even images of centaurs and flying horses, suggesting
              Greek influence, and granite railings dated to 300 CE with images of eagles and
              lotus flowers. The temple was built around 1500 years ago, periodically
              restored by local kings, including the Burmese king in the 19th century and
              finally the British archeological society. Today the upper portion of the
              temple is gold plated thanks to generous donation by the king of Thailand. For
              centuries Bodhgaya was visited by monks and royalty from Sri Lanka, Tibet,
              Kazhakistan, Cambodia, Vietnam, and China, where Buddhism spread, and their
              records speak of how the temple housed an image of Buddha that was carved in
              the very likeness of Buddha. (The image currently enshrined is dated to 10th
              century and was placed at this site by Alexander Cunningham, the British
              archeologist who played a key role restoring the site; he found the image in
              the ruins). Sri Lankan kings build a monastery here to house pilgrims in the
              4th century. But in the 13th century, the shrine was desecrated by Muslim
              marauders, and despite attempts of Pala kings of Bengal to revive it, it
              eventually was forgotten. But as the Buddha said, not everything lasts forever.
              And now the memory of this ancient way of life has been given a new life,
              restored to much of its former glory.</span></p>
