            <div class='col-md body'>i donno the answer but i can share with you what i believe in..Fate is changeable if you believe..eg.if one is fated to be fat..but if one work hard to loss weight then i considered tha as changing fate..Some people may argued that losing weight is also fated...I don believed that Working hard and believing in yourself is the best so fated or not depends on yourself..So sucks it up and work hard.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by needhelp1234:</div><div class="quote_body">can fate/karma be changed?</div></blockquote>There is no such thing as fate... is only karma. And yes, karma can be changed, if you think you have done something wrong, you can repent, do virtuous deeds, etc, and this will help overcome the karma. Chanting also helps...<br><br>In the Mahayana tradition... it is actually possible to pray to the Buddhas and bodhisattvas for help. I'll summarise a little on what my dharma teacher said about this. This is called Skillful Means, and the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is able to help in certain cases. It really depends on your situation... and what you pray for must be of right intentions, what you pray for must not contradict the dharma. For example if you pray to win big bucks from toto or gambling then of course you won't find that praying is helpful. Instead, the more you pray, the more you won't win. If say you are in financial crisis and you have a family to feed.. you really need money, and if you chant Namo Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa very often, very regularly, and pray for changes.. then you might indeed see a change of events.<br><br>However, it may not work in all cases. Because still it is your karma. The Buddhas/bodhisattvas can only help you have 'access' to these wholesome, virtuous seeds. So let's say you have $100 in your bank, if you are in crisis and you need some money, you pray to the Buddhas/bodhisattvas you may get some money from your bank (i.e the 8th consciousness, alaya consciousness). But if the money is used up (i.e the karma is used up) then even if you pray to Buddha/bodhisattva, they cannot help you.<br><br>So if you really didn't see much changes then perhaps it is because you do not have enough good karma. So it is important also, to be wholesome, do virtuous things, avoid unwholesome actions/speech/thoughts, this is to accumulate blessings. But that is not enough of course... because there is a saying by Buddha in accordance to a true story.. if you cultivate blessings and not wisdom, you will be reborn as a royal elephant (good karma but ignorant), and if you cultivate wisdom only but not blessings, even after you become Arhat (liberated person who attained Nirvana), the lay people do not give you alms to eat. So, meaning even if you are enlightened, on the material side you are poor.<br><br>But.. still for one who has wisdom, he completely every moment as it is, irregardless of the life situation around him. He is unaffected.. peaceful.. calm.. and joyful at all times. Therefore dharma practise is important, it allows us to be liberated and at peace, happy at all times.<br><br>p.s what kind of "fate" do you want to be changed? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

In fact, cenarious rightly said, that Buddha said that fortune telling is a 'lowly art'.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Whereas some religious men, while living offfood provided by the faithful make their living by such low artsj, such wrong means of livelihood as palmisti~ divining by signs, mtezpretmg dreams bringing good or bad lucky. invoking the goddess of luck...picking the lucky site for a building, the monk Gotazna refrains from such low art.s, such wrong means of livelihoodÂ” " ~ Buddha</span><br><br>But whether you want to seek a fortune teller is your own personal choice, I feel it is neither right or wrong. But very often people take what is being said by the fortune teller too seriously. If fortune teller say you are going to die in car accident 5 years from now, then how?<br><br>I have also went to fortune teller before out of curiosity. But I never take what is said too seriously (even though the report was quite good <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">). Life is too short to take it too seriously. If we are so serious about everything then how can we live our life happily and in peace? Even if the future is known to us, how can we stay in the present? If you want to make changes, make changes in the present. In reality, time is an illusion, only the eternally present Present is real.<br><br>My master says, if you know the dharma, your fate can change altogether. So know the dharma, practise the dharma. There is no need to seek anything else.</div>
