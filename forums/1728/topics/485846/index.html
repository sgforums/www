                                  busy summer. As God only knows, he was summoned to slaughter in the Holy Land,
                                  asked to end the killings of Muslims by Buddhist monks in Myanmar, and played
                                  both sides again in the 1,400-year-old dispute over the rightful successor to
                                  the Prophet Muhammad. </span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">In between,
                                  not much down time. Yes, the World Cup was fun, and God chose to mess with His
                                  Holinesses, pitting the team from Pope Francis’s Argentina against Germany,
                                  home of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. Well played, even if the better pope lost.</span></p>
              <p id="story-continues-2" class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">At
                                  least Rick Perry was not his usual time-suck. The governor proclaimed three
                                  days of prayer to end the Texas drought in 2011, saying, “I think it’s time for
                                  us to just hand it over to God, and say, ‘God: You’re going to have to fix
                                  this.’ ” The drought got worse. Two years ago, Perry said that God had not
                                  “changed his mind” about same-sex marriage. But the states have. Since Perry
                                  became a spokesman for the deity, the map of legalized gay marriage in America
                                  has expanded by 50 percent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">Still,
                                  these are pillow feathers in a world weighted down with misery. God is on a
                                  rampage in 2014, a bit like the Old Testament scourge who gave direct
                                  instructions to people to kill one another.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">It’s not
                                  true that all wars are fought in the name of religion, as some atheists assert.
                                  Of 1,723 armed conflicts documented in the three-volume “Encyclopedia of Wars,”
                                  only 123, or less than 7 percent, involved a religious cause. Hitler’s
                                  genocide, Stalin’s bloody purges and Pol Pot’s mass murders certainly make the
                                  case that state-sanctioned killings do not need the invocation of a higher
                                  power to succeed.</span></p>

                                  year, the ancient struggle of My God versus Your God is at the root of dozens
                                  of atrocities, giving pause to the optimists among us (myself included) who
                                  believe that while the arc of enlightenment is long, it still bends toward the
                                  better. </span></p>

                                  of God and hate, Sunnis are killing Shiites in Iraq, and vice versa. A jihadist
                                  militia, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, boasts of beheading other Muslims
                                  while ordering women to essentially live in caves, faces covered, minds closed.
                                  The two sides of a single faith have been sorting it out in that blood-caked
                                  land, with long periods of peace, since the year 632. Don’t expect it to end
                                  soon. A majority of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims are peaceful, but a Pew
                                  Survey found that 40 percent of Sunnis do not think Shiites are proper Muslims.</span></p>
              <p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Elsewhere,
                                  a handful of failed states are seeing carnage over some variant of the
                                  seventh-century dispute. And the rage that moved Hamas to lob rockets on
                                  birthday parties in Tel Aviv, and Israelis to kill children playing soccer on
                                  the beach in Gaza, has its roots in the spiritual superiority of extremists on
                                  both sides.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">The most
                                  horrific of the religion-inspired zealots may be Boko Haram in Nigeria. As is
                                  well known thanks to a feel-good and largely useless Twitter campaign, 250
                                  girls were kidnapped by these gangsters for the crime of attending school. Boko
                                  Haram’s God tells them to sell the girls into slavery.</span></p>

                                  intra-religious fights are not to be confused with people who fly airplanes
                                  into buildings, or shoot up innocents while shouting “God is great.” But those
                                  killers most assuredly believed that their reward for murder is heaven. </span></p>

                                  late, God has taken a long break from Ireland, such a small country for such a
                                  big fight between worshipers under the same cross. There, the animus is not so
                                  much theological as it is historical. If the curious Muslim is wondering why
                                  Protestants and Catholics can’t just get along on that lovely island, take a
                                  look at the Thirty Years’ War of the 17th century, when about 20 percent of the
                                  population of present-day Germany fell to clashes between the two branches of
                                  Christianity.</span></p>

                                  Buddhist mobs (yes, it sounds oxymoronic) are responsible for a spate of recent
                                  attacks against Muslims in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, leaving more than 200 dead
                                  and close to 150,000 homeless. The clashes prompted the Dalai Lama to make an
                                  urgent appeal to end the bloodshed. “Buddha preaches love and compassion,” he
                                  said.</span></p>

The problem is that people of faith often become fanatics of faith. Reason and force are useless against aspiring martyrs. </span></p>

                                  United States, God is on the currency. By brilliant design, though, he is not
                                  mentioned in the Constitution. The founders were explicit: This country would
                                  never formally align God with one political party, or allow someone to use
                                  religion to ignore civil laws. At least that was the intent. In this summer of
                                  the violent God, five justices on the Supreme Court seem to feel otherwise. </span></p>
