              <p>Sounds interesting :)</p>
              <p>Prior to the realisation of non-duality and emptiness, one's mind will hold on to all sorts of dualistic and views of inherency.</p>
              <p>Lankavatara Sutra is really a good Sutra. It's also our moderator Thusness's favourite Sutra. He did a 2.5 hours discussion with us last year. But it should be noted that it is just a casual discussion of one's experience with the sutra, not meant to be a commentary. I wrote down the transcript in the forum. <a href="/forums/1728/topics/262408">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/262408</a></p>

              <p>the lankavatara sutra u mentioned means æ¥žä¼½ç»�, is it ?</p>
              <p>And i do enjoy it, in fact i buy it because i mistakably see it as æ¥žä¸¥ç»�, interpreted by å�—æ€€ç‘¾. But i think it's more interesting, lankavatara if i'm not wrong , is the fundanmental sutra for zen, but later ppl found a diamond sutra more readable, and forget the deep and difficult lankavatara sutra, but the sutra was very comprehensive, and deep, hope everyone will read it, then they will acheive åŠŸå¾·</p>

              <p>Thats right, æ¥žä¼½ç»� = Lankavatara Sutra. It was the only sutra that Bodhidharma brought to China, the only sutra that Bodhidharma asked his students to study.</p>
              <p>æ¥žä¸¥ç»� = Shurangama Sutra. Also a great sutra, though I have only yet read the 1st Chapter and a few other parts.</p>

              <p>About the Meditation, Rokkie is refering to the Fifty Skhanda Demon States. That is why having an enlightened person to guide a practitioner is important.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">The Fifty Skandha-Demon States:</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">A Simple Explanation by the Venerable Master Hsüan
                      Hua.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">The Shurangama Sutra, Volume VIII</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">"Foreword"</span></strong> <br><strong>By</strong> <br><strong>Ron Epstein</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p>For over a thousand years the Shurangama Sutra has been held in great
                      esteem in the Mahayana countries of East Asia. In China the Sutra was ranked
                      in popularity and importance with the Lotus, Avatamsaka, and Prajna Paramita
                      Sutras; it was also accorded imperial favor.</p>
              <p>One major reason for the importance of the Sutra is its final section,
                      presented in this volume, on fifty deviant mental states associated with
                      the Five Skandhas; ten states are described for each of the skandhas. For
                      each state a description is given of the mental phenomena experienced by
                      the practitioner, the causes of the phenomena and the difficulties which
                      arise from attachment to the phenomena and misinterpretation of them. In
                      essence what is presented is both a unique method of cataloging and classifying
                      spiritual experience and indication of causal factors involved in the experience
                      of the phenomena. Although the fifty states presented are by no means exhaustive,
                      the approach taken has the potential of offering a framework for the classification
                      of all spiritual experience, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist.</p>
              <p>An important causal theme of the Sutra that reaches its full development
                      in this section is the relations of the experience of the demonic states with the failure
                      to observe the guidelines of the moral precepts. Thus we find a link between
                      this particular section and the Aiding Practices of the Bodhimanda described
                      in volume six. There the elimination of lust, killing, stealing and false
                      speech is presented as a prerequisite for correct meditational progress.
                      In this volume the consequences of the failure to completely eliminate
                      them are presented in terms of wrong views and encounters with demonic
                      states, both internal and external.</p>
              <p>The Sutras are particularly clear and graphic exposure of wrong practice,
                      wrong views, the wrong use of spiritual powers, and the deceptions of deviant
                      spiritual teachers is probably one of the major factors involved in the
                      perennial attacks on its authenticity. It is clear that the types of people
                      it criticizes have certainly been threatened by it, and in order to preserve
                      their own authority and views have attacked the Sutra. Unfortunately this
                      primary motivation for discrediting the Sutra has been ignored by the modern
                      Buddhist scholarly community. It is not, however, difficult to see why
                      this is the case.</p>
              <p>To examine this dimension of discourse would mean plunging into the
                      "subjective" realm of values, that is, the Dharmic evaluation of the correctness
                      of various historical schools and trends. For example, not in this volume
                      but in the above mentioned one, the Buddha proclaims:</p>
              <blockquote>How can thieves put on my robes and sell the Thus Come One,
                      saying that all manners of karma one creates is just the Buddhadharma? They
                      slander those who have left the home-life and regard Bhikshus who have
                      taken the complete precepts as belonging to the path of the Small Vehicle.
                      Because of such doubts and misjudgments, limitless beings fall into the
                      unintermittent hell. (Volume 6, p. 37)</blockquote>
              <p>Students of Buddhist history will have no difficulty identifying those
                      for who such a statement would be extremely uncomfortable. The present
                      volume profiles in vivid details deviant experiences, claims and behaviors
                      on the part of so-called Buddhist teachers in such a way as to make it
                      an embarrassment and threat to many, including both historical and contemporary
                      figures.</p>
              <p>This volume of the Sutra cannot be dismissed as a narrow sectarian document.
                      Its classification of non-Buddhist Indian religious traditions, through
                      its framework of interpretation of meditational states, attributes to many
                      of their founders very high states of consciousness and accords them unusual
                      respect.</p>
              <p>The primary importance of this volume is as a unique and intensely valuable
                      guide for Buddhist practitioners. Herein lies the value of the commentary
                      of the Venerable Master Hsüan Hua, which accompanies the Sutra text.
                      His erudition, Wisdom and personal experience help both to bring to life
                      the text and to illuminate its practical use and current relevance.</p>
              <p>One cannot underestimate the importance of the publication of this section
                      of the Sutra with the accompanying commentary. It is an excellent resource
                      for the English-speaking Buddhist world in the quest for proper understanding
                      of Buddhism. Careful study of it will lead to greater insight into one's
                      spiritual experiences and those of others. It is also an invaluable aid
                      to avoiding the pitfalls of association with false gurus and so-called
                      spiritual masters, many of whom have achieve great prominence in the contemporary
                      spiritual scene.</p>

              <p>BTW meditation is not dangerous. The danger is when some meditation experience comes, you become attached, you think you're enlightened and so on. When you're not. Or actually, the true danger (demon) is any kind of grasping. We all live in the state of grasping, so we are living in a very 'dangerous' state of mind. And if we are desperate, we can kill others for our selfish reasons, to preserve our body... that is how attached we are. Meditation can actually help to reduce and eventually remove this attachment through the proper method of developing insights into the nature of consciousness... provided you cultivate/practice properly. Otherwise you simply bring your grasping into meditation.</p>
              <p>First of all, we have to understand that all states and experiences (å¢ƒç•Œ) are merely the congregation of various causes and conditions, the congregation of the 18 dhatus. They are dependently arisen, illusory and empty appearances. (ä¸€åˆ‡å¢ƒç•Œéƒ½ä¸�ç¦»<span style="color: #cc0033;">å��å…«ç•Œ</span>, éƒ½æ˜¯ç¼˜èµ·æ€§ç©º, å› ç¼˜å�ˆå’Œçš„å�‡ç›¸) To grasp or abide on ANY appearance, experience, or states, is to grasp onto illusions. To realise enlightenment is to realise that all states, and experiences, i.e. All 18 Dhatus, are empty. Be careful not to grasp or seek any experiences, whether in meditation or in daily living.</p>
              <p>Daily living is probably more dangerous than meditation when there is attachment to <em>skhandas</em>. (form, feeling, perception, volition, consciousness) When there is attachment, we can cause mental, emotional, physical harm to both ourselves and others in the "real world".</p>
              <p>If there is a single attachment to the experiences of skhandas, realisation of our true nature cannot occur. That is why they are called 'Demons'.</p>
              <p>We have to have the right understanding not to seek anything external to Mind, our True Mind. If we seek anything external to Mind, we are externalist. (å¿ƒå¤–æ±‚æ³•æ˜¯å¤–é�“) In reality there is nothing external/outside Mind, so to seek/search/look for anything at all is to seek illusions. Drop all that, turn inwards, and listen to the listening, be aware of the awaring. (And actually this awaring is all there is... and even if thoughts of past and future, projections of external world arises, it is awareness appearing as the presently arising thought. Awareness is appearing as everything, from what we see and feel to what we think. But we are so lost in the seeming 'reality' of our I-me-mine-projections that we couldn't see that this arising thought is simply a fleeting, dream-like appearance of Presence.)</p>
              <p>When we practice, the only thing we should be concerned about is our True Nature, our True Mind. And we should <strong>undistractedly</strong> remain in that awareness [of our natural state]. This is called å��é—»é—»è‡ªæ€§. Turn the [outward] perceiving/seeking around to perceive our true nature.</p>
              <p><em>Â“All you who listen here should turn inward your<br> faculty of hearing to hear your own nature. This is how<br> enlightenment is won.Â”</em></p>
              <p><em>~ Shurangama Sutra</em></p>
              <p>With this right understanding, whatever experiences arise are simply allowed to be, it is neither pursued nor followed, not grasped onto, no abidance. We become clear and bright like a mirror reflecting all things but yet undistracted and unattached to all things. All phenomena are inseparable from the mirror, are only ornaments or manifestation of this mirror, which is our true nature, luminous and empty.</p>
              <p>When we firmly abide in this principle, we cannot go wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. When I say 'turn inward', there isn't any turning anywhere actually. It just means a stop to the endless external seeking, which 'obscures' and makes us overlook what is everpresent. It is to allow everything to naturally reveal/express itself in clarity, as awareness.</p>

              <p>You're right, æ¸…å‡€å¿ƒ is only a state of mind and is intangible. The true goal is not even æ¸…å‡€å¿ƒ. Any passing experiences cannot be something to be sought after, because even if we achieve it it will inevitably pass away. Even if you reach the 8th jhana, it is temporary state of absorption, it is not enlightenment or liberation and one will eventually fall away from that realm. So be careful of attaching to absorption, and know that they cannot bring enlightenment or liberation.</p>
              <p>There can only be an allowing, de-grasping, letting go, so that what is eternally present can be revealed. Whether your mind is å‡€ or not, or whether you are moving or sitting, doesn't affect our True Nature at all, just like the sun is always there, the sky is always present whether the clouds appear in the sky or not. To clear our mind of thoughts and attachment simply makes it easier for the sun/sky to be revealed. i.e. our true nature, becomes revealed as an all-pervasive empty-luminous-awareness.</p>
              <p>But it is also seen later that thoughts does not at all obscure the boundlessness and the freedom of the sky, or the clarity/brilliance of the sun, and furthermore the thought is INSEPARABLE from our true nature.</p>
              <p>Our true nature is not a particular experience, or a <em>passing</em> state of mind, but it is the <strong>ever-present</strong> clearing, the vast aware emptiness of infinite potentiality, and all appearances of life is not separate from that. All is It.</p>
              <p>Hence the goal is not about seeking peaceful states of mind. It is to know Who You Truly Are. Who You Truly Are, your Essence of Mind, which is empty luminosity, is intrinsically pure. And all phenomena are manifestation of the Essence of Mind, and hence all are equally empty, equally luminous, equally pure. All there is is One Mind. <em><span style="font-family: arial;">Manifestations are not dust on the
                                  mirror, the dust is the mirror. All along there is no dust, it becomes
                                  dust when we identify with a particular speck and the rest becomes dust.</span></em></p>
              <p>To attach oneself to a "purest state of mind" apart from One Mind is an illusion. The Purity of our true nature is <strong>NOT</strong> a dualistic 'pure vs impure'. It is a non-dualistic purity that encompasses everything: it is the nature of emptiness, and all phenomena exhibits this characteristic.</p>

              <p>The Patriarch on another occasion preached to the assembly as follows:--</p>
              <p>Learned Audience, what is sitting for meditation? In our School,
                                                                      to sit means to gain absolute freedom and to be mentally unperturbed in
                                                                      all outward circumstances, be they good or otherwise. To meditate means
                                                                      to realize inwardly the imperturbability of the Essence of Mind.</p>
              <p>Learned Audience, what are Dhyana and Samadhi? Dhyana means to
                                                                      be free from attachment to all outer objects, and Samadhi means to
                                                                      attain inner peace. If we are attached to outer objects, our inner mind
                                                                      will be perturbed. When we are free from attachment to all outer
                                                                      objects, the mind will be in peace. Our Essence of Mind is
                                                                      intrinsically pure, and the reason why we are perturbed is because we
                                                                      allow ourselves to be carried away by the circumstances we are in. He
                                                                      who is able to keep his mind unperturbed, irrespective of
                                                                      circumstances, has attained Samadhi.</p>
              <p>To be free from attachment to all outer objects is Dhyana, and
                                                                      to attain inner peace is Samadhi. When we are in a position to deal
                                                                      with Dhyana and to keep our inner mind in Samadhi, then we are said to
                                                                      have attained Dhyana and Samadhi. The Bodhisattva Sila Sutra says, "Our
                                                                      Essence of Mind is intrinsically pure." Learned Audience, let us
                                                                      realize this for ourselves at all times. Let us train ourselves,
                                                                      practice it by ourselves, and attain Buddhahood by our own effort.</p>

              <p>You're right, æ¸…å‡€å¿ƒ is only a state of mind and is intangible. The true goal is not even æ¸…å‡€å¿ƒ. Any passing experiences cannot be something to be sought after, because even if we achieve it it will inevitably pass away. Even if you reach the 8th jhana, it is temporary state of absorption, it is not enlightenment or liberation and one will eventually fall away from that realm. So be careful of attaching to absorption, and know that they cannot bring enlightenment or liberation.</p>
              <p>There can only be an allowing, de-grasping, letting go, so that what is eternally present can be revealed. Whether your mind is å‡€ or not, or whether you are moving or sitting, doesn't affect our True Nature at all, just like the sun is always there, the sky is always present whether the clouds appear in the sky or not. To clear our mind of thoughts and attachment simply makes it easier for the sun/sky to be revealed. i.e. our true nature, becomes revealed as an all-pervasive empty-luminous-awareness.</p>
              <p>But it is also seen later that thoughts does not at all obscure the boundlessness and the freedom of the sky, or the clarity/brilliance of the sun, and furthermore the thought is INSEPARABLE from our true nature.</p>
              <p>Our true nature is not a particular experience, or a <em>passing</em> state of mind, but it is the <strong>ever-present</strong> clearing, the vast aware emptiness of infinite potentiality, and all appearances of life is not separate from that. All is It.</p>
              <p>Hence the goal is not about seeking peaceful states of mind. It is to know Who You Truly Are. Who You Truly Are, your Essence of Mind, which is empty luminosity, is intrinsically pure. And all phenomena are manifestation of the Essence of Mind, and hence all are equally empty, equally luminous, equally pure. All there is is One Mind. <em><span style="font-family: arial;">Manifestations are not dust on the mirror, the dust is the mirror. All along there is no dust, it becomes dust when we identify with a particular speck and the rest becomes dust.</span></em></p>
              <p>To attach oneself to a "purest state of mind" apart from One Mind is an illusion. The Purity of our true nature is <strong>NOT</strong> a dualistic 'pure vs impure'. It is a non-dualistic purity that encompasses everything: it is the nature of emptiness, and all phenomena exhibits this characteristic.</p>
              <p><em>"In our system of meditation, we neither dwell upon the mind (in contradistinction to the Essence of Mind) <strong>nor upon purity. Nor do we approve of non-activity.</strong> As to dwelling upon the mind, the mind is primarily delusive; and when we realize that it is only a phantasm there is no need to dwell on it. <strong>As to dwelling upon purity, our nature is intrinsically pure; and so far as we get rid of all delusive 'idea' there will be nothing but purity in our nature, for it is the delusive idea that obscures Tathata (Suchness). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If we direct our mind to dwell upon purity we are only creating another delusion, the delusion of purity. Since delusion has no abiding place, it is delusive to dwell upon it. Purity has neither shape nor form; but some people go so far as to invent the 'Form of Purity', and treat it as a problem for solution. Holding such an opinion, these people are purity-ridden, and their Essence of Mind is thereby obscured..."</span></strong></em></p>

              <p>As 6th Ch'an/Zen Patriarch Hui Neng taught,</p>
              <h1>Sutra of Hui Neng: Chapter 5: Dhyana</h1>
              <h3>From Dharmaweb</h3>
              <p>&lt;!-- start content --&gt;</p>
              <p>The Patriarch (one day) preached to the assembly as follows:--</p>
              <p>In our system of meditation, we neither dwell upon the mind (in contradistinction to the Essence of Mind) nor upon purity. Nor do we approve of non-activity. As to dwelling upon the mind, the mind is primarily delusive; and when we realize that it is only a phantasm there is no need to dwell on it. As to dwelling upon purity, our nature is intrinsically pure; and so far as we get rid of all delusive 'idea' there will be nothing but purity in our nature, for it is the delusive idea that obscures Tathata (Suchness). If we direct our mind to dwell upon purity we are only creating another delusion, the delusion of purity. Since delusion has no abiding place, it is delusive to dwell upon it. Purity has neither shape nor form; but some people go so far as to invent the 'Form of Purity', and treat it as a problem for solution. Holding such an opinion, these people are purity-ridden, and their Essence of Mind is thereby obscured.</p>
              <p>Learned Audience, those who train themselves for 'imperturbability' should, in their contact with all types of men, ignore the faults of others. They should be indifferent to others' merit or demerit, good or evil, for such an attitude accords with the 'imperturbability of the Essence of Mind'. Learned Audience, a man unenlightened may be unperturbed physically, but as soon as he opens his mouth he criticizes others and talks about their merits or demerits, ability or weakness, good or evil; thus he deviates from the right course. On the other hand, to dwell upon our own mind or upon purity is also a stumbling-block in the Path.</p>
              <p>The Patriarch on another occasion preached to the assembly as follows:--</p>
              <p>Learned Audience, what is sitting for meditation? In our School, to sit means to gain absolute freedom and to be mentally unperturbed in all outward circumstances, be they good or otherwise. To meditate means to realize inwardly the imperturbability of the Essence of Mind.</p>
              <p>Learned Audience, what are Dhyana and Samadhi? Dhyana means to be free from attachment to all outer objects, and Samadhi means to attain inner peace. If we are attached to outer objects, our inner mind will be perturbed. When we are free from attachment to all outer objects, the mind will be in peace. Our Essence of Mind is intrinsically pure, and the reason why we are perturbed is because we allow ourselves to be carried away by the circumstances we are in. He who is able to keep his mind unperturbed, irrespective of circumstances, has attained Samadhi.</p>
              <p>To be free from attachment to all outer objects is Dhyana, and to attain inner peace is Samadhi. When we are in a position to deal with Dhyana and to keep our inner mind in Samadhi, then we are said to have attained Dhyana and Samadhi. The Bodhisattva Sila Sutra says, "Our Essence of Mind is intrinsically pure." Learned Audience, let us realize this for ourselves at all times. Let us train ourselves, practice it by ourselves, and attain Buddhahood by our own effort.</p>

              <p>Found something by Zen Master Linji/Rinzai which I found worth sharing:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p>Followers of the Way, when I say that there is no
              Dharma outside, the students do not understand and deduce it is
              necessary to search within themselves. Then they sit, leaning against a
              wall, tongue pressed to the upper palate, and remain so motionless.
              That they take for the patriarchal gate of the Buddha-Dharma. What a
              great error! If you take the state of immovable purity for THIS, you
              acknowledge ignorance as your master. An old master said: “To get lost
              in the depth of the dark cave, is surely a cause for fear and
              trembling.” But if you take the moving as THIS, all the grasses and
              trees can move and so should possess the Way. Therefore, what moves
              belongs to the element of air(wind); what does not move belongs to the
              element of earth; and what both moves and does not move has no being in
              itself. If you think to grasp the moving, it will hold itself
              motionless. And if you try to grasp the motionless, it will take to
              moving, “as a fish in a pool rises when waves are stirred.” So,
              venerable ones, the moving and the motionless are two types of
              circumstance. But the man of the Way who does not depend on anything
              makes use of both the moving and the motionless.</p>
