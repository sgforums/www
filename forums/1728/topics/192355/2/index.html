If guidelines are held as absolute it will inevitably become a dualism. In Christianity, the essential two commandments is <span style="font-style: italic;">"Thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." (Deut 6:5, Mat 22:37) and " Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." (Lev 19:18, Mat 22:39.)</span>. Why are they the essentials? Because when there is the Unconditional Love which is itself without discriminations as Jesus always taught, things will fall in place, everything will become One and naturally all other 'commandments' are met without fail.<br><br><blockquote>Book: Buddhism Plain and Simple by Steve Hagen<br><br>Page 53:<br><br><strong>5. The Art of Seeing</strong><br><br>THE FOURTH TRUTH OF THE BUDDHA-dharma, also known as the eightfold path, offers us a realisation and a practice for bringing about the cessation of dukkha.<br><br>This is not a path we can take to get from point A to point B. Its peculiar nature is that the moment we step on it, the entire path is realised at once. Still, with each step we take we can deepen our understanding.<br><br>The eight aspects of this path are <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">right view. right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">right meditation.</span></strong><br><br>We'll preview each of these in a moment, but first let's consider the word "right." <strong>The word the Buddha actually used was <span style="font-style: italic;">samma. Samma</span> is translated as "right" - but not "right" as opposed to "wrong," or "bad," or "evil." Normally, the moment we say "right," we've already implied "wrong." We've implied dualism.<br><br>For those unfamiliar with the term as it's being used here, dualism simply refers to the world of left and right, dark and light, good and bad, pure and impure. It's the psychological backdrop for our everyday world of chasing after something and running away from others, the world in which if you differ from me, then there's something wrong with you.<br><br>Obviously, this isn't what the Buddha meant by <span style="font-style: italic;">samma</span>. The term suggests something far more subtle. It's better that we understand right as "this is appropriate," "this works," "this is in sync with Reality." Right, on the eightfold path, doesn't mean right versus wrong so much as it means <span style="font-style: italic;">seeing</span> versus <span style="font-style: italic;">not seeing.</span> It refers to being in touch with Reality as opposed to <span style="font-style: italic;">Samma</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">refers to Wholeness rather than fragmentation.</span></strong><br><br>Thus, when I use the word "right" in the chapters to come, I intend it to refer to what is conducive awakening, rather than something that can be compared against something wrong.<br><br>................................<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>6. Wisdom<br>................................<br>page 66:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Right view</span> is <span style="font-style: italic;">seeing</span> reality in all its fullness and fluidity. Yet there's nothing in particular to be <span style="font-style: italic;">seen</span>.<br><br>In the world of our common ordinary mind, everything is divided up: left and right, good and bad, above and below.<br><br>For example, we see the puma stalking the deer and we want to call out to the deer to help him escape. And when the puma pounces on the deer, our heart goes out to the deer.<br><br>So we look for a way to protect the deer. We put bells on the puma so the deer knows when she's around. As a result, the puma suffers. Eventually, she starves.<br><br>With no more puma to keep the deer population in check, the number of deer increases. Before long there are more deer than the local environment can support. The deer overgraze the land and strip the trees and shrubs bare of leaves. And eventually, due to overpopulation, the deer, too, begin to starve.<br><br>We believe we're expressing compsasion. But compassion must be balanced with wisdom. To the extent we don't <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span>, we waste our compassion.<br><br><strong>If you <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> Reality in its fluidity and fullness, then you <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> the puma as well as the deer. You <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> how the two fit together as parts of a seamless Whole.</strong><br><br>..............<br>-----------------<br><br>7. Morality<br><br>.............<br>page 78:<br><br>What's the point of <span style="font-style: italic;">right speech?</span> It's to remind ourselves, to constantly bring ourselves back to this moment - not only for ourselves, but for others as well. It's to do whatever leads us out of confusion and bondage. It's to <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> what's really going on.<br><br><strong>The Buddha did not lay down any commandments. If we say, "Thou shalt not lie," applying it as a rule, what are we to do when the Gestapo pounds at our door and we're harbouring a family of innocent fugitives in the attic? If not lying were an absolute rule to live by, we'd be in deep moral trouble.<br><br>Nevertheless, it's not the case that buddhas simply live out of their own individual truths. The buddha-dharma - what the awakened teach - is about directly <span style="font-style: italic;">seeing</span> Truth itself, prior to forming any ideas about it.</strong> It is about responding to each particular situation as it comes to be, not according to some lockstep programs of do's and don'ts. We can't use a hard and fast rule to deal with the dilemmas and uncertainties and ambiguities of life. A rule - any rule - would only open the door for more relativism and contradiction.<br><br>Nevertheless, we can <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> what's morally appropriate in each situation. We can easily <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> what actions and speech will lead us and others into hatred, confusion, difficulty, and suffering. And we can <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> what actions and speech will lead us and others into hatred, confusion, difficulty, and suffering. And we can <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> what words and actions will not. It all has to do with our intention. Is our intention to hoodwink, mislead, inflate, or deceive others - or is it to be awake?<br><br>Here is the focus for <span style="font-style: italic;">right speech</span>. In any given moment, our eyes must be open to <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> our situation fully for what it is. Our intent- and the action, speech, and though that arise from the intent - is that we all become free of our confusion. For this, it's not necessary that we see one thing pitted against another.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Right speech</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">omits nothing. It includes the whole picture: the Gestapo, the fugitive family, yourself, and the world in which you live.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Right speech</span> doesn't rely on judgment or discriminative thinking. In judging we weigh everything out. We base our speech on some conceptual frame that we've arranged to accommodate ourselves and process ideas - like, for example, the idea that the Gestapo are inherently bad, and the people upstairs are inherently good. This is precisely the thinking that got us into trouble in the first place. Indeed, it's the very thinking that produces both the Gestapo and the fugitives.<br><br>Instead, we have to simply <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> the situation in all its pain, conflict, difficulty, and contradiction, and <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> how it is we become so confused. Then, and only then, can we speak and act in a way that's conducive to awakening.<br><br>We must also observe our own intent, so that we can <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> when we're speaking or acting out of a leaning mind, out of a desire to bring about some particular end. <span style="font-style: italic;">Right speech</span> concerns your intention. Are you using speech because you're trying to manipulate the world and other people? Or are you speaking in order to help yourself and others wake up?</blockquote></div>
