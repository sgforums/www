            <div class='col-md body'>The modern problem of extreme environmental destruction was not a concern in Dogen Zenji's time. On the contrary,people realized their debt to the natural environment and lived in harmony with that environment. The Buddhism of Dogen Zenji was preached in such conditions. We can easily imagine that Dogen Zenji felt close kinship with and affection for the mountains and rivers of his environment.<br><br>The grass, trees and the forest are also transient. Thus they are no other than Buddha-nature. People and things, body and mind are transient. Thus they are Buddha-nature. The land, mountains and rivers are transient. Therefore they areBuddha-nature.<br>[Shobogenzo, "Buddha-Nature" (Bussho)]<br><br>Dogen is treating the question of Buddha-nature here. He discovers Buddha-nature in the grass, trees, groves and forests as well as the land, mountains and rivers. He says that the plants, mountains and rivers are impermanent. He moreover states that this very impermanence signifies Buddha-nature, and he recognizes its great value.<br>Transience (mujo) is a fundamental tenet of Buddhism, an important matter thatcannot be omitted in any discussion of Buddhism. It is the starting point of Buddhism, and no one can rightly be called a Buddhist if he or she does not feelthis aspect of its teaching. Dogen Zenji continues:<br><br>http://www.sotozen-net.or.jp/kokusai/soroku01.htm<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all I would like to explain what I mean by actuality. In a way the fact that we are gathered here to celebrate Dogen, having come from distant countries and cultures, is in itself proof of DogenÂ’s actuality. However, this is not the actuality I am talking about.<br><br>Dogen's thought here and now neither implies trying to make what was actual 800 years ago relevant today, nor trying to find similarities between the past and present situations (the so-called ebb and flow of history). What it means is to grasp the actuality which is always actual, at all times and over and beyond time. The here and now which was manifest for Dogen during the Kamakura era in Japan is manifest for us in Europe during the Third Millennium. We must not look for something in Dogen's thought which has remained relevant for us despite changes in time and circumstance, but rather, for what is enduringly actual regardless of changing circumstances and times. The actuality I am talking about is not influenced by the changing times but, because it is unconditioned by circumstance, it floats and flows with time.<br><br>I say this because some people do confuse the actuality of the present with passing trends. Today in Europe, Buddhism, and especially Zen, is much in vogue. The word Â«ZenÂ» is used to give flavor to the most diverse and eccentric activities - massage, psychotherapy, martial arts, relaxation techniques - and is sometimes even used to promote commercial products. This type of actuality has nothing to do with Dogen's here and now and will disappear with the passing of the fashion. It saddens one to see people lend themselves to this type of easy success, but I don't think this should cause undue concern, as it is an actuality which is doomed to a quick death and will not leave any trace. The actuality of Dogen's thought, like every other authentically religious vision, has nothing to do with short-lived trends or criteria for success. It is the ever-present here and now which cannot be influenced by success or failure and has no need of other props to make it actual.<br><br>This does not mean to say that it is a disembodied here and now or separate from time and space. Â«HereÂ» really means where I am now, and Â«nowÂ» really means in this concrete moment. However, since Â«hereÂ» is the place of every space and Â«nowÂ» is the moment of every moment or all time, there is no need to use artifice to bring about something which is enduringly actual thanks to its intrinsic nature. The problem is not one of making Dogen's thought of yesterday actual today, or making his thought of there actual here. It is not a question of making something actual which, with the passing of time, has lost its freshness and vivacity and become obsolete. Rather it is a matter of drawing on the inexhaustible and unchangeable vitality which is manifest always and everywhere, here and now. This is the meaning of Â«attaining Old HeartÂ» (mokoshin), to use the expression chosen as the title of this celebration ; this is Dogen's thought here and now.<br><br>In the same way as there is no need to employ artifice to render actual that which is naturally so, neither is there any need to immobilize that which is enduringly actual simply because of change. To attain Old Heart does not mean to behave as in past times, to imitate past behavior without taking into account present conditions. For example, to grasp the enduringly actual sense of nourishing oneself, the Old Heart of the vital function of nourishment, does not mean eating in exactly the same manner as those who had originally grasped that essential spirit. That would just be religious folklore. To imitate the manner in which the ancients ate will not suffice to keep that enduringly vital Old Heart beating. We must allow that Old Heart to beat in our manner of eating here and now. We must not confuse life-giving respect with embalming rigidity.<br><br>http://www.sotozen-net.or.jp/kokusai/sympo2001/en/06.htm<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Promoting and Building a Pure Land on Earth<br><br>In China, for almost a century, people have had the impression that Buddhism is just a religion of ghosts and deities devoted to asking favors from gods, worshiping the Buddha, and praying for a better rebirth of the dead. Buddhism has been confused with folk religions and therefore criticized by intellectuals as a form of superstition. WhatÂ¡Â¦s more, many Buddhists have made seeking an early rebirth in a Buddha-land elsewhere their sole goal in life, thus making the general public regard Buddhism as a passive, escapist religion.<br><br>For most of his life, Master Taixu (1889/1890-1947) promoted "humanistic Buddhism" and "engaged Buddhism." My teacher Master Dongchu inherited Master Taixu's goal in promoting engaged Buddhism, and started Humanity Magazine; Master Yin-shun also inherited Master Taixu's goal. I, too, inherited Master Taixu's goal. So I have been promoting the vision of a "pure land on earth," in the hope that people will practice Buddhist teaching in their daily life, and thus turn our world into a pure land.<br><br>I will now quote one of Master Dongchu's articles, "The Essence of Engaged Buddhism," to explain that concept:<br><br>1. Putting ethics into practice<br><br>According to The Sutra of Shingalaka's Homage to the Six Directions, ethics means taking responsibility for one's interactions with others. Those interactions include the relationship between parents and children, teachers and students, employers and employees, husband and wife, and friends. Each individual plays multiple roles in these interactions, and must be responsible for the roles they play.<br><br>2. Putting morals into practice<br><br>A Buddhist should keep the five precepts and uphold the ten virtues. The five precepts are: not to kill, not to steal, not to engage in sexual misconduct, not to speak falsehood, and not to take intoxicants. The ten virtues include abstention from three kinds of bodily evils, four kinds of inappropriate speech, and three kinds of mental evils. Because the abstention from drinking alcohol is included in the five precepts, many people choose only to uphold the ten virtues. However, this is a misconception, since the ten virtues are derived from the five precepts.<br><br>3.The practice of right awakening<br><br>Right awakening entails the practice of the eightfold noble path: right view, right aspiration, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. Right view refers to the Buddha's fundamental teachings of the Four Noble Truths, eightfold noble path, twelve links of dependent origination, etc., plus the four inducements and six perfections of Mahayana. If we really see with our eyes and hear with our ears, and apply the right Buddhist views to the practice of morality in our daily lives, as well as mastering the skills of concentration, we can attain liberation. Right aspiration requires thorough understanding, and incorporation into oneÂ¡Â¦s very being. Right view and right thought transcend the scope of ethics and morality because right view is about seeing suffering, emptiness and no-self in human existence; this alone constitutes an awakened attitude toward life. Right speech, right action, right livelihood, and right effort are consonant with ethics and morality. Therefore, we have to practice and promote the four inducementsÂ¡Xgiving, acting beneficially, intermingling, and speaking kindlyÂ¡Xin order to benefit ourselves and others, win people over to Buddhism, and bring about a pure land on earth.<br><br>(A lecture given to a gathering of Dharma Drum upholders cherishing common aspirations, at the Chan Meditation Center in New York on November 13, 2004.)<br><br></div>
