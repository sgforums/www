It is the suffering of encountering something unplesant and losing what one cherish most. I will definitely say this is what he sowed and now he reap such fruit.<br><br>Suffering is as such, suffering does not just happen out of the blue nor does it come looking for you. But looking at one lifetime of that farmer, one will not be able to tell. It is from his previous lifetimes that he had committed evil karma that led to the fruition of the karma created. It is the same in the case where a rich man is creating evil karma. All we can see is that he perform alot of misdeeds yet he is very rich and enjoying life to a ripe old age. Similarly, it is the fruition of the good karma he had sow in previous lifetimes that enable him to be rich in this lifetime.<br><br>And of course, there is no such thing as luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cherrio</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Constantly contemplate all dharmas as emptiness by nature and all problems are gone!<br><br><span class="large"><strong>The Heart Sutra</strong></span><br><br>When Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara was practicing the profound Prajna Paramita, he illuminated the Five Skandhas and saw that they are all empty, and he crossed beyond all suffering and difficulty.<br><br>Shariputra, form does not differ from emptiness; emptiness does not differ from form. Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself is form. So too are feeling, cognition, formation, and consciousness.<br><br>Shariputra, all Dharmas are empty of characteristics. They are not produced, not destroyed, not defiled, not pure; and they neither increase nor diminish. Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, feeling, cognition, formation, or consciousness; no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no sights, sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, or Dharmas; no field of the eyes up to and including no field of mind consciousness; and no ignorance or ending of ignorance, up to and including <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no old age and death or ending of old age and death. There is no suffering, no accumulating, no extinction, and no Way, and no understanding and no attaining.</span></strong><br><br>Because nothing is attained, the Bodhisattva through reliance on Prajna Paramita is unimpeded in his mind. Because there is no impediment, he is not afraid, and he leaves distorted dream-thinking far behind. Ultimately Nirvana! All Buddhas of the three periods of time attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi through reliance on Prajna Paramita. Therefore know that Prajna Paramita is a Great Spiritual Mantra, a Great Bright Mantra, a Supreme Mantra, an Unequalled Mantra. It can remove all suffering; it is genuine and not false. That is why the Mantra of Prajna Paramita was spoken. Recite it like this:<br><br>Gate Gate Paragate Parasamgate<br><br>Bodhi Svaha!</div>
