            <div class='col-md body'>Someone from sgForums created a new account to tell me that Yi Guan Dao is orthodox... since he is using a new account or clone (0 posts) I assume that he wouldn't mind his identity be revealed (unless he tells me otherwise)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zachela:</div><div class="quote_body">pls yi kuan tao IS orthodox it is not a religion and u CANT comment on yi kuan tao without proof let me repeat moiself it IS orthodox<br>thx<br><br>p.s sry if i had ofended u in anyway</div></blockquote>First of all, there is already a previous thread in my forum discussing this, please see: <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=217526" rel="nofollow">any1 heard of I-Kuan Tao</a> and don't need to worry about offence as I do not take offence easily. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I would like to say firstly... Yi Guan Dao is NOT Buddhism. They do not represent true Buddhist or Buddha's teachings and do not lead to enlightenment. For more information about this organisation, please refer to the first article the following article I am pasting. Yi Guan Dao's teachings on Maitreya are a total distortion of Buddha's teachings on Maitreya. The fake sutra they wrote THEMSELVES (it is Clearly not from Shakyamuni Buddha) on Maitreya is completely different from Buddha's sutra on Maitreya, and they claim that Maitreya has come, though it is completely different from head to toe from Buddha's prophecy on the upcoming Maitreya.<br><br>For the TRUE account of the future Maitreya by Shakyamuni Buddha, what will the world be like at that time, what will be the lifespan, technology, lifestyle, weather, planet/world, cities, luxury, etc etc etc, they are all completely detailedly described. It is completely different from our times. For example, people at that time have a lifespan of 84000 years old, and are very tall. Cities all around the globe are huge and are packed closely together, their technology much more advance than our current world. Population is perhaps 100 billion people (no lesser than 40 billion since about 40 billion people got enlightened at that time).... please read: <a href="http://www.quangduc.com/English/buddha/17comingbuddha.html" rel="nofollow">The Coming Buddha,  Ariya Metteyya</a> Also at that time, the world will be ruled by a <strong>Universal Ruler</strong>, not only that, 4 planets in our galaxy including our Planet Earth inhabited by intelligent beings/humans/extra-terrestrial 'humans' will be under One rule, and the Universal Ruler is said to travel in a golden flying vehicle that reaches the other planet within 1 days time -- obviously we have not come to that.<br><br>To add on that.. Maitreya Bodhisattva will be the next Buddha, however it certainly isn't time yet. That will be according to Buddhist sutras <strong>millions or billions of years away</strong>, long after the teachings of Shakyamuni has completely disappeared from the face of Earth, all the sutras and Sangha (monastic community) has already completely disappeared for millions of years. Furthermore any Buddhas must be complete with the 32 major marks and 80 minor marks (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-two_marks_of_the_Buddha" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-two_marks_of_the_Buddha</a>), and ever since Shakyamuni we have never met anyone like that, so we can confidently and conclusively said that there was NO other Buddha ever since Shakyamuni Buddha came to Earth.<br><br>Next thing is, I Kuan Dao is a rojak teaching... they mix up everything and yet call that teaching their own. It has some characteristics which are the common traits of cults that are fear-based -- do see the upcoming post.<br><br>Conclusions: Like all religions I Kuan Dao teaches people to be good, but does it lead to enlightenment, or is it Orthodox Dharma/Buddhist teachings? nope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Please read this article:<br><br><strong>Thian Tao</strong><br><br>Tian Tao or I Kuan Tao is a modern, syncretic faith and the third most popular religion in Taiwan. The Chinese words I Kuan Tao can be roughly translated as the Religion of One Unity. It is a religious doctrine that draws upon both traditional Chinese teachings and each of the world's major religions. This religion attempts to identify common principles underlying Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Hinduism. Tian Tao believes that by uncovering a single set of universal truths, the "increasing chaos" of modern times can be defeated and the world can live peacefully in harmony. They believe in a God beyond all other gods, called Ming-ming Shang-ti (the God of Clarity).<br><br>It may have its roots with the Bai Lian Jiao (White Lotus Sect) which created several political unrests for both the Qing court (1644 - 1911) and foreign powers, such as the British, French and so forth who have seized the lands from the hands of the Qing court since the Opium War. Bai Lian Jiao is closely related to the Chinese Christian cult, Tai Ping Tian Guo, founded by Hong Xiu Quan, in the late Qing dynasty. Hong Xiu Quan believed himself as Jesus Christ's heavenly brother, which was sent to Earth by Lord God to liberate Chinese people from imperial oppression. Lands were belonged by Lord God and not the Qing court, hence poor and uneducated peasants in ten of thousands accepted his teachings. Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching, the Minister of State for Tai Ping Tian Guo, tried to seize the power and authority of Emperor Hong Xiu Quan. To legitimize his authority, he occasionally lapsed into trances in which his voice supposedly became that of the Lord's. In one of his trances, Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching claimed that the Lord demanded Hong Xiu Quan be whipped for kicking one of his concubines. Emperor Hong Xiu Quan had Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching murdered by Wei Chang Hui, a Tai Ping Tian Guo general. The followers of Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching later formed the Bai Lian Jiao.<br><br>Another source stated that Tian Tao was evolved from Xian Tian Tao which was founded by 9th Patriarch Huang De Hui of the Shun Zhi period of Qing Dynasty. Huang De Hui combined the three main belief systems of China with a belief in the Wu Sheng Lao Mu (Great Mother) to form Xian Tian Tao. Bodhidharma is credited as the 1st Patriarch, the first five Chinese Chan Patriarchs are credited as 2nd to 6th Patriarchs. Bai Ma became the 7th Patriarch and the 8th Patriarch is Luo Wei Qun. The lines of patriarch of Xian Tian Tao continue into the present I Kuan Tao. The 15th Patriarch had made some major changes in the formulas and goals of Xian Tian Tao. And it is the 16th Patriarch Liu Ching Xu renamed the group as I Kuan Tao. The 18th Patriarch is the last in line of the patriarchs.<br><br>The followers of I Kuan Tao claimed that it is a distinguished lineage back over 2000 years when it begins from the ancient Chinese astrolgers, emperors, Confucius, and so forth. From 18th Ancient Patriarch Mencius, the lineage travels to the west, the lineage began from Shakyamuni Buddha, Mahakashyapa to 28th Indian Patriarch Bodhidharma. But the modern practice of Tian Tao, as we know it today, was established about 70 years ago. In the 1930, Shi Zueng Zhang Tian Ran and Shi Mu Sun Hui Ming, became the 18th Patriarch and started their practice I Kuan Tao in Chi Nan City, Shang Dong Province of China. Their work spread by word of mouth, and by 1946 I Kuan Tao became prevalent among 36 provinces of China. At the end of the Civil War in 1949, many followers in China found their beliefs incompatible with Communist doctrines. This and other reasons compelled large numbers of them to emigrate to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Tian Tao quickly took root in these new lands, spreading with its teachings Chinese culture and traditional family values. By increasing the number of I Kuan Tao temples, they believed that they are bringing the Buddhist "Western Paradise" to earth and creating a world of brotherhood and universal love as envisioned by Confucian teachings.<br><br>Today, they have about 4,500,000 followers in Taiwan, Korea and Japan; about 2,000,000 followers in South East Asian countries; and a growing number of adherents in countries like Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Paraguay, Italy, France, Germany, Holland and United Kingdom. In Taiwan alone, there are over 200 large and medium-sized temples and over 30,000 family shrines.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Presently, they claimed that the founder, 17th Patriarch Lu Zhong Yi, was an incarnation of Maitreya. He has major influence and impact on the present form of I Kuan Tao. The central teaching of Tian Tao, is based on the initiation ceremony - a new formula on the Triple Gem, namely: 1. Opening of Heavenly Eye (Dian Xuan Dao), 2.Oral Transmission of the Maitreya prayer (Chuan Ko Jue), and 3. Hand Gestures (Jie He Tong). They believe that the recipient has obtained the Tao and that his name has been reserved in the heaven and erased from the lists in hell. Upon death, the recipient will ascend straight to heaven without having to endure the cycles of rebirth.<br><br>The followers of this organization must be a strict vegetarian. It is said that they will not teach and liberate three groups of people: they are butchers, fishermen and prostitutes.<br><br>Usually, their temples are painted in pure white. And they have large followers in Asia. Their selection for potential followers are very strict. Non-members of this organization are not allowed to step into their temple compound. They can only enter the temple compound through the invitation from the senior members. On the day itself, the new recruit will make to vow to keep secrets on what he/she has learnt from the temple. Why? Without asking of consert, he/she is sent to receive the "secret" formula, so-called "Triple Gem". If he/she has failed to keep the secrets, and leaked out these secrets to non-members, he/she will be killed by the 5 heavenly thunders (Wu Lei Hong Ding).<br><br>There are many works written by this cult group. There are few popular ones. For example:<br><br>1. "Maitreya Sutra" (Chinese: Mi Le Zhen Jing) is their own version of Maitreyavyakarana Sutra. It is said that this scripture was spoken by the Buddha. It talks about the benefit on having faith on Maitreya Buddha. The retinue of protectors are non-Buddhist ones, most of them are from the Chinese folk religions and not to mention the main character, Lao Mu who is Wu Sheng Lao Mu in short.<br><br>2. "The Travelogue for the Hell" (Chinese: Ti Yu You Ji) revealed by Ji Gong, a Chinese folk religion deity whose origin is unknown. This work explains about hell.<br><br>These books can be found in the free book distribution corners in the Chinese folk religion temples.<br><br>"The group is known as Ee Kwang Tao. I was invited to attend the opening of one of their 'Holy Houses'. It was one of the strangest rituals that i have ever witnessed. Following the ritual we were invited to go before the 'Master' to receive initiation. I declined on the grounds that I had been invited to attend the opening but not to join anything. After a while they approached me again and they said that the 'Master' was waiting for me and I MUST go before the 'Master'. I replied that I must not do anything of the sort as I am a traditional Buddhist and had no wish to join their organisation. I thanked them for their hospitality and said that I was leaving. As each person arrived they took their name. As I left they asked me for my name as they said that the names were being sent to heaven and, as I refused initiation, my name would have to be struck off the list. I consulted a Chinese friend about my experience and he immediately identified it as the Ee Kwang Tao cult which, as was said, is proliferating in Australia. The initiates are sworn to secrecy with the threat of harm to themselves and their family if the secrets are revealed. This dangerous cult bears no relation to Buddhism so beware of them." Graeme Lyall (Australia), 1999.<br><br>At times, their activities are not restricted in the temple compounds. In Singapore, the very senior members who hold the posts of "Tang Zhu", can convert the new comers in their own houses. The main Singapore centre is located at Bukit Merah Central, and it is known as "Chong Hua Tong Tou Teck Hwee Building". You can see the name of the building at the main gate. It is also stated that it is "strictly for members". Their first centre was located at Upper Serangoon Road, and was demolished recently. And there are many smaller temples or community welfare centres scattered around Singapore. They are registered with Registry of Society as "Xin Jia Bo Zhong Hua Tang Dao De Hui" (Sing Gah Ball Chong Hua Tong Tou Teck Hwee) and they also work hand-in-hand with "De Jiao" founded by Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society and also with Chee Hoon Kog Moral Promotion Society for those community welfare services.<br><br>The other schools which are evolved from Xian Tian Tao, are Tung Shan She, Tien De Sheng Jiao, Tao Yuan and Tzu Hui Tang. They are independent groups and do not share the same leadership.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahh.. Yi Guan Dao... it was very aggressive in the 80's when I was a student, a little older than AEN.  I remember seeing YGD flyers and books almost everywhere then and I would take them, stuffed into my school bags, walked to some dustbins and throw them all in. I was very attached, so very unhappy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Nobody really come to preach to me but I had a few friends got kinda "brainwashed" by YGD's followers, and I had a hard time trying to tell them what Buddhism is. But later I realised that some ppl that continued to stayed in YGD actually preferred its teachings more than Buddhism, they don't really wish to understand Buddhadharma at all. So, it was not about brainwashing or not already, it was a personal preferrence. Then I left it as it was.<br><br>I come to realised then that to spread the Buddhadharma is of upmost importance. If more ppl, especially the youngs, would to understand  orthodox Buddhism ( zheng jian de fo jiao), then many problems will be solved easily. At least I didn't hv to look for dustbins at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So I am always happy to support the running of Dharma schools. And many Venerables and Lamas were working hard to set up classes under harsh conditions as there were not many supports then during the  80s, either financially or physically...<br><br>Through the years, some ex-YGD followers had actually left the organization, and some of these started to attend Dharma lessons as well. There are of cos still fresh followers, but at least I feel they are not that aggressives as before.<br><br>To have zheng jian is very important in this chaotic brave new world we are living now, and as Buddhist we must support the Sangha who set up dharma classes or centers. ( oh, mentally must support AEN also; for posting very good clarifications and explanations on YGD. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br></div>
