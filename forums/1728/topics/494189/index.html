              Thai Buddhist nuns</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Richard S Ehrlich, June 3,
              2017 Asia Times</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">An
              American bhikkuni's campaign to ordain Thai women, forbidden under local
              Buddhist law, has been met with violence, threats and arson attacks on her
              temples </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">An
              American Buddhist nun said the US Embassy rescued her from Thai men who
              threatened to kidnap her and later allegedly burned down her temple dormitory
              because she intentionally disobeys Thai Buddhist clergy by supporting women to
              become nuns.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Leaura
              Naomi’s confrontation earlier this year is the most vivid example of a wider
              revolution by women across Southeast Asia demanding equality to allow female
              ordinations within Theravada Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Theravada — the oldest and more conservative of Buddhism’s two main branches —
              a male monk’s ancient Pali-language title is “bhikkhu.” A nun is known as a
              “bhikkhuni.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              vast majority of Thailand’s population are Theravada Buddhists. Theravada also
              exists in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Thailand many, if not most, families arrange for at least one young adult son
              to live in a temple — perhaps for several days or a season — to be ordained as
              a novice or monk. Ordination bestows spiritual “merit” on the family, which is
              a major reason why the ceremony is coveted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              a 1928 proclamation by Thailand’s all-male Buddhist Sangha Supreme Council
              forbids female ordination, frustrating many daughters and their parents because
              no equivalent merit can be earned by women. Historians say bhikkhunis
              flourished for 1,000 years in India and Sri Lanka but Islam and war caused them
              to almost disappear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“My
              name is Bhikkhuni Doctor Lee. We don’t use last names,” Naomi said in an
              interview. The American ascetic was wrapped in a robe styled differently but
              the same saffron color as a Thai monk’s robe.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">More
              than 2,500 years ago, “in the time of the Buddha, we had bhikkhunis and they
              wore similar attire,” said Naomi, 56, who also has a shaven head in keeping
              with Buddhist tradition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              built a temple three times in Thailand. We got shut down two times and the
              third time we were arsoned.” Naomi said a gang of Thai men are still
              threatening her and her “temple” in Rayong, a tourist-friendly beach town
              situated 144 kilometers from Bangkok.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Her
              earthly woes began in 2016 with “eight men, drunken and shouting, ‘We want the
              bhikkhuni out of the village. We want the American out of the village. If you
              don’t get out of the village, we’re going to burn your temple down’,” she said,
              recounting the violent incident.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“In
              Thailand, there have been four kidnapping attempts on my life. But thank
              goodness for the American Embassy,” she said. An official at the US Embassy in
              Bangkok “saved my life”, Naomi said, after telephoning him for help during her
              latest crisis earlier this year when a gang surrounded her temple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">She
              said the US official helped to get the local police to intervene. About 10 days
              after that confrontation, some men set fire to the women’s dormitory where
              Naomi lived with four Thai women, she said. She continues to run her
              International Women’s Meditation Center which she describes as a “temple”,
              despite the threats.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Born
              into a Christian family in Yonkers, New York, Naomi received a PhD in geography
              at Colorado University and taught at Central Michigan and Eastern Michigan
              universities. She ordained as a bhikkhuni in Colorado 25 years ago and came to
              Thailand in 2000.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              read that they have Theravada Buddhism in Thailand, but not the bhikkhuni
              thing.” She decided to “introduce this new cultural element, then it could
              perhaps take off.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">More
              than 300,000 monks and novices live in Thailand’s 30,000 temples. There are
              hundreds of unrecognized Thai bhikkhunis, but Ms. Naomi is the only American
              Buddhist nun residing in Thailand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Another
              American known as Venerable Pannavati, who claims she’s the world’s only black
              Buddhist nun, often visits Thailand to help Naomi ordain nuns. Pannavati, 68, a
              thrice-married mother, is co-founder and Buddhist abbot of Heartwood Refuge, an
              interfaith center in Hendersonville, North Carolina.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Born
              a Baptist in Washington DC, she went to First Rising Mount Zion church.
              Pannavati later became a Pentecostal Holy Roller — speaking in tongues — and
              then a charismatic Christian before embracing Buddhism. Pannavati first came to
              Thailand in 2008 on Naomi’s invitation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“She
              was looking for [foreign] nuns who were not afraid to ordain [Thai women],”
              Pannavati said in an interview while visiting Bangkok. “I helped Dr Lee ordain.
              And it was good. We did that for several years.” Pannavati says she would “fly
              in, arrange an ordination, and fly out.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Venerable
              Dhammananda, a Thai national, became a nun after being ordained in 2003 in Sri
              Lanka where the Theravada tradition was revived. Formerly known as Dr
              Chatsumarn Kabilsingh when she was a Buddhist philosophy lecturer at Bangkok’s
              Thammasat University, she divorced her husband, became celibate and explained her
              religious decisions to her children.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dhammananda
              now heads an unrecognized Theravada temple near Bangkok. Her Thai mother
              established the temple in 1971 after ordaining in Taiwan which allows, similar
              to China, Mahayana Buddhist female ordination. Dhammananda’s Thai grandmother
              also ordained overseas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              have given ordination to 700 women. They are working women, so after nine days
              [at her temple] they return to their life,” Dhammananda said during a recent
              news conference at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">She
              is also active elsewhere in Asia. “In Tibetan tradition, they have only female
              novices. They don’t have fully ordained [nuns]. They are also struggling. I
              have been trying to work with His Holiness [the Dalai Lama] since 1980, but it
              has not been successful,” she said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“He
              said he would wait to see if some senior [Tibetan] monks would consider joining
              him or not. That will never happen,” Dhammananda predicted. “I just came back
              from Myanmar. I tried to push for fully ordained female monks in Myanmar. Not
              possible.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">She
              said a Myanmar woman who ordained in 2003 in Sri Lanka returned to her country
              — also known as Burma — but was jailed for 76 days. Upon release, she settled
              in America, Dhammananda said. “Laos and Cambodia are following after Thailand
              because many of the monks come here for education,” and forbid female
              ordination.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dhammananda
              and others recently established a Network of Asian Theravada Bhikkhunis to push
              for equality. Male-to-female transgender women, who want to be ordained as
              nuns, present a special case, she said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Recently,
              a “woman came to me. And if she did not tell me she was a he before, I would
              not know. He had breasts just like women. And he had his penis removed.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Supposing
              if this person asked me for ordination as bhikkhuni…should I or should I not
              give him ordination?” One respected senior Thai monk told Dhammananda, “‘If she
              has the physical form of a woman,’ I should be able to give her ordination.”</span></p>
