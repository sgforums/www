              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #888888;">By Mark Coleman</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">In the wilderness of the Rainbow Trail at
              twilight, silence reigns. On this silent backpacking and meditation retreat I
              am leading deep in the red rocks of Arizona, a
              small group of men and women have been walking and camping under the steady
              presence of Navaho
               Mountain for seven days
              and seven nights. Immersed in winding sandstone canyons 650 million years old,
              we have been alone except for occasional visits by curious ravens.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Now the retreat participants are returning
              from spending twenty-four hours alone. As we sit around the campfire, the moon
              rises slowly above the sheer canyon walls, casting shadows and animating
              wizened faces in the rock.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Since I began leading meditation retreats in
              nature, I've observed again and again what a profound sense of peace people
              feel when they spend some meditative time outside in the forest or in open
              meadows. The power of the natural world encourages us to let go of our habitual
              mode of being, which is usually self-centered, acquisitive, and endlessly
              seeking something outside of ourselves. The everyday thinking mind, with its
              restless concerns and perennial planning, begins ro calm down. The body feels
              more at ease, and the heart slowly opens and resonates with the peace of the
              natural world. On wilderness meditation retreats, people taste the depth of
              intimacy it is possible to experience with nature, themselves, and their
              community.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Nature teaches us simplicity and
              contentment, because in its presence we realize we need very little to be
              happy. Since we are part of the animal kingdom, our senses are naturally more
              alive in the outdoors. The rustle of leaves or the rapid flight of birds could
              indicate the presence of a mountain lion or bear. Hiking in places where we are
              not the only predator helps us understand that all oflife is intimately
              interwoven and that we are a part of that web. Meditation training, on the
              other hand, provides the tools to steady the mind so we can be open to receive
              the jewels of nature. Through meditation we learn how to work skillfully with
              thoughts and emotional patterns that interfere with simply being able to rest
              wherever we are, with full presence.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The following are some exercises to help you
              connect with the natural world in a meditative way.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Beginner's Mind</span></strong><span><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Â </span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"><br> Take a walk and let yourself be called to a particular tree. Stay with the tree
              awhile to study, look, feel, smell, and sense it. Listen to it as wind rustles
              its branches. Bask in its shade in the midday sun. Get to know it at different
              times of the day and in different seasons. How is it connected with life around
              it? How do you get to know it, and which senses do you use?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Feel the difference between your idea of the
              tree and the rich textural experience of it. Notice the impulse to move on
              because of impatience, resistance, or boredom. When you feel you "know
              it," what does that do to the sense of curiosity and mystery? Can you
              maintain interest even when you think you have reached the end of your
              exploration? Is it possible to fully know what a tree really is? Start to bring
              this curious attention to all that you meet.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Silence</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"><br> Spend a period of time in a quiet place in nature to experience silence. Can
              you connect with the silence that is there even when there are sounds? What
              interrupts the experience of silence? Does being in silence create any sense of
              discomfort? Do you want to distract yourself from it? Does the silence allow
              your mind and body to rest more in stillness and quiet?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Working with Thoughts</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"><br> Take some time to sit or walk in nature. Simply be as present as you can,
              Notice when your attention is lost in thought, and how thinking makes you less
              present to your environment. For a period of time, practice letting go of your
              thoughts as soon as they arise and returning your attention to what is
              happening in the physical environment. How does that affect your experience?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Letting Go of Our Stories</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"><br> When you are lost or caught up in an emotional storm or contracted in
              self-centeredness or plagued by obsessive thoughts, notice what happens when
              you step outside or go for a walk and pay attention to the sky, the air, the
              light, the movement of wind, the feel of grass under your feet. Be aware of how
              the spaciousness that can arise allows a natural dis-identification with inner
              turmoil and a regaining of perspective.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Knowing Your Backyard</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"><br> Take some time to investigate the source of your water, food, lumber, firewood.
              Where do your waste products go? Is the food that you eat grown locally? What
              are the indigenous animals, birds, plants and trees in your local area? What
              are their habitats, where do they nest, eat? What species, what land is
              currently under threat in your region? Since you are part of this chain of
              interrelated life, what are you doing that supports or threatens the health of
              that which may be in danger?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Love</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"><br> Take time to be with something you love in nature that brings out your natural
              curiosity and delight, It may be a wild iris, the shimmering luminescence of
              water in a stream, the patrerns and colors ofa butterfly's wing. Let yourself
              be drawn to it. Engage your senses. Are you touched by the sense of wonder?
              Practice daily or weekly, spending time in nature with what most allows your
              heart to open. How does such love feel in the mind, body, and heart? What
              effect does it have on your sense of connection with the web of life?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">A Day in Nature</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"><br> Take a day to be alone in nature. Select a location where you are not likely to
              be interrupted by many people, You can divide the time between periods of
              contemplative sitting and gentle walks. In sitting meditation, cultivate an
              open attentiveness toward the present moment. You can focus on the inner
              experience of breathing and the sensations of the body. Or you can pay
              attention to the experience that arises from sitting outsideâthe touch of the
              breeze on your skin, the physical connection with the earth, the sounds of
              birds, animals, and the wind, and the fragrances in the air. Try meditating
              with the eyes open, allowing the eyes to be soft and receptive with a wide
              field of vision while maintaining awareness of the other senses, especially
              hearing.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">While walking, let go of any goal-orientation. Simply let yourself
              walk slowly, carefully, with full awareness of the space you are walking in.
              Let go of any intention to get anywhere. Listen to whatever draws you in the
              landscapeâa particular tree, rock, stream, or a vast open vista. Or perhaps a
              lizard or beetle draws you into a conversation. Let your senses be wide open
              and receptive. Give little attention to your thoughts and instead keep turning
              to your inner and outer environment. If you begin to feel spacey or unfocused,
              resume sitting meditation, centering attention upon the breath. The less you do
              outwardly, the more will open to you.<span>Â </span><br> <strong><br> <strong><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Mark Coleman</span></strong></strong><span>Â </span>teaches Vipassana meditation at Spirit Rock Meditation Center
