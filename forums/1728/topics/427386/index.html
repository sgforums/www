              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong>Nonexistence of Self<br>By 
              Paul Knierim<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The idea of a self is fundamental, yet strangely inscrutable. 
              "I exist" seems an obvious truth, but who is the "I"? Is there 
              a single distinct "I" experiencing existence, or is it unfair to say 
              that the "I" is distinct from the experience? Is it sensible to imagine 
              there not being a self? Buddhist philosophy asserts that the conception of a separate 
              self having the experiences is a mistake. Contradicting the assertions of the 
              Samkhya and Yoga philosophies, Buddhists argue that the self is nothing more than 
              an arbitrary label for a collection of parts. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>In the view of Samkhya and Yoga, 
              the self is an undeniable fact. Where there is a scene, it is argued, there is 
              a witness. Where there is an observation, there is an observer. Where there is 
              something known, there is a knower. The mind isn't properly described as being 
              the self, for it's clearly known. Thoughts are all observations of their own sort, 
              as they must pass before consciousness. Consciousness is of thoughts, therefore 
              consciousness cannot be the thoughts themselves according to Samkhya and Yoga. 
              In the Yoga-Sutra this argument is given against the mind being the self: "Whatever 
              objects color the mind, that object becomes known. That which becomes known is 
              an object. That which is not thus known is purusa and is unknown" (482). 
              Anything which is known must have a knower, so the known mind must be known by 
              the true self. What's left over after the options of the self being the body or 
              the mind are dismissed is a self which is a pure principle of observation -- consciousness 
              in itself. This self, called purusa, is the eternal observer before whom temporary 
              thoughts pass. We have a difficulty in that the self cannot be known (it being 
              the knower of any knowledge, always the subject and never an object), but confidence 
              that the self must be there since it's been logically derived. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The Buddhist 
              rejects the self, preferring to say that it's no more than a label for a collection. 
              Just as we label objects in the world around us arbitrarily, we invent an arbitrary 
              label with the word "self" that has no reality beyond the parts. "Chariot" 
              is a word we use to keep track of a conglomeration of descriptions: wheels, axles, 
              reins, yoke, banner-staff, goading-stick, pole, et cetera. It isn't proper to 
              say that these things unite to become the chariot because there's no real unification, 
              the parts remain only the parts, it's just we who imagine some sort of unity by 
              use of the word "chariot" as the unifier. Objectively there's nothing 
              that "chariot" adds to what's there compared to if we didn't treat it 
              as though it were unified... all the parts are simply all the parts, our label 
              adds nothing. So it is as well with the self. Nagesana explains this with reference 
              to his own being in the Milindapanha: "Nagesana is but a way of counting, 
              term, appellation, convenient designation, mere name for the hair of my head, 
              hair of my body... brain of the head, form, sensation, perception, the predispositions, 
              and consciousness. But in the absolute sense there is no ego here to be found" 
              (284). The self is not form, not sensation, not perception, not predispositions, 
              not consciousness... nor is it something else, nor is it the unification. The 
              self is not to be found, it's only the invented label which is imagined to mean 
              something but actually adds nothing to the picture beyond what was already there. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The Samkyha and Yoga philosophers may object to the fundamental ideas of the 
              Buddhist conception as being incoherent, but must establish that their own view 
              as more coherent if the objections are to be effective. The Buddhist is denying, 
              it would seem, the most obvious facts of the world: that there are things in it 
              and someone perceiving it. The existence of objects being known is proof of the 
              existence of the knower, the objects cannot be known without a knowing subject 
              existing. Patanjali says of the mind, "It is not self-illuminating, being 
              the knowable" (482). This proves there must be a self, as the fact of the 
              knowable means something must be doing the knowing. The Buddhist seems simply 
              self-contradictory, uttering such nonsense as "The Path exists, but not the 
              traveler on it" (289). If someone is traveling the path, then the traveler 
              on the path must exist, and to say otherwise is surely nonsense. The Samkhya philosopher, 
              however, is in the situation of asserting the existence of something which is 
              defined as unknown (because it's the knower) and impossible to experience (because 
              it's the experiencer). Many philosophers would argue that it's never proper to 
              claim to existence of something which by definition can never be conceived of 
              -- if you see the tip of an iceberg perhaps you can deduce the rest, but if you 
              have no sample at all of what sort of thing it is then you have no business asserting 
              it. The Samkhya idea of the purusa, then, cannot be trusted based on appeals to 
              intuition unless there's some sort of sample of what it could be -- otherwise 
              it might be more reasonable to say that the intuition that there's a subject for 
              every object only applies to the experiences within the mind and is misapplied 
              when used on the mind itself... for after all, we derived the intuition only from 
              sense experiences. Perhaps Patanjali sees these objections, for Yoga provides 
              an attempt at showing a way to verify the existence of the self. In the Yoga-Sutra, 
              Patanjali believes he's showing a process through which the true purusa can be 
              experienced in itself, the method to have the subject without any object. But 
              how coherent, exactly, is the idea of self-observation? Surely it's the impossibility 
              of self-observation that motivated the idea of an observing unobservable self 
              to begin with, and if we're willing to assert self-observation we might as well 
              assert the mind as doing it. The idea that subject and object require each other 
              was just moments ago being used to refute the Buddhist, so how then can we suddenly 
              moving to talking about a subject by itself? If there can be no object without 
              a subject, how can there be a subject without an object... how can there be any 
              way to distinguish one to say that it exists, without the other being there to 
              distinguish it? Logically, the consciousness in itself would have to be either 
              total nothingness or an experience of another meta-self experiencer (which would 
              lead to an infinite homuncular regress). It would seem then that the objections 
              to Buddhism by Samkhya and Yoga philosophy are not especially strong, in view 
              of how their alternative to the Buddhist falls victim to some similar attacks 
              -- yet it remains worthwhile to see if the Buddhist can deal with the objections 
              more easily, in order to determine if the views will be stuck on equally questionable 
              footing. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The Buddhist position can be clarified to show how it sidesteps the 
              problems it's accused of. The denial of self is not a denial that there are perceptions 
              and consciousness, rather it's a denial of unity and a denial of absoluteness. 
              There is a chariot so far as common talk goes, and it would seem nonsensical to 
              deny that there's a chariot -- but we must remember that we're addressing the 
              idea of a unified real absolute chariot, not just asking if the situation has 
              arisen where in our language we're supposed to say "chariot." There 
              is a chariot there, but only in a relational sense -- the relation of the parts 
              to each other. It's entirely arbitrary to try to call that set of relations a 
              unified whole, as it would be just as easy to extend it out and call the entire 
              world a chariot. There's nothing in the relations themselves which says how many 
              or what kind of relations to include in some sort of absolute unified whole... 
              there's nothing in the parts of a chariot that says "I'm part of a chariot." 
              The unified chariot, the absolute chariot, does not exist -- it's only what the 
              senses and mind structures cause the mind to imagine. This carries over again 
              to talking about the self -- the thesis in not that nothing exists, it's that 
              things are only there in a relational sense (with arbitrary and fuzzy boundaries) 
              rather than an absolute sense. The chariot is the expression of the relation of 
              parts, and so is the self the expression of the relation of parts. This is emphasized 
              in the Visuddhi-magga: "When we come to examine the parts one by one we discover 
              that in the absolute sense there is no tree; in exactly the same way the words 
              'living entity' and 'ego' are but a mode of expression for the presence of the 
              five attachment groups, but when we come to examine the elements of being one 
              by one, we discover that in the absolute sense there is no living entity there 
              to form a basis for such figments as 'I am,' or 'I'; in other words, that in the 
              absolute sense there is only name and form" (285). Our attempts to express 
              an absolute reality of self are mistaken, for there is nothing there except exactly 
              what's there. There is no unity, only relations which we hopelessly attempt to 
              turn into unity. It's not that we're wrong to talk of things existing, it's that 
              we're wrong to think we mean something absolute or unified by it, for on close 
              inspection everything we call an object (including the self) is no more than relations. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The critic may still object that the Buddhist hasn't offered an account of 
              how experiences exist. To this, the Buddhist may reply that experiences are made 
              up of skandhas, skandhas being essentially aggregates or bundles. The five skandhas 
              are form, sensation, perception/cognition, predispositions, consciousness. The 
              most important as far as analyzing why experience seems to be as it seems to be 
              is the consciousness. The consciousness (vijnana skandha) is the skandha which 
              splits things into subject and object. This occurs when a sense organ (brain included) 
              comes into contact with something -- it's here that the duality of experience 
              is added. Consciousness creates a split into experiencer and experience, a split 
              which is not real beyond consciousness. Normally we think of experience being 
              created by subject and object, because consciousness forces things into such description. 
              In actuality, says the Buddhist, both the subject and the object are aspects of 
              experience. The subject/object distinction is created by the consciousness aspect 
              of experience, rather than being the reality of the way things are as the Samkhya 
              or Yoga philosopher would have it. Samkhya would have a self sitting in a movie 
              theater watching life on the screen. The Buddhist would have nothing but the experiences 
              on the screen, with no theater or viewer, and for that matter no screen. The Buddhist, 
              instead of appealing to the necessity of a subject for every object that seems 
              so natural, says that the subject/object distinction is illusory (an aspect of 
              experience itself) and so eliminates the problem of looking for a self. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>For 
              the Buddhist, the knowing that goes on is only relational, parts relating to other 
              parts. By avoiding the absolute sense of something being known, the Buddhist also 
              avoids the implication of an absolute self. When the mind knows something, that's 
              just a pattern of relations with no absolutes involved. There is no observer of 
              the mind, for the thoughts stand without need of any absolutes to put them in 
              context. When subject and object are illusion and reality contains neither subject 
              nor object, there's no need to invent a self to fill the hole of "subject". </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The nature of the self is a problem that has plagued philosophy from the earliest 
              times. The Buddhist argues that this problem is a psychological problem -- the 
              feeling of a need to find something that isn't there. If the self seems strangely 
              inscrutable, that's because there's nothing there to examine. The quest for the 
              unified self is doomed by the simple fact that there's nothing more there than 
              what's there, there is no unity. If the subject/object distinction is truly illusory, 
              then our intuitions of separateness and unified nature of a self opposed to a 
              world are only a part of the nature of experience, and not an actual reality beyond. </strong></span></p>

              <p><br>As AEN mentioned you cannot find a self. If you keep on finding it, it never exist, once you dun find it, true self emerges. It journeys together with existence like a wonderful family of bliss and peace. Buddhism is beautiful, but attachment and discrimination of Buddhism is an hindrance to realize true self, as basically, the teaching of Buddhism arises because of attachment over the blissful state of emptiness mind (highest heavenly state of dwelling).</p>

              But my main koan was before birth who am I, yours could be different
              
              But basically self inquiry comes down to, who is the source? And you "trace the radiance back to its source" as zen master chinul puts it
              
              Who is aware? Who is the source of awareness? Who am I?
              
              Actually the topic of self inquiry would be more appropriately discussed in my thread Certainty of Being as this thread is about the realisation of anatta while self inquiry leads to the realization of I AMness

              <p>actually, though yoga has spiritual origins, the yoga taught in classes nowadays have nothing spiritual in it and is some physical exercises done merely for physical fitness and some limited mental benefits but doesnt really lead to selfrealisation</p>
              <p>therefore it is quite useless to attend these classes if ur goal is self-realisation</p>
              <p>speaking from experience, self-realisation is not difficult at all. it took me less than two years of self-inquiry to reach self-realisation, while our moderator thusness had it even faster (also practicing self-inquiry). both of us can attest that self-inquiry is a direct path to self-realisation.</p>
              <p>you also dont really need much guidance for it, though i did have several conversations with seekers on the practice, see my e-book: </p>

              <p>oh btw seekers if they require guidance should seek those who are already enlightened... otherwise it  will be a case of the blind leading the blind</p>
