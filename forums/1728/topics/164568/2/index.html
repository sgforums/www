Even today there are Mahabodhisattva manifestations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Remember Bu Dai monk? (maitreya bodhisattva/"laughing buddha"), master han shan (incarnation of manjusri bodhisattva), shih te is Samantabhadra bodhisattva, etc etc...<br><br>In Tibet also got alot of manifestation. The 5th Dalai Lama, if I recall, is known to be the famous incarnation of Guan Yin also.<br><br><blockquote>An official once went to Kuo Ching Monastery on Tien Tai Mountain to ask questions of the Abbot Feng Kan. The official and the Abbot chatted. What was the official's name, you wonder? Don't ask me; I've forgotten. Perhaps it was you, or perhaps it was me; it's not for certain. The official said to the Abbot, Â“In the past, there used to be a lot of Bodhisattvas who came into the world, but there aren't any in this day and age. I'd like to meet a genuine Bodhisattva, but I can't find one.Â”<br><br>Abbot Feng Kan said, Â“Oh, you want to see a Bodhisattva? We have two here. I'll introduce you to them, and you can go see them.Â”<br><br>The official was duly surprised, Â“Two Bodhisattvas, right here? You mean ones made of clay, or carved wooden ones?Â”<br><br>Â“No,Â” replied the Abbot. Â“These two are flesh-body Bodhisattvas. They are living Bodhisattvas.Â”<br><br>Â“No kidding?Â” asked the official.<br><br>Â“I'm the Abbot here. Would I joke with you about a thing like that?Â”<br><br>Â“Who are they?Â”<br><br>Â“One is the cook and the other boils the water. One is named Han Shan and the other is named Shih Te. One is a transformation of Manjushri Bodhisattva, and the other is a transformation of Universal Worthy (Samantabhadra) Bodhisattva. They practice ascetic practices in this temple, doing menial tasks. They do the things that no one else likes to do. If you want to see them, it's quite simple. Just go to the kitchen and youÂ’ll find them there.Â”<br><br>The official asked the Guest Prefect to take him to the kitchen. There they found two grimy, tattered monks with long hair and beards, dirty faces, and a generally disreputable appearance. They appeared like present-day hippies. But the Abbot had said these two were Bodhisattvas, and so he dared not look down on them. Instead, he bowed to them.<br><br>Â“What are you doing?Â” the two demanded. Â“Why are you bowing to us?Â”<br><br>Â“Abbot Feng Kan said you were transformations of Manjushri and Universal Worthy Bodhisattvas, so of course I'm bowing to you.Â”<br><br>Â“Fen Kan's flapped his tongueÂ”--by which they meant he was loose-tongued. Â“HeÂ’s said too much this time.Â” So, as the official bowed, they backed up and backed up and backed up, one knows not how great a distance--probably several hundred steps from the kitchen to the rock cliff at the base of the mountain. Then they said, Â“Feng Kan has flapped his tongue. You didnÂ’t even bow to Amitabha. What are you doing bowing to us?Â”<br><br>Â“Who's Amitabha?Â” asked the official.<br>Â“The Abbot is. He's Amitabha Buddha come again. He came to China and became the abbot of Kuo Ching monastery on Tien Tai mountain. Go bow to him. Leave us alone.Â”<br><br>As the official stood there in amazement, the two grimy monks took one last step backwards and disappeared into the rock cliff. That place is now known as Moonlight Cliff on Tien Tai Mountain--the spot Han Shan and Shih Te disappeared into.<br><br>The official hurried back into Kuo Ching Monastery to bow to the Abbot Feng Kan--Amitabha Buddha. But when he arrived inside, he found that the Abbot had sat down and entered the stillness. HeÂ’d entered nirvana. The official now knew that the Abbot had been Amitabha Buddha come again, but it was too late. He had missed his opportunity. The official realized at that time that nobody knew Abbot Feng Kan was the transformation of Amitabha Buddha until he passed away.<br><br>Why don't Buddhas and Bodhisattvas let people know who they are when they come? If everyone knew, everyone would be bowing all day long one after another to to them the point that it would be pretty disruptive. There would be no time left to cultivate. So they don't want to let on to who they are.<br><br>That's the way it is in Buddhism. One would never announce, Â“Look! I'm enlightened!Â” Â“I'm a Bodhisattva!Â” Â“I'm a Buddha!Â” People like that are no different from the ones being discussed in this section of the Sutra. IÂ’ve never met anyone who admitted he was enlightened. Neither Elder Master Hsu Yun, nor any of the other enlightened monks in China ever said a word about being enlightened, even if asked directly. There's no such thing in Buddhism, except perhaps in Â“New Buddhism.Â” Here in America, there isÂ“new dharma.Â”</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by surfbabe:</div><div class="quote_body">Is the above true?<br><br>Is that why he sits on the right of Buddha (West), while Avalokitesvara sits on the left of Buddha (East)?</div></blockquote><strong>Buddhism and Other Religions</strong><br><br>Though Boston University professor Stephen Prothero has warned about a shallow and banal American "Boomer Buddhism," the Dalai Lama said he is generally not discouraged about the type of Buddhism he sees when he visits the West. He believes that people from different areas should keep their own faith. "Changing religion is not easy," he said. "Sometimes it creates more confusion." If someone in the West finds Buddhism more suitable, "It is their individual right, but it is extremely important to keep their respect towards their own traditional religion."<br><br>He expressed appreciation for Gere's efforts as a celebrity to spread Buddhist dharma (or teaching). He did not seem concerned about the depth or style of Buddhist devotion in America, except to make a point against what he called New Age Buddhists who take concepts from every religion. "If they do that and make clear this is something new, that is all right. If they claim that such a mixture is traditional Tibetan Buddhism, then this is not right."<br><br>The Dalai Lama is no advocate of one world religion. He has consistently spoken against this in his public speeches. "So if one is always trying to look at things in terms of similarities and parallels, there is a danger of rolling everything up into one big entity," he writes in The Good Heart, his book about the teachings of Jesus. "I do not personally advocate seeking a universal religion; I don't think it advisable to do so. And if we proceed too far in drawing these parallels and ignoring the differences, we might end up doing exactly that!"<br><br>But if not a universal religion, what about a universal following of Buddha? Why does he not simply urge people to follow the path of Buddha as the only truth?<br><br>He replied by citing India's pluralistic past and said that contradictions in Buddha's own philosophical teaching have forced Buddhists to realize that "one teaching or one view will not satisfy."<br><br>"To some people Christianity is much more effective, in some other case, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, or Zoroastrianism," he said. "Even if I say that Buddhism is the best, that everybody should follow Buddhism, everybody is not going to become a Buddhist."<br><br>He laughed.<br><br>"But you do believe Buddhism is the best, don't you?"<br><br>"Yes," he replied, "I can say that for me personally, Buddhism is best because the Buddhist approach is most effective to me."<br><br>"This does not mean Buddhism is best for everyone. No," he said when pushed further. "Now, for my Christian brother or sister, Christianity is best for him or for her." But Christianity, he said, is not the best for him.<br><br>"Here, the concept of one religion, one truth, is very relevant for the individual," he said, qualifying his other statements about one religion. "But for the community it must be several truths, several religions."<br><br>He believes this solves the contradiction between religions, though he said that there is a unity of all major religions on "the message of compassion, forgiveness, tolerance, contentment, simplicity, then self-discipline."<br><br>In terms of his own faith, the Dalai Lama drew a parallel between emotional love for Buddha and Christian love for Jesus. He said that his reflection on Buddha's teaching and sacrifice has led him to tears at times.<br><br>Does he thank Buddha for the good things in his life?<br><br>"Frankly speaking, my own happiness is mainly due to my own good karma," he said. "It is a fundamental Buddhist belief that my own suffering is due to my mistakes. If some good things happen, that is mainly due to my own good actions, not something related to a direct connection with Buddha."<br><br>In our interview, we devoted considerable time to the identity and integrity of Jesus. The Dalai Lama seemed at ease with the questioning, even while admitting that this was possibly the toughest area for exploration between evangelical Christians and Buddhists.<br><br>I reminded him of his belief that Jesus is "a fully enlightened being" and asked, "If Jesus is fully enlightened, wouldn't he be teaching the truth about himself? Therefore, if he is teaching the truth, then he is the Son of God, and there is a God, and Jesus is the Savior. If he is fully enlightened, he should teach the truth. If he is not teaching the truth, he is not that enlightened."<br><br>As the Dalai Lama felt the momentum of the question, he laughed more than at any other time in the interview. He obviously understood the argument, borrowed from C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity.<br><br>"This is a very good question," he said. "This is very, very important, very important." Even in Buddha's case, he said, a distinction must always be made between teachings that "always remain valid" and others that "we have the liberty to reject."<br><br>He argued that the Buddha knew people were not always ready for the higher truth because it "wouldn't suit, wouldn't help." Therefore, lesser truths are sometimes taught because of the person's ignorance or condition. This is known in Buddhist dharma as the doctrine of uppayah, or skillful means. The Dalai Lama then applied this to the question about Jesus.<br><br>"Jesus Christ also lived previous lives," he said. "So, you see, he reached a high state, either as a Bodhisattva, or an enlightened person, through Buddhist practice or something like that. Then, at a certain period, certain era, he appeared as a new master, and then because of circumstances, he taught certain views different from Buddhism, but he also taught the same religious values as I mentioned earlier: Be patient, tolerant, compassionate. This is, you see, the real message in order to become a better human being." He said that there was absolutely no lying involved since Jesus' motivation was to help people.</div>
