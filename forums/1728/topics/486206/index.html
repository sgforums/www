              <p>Hi Bro. Shi’an, Thanks for sharing your knowledge with us. Though 
              have heard and read this åœ†é€šç«  some time ago, but only now do I realise 
              its meaning… and it is enlightening. This will further reinforce our 
              confidence in å¿µä½› practice. I have started and will make an effort to 
              recite the åœ†é€šç«  daily to strengthen this understanding. Do continue this 
              course for the benefit of all if not more beings… çºŒä½›æ…§å‘½ï¼�é˜¿å½Œé™€ä½›! Kind 
              Regards, <strong>Andrew</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Bro Shi’an, once again, thank you for conducting å¤§åŠ¿è‡³è�©è�¨å¿µä½›åœ†é€šç« , a 
              sutra which is not commonly known, which even many Buddhists are not 
              aware of. Upon comprehending the narration by å¤§åŠ¿è‡³è�©è�¨, this short 244-word
               sutra indeed develops a feeling within that Amituofo is of close 
              proximity and is always ready to welcome us (his ‘children’) back 
              ‘home’. My aspiration to be reborn in Pure Land hence stretches even 
              further. I have started to recite this sutra followed by continuous 
              Nianfo during night chanting at home and I do feel a stronger sense of 
              devotion and good faith in Amituofo. I will continue to develop habitual
               Nianfo during times when my mind is at rest (idle), ie. waiting, 
              walking, exercising, doing household chores, moments before sleep, etc… 
              It’s great that you’ve introduced this course which may be ‘simple’ in 
              content, but deep in result if we put it into sincere practice. With 
              Metta, <strong>Bro. Tuck Khuen</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Teacher Shi’an, thanks for creating this new course. It is very 
              enriching and interesting. It teaches us the proper way of Nianfo and to
               understand its benefits. I enjoyed your lessons. Keep it up! Amituofo, <strong>Choy Leng</strong></p>
              <p>Really grateful to encounter this Nianfo practice as a means and path
               to realise enlightenment – an idea which I had ruled out as simply not 
              possible in our world. It gives hope and I will always be grateful that 
              it gives me the chance to help my family and maybe friends to reach Pure
               Land. – <strong>Adeline</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Shi’an, thank you for your tips on å¿µä½›. Previously, I tried hard to
               fight stray thoughts during chanting aloud. The chanting was like any 
              ‘mundane’ task when my mind became idle and started to do some 
              ‘multi-tasking’. After attending your classes, I learnt wholeheartedness
               is an important factor and it has to start with the mind… Thank you 
              again for the inspirations. Attending your classes helps to strengthen 
              my faith. Amituofo _/|\_ – <strong>Rebecca</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks Shi’an, for your teaching and valuable guidance. I have a 
              better understanding of meditative chanting and have made improvement in
               my practice. I have also realised how profound the Pure Land teaching 
              is and hope more will come to have this realisation. Regards, <strong>Mee Nah</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks for your notes. So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed your 
              classes. The notes that followed after each class, especially, are very 
              helpful! Amituofo, <strong>Wei Peng</strong></p>
              <p>Dear Brother Shen, thank you for being so dedicated to your mission 
              of sharing the Dharma! æ„Ÿæ�©… Thank you for your time. Amituofo, <strong>Jo</strong></p>
              <p>Nice course! Yuan Tong Zhang and Da Shi Zhi Pusa’s strength is indeed inspiring. Thanks for the teachings. Amituofo, <strong>Shawn</strong></p>
