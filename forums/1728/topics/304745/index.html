In order to appease them, animals are slaughtered and offered to these 'hungry ghosts', together with other food. Big feasts and other festivities are held during this month and the most 'auspicious day' is the 15th day of the month. It is so widespread that this yearly affair is dubbed the Month or Festival of the Hungry Ghosts. What is this all about?</span><br><br>Among the chief disciples of the Buddha was one named Maudgalyayana. He had immense supernatural powers: Deva-foot ubiquity which made it possible for him to appear at any place at will, the divine sight of Deva-eye to have unlimited vision of all things, large and small, near and distant; Deva-ear to hear all sounds regardless of the distance. Furthermore, he had the ability to read and understand whatever was in a person's mind. He also had the ability to see clearly the events that occurred in a person's many past lives aeons ago. Thus, Maudgalyayana is considered to be a Maha-Bodhisattva who is foremost in supernatural powers.<br><br>One day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. Her throat was as small as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha and insulted the Sangha [1], had no respect for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, Maudgalyayana wept in pain.<br><br>Notes<br>1. 	Sangha<br>The corporate assembly of at least 3 monks; in general the term has come to mean a monk, or monks.<br>2. 	Bodhi<br>From budh; knowledge, understanding; perfect wisdom; the illuminated or enlightened mind.<br><br>The Buddha continued to console him, "It is impossible to rely solely on your own effort to save your mother from the realm of the hungry ghost. The only way is to use the combined merits of the Sangha. The 15th day of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because of the purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised cultivation, many attain the Bodhi [2]. The merits that they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha is most delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this time, you can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the suffering of the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) through their immense merits. If the parents are still living, then they shall be blessed with good health, happiness and a life of abundance. This is the truly marvellous method of giving salvation to the deceased." Maudgalyayana was delighted to hear this, and carried out the Buddha's advice accordingly. Thus, on the 15th of the 7th month after the offering to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the suffering of the realm of the hungry ghost.<br><br>To give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 'Ullambana' method. After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express our gratitude and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, the passage of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, so much so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to the Dharma. Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The original act of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for feasting and making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to invite the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.<br><br>When we refrain from killing and protect all lives, we actually accumulate the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to kill other living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to all forms of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the tradition of offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be changed, the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of meat with vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are not able to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we could invite them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the deceased. In this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.</div>

We can chant and dedicate the merit to him, even if it is only a small portion, at least better than nothing.<br>If you want to generate more merit for the deceased one, do the chanting more sincerely, don't attached to the concept of giver, receiver and the object of giving. With that the merit will be more.<br><br>If the person already born in another realm, the chanting though can't change the fact that lets say he born in animal. But it will help in a way, for example, someone will buy the animal and release it or take it home as pet with good care.<br><br>Dedication of merit is something that can really take place.<br>Sometimes we see some people go to mountain for any remote place for long retreat and some thought that person don't think about other beings and no compassion.

                                      <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>if those beings today or in the future hear a name of Buddha or a Bodhisattva

              <p>There are many ways to help a deceased. Funeral rites, if properly done, with the right intentions and right preparations, will indeed help the deceased to attain a better rebirth in any of the 3 good realms (heaven, human and any Buddha's Pureland).</p>
              <p>What are the right intentions?</p>
              <p>Utmost sincerity and filial piety on the part of family members to help the deceased prior to and after his/her last breath.</p>
              <p>All family members should only think of how sincerely and badly they want to help their deceased family members when reciting faithfully and respectfully the name of any Buddha or Bodhisattva at his/her deathbed.</p>
              <p>Such sincerity and compassion will enable the spritual strength in the vows of any Buddha and Bodhisattva to guide the deceased towards a more peaceful and less painful death and a better rebirth in good realms after the deceased's consciousness or what people know as 'soul' has left the body.</p>
              <p>The right preparations include not eating any meat or killing any live animals/insects for at least 30 days, the most would be 49 days. This is what Buddhist funeral rites are generally about.</p>
              <p>For more details, please consult the sutra of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's Original Vows. Feel free to ask again if you come across any verses that you do not understand.</p>
              <p>Hope my comments can help in some way.</p>

              One day a man approached the Buddha and plead him to do a ceremony for his death parents.Well,if Buddha personaly do the ceremony,you can think how powerful it will be,i think sure go to heaven or Brahma realm.
              The Buddha replied saying that he dont do ceremonies for the dead or living.But,the man keep pestering and pestering,even telling the Buddha that why other sect or religion is doing it and not you.
              The Buddha knowing its time to help this man.He ask this man to wait for him by the river tomorrow and he will do the ceremony,but must prepare two earthened(made of mud)pot,one contains oil,the other contains stones.The man is so very happy and ran home to prepare everthing the Buddha said,also thinking his parents will be going to a very good place like heaven.
              The next day the Buddha arrived at the meeting place.He ask the man is everything ready.The man replied yes and very eager and curious waiting to see what the Buddha will do.Now, the Buddha said,"throw the pot containing stones into the  river".The Buddha then ask the man to pray and said out loud,stones....ah...stones...ah....please float up.The man stared at Buddha and was thinking not possible right.The man do the same thing to the pot of oil,shouting oil.....ah...oil...ah..please sink down.The man then told the Buddha that it is not possible for stone to float and oil to sink.The Buddha replied,same as the force of Karma,if a man do good he will will float up,if a man do bad action,he sure to sink down.This is the law of Karma.(no matter what religion or believe you are in,you cannot escape that).

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Whether chanting works or not, its still not the main thing. The main thing Ajahn and the Ksitigarbha sutra is trying to tell us is that our karma lies within us and that only we can help ourselves. There is in actual fact nobody that can save us, not even buddha. Therefore a buddhist should never believe that there is any saviour out there who can save us because we really reap what we sow.  Whether or not our next life is good or bad really depends on our karma at the end of our this life. There only way to help ourselves is to do good through action,speech and thought. Not saying that chanting is not helpful, but it would be also meaningless if we chant all day yet not wholesome in our action,speech and thought right?</p></div>

              <p>Let me summarise:</p>
              <p>Believe in the compassionate vows of the Bodhisattva and Buddha when chanting. Consistently correct your unwholesome thoughts and behaviour. Whether you succeed or not depends on the right motivation and understanding.</p>
              <p>I wish to encourage you by saying: In many scriptures, it is mentioned or clearly implied that those who hear or recite (mantra, sutra, Bodhisattva/Buddha's name) by chance, wholeheartedly, half-heartedly or for the sake of it, will eventually attain spiritual enlightment and hence liberation from all kinds of suffering.This is the same for everyone.</p>
              <p>Do your best to chant as sincerely, as wholeheartedly as possible for the deceased, and continue to believe in all Bodhisattvas and Buddhas' compassion and skillful means to help all sentient beings.</p>
              <p>With such a mindset, the positive and wholesome energy from your heart will further empower the mantra/sutra/Buddha's name and the merits when dedicated after your recitation will definitely help any deceased.</p>
              <p>Take care. ^_^</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>if i may add my personal views here. In my tradition (Jodo Shinshu - Japanese Pure Land), we conduct funeral and memorial services not for the dead, but more for the living. It gives the living a chance to commemorate the life of the deceased, and enables them to have another opportunity to encounter Buddha-Dharma again. Those who seek rebirth in Amitabha's Pure Land, no matter under what circumstances they died in, if they have entrusted themselves, will be reborn in the Pure Land, so there is no further need for us to dedicate our minute merits (when compared to Amitabha's) to them, since Amitabha has done all the work. All we need, is to recite His Name in Gratitude.</p>

              <p>It is possible to help someone who is about to pass away by doing good deeds on their behalf...</p>
              <p>1) Offer food dana to monks. </p>
              <p>2) Donate the deceased's assets to charity organisation. Other good deeds etc.</p>
              <p>3) Dana for printing of dharma materials, temple.</p>
              <p>4) If one is skillful, one could remind the person of his/her good deeds during his/her brink of death.</p>
              <p>5) Chanting and dedicate the merits to the latter and his/her yuan jia who might come to disturb him/her during his last moment. </p>
              <p>As for helping the deceased, i think even if they are reborn into another world. What we do today will affect the environment and people, near or far. This effect of our action might have some effect on the deceased. My two cents.</p>
