              that shook the mountainous Himalayan country of Nepal, killing many thousands
              and reducing ancient temples and shrines to rubble, brought an unwanted
              reminder of the profound historical, religious, and artistic importance of the
              Kathmandu Valley. In its unique and sacred Hindu and Buddhist landscape can be
              found seven separate World Heritage Sites, a concentration of monuments
              unmatched anywhere else in the world. Yet a month before the earthquake hit,
              Nepalese art was already in the headlines on the other side of the globe, as
              art market prices for Himalayan Buddhist treasures reached new highs in the
              latest round of auctions amid a spate of seizures of stolen art.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; color: #666666; text-transform: uppercase;"></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>Over
              the past few years, demand for Buddhist art has rocketed, driven primarily by
              the new generation of superrich Chinese collectors obsessed with reclaiming
              parts of what they consider their lost cultural heritage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>New
              York has traditionally been a major hub of the market for South Asian,<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> Himalayan, and Chinese antiquities. In recent years the city’s dealer-led Asia
              Week initiative, arranged around the March auctions, has exploded into an
              event-filled jamboree organized to accommodate a free-spending nine days of
              antiquities shopping among this new and burgeoning Chinese clientele.<strong></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>This
              year, all eyes were on a seven-part auction at Christie’s of Chinese, South
              Asian, and European antiquities belonging to the late Robert Hatfield
              Ellsworth, a New York dealer and connoisseur known as the King of Ming. At
              this prodigiously hyped, 2,000-lot marathon sale, which recalled the giant
              collection auctions of an earlier age, the star Himalayan object was a
              two-foot-high gilt-bronze image of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of
              compassion, a spectacular example of 13th-century Nepalese sculpture that once
              stood on a mantelpiece in Ellsworth’s 22-room Manhattan apartment. The
              $8,229,000 paid by an anonymous, but almost certainly Chinese, bidder went far
              beyond the $3 million high estimate, setting a new record price for a work
              of art from Nepal. Like many of the pieces on offer, it had originally been in
              the pan-Asian collection assembled by financier Christian Humann in the 1970s
              and bought by Ellsworth after Humann’s death in 1981.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>“The Ellsworth collection was unique,” says Sandhya
              Jain-Patel, head of the Indian and Southeast Asian art department at Christie’s
              New York. “I don’t think we will see anything like it again.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>For Chinese collectors, Buddhist art is an
              increasingly fashionable alternative to the overheated contemporary art market.
              The rise of Chinese nationalism and the re-embracing of traditional culture
              that was once so brutally repressed by the Cultural Revolution have made the
              reclamation of the spiritually and artistically rich heritage of esoteric
              Himalayan Buddhism an attractive counterpoint to rampant 21st-century
              materialism. More than anything else, this new taste has focused on the
              patronage of the third and fifth emperors of the Ming Dynasty, Yongle and
              Xuande, who embraced Tibetan Buddhism during the first half of the 15th
              century. Their rule heralded a rich phase of imperial patronage and cultural
              florescence that saw the construction of the Forbidden City in the new capital
              of Beijing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>Yongle artists, if not actually Nepalese in origin,
              were certainly working in the same traditions of classical Newari metalwork
              that had been disseminated throughout the monasteries and shrines of the
              Himalayan region by traveling guilds of craftsmen, many of them Buddhist monks
              themselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>A small, Yongle-era gilt-copper-alloy deity from a
              Vajrabhairava shrine was the top lot for Bonhams during its Asia Week auctions;
              it sold for $893,000, more than doubling its high estimate of $350,000. An
              image of the sun god Surya, it is believed to have been one of eight Hindu
              deities from the base of a monumental throne, an example of the religious
              syncretism characteristic of the Tibetan Buddhism patronized in the Yongle
              court.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>The second half of the 20th century saw many
              Buddhist treasures transported out of Asia, to end up in museums and private
              collections in Europe and America. For many Chinese collectors, bringing these
              works of art back home is now a matter of national pride as well as spiritual
              merit. In October 2013 a large, Yongle-era gilt-bronze image of a seated
              Shakyamuni Buddha whipped up frenzied competition among big-spending Chinese
              collectors at Sotheby’s Hong Kong. Zheng Huaxing, the collector who eventually
              bought for it for $30.3 million—a world record for Chinese
              sculpture—theatrically bowed toward the cardinal points of the room before
              prostrating himself in prayer in front of the Buddha statue after the sale.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>The wild spending shows no signs of abating. Last
              November at Christie’s Hong Kong, a magnificent silk<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">thangka</em><span> </span>depicting the deity Rakta Yamari,
              which had changed hands for only $4 million in 2002, sold for
              $45 million. The buyer was Liu Yiqian, an investment tycoon and onetime
              taxi driver who, with his wife, Wang Wei, owns China’s largest private museum,
              in Shanghai, and has spent $115 million on art in the last year alone. Liu
              continued racking up the purchases in New York, spending nearly
              $19 million on two Buddhist works. One was a 39-leaf, gold-on-blue Ming
              Dynasty Buddhist sutra, estimated by Sotheby’s at $100,000 to $150,000, which
              triggered a bidding war that ramped the price up to $14 million, making it
              the week’s top lot. His other buy was a fabulous 11th- to 12th-century Tibetan
              bronze seated yogi that once stood on the headboard in Ellsworth’s bedroom, for
              which Liu paid $4.9 million. Ever the extrovert, the night before the
              auction Liu posted pictures of himself on social media dressed only in his
              underwear and seated in the same lotus position as the statue.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>According to dealer Fabio Rossi of London- and Hong
              Kong–based Rossi &amp; Rossi, Chinese taste is evolving fast as increasing
              numbers of new collectors become active in the market. “The Chinese are on a
              rapid learning curve,” he says. “Traditionally, Chinese buyers have been
              concerned with good condition and perfect gilding, but now we are seeing them
              becoming more aware of the subtleties of the field.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>“There are strong collecting communities in Taiwan
              and Hong Kong as well as mainland China,” adds Rossi. These buyers are served
              by an ever-growing number of dealers and agents as well as auction houses such
              as Hanhai in Beijing, which has its own dedicated Buddhist art department. In
              addition to China’s numerous private museums, Asian institutions actively
              collecting include the National Palace Museum in Taipei and the Singapore Asian
              Civilisations Museum.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>At this year’s tefaf in Maastricht, one of the
              standout Himalayan pieces exhibited by Rossi &amp; Rossi was an exceptionally
              large gilt and cast-copper image of a seated Vajra-dhara, a spectacular example
              of Nepalese repoussé work probably made in a Tibetan monastery in the
              16th century—although the crown is likely 19th century—for which the
              dealers are asking around $2 million.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>“Whereas Tibetan sculptures were locked up in
              monasteries and venerated as treasures, in Nepal worshippers always had direct
              contact with the images of their deities,” notes Edward Wilkinson, a Himalayan
              art specialist at Bonhams. “They would be rubbed, fed, anointed with liquids,
              painted, and sprinkled with colored powders.” The resulting imperfect condition
              of Nepalese bronzes has traditionally discouraged Chinese buyers, but has been
              one of the aspects most appreciated by collectors in the West.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>“Nepalese bronzes are very rare, but for Chinese
              collectors, condition is still an issue,” says Rossi. “New Chinese collectors
              will generally look at Tibet first, but their taste and knowledge are evolving
              fast.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>The kind of pristine condition most in demand is
              exemplified by the top-priced sculpture in Sotheby’s Asia week sale of
              Himalayan, Indian, and Southeast Asian art: a fine Tibetan gilt-copper-alloy
              figure of Chakrasamvara<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> and his consort, Vajravarahi in ecstatic union (est. $400–600,000), which
              sold for $1,570,000.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>There is clearly a danger that the deep-pocketed
              Chinese will monopolize the market. Chinese dealers or agents scrupulously
              monitor all levels of the trade. “If a Himalayan piece comes up in an auction
              in New Orleans, they will be there,” says Wilkinson. “Now we are even seeing
              them buying Indian Buddhist art such as Gandharan or Pala works.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>According to John Eskenazi, a London dealer with
              long experience selling Himalayan art, there are still collectors in Europe and
              America who are seriously focused on this field, many originally inspired by
              groundbreaking exhibitions<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> in the 1980s like those curated by Pratapaditya Pal at the Los Angeles
              County Museum of Art. “The appeal of Nepalese art is that it is in favor of
              compassion,” Eskenazi says. “Not only is it very rare, but it has a very
              approachable quality compared with Tibetan art and has always been collected
              with great enthusiasm in the West.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>One of the most high-profile collections of
              Himalayan art to emerge in recent years has been that assembled by Shelley and
              Donald Rubin and displayed at the Rubin Museum, a former Barneys department
              store in Manhattan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>The more wealthy American museums are also prepared
              to make purchases, often acting with the help of donors. In 2012, the
              Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York bought a rare 11th-century Nepalese
              bronze of Vishnu riding on Garuda, while the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, in
              Richmond, has made a number of acquisitions including that of a spectacular
              12th- to 13th-century Nepalese ritual crown, gilded and set with jewels.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>The existence of a further potential market was also
              demonstrated last December when Pundole’s auction house in Mumbai sold
              Himalayan art from the     collection of the late Roshan
              Sabavala, the widow of a Parsi industrialist who had acquired most of the 121
              lots in Delhi in the 1950s and ’60s. The sale was a tremendous success,
              although, since many of the pieces were not exportable from India, prices never
              reached the stratospheric levels that Chinese      interest
              has generated elsewhere. The top lot was a gilt-bronze image of Hevajra, made
              in Nepal in the 13th or 14th century, which sold for just over $400,000.
              International awareness and legislation over matters of stolen cultural
              heritage have been increasing in recent years, but the sale and collecting of
              antiquities from Nepal and Tibet have always retained a degree of controversy.
              Stolen and smuggled Asian antiquities have recently been the subject of a major
              federal investigation into the activities of New York art dealer Subhash
              Kapoor, who is currently in prison in Chennai, India. The Manhattan District
              Attorney’s Office released details last April of the largest seizure of
              antiquities in United States history, most from storage units belonging to
              Kapoor. The majority were Indian, but among the pieces confiscated were also a
              considerable number of bronze figures and ritual artifacts from Nepal and
              Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>In recent years, efforts have increased among Nepali
              scholars and conservationists to trace the missing heritage of the Kathmandu
              Valley. Jürgen Schick, author of<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">The Gods Are Leaving the Country: Art Theft from
              Nepal</em>, 2006, estimates that 90 percent of the major pieces of Nepalese
              sculpture outside Nepal have been smuggled out of the country since the 1960s,
              when Nepal first opened its doors to Western tourism, becoming a favorite
              destination on the hippie trail and later for trekking and mountaineering. The
              whole of the Kathmandu Valley was declared a World Heritage Site as far back as
              1979, but the great number of individual sites and shrines has made it almost
              impossible to defend from looters comprehensively.</span></p>

              have further encouraged the flow of precious art out of the country. Of course,
              it may often be difficult if not impossible to determine when a particular work
              of art left the shrine it was made for and who legitimately owned it before it
              left the country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>Auction houses and dealers are all aware that it is
              more necessary than ever to research the provenance of anything they propose to
              sell. In reality this means ensuring that it will not later be revealed to have
              been stolen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>“We work hard to do our due diligence,” says
              Jain-Patel of Christie’s. “Two years ago we were informed that a set of
              12th-century Nepalese painted wooden book covers had been stolen from the
              National Library in Kathmandu, and we immediately withdrew them from the
              auction and arranged for them to be returned.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #333333;'>The Musée Guimet in Paris, too, has expressed a
              willingness to return stolen works, including an 11th-century figure of
              Uma-Maheshvara taken from Bhaktapur in 1984 and a 12th-century figure of Vishnu
              with Lakshmi and Garuda stolen from Patan in the late 1970s. The Nepali
              authorities have been criticized, however, for their lack of initiative in
              arranging the proper legal procedures for such repatriations. Whether the
              earthquake and its aftermath will prove an incentive or a distraction is
              difficult to tell.</span></p>

              flourish at its current level is also hard to predict. It may hinge on the
              Chinese economy, which, as of this writing, has been cooling. Any art market
              boom always carries with it the specter of a forthcoming crash, but in the case
              of Himalayan bronzes, the signs seem to indicate that the only way is up.  </span></p>
