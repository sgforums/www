              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  I’m aware that in the weeks that I’ve been here, in the talks weekly,
                  there have been a few threads that run through the talks. And so I want
                  to take one of those threads and fill it out a bit, quite a bit
                  actually, explore it and expand it quite a bit. And that is the nature
                  of mind. Or the nature of Awareness. So what does it mean to realize
                  the true nature of Mind, the true nature of Awareness? I’m also aware
                  that everyone here obviously has different practice background. You’ve
                  been doing different practices in the time that you’ve been here,
                  you’ve had exposure to different teachings in your life, etc. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  to some, what we’re talking about tonight will seem very very relevant,
                  very very apropos. To others, it would seem less pertinent right now,
                  less relevant. And if that’s the case, if it doesn’t seem like this is
                  really relevant to my practice right now, I hope that you can just
                  listen. I hope that it’s still interesting. And I hope that one can
                  listen with a sense of possibility, so just listening to it, “ok not
                  right now, but there’s a sense of the possibility of practice,
                  possibility of an avenue to explore in practice.” And one can just
                  listen and file it for later. Just stick it somewhere, I’ll come back
                  to this later. And that’s a totally valid and wonderful way to listen
                  to a Dharma talk. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">And
                  actually, I should really, and in another situation I would have
                  devoted three or four or five Dharma talks just to this subject.
                  There’s much more to this than meets the eye, there’s much more to this
                  than meets the eye in terms of depth and enrichment. And yet I’m
                  steaming ahead and doing what’s foolish and try to put it all in one. I
                  hope it’s not too full, and again I hope it’s full enough for the
                  people that have been here and followed the threads, that it can raise
                  some questions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">But
                  more I’m interested in is offering some possibilities – how might one
                  practice to discover the nature of mind? How might one navigate through
                  practice as it deepens, as it evolves,</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">to actually come to that realization and then consolidate that realization, strengthen it. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So some words. <strong><em>Mind, Awareness, That Which Knows, and Consciousness. </em></strong>In
                  this talk tonight, I’m using them all as synonyms. So I’m using them
                  interchangeably, and meaning the same thing by all of them. Sometimes
                  when we talk about mind, my mind is making such a fuss, my mind is so
                  difficult – we actually mean all the realm of thoughts. But you also
                  get in the Dharma talking about Mind, meaning just Awareness</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">or
                  Consciousness. Sometimes, people leave out the word Consciousness,
                  people in Buddhist circles leave out the word Consciousness from that
                  group. And there’s a reason they do that. Partly because the Buddha was
                  a little bit dismissive of consciousness, in the sense it’s just
                  something impermanent, not-self, etc. But actually to leave it out
                  obscures something. It obscures, which I hope it’ll become clear in the
                  talk and I hope it makes sense.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So,
                  different streams of Dharma traditions kind of make a promise, and
                  it’s: if we understand the nature of mind deeply, the nature of
                  awareness, consciousness, etc, deeply, if we really understand that
                  deeply, there is freedom. That’s the promise. And that runs through a
                  lot of different Dharma traditions, a lot of different Buddhist
                  traditions. What I want to explore and what I’m asking right at the
                  beginning is, understand What about the nature of mind, what is it
                  about the nature of awareness that I need to understand? And with that,
                  How? How can I understand that? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  I’m gearing this talk not so much to questions of abstraction or
                  philosophy, that can be very interesting, I think has its place in
                  human’s (?) inquiry. But really talking on a very practice level. We,
                  as meditation practitioners. So often times we don’t really think about
                  the nature of mind. It’s not something we give that much reflection to.
                  Maybe, until we start meditating. And then, maybe we do. Because
                  meditation is a lot about Awareness, a lot about Consciousness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">And
                  at first, perhaps in the beginning years even of practice, the notion
                  of the Mind, or Awareness, as the metaphor of a mirror might feel very
                  apt. And obviously we obviously don’t think that there’s a mirror in us
                  that if we cut open our brain we get to this mirror. But that sense of
                  Awareness is somehow reflecting the world. We have that, even if it’s
                  not a conscious notion, that notion somehow embedded in us: Awareness
                  is something that reflects the world. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">And
                  in a way, we can see practice and the devotion to mindfulness and being
                  present and bare attention as a kind of polishing of that mirror to see
                  things as they really are, things as they truly are, to quote the
                  Buddha. And the constant practice to let go of the entanglement in the
                  story, the entanglement in the papanca (conceptual proliferation) and
                  complication, the opinions that we layer onto experience, the
                  pre-conceptions, the views, the images, the likes, the dislikes, all
                  that whole baggage of veil that covers over the actuality of
                  experience. When we have a sense of practice, just patiently polishing
                  the mirror, so that the awareness can reflect things as they really
                  are. And so sometimes, people use the phrase or word “Pure Awareness”
                  and that actually means very different things used in different
                  contexts. But that might be a meaning. Awareness is pure in the sense
                  that it’s free of all that papanchizing complication story, etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Having
                  that kind of model or metaphor, whether it’s conscious or unconscious,
                  can bring with it a lot of clarity, a lot of vividness into the
                  experience and I’m sure many of you have felt on retreat or as practice
                  times goes by, the actual imprint of perceptions becomes brighter, more
                  vivid. The actual grass seems greener, the lights seem more colorful,
                  everything stands out, a beautiful aliveness because we’re
                  metaphorically polishing that mirror. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">There’s
                  also something else that’s very helpful about the metaphor of the
                  mirror, and it’s just metaphor. If you think about a mirror, a mirror
                  remains unaffected by what passes in front of it and is reflected by
                  it. So I could be absolutely beautiful, I could be monstrously ugly, I
                  could be scary, I could be this or that or radiant or whatever but the
                  mirror is just still and reflecting. And in a way, incorporating that
                  kind of aspect of the metaphor into the practice lends itself towards
                  equanimity, can you see? Because there’s an aspect of the being that’s
                  unaffected. This aspect of mindfulness that’s just unaffected by what
                  passes in front. It’s very very useful.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Now,
                  there’re problems with this and I’m going to come back to this. I’m
                  going to lay out a few possible ways of conceiving the nature of
                  awareness, and then later come back to what the potential problems
                  there are with each of them. So that one with the mirror might be very
                  understandable and useful, certainly at the beginning years, really
                  years of practice, for most people, years. But after much practice or
                  some degrees of practice, a different sense of awareness can begin to
                  be discovered or opened to. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Now,
                  one possibility is through developing the attentiveness, developing the
                  mindfulness in a very sharp way, very focused awareness, very bright
                  attentiveness, microscopic kind of fine awareness and really refining
                  the mindfulness like that. And what happens is that the reality that’s
                  revealed to us through that lens is of a very fastly, rapidly changing
                  reality. Everything like pixels on the screen changing, like sand
                  falling on the surface of a lake, just change, change, change, arising
                  and passing, arising and passing, included in that consciousness. So
                  the sense of consciousness is of rapidly arising moments, moment of
                  consciousness, moment of consciousness, arises in relationship to
                  something. And you find this very commonly in the commentaries to the
                  Pali canon, it’s also a little bit in the Buddha said, but mostly in
                  the commentaries. But again, can be very useful if one can develop that
                  way just from the consistency of mindfulness. In that what it brings,
                  seeing all these impermanence, there’s nothing to hold on to.
                  Everything is just slipping through the fingers, like sand through the
                  fingers, including consciousness, can’t be clung to. And so letting go
                  happens with that. I say theoretically, because actually sometimes that
                  mode of working doesn’t actually bring a letting go, but theoretically
                  it brings a letting go and it certainly has that potential. So that’s
                  another possibility again, with its fruits.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">A
                  third one we’ve touched more on in the course of the talks here, and
                  it’s more practicing in the kind of more open out sense – and so
                  awareness kind of opens out into the whole field of experience and
                  phenomena. And this opening out of the practice lends itself to having
                  a sense of awareness as something very spacious. Especially when we
                  talk about silence a little bit. Awareness begins to seem incredibly
                  spacious, vast, unimaginably vast. Now this can be arrived at actually
                  through letting go. So the more we let go in practice, the likelihood
                  of the sense of awareness opening up in this very beautiful way. Very
                  vast awareness, dependent on letting go. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">And how do we let go? We could either just focus on letting go, we could</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">focus
                  on the impermanence and then we let go, or we could focus on the Anatta
                  – not me, not mine. That’s the three classic ways of letting go. That
                  sense of vast awareness might also be discovered or arrived at just by
                  kind of practicing in a kind of way that relaxes the attention. So
                  usually we attend to this object and that object, and another object,
                  and another object. But actually relaxing that propensity, and being
                  more interested in the space that opens up, rather than the objects or
                  things in the space. And we say you can rest then in Awareness, instead
                  of going out and doing things with objects, one just rests in that
                  space of Awareness that begins to opens up. This is something one can
                  do with the eyes open, or with the eyes close, actually completely
                  irrelevant. Practice it with the eyes open, practice it with the eyes
                  closed. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">One
                  can also arrive at something quite similar in a more focused and less
                  restful way and that is actually focusing in a very alive way in the
                  moment on the sense of awareness itself. All these is practiced,
                  everything that I’ve said so far comes out of practice and kind of
                  tuning the practice in a certain way and a little bit of directing at a
                  certain way and then these senses are discovered. One can actually do
                  it in a more focused way, actually focusing on awareness, it will bring
                  about a slightly different state. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  we can either use analogies to kind of help ourselves open to that
                  sense. So, the night sky. Just vast, black, night sky. And then
                  suddenly, fireworks. Burst of colors. A phenomena. Something is
                  happening in experience. And of course we say, “Wow, look at that,
                  amazing.” Dramatic event, phenomena. And in getting drawn into the
                  object, we lose the sense of the context, we lose the sense of the
                  space, the sky around that thing. Similarly you can say shooting star,
                  phenomena arises out of the space, does its things and then disappears
                  back into it. A cloud moving across the sky. Same thing, a sense of a
                  context, a space, which is Awareness, and the object in it. And giving
                  more attention to the space, the sense of Awareness, than the object. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So,
                  phenomena begin to seem as if they’re arising, passing, and living In
                  Awareness. Which is different from how we usually think of the world –
                  my Awareness is somehow in here, and the world is out there, and
                  there’s some kind of interaction going on. We begin a whole other sense
                  that the world of phenomena has been born, living and dying In
                  Awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Now,
                  I’m going through this very quickly, in other talks we spent more time
                  on this. But this is something incredibly beautiful. If I had more time
                  I would really emphasize that more. Something very very beautiful to
                  open up to. There’s an incredible peace to it. Just the sky, the space,
                  everything belonging to that. Real equanimity comes with it, and a real
                  sense of very deep freedom comes with it. If we practice over and over,
                  and develop that sense of Awareness. Now, someone doing this, might get
                  the sense that Oh, that sky, that Awareness in the sense of a big
                  spaciousness, that’s actually pure in the sense that it’s untainted,
                  unaffected by what arises and disappears and lives in it. So similar to
                  the Sky, shooting stars go through the Sky, fireworks go in the Sky,
                  Sky remains the same. Unaffected. Still. Tranquil. Imperturbable. Vast.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">And
                  one might be practicing in this way, and if one does one is usually
                  struck by this. There’s an incredible sense of depth and beauty here.
                  Incredibly striking and attractive place to discover. And if one is
                  practicing, when it’s heard of the Unconditioned, the Buddha talking
                  about the Unconditioned, or the Deathless, and very common for a
                  practitioner to think: this is it! Because it seems unchanging. Doesn’t
                  seem to change. Everything else is arising, living there a while, and
                  then dying back into it. Seems unchanging, and kind of eternal in the
                  sense of lasting forever in some unperturbed way. So one really wonders
                  or decides that it’s unconditional, or wonders.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Again,
                  practice is to be developed. I’m moving a lot of territories tonight,
                  very quickly. Laying out again, possible ways of navigating through
                  this. If one learns to cultivate that space and discover that space and
                  hang out and then sustain and be familiar it, it’s possible that it
                  deepens. It’s possible that the whole sense of it begins to deepen and
                  objects, the phenomena that occur begin to feel as if they’re made of
                  the same substance as the space of awareness. They’re made of the same
                  substance as Awareness. So you might have heard analogies like waves in
                  the oceans. Whatever happens, you, me, this, that, sounds, an event,
                  whatever, it’s all just waves in the Ocean of Being, or the Ocean of
                  Awareness. It’s all just the same substance taking different shapes.
                  Incredibly freeing and useful perspective to open to. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Everything
                  is just an impression in Awareness. And that in that sense, from that
                  perspective we could say, things, the things of the world, all things,
                  all phenomena, all observable phenomena are empty in the sense that
                  they’re not different from empty. They’re empty of being something
                  different from this vast insubstantial substance of Awareness. So
                  things seem empty in that sense, they seem insubstantial, they seem not
                  real in the sense of existing really outside of Awareness in the way
                  that we usually think things do, usually perceive things. Have a whole
                  different perception. With that too, as it deepens of course, there’s a
                  sense of incredible oneness. All is One. And one has heard that in the
                  teachings, different teachings, different traditions. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">All
                  is One. And sometimes we use the phrase Non-Duality, they use that in
                  that sense as everything is One. So it seems to tie in very strongly.
                  One has a real sense as this deepens of there being only One Mind. It’s
                  not my mind, your mind, his mind,</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">the
                  dog’s mind, whatever. It’s One Mind. One Vast Mind that encompasses
                  everything. And we hear about that in different teachings, some
                  Buddhist teachings, some non-Buddhist teachings. One Mind, or Cosmic
                  Consciousness, Awareness knowing itself. Everything is the play of
                  Consciousness, but that Consciousness kind of is the Base, it’s somehow
                  self-existent. That’s the Ultimate Reality. And so it’s very easy to
                  have that view, very liberating. Very useful. And these views are not
                  intellectual standpoints. I really like to stress this. They’re not
                  intellectual standpoints. They are views that people come to through
                  practice. So it’s not like someone is figuring out, “da da da da da”…
                  It’s actually through deep and sincere care and practice. This is the
                  practice that can easily, well not so easily, but eventually be come to.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">And
                  in that, there’s an incredible beauty, an incredible sense of mystery,
                  that the being opens to. A person who practices in that way a lot, who
                  practices at that level a lot, who cultivates that and looks to
                  cultivate that and learns, develops the skill, the art of really
                  hanging out there a lot, if you meet a person like that, they are going
                  to be really radiant. Very shiny. Very big aura. Very free. And they
                  will feel very free, at quite a deep level quite a lot of the time.
                  They will also probably be quite compassionate. A lot of love there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">The
                  Buddha makes a very marked point on one occasion, I think it was to
                  Ananda, which is never judge someone’s awakening or non-awakening,
                  enlightenment or non-enlightenment by how radiant they seem, by how
                  shiny they seem, by how glowing. Absolutely not the way you discern
                  where someone’s really at in the practice. But to practice at that
                  level will bring that, and to learn people do they develop it as kind
                  of what they’re going for, we’re talking about Buddhists and
                  non-Buddhists, and they learn to hang out there. Incredibly beautiful
                  and incredibly powerful.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  before I kind of go into this in a kind of deeper way, I really like to
                  make a point before I sort of say what’s the problems with these views.
                  I really want to make a point that all of these are to be cultivated,
                  so it’s not that we’re dismissing them out of hand immediately at all.
                  They’re to be cultivated. So we actually want to practice developing
                  these in our practice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">But,
                  there’s problems with them, when we look into this. So let’s take the
                  mirror one, for example. The notion of a mirror, the metaphor of the
                  mirror as something that gives a true reflection of a real world.
                  There’s a problem with that. I can’t find a stance in consciousness, I
                  can’t find a place from which to look, can’t find a moment of looking,
                  where there’s not something in the Mind, in Awareness, shaping,
                  fabricating, what is perceived. In that moment, in that present moment.
                  So the conditioning factors, they’re not just in the past, they’re in
                  the present as well. So what I see is always being shaped. I cannot
                  find a sort of zero point in the mind. Sometimes we think that’s what
                  mindfulness is, or that’s what equanimity is, it’s actually not. If one
                  actually goes into practice one sees one cannot find that place.</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">This
                  is one of the most fundamental insights of the Buddha, that it’s easy
                  to practice for a long time without going into this, I know we’ve
                  touched on it before in other weeks but it’s so important. If we don’t
                  see this, that what we perceived is being conditioned in the present by
                  how I’m seeing it and relating to it, we’re missing one of the most
                  fundamental and important insights of the Buddha. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">We
                  might say, what’s the problem with that vast Awareness? Well, one thing
                  is, it might seem that all phenomena arise in it and die back into it,
                  but what about my actual death? Actual time when I actually (?) over.</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">I
                  have to have a bit of faith that that will just be another event in
                  this Awareness. There’s no way of knowing that. It’s a leap of faith.
                  Is it possible to have such a deep insight that it’s actually not
                  dependent on faith anymore. There’s no sense of needing faith there. So
                  there is so much to this as said in the beginning of the talk, and to
                  beware of answers, I think of all us as practitioners, to beware of
                  answers to what is the ultimate nature of Awareness, etc, that are too
                  easy or too facile. Or also answers to what liberation might be, “it’s
                  just kind of hanging out in that place and realizing that it’s vast.”
                  Beware of answers that are too glib, too facile, too easy. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">I
                  feel, and there can be, for practitioners at that point for many times,
                  is a sense of uneasiness at that point. Despite all the beauty, despite
                  all the loveliness and the depth and the freedom that comes from it, at
                  some deep level in the being, there’s a sense of “mm, not quite sure
                  about this”. A real uneasiness. I think that needs to be cultivated,
                  that uneasiness. And one doesn’t stop probing and asking and
                  questioning. I actually remember years ago in my practice being on
                  retreats, and actually quite a long period of time where anytime I met
                  a teacher, I would ask them about this. And get all these different
                  takes, and then try to understand in my practice, trying to understand,
                  and one time feeling that I couldn’t understand it and I wasn’t happy
                  with any of the answers I got. And being so upset with that, that I
                  actually remember being on a retreat at Gaia House and just sitting
                  outside and crying. I think it’s really Ok in the quest for truth, in
                  the quest for liberation that there’s agitation at times. I think it’s
                  a sign of how much we care. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">With
                  that Big Space Awareness, the Vast Awareness, it’s the place where most
                  people would tend to stop their inquiry. It’s the most common place
                  nowadays to stop the inquiry. But there’s a lot of assumptions there. A
                  lot of assumptions. One is that Awareness is something simple and
                  passive. In the sense of it’s just there, and it just receives
                  experience. I think this came up in a question and answers or
                  something. Just here, and I hear the bird twitting, I didn’t …, it just
                  comes. Awareness is simple and passive and has a kind of naturalness to
                  it and a kind of natural openness to it, versus what sometimes we use
                  the word “mind” as a very complicated, enmeshed in thoughts, etc. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">But
                  is there an assumption that simple means true? So we’re very attracted
                  to simplicity, often times because our lives are very complex, and our
                  thinking minds seem very complex. And simplicity has a very “ah, that’s
                  nice, simple.” Feels soothing. Does it mean that it’s true? These are
                  the kinds of things one really needs to watch out for one’s
                  preconceptions, likes, assumptions. I think it’s really important to
                  bring into practice as much as possible the quality of integrity that
                  there’s a real sense of caring about the truth and not stopping short
                  and keeping the heart alive in its penetrating questioning. Not
                  settling too easy. Really caring and really being careful in one’s
                  inquiry. Part of integrity is a heart movement. Another part of
                  integrity is actually intelligence. It’s actually using one’s
                  intelligence as part of the integrity, part of the care in practice. So
                  not almost like leaving the intelligence outside of practice, outside
                  of our meditation practice. To me this is actually really important.
                  And because we often have a very difficult relationship with thought
                  and with discursive thoughts and the thinking mind, often we jettison
                  the whole of our intelligence as well, as we regard it as something we
                  need to get rid off in practice. That may be a huge mistake at times.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Does
                  there need to be a divorcing of head and heart? So just because my head
                  is getting involved and thinking through stuff, does that mean that my
                  heart has to close down? For a lot of people it does, but that’s just a
                  habit and that doesn’t have to be so. So it might feel better but it’s
                  just a feeling of it feeling better, and as such it doesn’t mean
                  anything about the truth. Again we might have an intuition that the
                  truth is this way, or that Awareness is this way, etc. But in a way,
                  lovely and good and helpful as that can be at times, it’s still just an
                  intuition, needs to be probed, needs to be questioned, needs to be
                  checked out.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Sometimes,
                  when we go to the texts of different Buddhist traditions, it seems as
                  if, especially the Vast Awareness, it seems we find something in the
                  texts that really corresponds to that. And I can find plenty of
                  references. But this is actually not as simple as it seems. Words can
                  sound very very similar when you get to a certain level in practice,
                  and we say empty or nothingness or vastness or this or that, and it
                  kind of all begin to sound very similar after some point. So it
                  behooves us I think to really be careful not to be sloppy with language
                  in our practice, as it's difficult, as precise as we can, which isn’t
                  easy. And not to throw out words or concepts, because as I said, I
                  can’t remember where it was in one of the talks. If I throw out
                  conceptuality too early, what happens is I’m just left with my default
                  unexamined concepts. I’ve done nothing to really dig them out. I’m just
                  saying concepts are not helpful. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">What
                  we also find if you do kind of check out a lot of texts on this is the
                  same words used in very different ways. So when we use words like
                  Awareness is luminous, but it turns out if you really probe that, that
                  luminous actually means empty. Or pure, meaning empty of inherent
                  existence. Doesn’t mean bright in that sense. You wonder why they’re
                  using that word. Or clarity, doesn’t mean clarity in the sense we would
                  usually mean clarity. Or even the word space, funnily enough, doesn’t
                  even mean space in the way we would usually mean space. It’s not easy. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">One
                  time the Buddha to a group of monks and he basically told them not to
                  see Awareness as The Source of all things. So this sense of there being
                  a vast awareness and everything just appears out of that and disappears
                  back into it, beautiful as that is, he told them that’s actually not a
                  skillful way of viewing reality. And that is a very interesting sutta,
                  because it’s one of the only suttas where at the end it doesn’t say the
                  monks rejoiced in his words. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">This
                  group of monks didn’t want to hear that. They were quite happy with
                  that level of insight, lovely as it was, and it said the monks did not
                  rejoice in the Buddha’s words. (laughter) And similarly, one runs into
                  this as a teacher, I have to say. This level is so attractive, it has
                  so much of the flavor of something ultimate, that often times people
                  are unbudgeable there. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">In
                  the Dzogchen tradition, there’s a very beautiful saying – very simple
                  but very beautiful. And it says, “trust your experience, but keep
                  refining your view.” Trust your experience, but keep refining your view
                  - there’s a lot of wisdom in that, a lot of wisdom. One of my teachers
                  years ago, when I was describing some of these states to him and
                  questioning, “Is this right? Is this real? Doesn’t seem …” And he said
                  to me actually, “Get attached, Rob. Get attached there, slow down, hang
                  out.” Of course, that was very surprising to hear. “Really?” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">We
                  need to actually hang out in these states, because through time they
                  work their way into the selves and into the view, and they begin
                  transforming the heart and transforming the view long-term. In terms of
                  freedom, in terms of opening, in terms of love. They really have that
                  power. So it’s interesting. You get different personalities. People who
                  want to park the bus there, and build the house, and arrive and finish
                  there. Not with the kind of agitated impetus to keep questioning. And
                  other people who want to move through too quick, it’s just different
                  personalities. So one needs to get attached but not stop there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  again, please see all these as in the context of how practice might
                  navigate through all these. Sometimes I really feel that people need to
                  fall in love with those kind of spaces. Something really feels touched
                  so beautifully inside. So, how might a practitioner move on from there?
                  How might one come to a deeper understanding? One might reveal that
                  that’s not quite it. Well, one clue is in the fact that if one really
                  develops one’s practice, it’s actually possible to experience both this
                  sort of rapid arising and disappearing of consciousness that I was
                  talking about, the very fine awareness. It’s actually possible to
                  experience that. And it’s actually possible to experience a very wide,
                  vast, spacious, still awareness. And if you really practice these kind
                  of stuff a lot, then it’s actually possible to have both those
                  experiences in the same sitting. See it one way, or see it another way.
                  And actually to choose which one to have. What does that imply? There’s
                  something right there that is at the core of all these. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Now,
                  sometimes I come across people, I won’t say who, but people who
                  actually then come up with a kind of theory, “Consciousness is what’s
                  called the rapid arising and passing, and you something else called
                  Awareness, which is the vast thing in which consciousness takes place
                  and the Awareness knows the consciousness which knows the object.” It’s
                  kind of this quite complex theory that’s actually just a theory. Might
                  be a perception. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">But
                  there’s something here to question. Could it be that Awareness or
                  Consciousness or Mind or whatever name we give it, that Awareness and
                  Perception are inseparable? In other words, when I focus my mind in a
                  certain way, when I focus in a very narrow, microscopic way, I have
                  certain perceptions and I will have certain perceptions and sense of
                  awareness. When I focus my mind, when I use my mind in a different way,
                  I’ll have different kinds of perceptions of things, and with that a
                  different perception or sense of awareness. So the sense of awareness
                  takes on the aspect of perception. We could say Awareness,
                  Consciousness, or whatever you want to call it is bound up with
                  perception. This is at the core, and this is something we want to
                  understand. Doesn’t sound very glamorous at first at all. But this is
                  what we need to understand. So how might I work with this?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Well,
                  one way, shouldn’t say cheap and easy way but um (laughs), one way of
                  doing it is to practice in this vast way. You get the sense of vastness
                  and a sense of awareness as vast. And yet a kind of global sense of
                  awareness. But then kind of introduce the thought subtly, the insight
                  subtly, that the sense of awareness is also so to speak – happening in
                  awareness. In other words that’s just a perception too. And you
                  introduce that, and see what happens. See where it goes. That can be
                  very powerful for some people and very useful. But I don’t think it
                  will give a really full, probably not, a full understanding of the
                  whole picture of what is going on. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  there’s many possibilities to navigate through, but one possibility,
                  we’ve touched on this in here before, is using the practice of
                  not-self, not-me, not-mine. Regarding whatever comes up, regarding
                  whatever phenomena as not-me, not-mine, not-self. And we’ve touched on
                  developing that as a practice. I’m not going to go too much into it
                  again. But including in that seeing the awareness as I said I think in
                  the last talk, seeing awareness or consciousness also as not-me,
                  not-mine, I am not that. This is a practice, as I said in other talks,
                  that we can develop and we want to develop. We really go on a journey
                  with it and we deepen it and develop it. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">And
                  what happens potentially when we develop it, and in the moments when we
                  managed to (it might be just an instance or two) unhook the
                  identification from objects or awareness. In those moments, what
                  happens? Well, a number of things can happen. One of them is, the whole
                  experience opens up to a whole other level of freedom, a whole
                  different sense of freedom because at that point there is no
                  identification with either object or subject. There is no
                  identification with any of the five aggregates. So of course there is
                  gonna be a lot of freedom. Feels very free.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">But
                  the second thing that will happen if one learns how to hang out there
                  and learns to re-sustain that as a way of looking, and we’ve touched on
                  this as well, so just to repeat: it’s that objects and perceptions
                  begin to fade, because I’m not supporting them by identifying. Objects
                  and perceptions begin to fade, this is so, so crucial an observation in
                  Dharma insight unfolding. Including the perception of space will fade.
                  Now, if I have a notion of awareness as vast, and space itself begins
                  to kind of fade or lose it’s reality. Well, I can’t really call
                  awareness vast because space isn’t something really real. And maybe my
                  notion of awareness as something really vast is actually re-enforcing
                  or reifying a sense of space.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">If
                  objects fade completely, completely, completely gone as it really
                  deepens, is what’s left Awareness in the usual sense that we call, that
                  we use that word Awareness? So let’s take a whole big step backwards
                  and actually ask actually the most basic question of all, which often
                  as meditators we don’t really ask, which is, “What on Earth do we mean
                  by Awareness?” So we use that word all the time, just hold on a minute,
                  what do we mean by Awareness, what do we mean by Consciousness?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">In
                  English we have a noun, “Awareness”, “Consciousness”, a noun, and nouns
                  have a way of giving something a kind of sense of independent reality –
                  it’s a clock, </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">a
                  thingy. It’s a thingy. And because Awareness or Consciousness is a
                  noun, it seems to be a thing, a thingy. Pali apparently is more of a
                  verb based language. When we think of what Awareness means, well it’s
                  Awareness Of something, rather than Some Thing, some substance, it’s
                  Awareness Of something. Putting it in verb terms, we could say it’s
                  knowing. Consciousness or Awareness means knowing. Now, knowing needs a
                  known, ok. For there to be knowing there has to be something that’s
                  known. And if there’s a known, it needs knowing. So vice versa. Knowing
                  needs a known, and a known needs knowing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">If
                  I followed the not-self practice, or a number of other practices too,
                  it’s not just that at all. If I follow that, I see that the known or
                  otherwise the perceptions or objects are empty, because they don’t kind
                  of exist by themselves. They depend on the identifying and clinging.
                  And I don’t know how they really are, how much clinging reveals the
                  real object. Then in a way the knowing, we could say, is leaning – it
                  needs a known and it’s leaning on something that’s empty, it’s leaning
                  on a vacuum. Do you see this? Knowing needs a known, the known needs
                  knowing. If the known is empty, it’s leaning on nothing. It’s leaning
                  on something that’s empty. We say that it’s groundless or unsupported.
                  Awareness is unsupported, it’s groundless. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  tracing stages, we want to deliberately consolidate the insights, so –
                  objects depend on the mind, so they’re empty, and the mind or
                  consciousness or awareness depends on object so that is empty too,
                  because it’s depending on something that’s empty. Anytime two things
                  are mutually dependent, they have to both be empty. We can go into that
                  but we don’t have time. This groundlessness, this emptiness, this lack
                  of independent existence of Awareness, rather than being a kind of
                  conundrum or a complication, is actually the insight that brings the
                  deepest level of freedom. It’s not anywhere, and it’s not supported by
                  anything, and it’s not anything that supports anything. Empty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Most
                  people are gonna need to develop that practice in, take this word very
                  lightly, stages. In the sense of gaining conviction first that the
                  object is empty. We’re learning actually how to disidentify and seeing
                  that because of that, things are dependent on that, which means they’re
                  empty. Gaining conviction in that, and moving on, resting on a kind of
                  secure footing in practice. With that, the conviction comes and
                  eventually the conviction that Awareness is empty too comes. And with
                  that, the deepest will (?).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">I
                  was gonna drop a little bit more about doing versus not doing in
                  practice because I know it has come up and it came up in a question,
                  but we’re actually going to leave that aside for now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  taking this one strand that we’ve talked about, it’s just one
                  possibility, one way of going about it. Disidentify. Learning to
                  disidentify. Practicing this disidentification. We said in those
                  moments what can happen is that a much deeper level of freedom opens
                  up. Second thing that can happen is that objects of perceptions begin
                  to fade (very important). A third thing can happen, sometimes. And that
                  is that time, or the sense of time, begins kind of fading or stopping
                  or losing its meaning. Some of you may have had a glimpse of this. The
                  whole notion of past, present, and future and the flow of time or
                  moments of time, it’s seen through. Time can stop. There’s a number of
                  different experiences that are possible, and one can sometimes can get
                  a glimpse of that or it could be a more extended thing. One can feel as
                  if one has a glimpse of eternity but it is not eternity in the sense of
                  something lasting forever. It’s a sense of time not being really the
                  reality of things. One goes beyond that. That’s something we could give
                  a whole talk to, and obviously I’m not going to, but it’s also
                  something that one can develop conviction in, and one should develop
                  conviction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">I’m
                  going to take a little time, because there’s another way in approaching
                  this, and it’s probably gonna be new to most people, I imagine. So one
                  way of looking into this time thing, is through the practice, letting
                  go, letting go, letting go, it could just be through letting go,
                  letting go, letting go, the actual sense of time is seen through. But
                  another way, and it’s actually using reasoning. And this is very
                  popular in some Mahayana schools, the Dalai Lama’s school, the Gelug
                  school, and other schools. So again one has to ask what is the
                  relationship with the thinking, logical mind, and what is the
                  relationship with the reasoning mind, and do we reject that as an
                  avenue of truth? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So,
                  check this out – This moment of consciousness, this moment of
                  awareness, is it inherently one moment or is it actually many moments?
                  If I say this moment of time is one moment, if I say it’s one – in it’s
                  essence it’s one, then either it’s divisible into a beginning, a middle
                  and an end or it’s not. Ok, either it has a beginning, middle and an
                  end or it doesn’t. If it is divisible into beginning, middle and end,
                  that actually means in that one moment it’s actually three moments.
                  Because when so to speak it’s at the beginning, it’s not at the end,
                  and when it’s at the end it’s not at the beginning. Time is here, and
                  then it’s here. It has actually become three moments, it’s not one
                  moment. The beginning must come before the end, so at the time it’s at
                  the beginning it’s not at the end. If we say the moment can<span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> be divided into beginning, middle and end, then that means it has no
                  beginning and end, which means it’s actually non-existent, it’s
                  infinitely small. No beginning, no end, also means it’s impossible to
                  make a continuum of moments in which anything can happen. So I have to
                  connect the end of this first moment with the beginning of the next
                  one, do you see that, like a chain? It’s actually impossible, you can’t
                  actually arrange moments in order in time, in happening. If I then say,
                  Ok, I’ll say the present moment is actually many moments somehow. But
                  Many is an accumulation of One, One, One, One, together. But we’ve
                  already said one moment can’t exist, so it can’t be many either. It
                  must be either one or many, if it’s something real. It must in its
                  essence be either one or many, but it can’t be either. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">I’m
                  aware of going through that very quickly, and I know that for most
                  insight meditators that’s going to sound very alien, that whole
                  approach. It’s, I think extremely powerful, what one can do in practice
                  is to actually hold the sense of the moment in awareness, focus on it,
                  and get used to this reasoning in a way that you can bring it in a very
                  light way, you’re actually contemplating the moment. It can be
                  extremely powerful for some people, extremely powerful. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">But
                  either way, whether it’s through letting go or through disidentifying,
                  whether it’s through using this reasoning, we see that time is actually
                  empty. Time is also a kind of fabrication. What happens? What does that
                  imply in terms of Awareness and the reality of Awareness? Awareness as
                  said in the different traditions is unfindable, we can’t find
                  Awareness. You can’t find the Mind. We can’t find Consciousness no
                  matter how much you look for it, in it’s essence. Now, one meaning of
                  that is I can’t see it because it has no form, no shape, no color. It’s
                  formless. And sometimes people again attempted to stop there as a kind
                  of seeing the complete unfindability of consciousness, but there’s more
                  to it than that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">That’s what the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/07/happiness-karma-and-mind.html">Dalai Lama would call</a>,
                  the conventional truth about Awareness. It’s that it doesn’t have a
                  form, and so you can’t see it. But relating to what we said, if there’s
                  nothing real to know, because the objects are empty, because I’ve seen
                  the objects are empty, how can we really talk about a real knowing?
                  There’s nothing real to know. And if there’s no time for the mind or
                  awareness to exist in, how is it really going to exist? So we say
                  Awareness is without essence. But seeing all those reasons why it’s
                  without essence – because of the time, and because the emptiness and
                  fabrication of objects – all of that’s involved there.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  what’s happening in all these is we’re seeing that Awareness completely
                  counterintuitively, is actually something built. And because it’s
                  built, it’s Empty. We build Awareness, and it’s Empty. And the Buddha
                  in a lovely quote, said, “Consciousness, when examined, is empty, void,
                  without substance.” Now if we just stop the quote there, that could
                  sound like the vast, spacious, insubstantial Awareness. But he doesn’t
                  finish there. He goes on to say, “Like a magician’s trick, like an
                  illusion.” In other words there’s some hocus pocus going in the mind,
                  and baadaabim baadaaboom – there’s awareness. And it’s a trick. It
                  doesn’t actually exist as something real. Consciousness, the Buddha
                  says, is like a magician’s trick, like an illusion, and in the formal
                  Dharma language, it lacks inherent existence. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">If
                  one goes into this unfabricated, unbuilding, letting go of the
                  building, is there a language for what’s left. Some people use the
                  words “it’s Awareness unbound”, “it’s Awareness not being bound to
                  objects, and space and time”, it's unwrapped itself from all of that.
                  But that Awareness is different than what we ordinarily mean when we
                  use the word Awareness. Because ordinarily, as I said before, means
                  “awareness of”. In everyday language, whether we are conscious of it or
                  not, that’s what we mean by awareness – it’s an awareness of.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
                  it’s different, different what’s left after we’ve unbuilt everything,
                  from ordinary awareness. In some Zen traditions they have the phrase
                  “No Mind”. That doesn’t mean learning not to think. It actually means
                  this: it’s like a Mind in its essence that doesn’t know anything,
                  that’s not aware of all the things that we’re usually aware of. So
                  there’s a beautiful Zen teacher that I really love, called Huang Po. He
                  doesn’t seem to be that popular at the moment in the West, partly I
                  think because his teaching is almost exclusively edicts on an
                  uncompromisingly deep level. But he’s very fun, I don’t know if he
                  started it, he’s very fun with this language of “No Mind”. He also
                  sometimes uses that inter-changeably with “Pure Mind” or “Real Mind”
                  but they mean the same thing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Now
                  listen to this, this beautiful quote from him. “This Pure Mind, the
                  people of the world do not awake to it, regarding only that which sees,
                  hears, feels and knows as Mind. Blinded by their own sight, hearing,
                  feeling and knowing, they do not perceive the spiritual brilliance of
                  that truth.” Later on, he says, “Realize that, though Real Mind is
                  expressed in these perceptions (our normal perceptions), it neither
                  forms part of them nor is separate from them.” Incredibly beautiful and
                  profound. Last thing I want to say, I’m aware talking about these
                  stuff, that it lands in very different places for very different
                  reasons for people. And it could seem, I hope it didn’t, but it could
                  seem that all these is almost an hour's worth of quibbling, an hour's
                  worth of sort of petty wrangling about some kind of intellectual
                  something or rather it might seem that way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">But
                  one of the things I want to say is, it’s very easy in the Dharma after
                  a long time of practice, to sort of hear this kind of talk and say,
                  “well, I don’t want to quibble. Does it really matter? It’s all good,
                  you say this, you say that, he says that, it’s all good. Let’s all be
                  friends, and we can all be happy together.” And that kind of attitude
                  again is very popular. I think it’s quite popular in the west. I think
                  contrary to the self-image that we have, we actually don’t like
                  debating with each other and wrangling out these points, we actually
                  don’t like it. We prefer this kind of “it’s all good”, but there’s
                  something that happens if I don’t grapple with these questions. When
                  people in the Dharma look at me from the outside, and if my attitude is
                  you know, “all this is the mind getting into complications and
                  arguing”, if that’s what I say and it’s like I’m not gonna get into
                  that, what it’s gonna look like, what it can look like from the outside
                  is, “there’s someone really peaceful and wise and not engaging in da da
                  da…”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">But
                  if I’m not grappling with these questions, although it might look like
                  there’s some peace and freedom here, I don’t think that the deeper
                  level of freedom will be arrived at. Like I said, I think it’s almost
                  inevitable that at points in the unfolding of insights there’s going to
                  be agitation. There’s going to be difficulty, there’s going to be
                  frustration, there’s going to be confusion, there’s going to be a
                  wrestling with these things. That deep freedom won’t be discovered
                  unless we grapple with these stuff at some point in our practice
                  whenever that is. And I hope it doesn’t sound intellectual tonight, it
                  might have, I hope it didn’t. And that’s really not the point. What I
                  really wanted to unfold is something we can see in practice through
                  developing practice in the right ways. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">There’s
                  not one way of going about this but there’s ways that will unfold this.
                  And what one sees is that different levels of freedom, unmistakably
                  different levels of freedom open up in one’s experience. Different
                  levels of freedom and release. And going through that, one sees, one
                  understands this building process. Oh, goodness me, this whole
                  structure of reality, what seemed to be a self, and a world and things,
                  and time, and awareness, everything in space, everything I took for
                  granted, is actually built. And I’ve understood that because I’ve gone
                  through it and kind of unbuild it, and unbind it. And then one realizes
                  almost in hind sight that one was either consciously or unconsciously
                  giving things – the things of this world, subtle things and gross
                  things, giving them an inherent existence, seeing them as possessing
                  inherent existence. Ascribing to them an inherent existence.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Usually
                  we unwittingly do that. So a good rule of thumb, (you know we talk
                  about the emptiness of this, the emptiness of that, and the emptiness
                  of all things and blah blah blah) to actually safely assume that you
                  are giving something an inherent existence – in other words not seeing
                  it’s empty, unless you’re really deliberately seeing it's empty. In
                  other words the default mode the mind gives inherent existence to
                  things all the time, and that’s what the Buddha called delusion, the
                  fundamental level of delusion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">The
                  thing I really want to emphasize is the possibility of practice to
                  actually discover this in a real way, a way that can be brought into
                  the life and have an enormous impact in our sense of freedom in life.
                  That’s possible and developable for us in this room as practitioners.
                  It’s just a matter of finding the way for that unbuilding, that
                  unpacking, that seeing of emptiness to happen. That is possible,
                  there’s no reason why it cannot be or shouldn’t be. If we care deeply,
                  as I said if we don’t really want to grapple with it, it’s not like
                  it’s like it’s suddenly gonna be known to us at a heart level. So it’s
                  something really possible for us as practitioners.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Ok, let’s have a bit of quiet together. </span></p>

              <p>In my book The Power of Now, I mention ways in which you can maintain present moment awareness, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but the main thing is to allow this new state of consciousness to emerge rather than believe that you have to try hard to make it happen</span>. How do you allow it to emerge? Simply by allowing this moment to be as it is. This means to relinquish inner resistance to what is – the suchness of now. This allows life to unfold beautifully. There is no greater spiritual practice than this."</p>

              <p>If you have an interest in polishing the mirror, it may be because something within has moved, which makes you feel like you would like to do something.  The pertinent question here for me, is "am I living, or am I being lived".  Is awareness "my" awareness, or is it simply part of the One.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The phrase "there is no doer" can be lived.  Not so much that you disappear into the ether, but rather you realize that you are not doing anything but, rather, are being done.  This is the true surrender that Eckhart talks of.</p>

              <p>Hi, thanks for the sharing.</p>
              <p>I'm noticing sometimes that Awareness has a quality of choiceleness to put it in JK's terms.</p>
              <p>It's all happening as awareness, the sounds, the sights, you aren't doing them and they're just happening. So it isn't a matter of concentrating or making awareness bright...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway... I've found something related by Dharma Dan on another forum which I thought was profound and relavant to the first article:</p>
              <p><em><span id="textNode_21873103" class="threadText">How to examine Vastness
              and Equanimity and Boundless Space and Boundless Consciousness and all
              sorts of other wondrous mind states is a great question, one that you
              have to figure out for yourself, but perhaps this will help.<br><br>Imagine
              that you were in a great space, such that everywhere you looked, that
              was what you found. You looked up and it was Vast, you looked down and
              found the same thing, you noticed things as individual sensations and
              also noticed that it was in a Vast field of awareness. All seems well.
              However, you will notice that Vastness is a quality, and as such, is
              implied by sensations, and while investigating such wonderful things as
              that Vastness seems to be the last thing you would want do to, it is
              actually also made up of sensations. Each time you look up and find
              Vastness, that is a new stream of sensations, transient, luminous, etc.
              The looking is also made up of a stream of sensations, as are the
              things in the Vastness, but looking more closely, or broadly, or
              completely, or evenly perhaps, you will find Formations.<br><br>Formations
              include space, include object, include looking and the sensations that
              seem to make up attention. As you find your attention moving around the
              to the objects in the Vastness, realize that actually that space is
              arising and vanishing in great volumetric swaths, like great 3D blobs,
              and attention is part of that, so notice all the way through the
              center, through the objects, in a way that includes all that and space
              as well, realizing that even space, consciousness, and equanimity all
              are just a part of the formations, and the formations change every
              instant, and arise and vanish completely. What happens when all this
              synchronizes is very good, so look for that. Everything has the Three
              Characteristics, even Vastness.</span></em></p>

              <p>Practicing in the more "open out sense"... not doing anything,
                                      relaxing all focused attention, reality takes over and everything
                                      is complete in that moment.</p>
