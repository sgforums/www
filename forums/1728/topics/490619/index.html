              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong></strong><a style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.independent.ie/opinion/independent-journalists/david-mcwilliams/">David
              McWilliams</a><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;"> </span><a style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden;" href="https://twitter.com/@davidmcw"><span style="color: #106ee5;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231; text-transform: uppercase;">18/11/2015<span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">It's customary to open the first speech of
              a conference with the catch-all welcome of "Good morning, ladies and
              gentlemen". It's more of a habit than anything else. It is therefore
              unusual to then look down more carefully from the podium at the huge hall and
              realise that there are no ladies present at all.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This absence was one of my first impressions of Saudi
              Arabia and, although it should have been expected, addressing an all-male
              audience - many in dresses - in this day and age, feels extremely backward. If
              a country is trying to be a leading global power and economic giant, excluding
              half its population seems a bit daft.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That's Saudi Arabia and I was in its main city,
              Riyadh.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In contrast, last year at a similar event in Morocco,
              it couldn't have been more different. In Morocco, the hall is full of women, they
              are vocal and questioning, and in Casablanca there is a sense of equality - or
              at least something moving towards equality. In Saudi, the opposite is the case.
              Let's just say that you'd be waiting a while in Riyadh for a
              #wakingthefeminists Twitter handle!</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The difference between both countries and between
              Saudi Arabia and many other Sunni Muslim countries is that Saudi Arabia has
              embraced Wahhabism. When I was in Riyadh, I spoke to a few Arab friends to try
              to get a handle on Wahhabism because, if you want to understand the region,
              it's critical to understand this strain of Islam that is preferred by - and
              exported by - Saudi Arabia.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You can't understand Isil and what drives them to blow
              up ancient Roman, Persian and Buddhist monuments without understanding
              Wahhabis. Nor can you understand what perverted logic drives them to kill
              innocents without learning about this type of strict Islam.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab was born not far from
              Riyadh in 1703. He trained as a holy man and was, like many religious people,
              constantly torn between a purist adherence to the original scriptures and a
              more tolerant accommodation of the word of God leavened with the reality of
              day-to-day living. This schism is not unusual. The fight between puritanism and
              pragmatism is after all, at the heart of the great split in the western
              Christian Church too - what we call the Reformation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Al Wahhab called for the purification of Islam and a
              return to pristine Islam. When the young Imam called for the beheading of women
              in his local town for adultery, the people knew this guy meant business.
              However, it is likely that this form of extremism wouldn't have caught on in
              what was, by the standards of the time, a reasonably tolerant place had it not
              been for local insurrection against the unpopular Ottoman Empire which ran the
              Arabian Peninsula and taxed the locals mercilessly.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Possibly in an effort to get God on his side in his
              fight against Istanbul, the local leader of a small oasis, Mohammad ibn Saud,
              threw his lot in with the renegade preacher, Al Wahhab, in 1745. The link
              between the House of Saud and Wahhabi was forged there and then; and they have
              been allies ever since.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At the time, Islam, like lots of religions, was a
              concoction of bits of other religions, beliefs and practices. These had been
              borrowed and customised along the way. Remember this part of the world was the
              crucible of civilisation, the epicentre of the world's great trading routes and
              a place where the three main monotheist religions, Christianity, Judaism and
              Islam had been founded - Judaism and Christianity literally a few yards from
              each other, Islam a few hundred miles down the road.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Given this mix, it's hardly surprising that there were
              huge overlaps in these faiths and, as Islam was the newest creed, it borrowed
              the most. Al Wahhab objected to this evolutionary, almost 'hand-me-down'
              approach to Islam. As a purist, he wanted to go back to basics, to make
              pristine the religion. Possibly the most important tenet of Wahhabis is that
              they believe in what they call "the oneness of God". As a result,
              association with lesser gods, other gods, mysticism, shrines, temples, saints
              or holy men amounts to idolatry and must be stamped out.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This put Wahhabis on a collision course with the other
              strains of Islam such as Shi'as or, even worse in the eyes of the Wahhabis,
              Sufism. Shi'as and Sufis were the enemy within and, of course, Judaism and
              Christianity were the enemies at the door. Wahhabis called for jihad against
              all these infidels.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Saudi/Wahhabi alliance was cemented by war and
              conquest as Arabian armies, immersed in a pure sectarian Islam, rampaged around
              the southern flanks of the crumbling Ottoman Empire. The Wahhabis were feared,
              deploying extremely brutal tactics against their Shi'ite enemies, for example
              in their sacking in the early 19th century of Karbala, Mecca and Medina, which
              were particularly vicious. But just in case we Christians get on our high
              horse, such sectarian savagery was a re-run of the earlier, 17th century,
              Thirty Years War in Europe.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For a century, the march, and reach, of the Wahhabis
              was limited to the Arabian Peninsula. Then the game changed, Saudi Arabia
              struck oil and the politics of the region altered forever, so too did
              geo-politics and Western economic expedience. Once the Saudis discovered oil,
              the West snuggled up to Riyadh, no questions asked.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Now the most extreme form of Islam was wedded to the
              richest country on earth and the Saudis have set about exporting not just oil,
              but a radical, intolerant form of Islam which drives Isil and various other
              jihadi groups. Saudi Arabia has spent some of its vast oil wealth on financing madrassas
              from Malaysia to Manchester - some of which are projecting Wahhabi ideas far
              from the Gulf.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Isil, with its murder of innocents, its desecration of
              ancient monuments and its subjugation of women, is the latest incarnation of
              extreme Wahhabism, and Saudi Arabia - the West's biggest ally in the region -
              is Isil's biggest external financier.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It costs money to wage war and Isil gets money from
              oil, local racketeering, hostage-taking and external private donations. The
              private donations come from donors, many of whom are Saudi.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When you follow the money, all radical roads lead back
              to Saudi Arabia, not states that are supposedly the West's enemies such as
              Libya, Iraq or even Assad's Syria.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From the majority of the 9/11 hijackers, to Bin Laden,
              his al-Qa'ida chief lieutenants and now Isil, each of these extremist
              organisations are the 21st century offspring of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab, the
              cleric who came out of the desert in the 1730s and the institution he allied
              with in 1745: the House of Saud.</span></p>
