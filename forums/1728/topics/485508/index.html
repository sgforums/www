              Naghal, Kathmandu when she visited on June 16, 2014. Students and teachers of
              the local Prabhat Secondary School stood in a queue to welcome the Nobel Peace
              laureate and world famous democratic leader of Myanmar, was making a visit to her
              old home. She had spent nine month satthe Vihara forty years ago in1974.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;"> <br> The enthusiastic crowd, who seemed so eager to be in her presence, showered her
              with bouquets of flowers and silk shawls. Deputy Prime Minister Prakash Man
              Singh escorted Suu Kyi to Dharmakirti Vihara, also known as the Shreegha
              Vihara.<br> <br> Suu Kyi spent about two hours at the Vihara with guruma Dhammawati under whose
              guidance she had spent nine months taking lessons on Buddhism forty years ago
              and in turn Aung San Suu Kyi had taught her English language and run English
              classes for other students. She spent her time learning about Buddhism and
              teaching English to others, said the general secretary of Shree Gha Vihar
              Development Committee Guhya Ratna Shakya. She was a good, compassionate
              teacher. Guruma Dhammawati herself also, however, has spent 14 years in Myanmar
              for her studies.<br> <br> Guruma Dhammawati, officials of the Shreegha Development Committee, and social
              workers congratulated Suu Kyi, who said that she remembered the bygone days at
              the Vihara vividly. After the formal program, Suu Kyi spent some intimate
              moments with guruma Dhammawati, who offered her blessings to Aung San Suu Kyi
              and prayed for her eternal happiness. <br> <br> I am very much influenced by the sacrifice, dedication and wisdom of lord
              Buddha, Suu Kyi said. My struggle began when I was in Nepal. I'll always
              remember Nepal and my beloved guruma and shall come back when time permits. She
              also said that Nepal was a pilgrimage site for all Buddhists and peace lovers
              of the world. <br> <br> Suu Kyi visited Lumbini on June 15. At Lumbini she said that if we are able to
              discard our lust for weapons and follow the path of Buddha, peace will prevail
              in the world and the foundations of democracy will eventually be strong. She
              said that her happiness knew no bounds as she at last could visit Lumbini after
              so many visits to Nepal. She visited and worshipped at the Myanmar Temple in
              Lumbini.<br> <br> Acharya Karma Syangbo Lama , the vice chair of the Lumbin Development Trust and
              Bal Krishna Panthi, the Chief District Officer of Rupandehi District, gave Suu
              Kyi the latest information on Lumbini and recent developments. <br> <br> The advocate of democracy for Myanmar and the world, Suu Kyi, came to Nepal at
              the invitation of BP Memorial Trust to mark centenary birth celebrations for
              the late Prime Minister BP Koirala. She delivered a speech on ‘Relevance of
              Social Democracy in the Contemporary World’ on June 14. During her stay in
              Nepal, Suu Kyi met the President, Prime Minister and the heads of different
              political parties of Nepal.<br> <br> Aung San Suu Kyi had visited Nepal in 1960 when her mother was the then Burmese
              ambassador to Nepal and a few times after that in 1974, with her husband. She
              has written 'Let's Visit Nepal', a book to promote Nepal in the international
              arena. The Nobel peace laureate and leader of Myanmar’s National League for
              Democracy returned to Myanmar on June 16, concluding her brief visit to the
              country.</span></p>
