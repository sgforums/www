              <p>Are you saying I replaced my belief of 'self' with 'no self'?</p>
              <p>To that: my answer is, no.</p>
              <p>I do not believe in 'no self'. I have seen through the illusion of self, yes, but I do not hold on to any beliefs of any sort. There is just this real time authentication of the true face of experience/experiencing without an experiencer.</p>
              <p>There is just the undeniable experience of hearing, seeing, thinking... without the sense or illusion of 'me in here seeing that over there'.</p>
              <p>There is no concepts, beliefs required.</p>
              <p>There is no self, and <strong>also no 'no self'.</strong></p>
              <p>There is just This... sound of keyboard typing, da da da.... words appearing on screen... all self-luminous, vivid, pristine, happening-of-itself.</p>
              <p>Everything is just shining the obvious Truth... there is no need to keep thinking 'no self'. (oh but before you see this, keep contemplating)</p>

              <p>Take monitor screen as an example - there are uncountable wisdom displays on your computer screen. When the monitor screen is powered off, these wisdom just disappeared. Well! you could not simply or dogmatically claim its non existence, on the other hand, the fact of existence on the permanent self of this intrinsical wisdom displayed, could not be intellectually and logically justified because it's impossible to take out to show people that there is this inherent super-harmony in beings' beauty and beast known in layman term as Buddhahood <img title="Laughing" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"><br></p>

              The enlightenment of each sage has followed a different process: no two alike.<span class="ws"> </span>However,
               when you read the biographies of each of these enlightened sages, you 
              notice that they collectively had one thing in common: the profundity of
               enlightenment is a life-changing development.<span class="ws"> </span>The
               bottom line, in these recorded lives, is that there was a radical 
              change between the pre-enlightenment life style and the life’s 
              consequent course.<br><br>If you listen to electronic recordings of 
              “spiritual” workshops, satsanga, retreats etc., you will frequently hear
               this comment from attendees: “I had a glimpse of the ultimate state 
              once.<span class="ws"> </span>But it has disappeared.”<span class="ws"> </span>The
               reason for this is simple: the commentator has not transcended the 
              subject/object perspective: there has been a “glimpse” to a “glimpser”; 
              there was a persistent “I” in relation to a “spiritual experience.” In 
              other words, the participant hasn’t fundamentally understood and 
              transcended the perspective which we call dualism.<span class="ws"> </span>The
               seeker’s presumption was that “I can have an experience of the One.” 
              And so there is an “I” on the one hand, and “the One” on the other hand.<br><br>Every
               “experience” is impermanent; it occurs within the time frame of an 
              “experiencer.” As the time–bound experience concludes, the experiencer’s
               I-consciousness recurs.<span class="ws"> </span>There remains the “I” with its “glimpse.” <br><br>With the “I” remaining central to one’s perception, there will be no radical change in one’s self-centered life matrix.<span class="ws"> </span>Only
               when this I-centered perspective has irretrievably dissolved will there
               be the true groundswell of matrix-breaking enlightenment.<br><br>Clearly,
               it is not uncommon for weekend “spiritual” participants to have an 
              experience of a “glimpse” of “merging.” But when they come away from 
              that “training” with the dualistic I/It mindset still unconsciously in 
              place, there will be no permanent, substantial realization of the 
              annihilating perspective known as nonduality â”€ a permanent, thorough, 
              annihilating change of the “experiencer” perception.<br><br>**** <br><br>Unpublished manuscript.</div>

              <p>Science is about understanding phenomena, how things work, that we may make things work according to our understanding.

              <p>Religion, in this instance, specifically Buddhism, is also about understanding phenomena, focusing on impermanence and also dissatisfaction. We all are inheritors of certain belief and culture of our community, clinging to the notions believing it to be permanent or solid.</p>
              <p>Even  as we are slowly changing our outlook as we grow , picking new ideas and habits, we still believe we are the same. </p>
              <p>The difference being religion, in this instance, Buddhism, and science is addressing different needs.  There are people who regard science as a religion, and also people who apply religion as science. </p>

              <p>What makes the subjective as being objective ? The assertion belief of facts of being irrefutable.Important is the underlying principle in which one applies one's understanding and perception of phenomena. Everything is relative to, even for measurements of things that can be measured.  In science things are measured and rated to a constant.</p>
