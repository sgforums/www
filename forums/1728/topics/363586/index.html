              <h1>How to Let Go and Forgive</h1>
              <h6>Post written by Leo Babauta<br></h6>
              <h6><br></h6>
              <h6></h6>
              <p>We’ve all been hurt by another person at some time or another — we were treated badly, trust was broken, hearts were hurt.</p>
              <p>And while this pain is normal, sometimes that pain lingers for too
              long. We relive the pain over and over, and have a hard time letting go.</p>
              <p>This causes problems. It not only causes us to be unhappy, but can
              strain or ruin relationships, distract us from work and family and
              other important things, make us reluctant to open up to new things and
              people. We get trapped in a cycle of anger and hurt, and miss out on
              the beauty of life as it happens.</p>
              <p>We need to learn to let go. We need to be able to forgive, so we can move on and be happy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is something I learned the hard way — after years of holding
              onto anger at a loved one that stemmed from my childhood and teen-age
              years, I finally let go of this anger (about 8 years ago or so). I
              forgave, and not only has it improved my relationship with this loved
              one tremendously, it has also helped me to be happier.</p>
              <p>Forgiveness can change your life.</p>
              <p>Forgiveness does not mean you erase the past, or forget what has
              happened. It doesn’t even mean the other person will change his
              behavior — you cannot control that. All it means is that you are
              letting go of the anger and pain, and moving on to a better place.</p>
              <p>It’s not easy. But you can learn to do it.</p>
              <p>If you’re holding onto pain, reliving it, and can’t let go and forgive, read on for some things I’ve learned.</p>
              <p><strong>1. Commit to letting go</strong>. You aren’t going to do it
              in a second or maybe not even in a day. It can take time to get over
              something. So commit to changing, because you recognize that the pain
              is hurting you.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Think about the pros and cons</strong>. What problems
              does this pain cause you? Does it affect your relationship with this
              person? With others? Does it affect work or family? Does it stop you
              from pursuing your dreams, or becoming a better person? Does it cause
              you unhappiness? Think of all these problems, and realize you need to
              change. Then think of the benefits of forgiveness — how it will make
              you happier, free you from the past and the pain, improve things with
              your relationships and life in general.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Realize you have a choice</strong>. You cannot control
              the actions of others, and shouldn’t try. But you can control not only
              your actions, but your thoughts. You can stop reliving the hurt, and
              can choose to move on. You have this power. You just need to learn how
              to exercise it.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Empathize</strong>. Try this: put yourself in that
              person’s shoes. Try to understand why the person did what he did. Start
              from the assumption that the person isn’t a bad person, but just did
              something wrong. What could he have been thinking, what could have
              happened to him in the past to make him do what he did? What could he
              have felt as he did it, and what did he feel afterward? How does he
              feel now? You aren’t saying what he did is right, but are instead
              trying to understand and empathize.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Understand your responsibility</strong>. Try to figure
              out how you could have been partially responsible for what happened.
              What could you have done to prevent it, and how can you prevent it from
              happening next time? This isn’t to say you’re taking all the blame, or
              taking responsibility away from the other person, but to realize that
              we are not victims but participants in life.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Focus on the present</strong>. Now that you’ve reflected
              on the past, realize that the past is over. It isn’t happening anymore,
              except in your mind. And that causes problems — unhappiness and stress.
              Instead, bring your focus back to the present moment. What are you
              doing now? What joy can you find in what is happening right now? Find
              the joy in life now, as it happens, and stop reliving the past. Btw,
              you will inevitably start thinking about the past, but just acknowledge
              that, and gently bring yourself back to the present moment.</p>
              <p><strong>7. Allow peace to enter your life</strong>. As you focus on
              the present, try focusing on your breathing. Imagine each breath going
              out is the pain and the past, being released from your body and mind.
              And imagine each breath coming in is peace, entering you and filling
              you up. Release the pain and the past. Let peace enter your life. And
              go forward, thinking no longer of the past, but of peace and the
              present.</p>
              <p><strong>8. Feel compassion</strong>. Finally, forgive the person and
              realize that in forgiveness, you are allowing yourself to be happy and
              move on. Feel empathy for the person and wish happiness on them. Let
              love for them, and life in general, grow in your heart. It may take
              time, but if you’re stuck on this point, repeat some of the ones above
              until you can get here.<br> —</p>
