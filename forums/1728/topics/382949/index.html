              <h1>Body / No-Body <br></h1>
              <p class="tdtextindent"><em>You have never questioned your 
              belief that you are the body….it attracts attention and fascinates so 
              completely that rarely does one perceive one’s real nature. It is like 
              seeing the surface of the ocean and completely forgetting the immensity 
              beneath. The world is but the surface of the mind and the mind is 
              infinite. What we call thoughts are just ripples in the mind. When the 
              mind is quiet…it dissolves and only reality remains.<br> <br> </em>--Nisargadatta Maharaj</p>
              <p class="tdtextindent"><em>The food body you are not. The 
              waking state you are not. The deep sleep state you are not. You know the
               waking state. Since you know the waking state you are not the waking 
              state. You know the deep sleep state; therefore, you are not the deep 
              sleep state.<br> <br> </em>--Nisargadatta Maharaj</p>
              <p class="tdtextindent"><em>There is only a stream of 
              sensations, perceptions, memories and ideations. The body is an 
              abstraction, created by our tendency to seek unity in diversity.<br> <br> </em>--Nisargadatta Maharaj</p>
              <p class="tdtextindent"><em>The ‘secret’ of life that we are 
              all looking for is simply this: to rest in the bodily experience of the 
              present moment.<br> <br> </em>--Joko Beck</p>
              <p>One teacher says that the secret of life is nothing more 
              or less than present moment sensory experiencing, and another teacher 
              insists that we are not the body and even suggests that nothing 
              perceivable or conceivable is real. Is awakening about being fully 
              embodied and awake to present moment sensory experiencing or is it 
              altogether beyond the body and the senses and even beyond consciousness 
              itself?  If we only hear these different pointers ideologically, they 
              seem to be totally contradicting one another. But if we really <em>hear</em> them, perhaps they are pointing to exactly the same realization.</p>
              <p>Toni Packer, a teacher I was with for many years, often 
              invites awareness of presently arising sensory experiencing: bird 
              cheeps, the sound of wind, the sensation of our body meeting the chair, 
              breathing, the beating of the heart. In her book <em>The Silent Question</em>,
               Toni writes:</p>
              <p class="tdtextindent"><em>It isn’t the content of the 
              listening (such as birdcalls) that matters, but rather it’s the quality.
               Likewise in seeing, it is not what is seen that is of importance but 
              the amazing fact that in the wholeness of seeing, the seer may disappear
               altogether! In complete seeing and hearing the ‘me’ is no longer the 
              driving center, creating a dualistic world. Instead of the experience of
               ‘me’ and the flower or me and the birdsong, there is just the wholeness
               of what is heard and seen (touched and tasted) – too marvelous to 
              describe in words: it is the ending of separation!</em></p>
              <p>This wholeness (the ending of separation) isn’t something 
              to get an idea about or think about, and it isn’t the <em>content</em> of any <em>particular</em> experience, such as the birdsong, but rather,
               it is the nondual seamlessness of the listener and the sound, for in 
              reality, they are divided only by conceptual thought and language. The 
              actual <em>experience</em> is simply undivided <em>hearing</em>. The 
              aliveness, the beauty, the love, the joy is in the awareness, the 
              listening presence, the wholeness of being.</p>
              <p>The body turns out to be a wonderful field for meditative 
              exploration. By tuning into the body with awareness, by exploring it as 
              pure sensation, we discover that there is no “body” (except as a mental 
              concept, an abstraction of thought), and we discover that the whole 
              universe is our body. The boundaries are not really there.</p>
              <p>This realization isn’t something mystical and exotic. It 
              is rather something so simple, so immediate, so obvious, so ever-present
               that we tend to overlook it because our attention is absorbed instead 
              in the ubiquitous abstraction created by conceptual thought that is 
              overlaid on top of the bare actuality of being.</p>
              <p>The actual experience here and now is nothing but 
              ever-changing sensations. “The body” is an idea, an abstraction, a 
              concept, a mental image, a thought-form. We can <em>conceptualize</em> a
               boundary-line between what we <em>think</em> of (and mentally picture) 
              as “my body” and “the chair,” but when we look for this “body” with 
              awareness, we find only ever-changing sensations and no clear 
              delineation between “body” and “chair.” If we look with awareness for 
              the place where “inside of us” turns into “outside of us,” we cannot 
              find it.  It, too, was only an idea!  We know from modern physics that 
              at the subatomic level, there is no solidity or substance and no 
              boundaries. And this is our actual present moment experience right now, 
              but we tend to ignore our actual experience in favor of the conceptual 
              overlay that is so deeply conditioned and easily mistaken for reality. 
              We mistake the map for the territory, the conceptual abstraction for 
              actuality itself. We know from ecology that everything depends on 
              everything else and that you cannot remove any part without altering the
               whole, but we easily overlook this in favor of our conceptual picture. 
              We imagine a world of separate parts -- including “me”-- parts that can 
              all be pulled apart and rearranged. Thus we imagine, “I could be 
              somewhere else right now, and that would be better.”</p>
              <p>In this abstract and imaginary world created by conceptual
               thought and story-telling, there <em>seems</em> to be separation and 
              solidity. Bringing awareness to the present moment, to sensory 
              experiencing, to the <em>actuality</em> of the body, erases the self 
              completely, meaning that it erases the imaginary boundaries and leaves 
              only everything, and this everything is seamless and all-inclusive.</p>
              <p>The real body (no body at all) is not a cadaver or an 
              anatomy book picture. It is alive and fluid and moving. Experientially, 
              it is nothing but ever-changing sensations. And in fact, it's an 
              ever-moving process of blood circulating, cells dividing, nerves firing,
               heart beating, lungs expanding and contracting, food being taken in and
               broken down, disbursed or eliminated. The body is in constant exchange 
              with the environment, the skin is porous and breathing, flaking off, 
              regenerating, the breath is coming in and going out. Your body now is 
              not the same body you had ten years ago, or ten days ago, or even back 
              when you started reading this page less than a minute ago. It is 
              ceaseless change.</p>
              <p>We can’t ignore the relative world in which we seem to be 
              separate individuals in a world of other individuals, but we can learn 
              to discern ever more subtly the difference between the anatomy book and 
              the living body, between the map and the territory, between the thought 
              of “me” and the actuality of present-moment experiencing. We can 
              discover for ourselves that the <em>actuality</em> of the present moment
               is ungraspable and impossible to capture with thought, and that the 
              deeper we go into the actuality of the body here and now in direct 
              experiencing, the more we find no-<em>thing</em> (no body) at all. And 
              yet, this nothing (or nobody) is not some nihilistic void, but rather, a
               vibrantly alive overflowing presence. And in the light of this 
              presence, <em>everything</em> is sacred – the ordinary <em>is</em> the 
              extraordinary.</p>
              <p>This aliveness does not hold still. A friend of mine who 
              was a surgical nurse described the shock of interns making their first 
              cut in a living body. They’ve studied the anatomy book, they’ve 
              dissected the cadavers, but now they’re cutting into a living organism 
              and suddenly everything is slippery and pulsating and moving, blood is 
              gushing out, everything is moving. This is real life. Nothing holds 
              still. It’s a mess. And yet right in the heart of this messy 
              impermanence, this utterly thorough-going flux, is true stillness, order
               and intelligence.</p>
              <p>            “Show me the Holy Reality,” a monk once asked 
              the Master. <br>             “It just moved!” the Master replied.</p>
              <p>Just as we have these seemingly contradictory teachings 
              about the body, we also find some teachers telling us that the world is 
              an illusion while others say that enlightenment is all about being a 
              bodhisattva who cares deeply for the world. Again, it can seem that 
              these are contradictory and irreconcilable teachings, but as with the 
              apparently opposite pointers about the body, if we look more deeply, we 
              may find that these seemingly divergent  teachings about the world also 
              point us to the very same realization, the very same reality. Ramana 
              Maharshi expressed it beautifully when he said:</p>
              <p class="tdtextindent"><em>The world is illusory;</em><br> <em>God alone is real;</em><br> <em>God is the world.</em></p>
              <p>“The world” we conceptualize, like “the body” we 
              conceptualize, is an abstraction, an idea, a map. And the stories we 
              tell ourselves and each other about this world are all in the end 
              fictional. But when we discover God (boundlessness, seamlessness, 
              emptiness, the aliveness or <em>suchness</em> of Here and Now), we 
              discover the reality of the world.</p>
              <p>When we truly see that <em>all</em> of our choices, 
              decisions, preferences, intentions, interests, inclinations, thoughts 
              and actions come from emptiness, that every action arises from the 
              Totality and not from “me,” the phantom operator, and that this is true 
              of everyone else as well, then we are instantly free of guilt and blame,
               vengeance and retribution.  This is true compassion. It doesn’t mean we
               approve of genocide, or that we allow child molesters to run free, but 
              we see that those who commit such atrocities could not have done 
              otherwise in that moment. We have compassion for them.  We see that 
              every action arises out of an infinite web of nature and 
              nurture---genetics, hormones, neurology and conditioning. Hitler could 
              not have “chosen” to be Ramana Maharshi anymore than Ramana could have 
              “chosen” to be Hitler. What we call “Hitler” or “Ramana” or “me” or 
              “you” is not really a solid <em>thing </em>with some kind of independent
               will, but rather, a boundless process that is inseparable from 
              everything else in the entire universe. We are not encapsulated inside a
               body as we had imagined, and as it turns out, seeing this doesn’t in 
              any way <em>deny</em> the actuality of the body either. If anything, we 
              become infinitely more sensitive to the reality of both the body and the
               world. We see that it is the whole universe breathing, thinking, 
              singing, dancing, sensing, awaring, body-ing, world-ing, being. </p>
              <p>“You are not your body” points to the realization that 
              “you” and “your body,” as you <em>think</em> of them, are nothing but 
              ideas. It doesn’t  point to <em>denying</em> or <em>ignoring</em> the 
              body, or to some kind of mystical disappearance into thin air.  
              Likewise, saying that “the world is a dream” points to the realization 
              that “the world” as we <em>think</em> of it (a solid objective reality 
              “out there” apart from us) is a dream-like illusion, a 
              conceptualization, a kind of mirage. It doesn’t mean there is no world 
              in any sense.</p>
              <p>If we zoom far enough out, this planet is nothing but a 
              tiny dot of light, and finally, if we go out far enough, it disappears 
              completely. If we zoom in close enough, at the subatomic level, we find 
              mostly empty space and nothing solid. Either way, zoomed in or zoomed 
              out, the world as we know it with all our personal and global dramas is 
              no longer here.</p>
              <p>Sensory experiencing, the body, the world, and the entire 
              movie of waking life are sometimes seen as a kind of veil that hides or 
              obscures Ultimate Reality, and then there is an attempt to detach and 
              transcend, to see that nothing perceivable or conceivable can be what I 
              am. But ultimately, this detachment collapses into unconditional love. 
              It is seen that sensory experiencing, the body, the world, the 
              characters and the entire movie of waking life are all the perfect 
              manifestation and expression of Ultimate Reality, that everything is one
               seamless whole from which nothing stands apart, and from which no 
              detachment is ever possible. There is always only the Single Reality, 
              the no-thing-ness appearing as everything.</p>
              <p>Both zooming out and zooming in can be powerful ways of 
              waking up. Advaita teachings often emphasize zooming out. They direct 
              you to what is beyond everything perceivable and conceivable, 
              encouraging you to discover that what you truly are is prior to the 
              world and the body. You are the screen that is present before and after 
              the movie, that is equally present in every scene of the movie, and that
               is never disturbed by the movie. You are boundless awareness. And in 
              the most radical of nondual teachings, awareness itself is seen as the 
              first appearance, and you are that which is prior to awareness, that 
              which <em>is</em> both awareness and the content of awareness. Many 
              other teachings, such as Zen, tend to begin by frustrating all your 
              attempts to zoom out. You come to the Zen Master to find Ultimate 
              Reality and enlightenment, and to your great consternation, all the 
              Master ever does is give meticulous instructions for cleaning the toilet
               and sweeping the floor! Finally, you realize that Ultimate Reality is 
              not someplace else. I have found all of these approaches potentially 
              eye-opening. They can all reveal that what you are seeking has never 
              been absent and can never be lost.</p>
              <p>It is wonderfully liberating to see that <em>nothing</em> in the movie of waking life really matters. And at the same time, I've 
              found that one of the very best and most reliable ways of discovering 
              insubstantiality, boundlessness and the absence of separation firsthand,
               is to give close and careful attention here and now to the bare sensory
               actuality of the present moment. By giving careful attention to the 
              form of this moment, we discover formlessness or emptiness. We discover 
              that nothing holds still. And yet, we find that there is a great 
              stillness beholding everything and at the very heart of everything.</p>
              <p>The danger I see in trying to <em>transcend</em> the body 
              or <em>deny</em> the world from an ideological place, rather than 
              through direct experience, is that we can end up cultivating a kind of 
              dissociated detachment. We keep trying to <em>imagine</em> or <em>picture</em> “formless nothingness” or “the screen” (as if this were some <em>thing</em>).
               The mind creates a subtle new object that doesn’t really exist, and 
              then it takes effort to keep this imaginary creation always in mind, to 
              keep remembering that I am formless nothingness and not the person, the 
              screen and not the movie. We fall into an inner conflict, attracted by 
              the movie and at the same time trying to turn away and detach from it. 
              This is why I’ve often found it more reliable to go directly <em>into</em> the apparent forms, such as the body, and see what is revealed.</p>
              <p>Instead of trying to <em>ignore</em> the world of form 
              (the body and the world), go into it deeply with awareness, and discover
               for yourself how fluid and ephemeral and empty of self it all actually 
              is. Discover the boundlessness of every moment, the boundlessness of 
              presence. Discover that true happiness, beauty, joy, and freedom is not 
              in any <em>particular</em> form, but rather in the awareness or presence
               at the heart of everything. Happiness is then no longer dependent upon 
              getting the perfect lover, or the perfect location, or the perfect 
              scenery, or the perfect job. It is about recognizing true perfection 
              here and now. And in this realization of fluidity and wholeness, our 
              grip on all our most cherished beliefs and ideas relaxes, along with our
               need to defend “me” and “my” side. We may still have strong opinions, 
              but we become more open to questioning them, more able to see and 
              consider other points of view, less caught up in “being right” and 
              “winning” and “getting even.”  More and more, we can enjoy the actual 
              messiness of life as it is.   Our ideals for how everything “should” be 
              are like the anatomy book or the cadaver -- dead. However hard we try, 
              the living body will never be “perfect” like that, and actually, that’s 
              wonderful! </p>
              <p>This alive and wondrous and utterly ungraspable IS-ness is
               true freedom. It is not the freedom to do what you want, but rather, 
              the freedom to be what you are.  What are you?  Nobody at all, 
              everything and nothing, and at the same time, a particular snowflake 
              unlike any other. The whole universe is showing up as you, as this 
              moment, just as it is.</p>
              <p>The exploration and freedom and aliveness that is being 
              pointed to here is all about the utter simplicity of being. Hearing the 
              traffic sounds or the wind or the birds, feeling the breathing, seeing 
              colors and shapes, sensations of cool air or heat, thoughts bubbling up 
              and vanishing into thin air -- just this, nothing more and nothing 
              less.  In this simple beingness, there is no “you” and no “body” and no 
              “world” and no “problem to solve” until thinking begins labeling the 
              sensations and telling a story. And that story is only another momentary
               shape that emptiness is taking, just like the bird songs and the 
              traffic roar. This present moment is alive with color and smell and 
              taste and touch and sound – it  simply isn’t anything you can grasp.</p>
              <p>“Boundlessness” is a word that points to the very essence 
              or <em>nature</em> of Here and Now, the groundless ground, the water in 
              every wave. You cannot <em>find</em> what is being pointed to because 
              nothing is outside of it. Anything you can find or define -- any <em>sense</em> of awareness or boundlessness, or any <em>notion</em> of Here and Now 
              -- is another appearance. The boundlessness that is <em>being</em> and <em>beholding</em> everything is nothing you can see or grasp or experience or possess or 
              pin down. You can only <em>be</em> this emptiness. And in fact, you 
              cannot <em>not</em> be it. And <em>whatever</em> appears is always only 
              this, for there is nothing else. </p>

              <p>As we explore the actuality of the body and discover 
              directly that it is insubstantial, impermanent, and boundless, we find 
              that many knotty problems dissolve into thin air along with the body. 
              For example, there is much debate over which is primary, mind or matter,
               and whether Consciousness is limited to the body or whether it is 
              beyond the body. Will it survive the body or die along with the brain?  
              Didn’t the universe begin with matter, and then consciousness appeared 
              much later in the evolutionary process, as a feature of complex organic 
              life?  Consciousness occurs in brains, but not in stones, right?</p>
              <p>We cannot deny that <em>all</em> our knowledge and 
              experience, <em>everything</em> perceivable and conceivable, appears in 
              Consciousness, and is in some sense “made up” of Consciousness. We have 
              no actual experience of anything <em>outside</em> of Consciousness or <em>other</em> than Consciousness. The very notion that there <em>is</em> a “material”
               world outside of Consciousness can only appear <em>in</em> Consciousness, and can never be verified. Don’t take any of this on 
              faith, but look and see for yourself. What is always here in every 
              experience? What must be here first in order for anything else to appear
               at all?</p>
              <p>As we explore actual present moment experiencing, and as 
              we look closely into the nature of this dream-like reality that appears 
              in consciousness, we find ceaseless change and complete interdependence.
               We find that everything is involved with everything else, and we 
              discover that solid, independent objects only exist conceptually as 
              ideas (and to some degree as conditioned perceptions).  When examined 
              closely and carefully, we see that the boundaries between objects are 
              fluid, porous and notional, and that any given object only exists (and <em>can</em> only exist) along with, and because of, everything it is not---that it 
              is actually <em>made up</em> of everything it is not---that everything 
              is inside everything else. This is sometimes called Oneness, but once it
               is named and conceptualized, it becomes another (imaginary) object, so 
              Buddhists prefer to call it emptiness. As one Buddhist teacher put it, 
              everything is empty of itself and full of everything else. Emptiness is 
              not some mysterious vacancy or voidness, but rather, exactly <em>this</em> – this present moment. </p>
              <p>There can only be an outside and an inside if you have an 
              object (a separate, independent, solid, continuous <em>thing</em> – like
               a “brain” or a “stone” or a “self”) to be inside or outside of.  And 
              yet in seeing clearly, it is obvious that no such separate, discrete, 
              persisting objects exist in reality.  At a casual glance, yes, we do <em>seem</em> to see a world of apparently solid, separate, persisting objects, and 
              this appearance isn’t going to disappear. This appearance arises through
               some mix of conditioned perception and conceptualizing, and it has a 
              relative reality and a functional utility <em>within</em> the dream-like
               movie of waking life that appears in consciousness. But when we look 
              more closely and carefully, either through meditation or science, we 
              find the borders are not solid, the objects are nothing but continuous 
              change, and the "me" who is assumed to be seeing all this cannot be 
              found.  There is only undivided, seamless, thorough-going flux, constant
               change, change that is <em>so</em> thorough-going and <em>so</em> complete that there is actually no separate or persisting “thing” to <em>be</em> impermanent! There is always only this one timeless present moment that
               never comes and never goes and never stays the same.</p>
              <p>If we see that there is only thorough-going flux, or One 
              Immutable Reality, then we see that the brain is actually inseparable 
              from the stone – they are different expressions of one seamless, 
              ever-changing, ever-present Whole. To say that Consciousness resides in 
              the brain and not in the stone is to imagine that “brains,” “stones,” 
              and “consciousness” are separate, discrete, independent, persisting 
              “things.”  Clearly, within the dream that we take for reality, brains do
               play a significant and unique role in manifesting, revealing or 
              transmitting consciousness, but the brain could not (and does not) exist
               without everything else in the universe including the stone.  The stone
               and the brain are like two ends of the same caterpillar. Nothing is 
              outside of this undivided flowing Wholeness.</p>
              <p>We can say that I am inside or outside this room – and 
              relatively speaking, this makes sense, and is a useful way of 
              conceptualizing and speaking. It allows us to function. But in reality, 
              there is no real separation between inside the room and outside the 
              room, and there is no me apart from the room to be in or out of it. The 
              boundary lines are purely notional, as is the room itself, as am I.  All
               apparently discrete entities are simply conceptual ideas, reifications 
              created by perception and conception abstracting out and freezing some 
              tiny piece of the ever-shifting infinite Whole as if it were a separate 
              thing and then drawing an imaginary boundary-line around it and giving 
              it a name.</p>
              <p>Likewise, in reality, there is no “my mind” and “your 
              mind,” no “me” and “you,” no “here” and “there.”  Such separations are 
              always only conceptual and relative. They have a functional usefulness 
              and a relative reality, but if we give them an absolute reality they 
              don’t actually have, we suffer.</p>
              <p>So how can Consciousness be located only in the brain and 
              not also, in some sense, in the stone?  Look at a brain or a stone at 
              the quantum level, and you find mostly empty space with subatomic 
              wavicles dancing in and out of existence. You don’t find solid 
              boundaries anywhere.  And <em>all</em> of this---brains, stones, 
              wavicles, subatomic happenings, ideas---<em>all</em> of this appears <em>in</em> Consciousness and <em>is</em> Consciousness in that sense.</p>
              <p>Even if I were a brain in a vat, as some of us have 
              imagined we might be, where exactly would this brain and this vat be 
              located? We could say, on Planet X, but then where is Planet X located? 
               We could say, in some corner of the universe, but then where is the 
              universe located? Where did the Big Bang happen? We seem always to come 
              back to the primacy of Consciousness and the impossibility of ever 
              getting outside of it. All our "objects" (from brains to subatomic 
              particles to planets to vats) are seen to be thought-forms (and to some 
              degree, conditioned perceptions) appearing in Consciousness. The 
              fundamental reality would seem to be Mind and not matter, but then, what
               exactly <em>is</em> matter?  We have an idea that it is something very 
              solid and substantial, like chairs and tables, but when we look closely 
              at any material, it turns out not to be in any way solid or substantial.
               “Matter” seems to evaporate into thin air when we really investigate 
              it!</p>
              <p>Clearly, we don’t “know” what Consciousness (or Mind, or 
              Awareness) is either, and we never will know, because the eye can’t see 
              itself.  There is no way to stand outside of Consciousness and observe 
              it as an object.  And in fact, scientists are finding there is really no
               way to stand outside of <em>anything</em> and observe it as an object, 
              perhaps because everything is Consciousness!  In the deepest sense, we 
              don’t really know what <em>anything</em> is!  We can say that water is 
              made up of such and such elements and that it is a liquid, but does that
               really tell us what water <em>is</em>? </p>
              <p>Although we don’t know what Consciousness “is,” we 
              certainly can’t deny the <em>reality</em> of Consciousness – it is 
              always right here as the most intimate ground of every moment. It is the
               undeniable <em>fact</em> of being present, being aware.  We have 
              absolutely no doubt about <em>being here,</em> and this doubtless 
              certainty requires no training and no proof. Consciousness would have to
               be here first in order to doubt it! </p>
              <p>Although Consciousness is the one thing of which we have 
              absolutely no doubt whatsoever—it is our most intimate and ever-present 
              reality, the very ground of every moment—even so, we can’t ever 
              apprehend or grasp this Conscious Presence or say exactly what it is!  
              It has no taste, no color, no shape, no form – other than <em>every</em> taste and <em>every</em> color and <em>every</em> shape and <em>every</em> form. As someone said, it’s so clear, it’s easy to overlook.  And even 
              this clarity is part of the appearance, for every night in deep sleep, 
              even the first sense of awareness vanishes completely along with 
              everything perceivable and conceivable. The groundlessness that remains 
              can never be perceived or conceptualized because it <em>is</em> the 
              perceiving and conceptualizing, it <em>is</em> the awaring, it <em>is</em> being and beholding everything.</p>
              <p>We may think that Consciousness is a brain creation, but 
              no brain has ever appeared outside of Consciousness, and if we cut open 
              the brain, we won’t find this room I’m sitting in. So where exactly <em>is</em> this room, and am I in it, or is it in me?  Indeed, every location, 
              every happening, and <em>everything</em> I ever encounter, appears 
              within me, within Consciousness. Does it also exist “out there” apart 
              from me?  Are we really a bunch of separate, independent organisms all 
              “looking out” through the windows of our senses at a single objective 
              reality that always exists “out there” whether or not anyone is aware of
               it, each of us seeing this single reality in slightly different ways?  
              Or is that very idea of an objective reality “out there” a fundamental 
              misconception?  As Zen Master Dogen asked, Are there various ways of 
              seeing one object, or have we mistaken various images for a single 
              object? </p>
              <p>We intuitively sense that there <em>is</em> a Single 
              Reality of some kind, but is it “out there” as an object to be seen, or 
              is it rather the all-inclusive being and beholding of everything?  And 
              is anything really separate from this Single Reality, this ever-present,
               ever-changing groundlessness?</p>
              <p>The thinking mind easily and habitually gets all tangled 
              up trying to solve imaginary problems. It may now be tangled up in 
              trying to figure out whether “the Single Reality” and “groundlessness” 
              and “Consciousness” and “awareness” and “being” are all the same thing 
              or a bunch of different things, and which thing is prior to which other 
              thing, but of course, these words all point beyond the very notion of 
              “things.”  So the invitation here is to drop all these words and ideas 
              for a moment and simply <em>be</em>. This is easy because you can’t 
              possibly <em>not</em> be.  Notice the <em>actual</em> <em>reality</em> of this moment right now. <em>Something</em> is undeniably present. 
              Hearing, seeing, sensing, being -- something <em>is</em>. This <em>IS-ness</em> is always right Here, right Now, whatever different form the present 
              moment takes. This aliveness that makes “the present moment” present, 
              what <em>is</em> that?  Never mind the word, whether we call it 
              “Consciousness” or “Awareness” or “Presence” or “Being.” The <em>actuality</em> of it is undeniable and unavoidable. <em>Being here</em> in undeniable!</p>
              <p>Without the words, what <em>is</em> this, right here, 
              right now?  No word can capture it. And what is it that knows this 
              beingness? What is it that remains in deep sleep when the first sense of
               awareness has vanished completely? What was here before the universe 
              was born, before the Big Bang? What were you before birth, before 
              conception? Explore these questions not by <em>thinking</em> about them 
              and trying to find some answer, but by falling into the 
              answer-less-ness. This groundlessness that can never be grasped is the 
              Single Reality, the emptiness that appears as the first mirror of 
              awareness in which the entire universe and “you” as the imagined 
              character in the story of your life appear and disappear. This Single 
              Reality has no problem with any appearance. It has no problem with being
               the character or the universe or with dreaming the dream. It has no 
              need to wake up from the dream, and yet, waking up happens, and it 
              happens only <em>within</em> the dream, within the world of 
              consciousness, as another reflection in the mirror of awareness. What 
              can be seen in the mirror is always only a reflection. The Seer Itself 
              can never be seen. This Single Reality can never be seen, and yet 
              whatever is seen is nothing other than this. This is all there is, and 
              all there is, is this. What is it?  Any answer you come up with must be 
              discarded.</p>
              <p>When the thinking mind gets busy trying to solve the 
              mystery of the universe, we wonder if the fundamental reality is mind or
               matter.  We wonder which comes first, the brain or the mind, the 
              chicken or the egg. We wonder if we are a brain in a vat, or whether or 
              not Consciousness will survive death. We wonder what is prior to 
              consciousness. Perhaps questions such as these are all akin to asking 
              what happens to me if I fall off the edge of the earth.  People used to 
              worry about that. But obviously, the apparent problem, which at the time
               seemed quite serious, was based on false ideas about the earth.  The 
              danger of falling off the edge was never really there. In reality, no 
              separate thing is ever born and nothing real ever dies.  There is no 
              before and after, no “out there” or “in here,” except relatively, in the
               world of appearances.</p>
              <p>Where is the boundary between mind and matter, or between 
              chicken and egg, or between form and emptiness? There is no actual 
              separation anywhere to be found. Realizing this doesn’t mean we lose the
               ability to distinguish a brain from a stone, or a chicken from an egg, 
              nor does it mean that we have no boundaries in the way psychology uses 
              that term -- awakening does not deny relative reality or the ability to 
              set limits and make distinctions, but awakened understanding functions 
              within that relative reality without the stickiness and confusion that 
              comes when relative reality is mistaken for absolute reality.</p>
              <p>Gradually, we become more and more sensitive to this 
              conceptualizing process – the way the mind divides, abstracts, reifies 
              and then gets confused, trying to reconcile the pieces it has just 
              created. We can begin to see this happening as it happens. And we can 
              begin to see directly that our confusion is all in how we’re thinking 
              and not in reality itself.  We can come back to the simplicity of what 
              actually is.</p>
              <p>At the very heart of the present moment, in absolute 
              groundlessness, we discover the extraordinary miracle that we imagined 
              was “out there” somewhere. And we discover this not once and for all, 
              but right Now.  There is no “final awakening.” Awakening is an infinite 
              unfolding, an infinite Self-realization, an infinite discovery, an 
              infinite Now. It is never finished. There is no end to it and no 
              beginning. It is ever-present and ever-changing. </p>
              <p>Believing this as an idea is not enough. Belief is always 
              shadowed by doubt. And even though we may know this secret of life from 
              our own direct experience, our tendency is to forget and to once again 
              go looking “out there” for something to save us, or even to go looking <em>out
               there</em> for “Here and Now.”  This habit of overlooking the jewel and
               searching for it somewhere else is deeply conditioned and tends to 
              recur.  Seeking what has never been absent. It is a wonderful game, a 
              wonderful joke, a wonderful play. The Single Reality loses itself and 
              finds itself again and again.</p>
              <p>In waking up, we realize that there is no enlightenment 
              without delusion, and that we cannot actually say which comes first, 
              delusion or enlightenment. They both appear together, like form and 
              emptiness, or mind and matter, or chickens and eggs. Enlightenment is a 
              word for recognizing the Single Reality that is never absent. Delusion 
              is a word for entrancement in the story of separation and lack. 
              Enlightenment has no problem with delusion, and recognizes delusion as 
              an aspect of itself. In waking up from the story, consciousness 
              realizes, again and again, that it has never really been lost or 
              separate, that emptiness has never <em>actually</em> been absent. 
              Wherever you go, Here is always Here. There is no way out of Here and 
              Now.</p>
              <p>In direct experience right now, what <em>is</em> this 
              present moment?  Can we see that no word or concept could possibly 
              capture it? </p>
              <p>Consciousness continues to explore Itself, and this is the
               nature of Consciousness, to explore and inquire and question.  In the 
              dream-like movie of waking life, the Single Reality appears as a 
              multitude of individuals, and “we” do this exploration through 
              meditation and science and body awareness work and art and lovemaking 
              and politics and philosophy and psychotherapy and in all kinds of ways. 
              Consciousness explores and plays with itself -- this infinite presence. 
              And then, the Single Reality comes home from its explorations, and “we” 
              put aside all our words, our telescopes and microscopes, our computers 
              and paint brushes and cameras and drop into Silence. Deep sleep 
              refreshes us, but before long, the dream world appears and then the 
              movie of waking life, which is another kind of dream, and at the end of 
              every episode of that dream-like movie, “we” let everything go and fall 
              back into the refreshment of deep sleep, just like the whole universe, 
              endlessly expanding and contracting, dying and being born, inhaling and 
              exhaling.</p>
              <p>And perhaps at the very heart of the present moment, there
               may be the discovery of the emptiness and freedom of deep sleep while 
              fully awake, right in the midst of everyday life, the still point at the
               center, the Ultimate Subject, that which is unavoidable and never 
              absent, beholding and being it all.</p>
              <p>Where are the boundaries, the dividing lines, the place 
              where “I” begin and end? Don’t look for the answer in thought, but 
              simply be what you are, the answer-less-ness that needs no answer. You 
              may find there is no end and no beginning to this indescribable being 
              and no need to define it.</p>

              <p>The day 
              my 95 year old mother died, we blew bubbles over her bed, her Lift  Off 
              Bubbles, we called them. It was an extraordinary day, full of love and 
              joy  and laughter and tears. It was her last party, and she died just as
               the sun was  setting. She lifted off, nothing to nothing, dust to dust,
               ashes to ashes. I sat  with her cooling body, holding her bony hands, 
              touching her face. Although we  called them her Lift-Off bubbles, it was
               utterly clear that there was  no-<em>thing</em> apart from everything 
              that dies or survives death, no-thing  that lifts off and nowhere to go 
              other than right here.  The bubble of apparent  encapsulation burst, the
               dawn came,  the Dorothy Show is finished and yet never  finished, for 
              it can also be said that it never began – Dorothy is everywhere  and 
              everything, sparkling in this new November sunshine, dancing in the 
              leaves.  Each life is like a bubble, inside and outside are the same 
              always. When the  bubble pops, all is One as it always was, and there is
               no more imaginary  separation. Inside the bubble is empty; outside the 
              bubble is empty. Each bubble  is brief and fragile, but immensely 
              beautiful. Shimmering. Wobbling. Billowing.  Expanding. Popping. Oh, how
               I adored my mother's smile, her voice, her hair, her  face, her nose, 
              her hands – the Dorothy Show, ephemeral and precious. Pop!  Gone  now, 
              and always right here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What 
              Remains</strong></p>
              <p>Where is Dorothy? Gone!  <em>What</em> was 
              Dorothy?  Nothing can be grasped.  And yet, Dorothy can't be denied. 
              Form and emptiness, relative and absolute.  Ocean and wave.</p>
              <p>I cry
               and feel grief, but it is a pure grief, like a clean fire or a  
              cleansing rain, almost an ecstasy at times, and I feel a great peace and
               love  and groundedness, a new strength. Bits of my mother's life are 
              migrating into my  apartment now....a few red pillows, a purple sweater,
               her fuchsia colored  shawl.....and already this place is changed. And I
               am changed. Nothing seems  real now except the absolute simplicity of 
              what is minus <em>all</em> ideas  about it. Her death re-turns me to 
              what is real and authentic, to ground and  groundlessness.</p>
              <p>Leaving
               my last class at the college where I teach before Thanksgiving, I see  
              out the huge picture window in the hallway that winter has arrived with 
              wild  ferocity. Wind is raging and it is dark and bleak looking out 
              there. Snow is  blowing furiously by the window, the first snow. 
              Outside, as I walk to my car,  it is cold and dark and bare branches are
               tossing in the wind. And now, on  Thanksgiving morning, the sun is out 
              and the world is white and glistening.</p>
              <p>My mother, who was so 
              utterly real only a few months ago, and for as long as  I can remember 
              before that, is absolutely gone. And in my living room is a small  
              cardboard box with a label that says: "This package contains the 
              cremated  remains of Dorothy A. Tollifson."</p>
              <p>It's more like 
              gravel than ash, and it's inside the box in a plastic bag not  much 
              bigger than an eggplant. A small parcel really, it weighs about 10 
              pounds  maybe -- all that remains of an entire woman.</p>
              <p>She's 
              absolutely gone, and yet, she's right here. Not as a disembodied spirit 
               waiting to ascend or reincarnate as some folks imagine, but as the 
              entire  universe: undivided, un-encapsulated presence, energy, 
              beingness, consciousness,  space, life itself.</p>
              <p>Of course, the 
              Dorothy A. Tollifson who played with me as a baby has been  dead for 
              decades. I barely remember her. Without photos, I probably wouldn't be  
              able to picture that young woman at all. The Dorothy who saw me off to 
              college  35 years ago is also long dead, a dim memory, as is the 70 year
               old Dorothy who  lived so openly and gracefully through the death of my
               father, the man she loved  with all her heart and soul. In fact, death 
              is happening every moment.  Continuity is an illusion. Some pattern 
              apparently persists, something that  allows us to recognize someone on 
              the street whom we haven't seen in decades.  But every cell in their 
              body has been completely replaced in the course of those  decades. There
               is literally no-thing left of the person we knew before. And yet,  we <em>think</em> it is the same person.</p>

              forever in the very fabric of my life.</p>
              <p>I sort through her 
              possessions. Her clothing. Her jewelry. The art she  collected. Her 
              books. Her wine glasses. Her cereal bowls. Her teacups. Her  napkins. 
              Her towels. Her sheets and blankets. Her bags full of old birthday  
              cards and letters from her daughter. Her prayer wheel. Her hearing aids.
               Her  table clothes. The remains of a life.</p>
              <p>Her middle-aged 
              daughter going forward. Walking on into her own crumbling  away.</p>

              <p>It’s 
              astonishing how many people believe Mom is in heaven now, or floating  
              around the room somewhere, or that she’s been reincarnated in a new 
              body. It’s  all about the notion of a self or a soul – a discrete unit 
              that has continuity –  the “me” that we <em>think</em> and <em>imagine</em> that we are.  Does such a  “thing” as this exist or is it more like a 
              mirage?</p>
              <p>It has been said that a true and complete understanding 
              of impermanence  reveals that nothing is impermanent, for in actuality, 
              there are no persisting  <em>things</em> that come and go – there is 
              nothing solid here in the first  place to <em>be</em> impermanent. 
              Thought and imagination create the  <em>image</em> or <em>idea</em> of 
              various seemingly solid, independent,  persisting <em>things</em> (me, 
              you, table, chair, mother, father), objects that  <em>appear</em> to 
              come into existence, persist in some continuous and essential  way for a
               time, and then go out of existence.  But if we investigate directly,  
              with care and close attention, letting our <em>ideas</em> of how it is 
              fall  away, are any such solid and persisting <em>things</em> actually 
              found?</p>
              <p>The wave is something the ocean is doing – it is waving. 
              Language makes it  seem that “a wave” is some <em>thing</em> that can be
               separated out from some  other <em>thing</em>, “the ocean.” Is it true?
               When a wave breaks on the shore,  what happens to it? Does it go to 
              heaven? Does it float around ghost-like on the  beach?  Does it 
              reincarnate as a new wave?  Or are all these questions  misconceived? 
              Has any-<em>thing</em> actually died on the beach?  Was  any-<em>thing</em> there to begin with?  When you open your hand, what happens  to your 
              fist?  When you stand up, where does your lap go?  When the bubble pops,
                what happens to the space that was inside the bubble?</p>

              everyone is up in heaven, it must be getting pretty crowded up there,”  
              Mom once joked.</p>
              <p>A so-called “person” is really more like a verb
               than a noun, more of a  <em>process</em> than a solid and enduring <em>thing</em>.
                And this process is  an activity of the boundless Whole, inseparable 
              from everything else in the  whole universe. An activity that is without
               beginning or end isn’t a “thing”  that can reincarnate, but we could 
              say that this boundless wholeness  reincarnates endlessly as <em>everything</em> (one undivided waving whole, a  boundlessness “which is never static or
               complete but which is an unending  process of movement and unfoldment,”
               in the beautiful words of the late  physicist David Bohm). Dorothy has 
              not disappeared because the activity or  process that was called Dorothy
               actually has no beginning and no end. It never  really had solid 
              boundary lines around it; it just <em>seemed</em> like it did.</p>
              <p>So
               what has actually died? It <em>seems</em> like <em>something</em> has 
              very  definitely come to an end, but what <em>is</em> it?  After all, 
              there were many  times when she was alive that my Dorothy disappeared 
              (whenever she went into  another room, or I was in another city, or my 
              attention was elsewhere), and so  what’s <em>actually</em> different 
              this time? And is my Dorothy the same as  someone else’s Dorothy, or 
              Dorothy’s Dorothy?  In fact, I knew many different  Dorothys over a 
              lifetime or even in the space of an hour, and Dorothy  undoubtedly did 
              too! Which was the <em>real</em> Dorothy? And what exactly  <em>is</em> it that would go to heaven or be reborn?</p>
              <p>At a quick glance, and 
              because we have a <em>word</em> for it and a mental  <em>image</em> and 
              an <em>idea</em> of it, a whirlpool in a river <em>looks</em> like a 
              solid <em>something. </em>At first glance, we see what we <em>think</em> is there. But if “the whirlpool” is carefully observed as it actually 
               <em>is,</em> it is discovered that there is actually no-<em>thing</em> there.  The so-called 'whirlpool' is constantly moving, changing shape, 
              being  reconstituted. And there is no real separation between whirlpool 
              and river.  There is simply a fluctuating pattern of water in motion 
              that is actually not  solid or separate or autonomous in any way. We 
              could say that the whirlpool is  an activity of the river. And then when
               we carefully observe the so-called  “river,” we again find no-<em>thing</em> at all, only continuous movement and  change, and the same when we 
              examine the “water”  or “the pattern.” Even closer  in, we find empty 
              space and subatomic particles or wavicles that flash in and  out of 
              existence in a quantum world where apparent solidity seems to be  
              contingent on (or a function of) observation.  Is there an observer and 
               something else apart from this observer that is being observed? Or is 
              there only  observing, only being?</p>
              <p>By paying careful attention 
              to actuality (not our <em>ideas</em> about  actuality, but actuality 
              itself), it is clearly seen that there is no particular  solid or 
              enduring <em>thing</em> to be found anywhere, and there is no real  
              separation (or duality) either.  Seeing this is profoundly liberating. 
              Although  if we ask, “What does this do for me?”, the answer is, it 
              doesn’t do anything  for “me.” It reveals that this “me” is a mirage. 
              And ultimately, even that  mirage is something that the totality is 
              doing in the same way the ocean is  waving. But we have to be very 
              careful with words such as “Totality,” or  “Being,” or “Consciousness,” 
              or “the Whole,” because again, is there really any  such <em>thing</em> to be found?</p>
              <p><em>When form disappears, there is no emptiness to 
              speak of.</em></p>
              <p>In paying careful attention to this so-called 
              bodymind, this apparent person,  it is discovered that this, too, is 
              actually no-thing. This bodymind that seems  so separate and solid and 
              discrete and autonomous and independent  <em>appears</em> to be a 
              permanent <em>something</em> but is actually like the  whirlpool or the 
              wave or the river. It is a constantly changing functioning, an  activity
               inseparable from the entire universe.  Inside the bubble and outside  
              the bubble is one and the same space, one and the same energy. And if we
               look  for the operator or the creator or the observer or the owner or 
              the source or  the substance of this functioning, what is found?</p>
              <p>We
               may find <em>ideas</em> like "me" or "God" or "Consciousness" or  
              “Intelligence Energy” or “The One Being” or “The Self” or “Totality” 
              springing  up as possible answers to this question. But if we are not 
              satisfied with ideas  or concepts or subtle mental pictures, if we let 
              them all go and fall back into  not knowing, into simply being present 
              with the openness of the question itself,  what is found?</p>
              <p>Rather
               than seeking a mental answer (a word or an idea or a “thing”), perhaps 
               it is possible to live with that question, allowing it to dissolve all 
              the  possible answers.</p>
              <p>What remains is not a word. And it is not
               <em>nothing</em> (in the sense of  void). It is simply not <em>something</em> that can be grasped or contained by  any word or concept. It is not “an
               answer.”</p>
              <p>Liberation is a dropping away (or seeing through) 
              rather than a picking up  (or finding). It takes away <em>everything</em> and leaves no-<em>thing</em> at  all. And this no-thing-ness is 
              vibrantly alive. It is clouds blowing through the  sky, trees bursting 
              with leaves, snow falling, the taste of tea, the warmth of  the sun, the
               smell of wet earth, the sounds of rain, tornados whisking away  houses,
               bombs dropping on innocent children, ant hills being crushed under  
              people’s shoes, colors and sensations, the whole amazing show with all 
              its  delicate beauty and all its horrific violence, all the sorrow and 
              all the joy.  Just this, exactly as it is.</p>
              <p>I hope that this book 
              will invite you to explore for yourself, to question,  to stop, look, 
              and listen. Endlessly interesting to wake up to what actually is.  
              Endlessly liberating to let all the answers go, and to discover what's  
              left.</p>

              let go of everything.<br> <br> </em>--Nisargadatta 
              Maharaj</p>
              <p>What is life all about? Does it mean anything?
               Where are  we looking for happiness or liberation? Do we have free 
              will? What is  enlightenment and how can I get it? Can anything be done 
              to free  ourselves from depression, anxiety, compulsive behavior, wars, 
               holocausts, prejudices? What is spiritual (and what isn't)? What 
              happens  when we die?<br> <br> The thinking mind wants 
              to find answers to questions. When  you're trying to find out which bus 
              to take or how to build a house,  this ability to find answers is a 
              useful function. But the thinking mind  doesn't know when to stop 
              thinking or when thinking is useful and when  it isn't. And so, as we 
              grow up, we live more and more in a conceptual  world trying to think 
              our way to happiness. We lose touch with the  immediacy and wonder we 
              had as children.<br> <br> When I was a little girl, my 
              mother used to give me a pail of  water and a paintbrush so that I could
               paint on the sidewalk. I'd paint  these paintings on the sidewalk with 
              water, and they would disappear in  a matter of minutes, but that didn't
               matter because what I was enjoying  was the sheer joy of doing it. It 
              needed no reward, no praise, no  permanence. It was complete in itself.<br> <br> And then at another point in my life, I was an art
               student,  and I can remember seriously questioning whether it was worth
               painting  at all if I weren't Leonardo or Picasso, if I were less than 
              perfect.  That sense of playfulness and curiosity that children have so 
              naturally,  enjoying the simplicity of being, gets overshadowed by this 
              attempt to  make something out of me, to make "me" into a successful me.<br> <br> Very often when we come to spirituality, even when
               it's  supposedly all about waking up from this story of me, it morphs 
              into  it's own new version of this same story, focused now on how 
              successfully  I'm waking up, how well I'm meditating, whether I'm 
              enlightened or not.  Oddly enough, this me that we're so concerned about
               may be nothing more  than a kind of mirage or mental image, the central
               character in a movie  story generated by thought and imagination, 
              nothing real at all.<br> <br> How can we find out? Is it
               possible to wake up from this  mental mirage, this entrancement in 
              thought? What is it that would wake  up? Is it "me"? Or is it something 
              else?<br> <br> Again, the thinking mind looks 
              immediately for answers. We  seek out authorities and adopt their views.
               We cling to ideas and  explanations, and seek bigger and better 
              experiences.<br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>Liberation is not about having the answers or having an 
               experience. It has nothing to do with belief, but is rather the absence
                (or transparency, or seeing through) of belief. Waking up does not  
              happen in the past or the future, only Now. Liberation or enlightenment 
               is not something you find or acquire like a new car. It is not some  
              dazzling or exotic experience like being permanently high on ecstasy or 
               LSD. Liberation is seeing through the ubiquitous fabrications and  
              mirages of conceptual thought, including the whole idea of liberation  
              and the one who supposedly needs to be liberated.<br> <br> Ultimate Reality is hidden right in front of our eyes in  plain view.
               It is showing up as breakfast dishes, laundry, sunlight on  leaves, the
               barking of a dog, sound of traffic or rain, the humming of  the 
              computer, the taste of tea, the shapes of these words, and the  
              awareness being and beholding it all. And only when we describe all of  
              this in words does it seem as if "awareness" is one thing and "the taste
                of tea" is something else. The non-conceptual actuality of this  
              breathing-hearing-seeing-being is undivided, without center or  
              periphery. No inside, no outside. No subject, no object. Simply <em>this</em>,
                just as it is.<br> <br> And then perhaps a thought: 
              "There must be more to life than  this," or "What is the meaning of it 
              all?" or "What about final  enlightenment?" or "Isn't this all just the 
              phenomenal manifestation,  and isn't that an illusion?" Thought creates 
              imaginary problems and  tries to solve them. The complex human brain has
               an astonishing ability  to conceptualize, imagine, remember, project, 
              and think about things  that have no actual reality. Yet even these 
              thoughts are nothing but a  momentary dream-like shape or expression of 
              the One, undivided,  boundless Whole.<br> <br> Thought 
              labels, categorizes, evaluates, and reifies the  ever-changing 
              perceptions that appear. Conceptual thought creates the  hypnotic, 
              mirage-like illusion of solid, persisting, independent <em>things</em> (including "me" and "you") -- the illusion of duality and separation.  
              Thought imagines "me" as a separate character on a journey through time.
                It conjures up goals and stories of success and failure. It even  
              creates the image of "me" as a serious spiritual person dedicated to  
              getting rid of the "me." But without thinking, where is the "me"? What  
              am I, really?<br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>Is it possible that the peace and well-being we seek 
              (that  longing at the root of all our more superficial desires), cannot 
              be  found or satisfied by answers or attainments or experiences of any 
              kind?  Is it possible that the very search for it "out there" is 
              precisely  what prevents us from noticing that what we are seeking is 
              the very  essence of Here and Now?<br> <br> And what is 
              that?<br> <br> It is nothing you can take hold of 
              conceptually, and it's not  any <em>particular</em> experience (as 
              opposed to any other  experience). It is the beingness, the 
              groundlessness, the IS-ness of  this moment -- this that is undeniably 
              present beyond all doubt,  requiring no proof or belief, impossible to 
              deny -- before and after and  even during all the grasping and searching
               and experience-seeking. The  words (beingness, groundlessness, IS-ness)
               are only pointers. What they  point to is nothing you can get hold of 
              as an object. In fact, there  really are no solid objects because 
              everything is thorough-going flux.  This no-<em>thing</em>-ness (or 
              emptiness) is all there really is.<br> <br> And this 
              no-<em>thing</em>-ness is vibrantly alive, aware,  conscious, awake, 
              present. The grasping, searching and thinking may <em>seem</em> to 
              destroy the wholeness of being or the spaciousness of  
              presence-awareness, but can anything <em>really</em> destroy awareness, 
               or the present moment, or beingness? Doesn't <em>everything</em> appear
                Here and Now, in awareness? And doesn't everything appear altogether 
              at  once as one diverse but seamless whole?<br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>Conceptual 
              thought (apparently) divides it up. The  division and separation are 
              never really there, of course. They exist  only in thought and 
              imagination, but if that thought isn't seen through,  if it is believed 
              and taken seriously, then the result is suffering.  Zen and Advaita are 
              all about waking up from this entrancement and  suffering. But it isn't 
              "you" who wakes up and then becomes "an awakened  person." That is 
              delusion. The very notion that there is someone who  needs to wake up 
              from delusion is part of the delusion! The problem of  bondage only 
              exists in the thought-created movie world of imagination.  The whole 
              problem is a kind of mirage. What's real is never absent, and  what <em>seems</em> to obscure it is never real.<br> <br> No words can ever
               capture the actuality of this one eternal  present moment. It can be 
              talked about and pointed to in various  different ways, but anything we 
              say about actuality is never actuality  itself. We may nod in agreement 
              upon hearing that; nevertheless, we  habitually tend to mistake the map 
              for the territory, the concept for  the actual. We then get into endless
               debates and confusion over  imaginary dilemmas such as whether there is
               or isn't free will, or  whether any kind of spiritual practice is worth
               doing or not, or whether  the world is real and deserving of our 
              attention or only a dream-like  illusion that is best ignored. This 
              mind-spinning goes in circles  leading nowhere. Reality can't ever be 
              captured in concepts (like free  will or no free will, self or no self, 
              this or that). Whatever you say  is never quite right. No word or 
              concept is ever complete enough. If you  say that you can't learn to 
              ride a bicycle because there's no you to do  it, or no free will, you'll
               be foolishly disempowering yourself. And  yet, if you look carefully at
               who or what is riding the bicycle or  "choosing" to do so, you won't 
              find anything or anybody, nor can you  really explain how exactly "you" 
              do this bicycle riding.<br> <br> We can argue endlessly 
              over who rides, and whether or not  they can freely choose to do it, or 
              whether instruction and training is  necessary or only a hindrance, and 
              we can discuss the mechanics of  bicycles and bicycle riding, or tell 
              stories about legendary riders of  the past, but finally, no amount of 
              description or prescription will  tell you how to ride a bicycle or how 
              it is to be riding one. Talking  about it, reading about it, watching 
              others do it, or debating about who  does it best, is not the same as 
              simply doing it. Of course,  enlightenment isn't quite the same as 
              riding a bicycle, because  enlightenment isn't an activity, but rather 
              the realization of what has  never been absent and the recognition that 
              there is no way in or out of  the groundlessness of what is. <em>This</em> is all there is, and you  are this. But as in bicycle riding, it's the 
              actuality that matters, the  territory itself and not the map. 
              Discussing enlightenment (or  awakening, or liberation), thinking about 
              it, imagining it, or seeking  it as a future event are all map-events. 
              But enlightenment is the  territory itself, although paradoxically, even
               the map is the territory,  for the One Reality is inescapable and 
              unavoidable. It is absolutely  simple and immediate and impossible to 
              lose.<br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>Right now, simply listen to the sounds that are 
              occurring.  Traffic sounds, honking horn, bird cheeping, lawn mower, 
              snow blower,  rain falling, wind, rustling leaves, dog barking, vacuum 
              cleaner,  children's voices, boom box, siren, train whistle, whatever it
               is.  Listen to the sounds as pure sound, in the same way you might 
              listen to  music. If there is no sound at all where you are, listen to 
              the silence.  Feel the breathing, the sensations of the body, the heart 
              beating, the  rushes of energy, the tightness in the chest, whatever is 
              felt. Feel all  of this as pure sensation, without labels or judgments, 
              without  resistance, without trying to correct or improve or enhance it 
              in any  way. See all the colors and shapes and movements around you in 
              the same  way you might enjoy an abstract painting. Notice that 
              everything is  constantly changing, and yet, it all happens Here and 
              Now. Here is  always here. It's always Now. This "Now" can't be pinned 
              down, nor can  it be avoided. It's always right here, seamlessly 
              present. Here and Now  is obvious, unavoidable and undeniable.<br> <br> What <em>is</em> Here and Now?<br> <br> Notice what happens when this question is asked. Does the  thinking mind
               instantly kick in looking for the answer? Does thought  begin searching
               the spiritual (or scientific, or psychological) files?  "This is all 
              Consciousness," we might think. Or, "This is pure  awareness," or "This 
              is brain activity," or "This is my living room," or  "This is text on a 
              web site," or "This is Intelligence Energy vibrating  into different 
              patterns," or "This is a dream," or "This is the  phenomenal 
              manifestation and I am pure neumonom."<br> <br> Can it 
              be seen right now that these are all thoughts? They  are concepts, 
              ideas, explanations, words, labels, beliefs. They may have  their 
              usefulness, and they may be relatively more or less accurate as  
              pointers or maps, but notice right now that they are all <em>words</em>.
                They are not the <em>actuality</em> (the <em>suchness</em>) of  
              ever-changing sounds, sensations, shapes and colors. They are  
              descriptions or labels (as are all the words I just used). The word  
              "awareness" is not awareness. Any <em>idea</em> of awareness or presence
                can be doubted or argued. But the <em>actuality</em> of awareness or  
              presence is beyond doubt or belief. It needs no proof. The word  
              "awareness" seems to make "awareness" into a separate thing. But the  
              actuality isn't really separate from everything else, is it? The Present
                Moment isn't really divided up into "awareness" and "content."  It is 
               one seamless Whole.<br> <br> Can <em>all</em> words, 
              labels, concepts, ideas, and beliefs  be allowed to fall away (not 
              forever and ever, but right now)? If they  are let go, then what 
              remains?<br> <br> Is the thinking mind looking for <em>something</em> (an  experience, a particular sensation, the right conceptual 
              understanding,  the absence of something, or whatever it might be)? Can 
              that seeking  activity be seen through and allowed to drop away? Can 
              there be a simple  resting in what <em>actually</em> remains -- <em>this</em> that is  utterly inconceivable and yet totally obvious and impossible 
              to avoid?  Seeing, hearing, awaring, breathing -- simply this. Not the 
              words, but  the actuality. (And if the mind is now trying to banish 
              words and  thoughts in order to achieve some imagined non-conceptual 
              purity, can  that effort also be seen for what it is? <em>Nothing</em> needs to be  banished, not even this effort! It's <em>all</em> one 
              indivisible  flowing whole -- this ever-changing appearance that always 
              happens in  this omnipresent Here and Now).<br> <br> Every moment is utterly new. Don't cling to the words.  They're never 
              quite right. Language is inherently dualistic. It requires  subjects and
               objects, it reifies and divides, but in actuality, where  are the 
              boundary lines? Where does "inside" turn into "outside"? You can  <em>think</em> of a conceptual answer, but looking directly with  awareness, can you 
              actually <em>find</em> such a place? Can you see that  this boundary is 
              purely conceptual, that it's not actually found in  direct experience? 
              Don't take this on belief, but right now, if you  close your eyes and 
              pay careful attention, can you actually find the  place where "inside" 
              ends and "outside" begins? How solid is what you <em>think</em> of as 
              "your body"? Is the apparent border between "you" and "everything  else"
               really there in your actual experience, or is it actually nothing  more
               than an idea, a mental image, a river of ever-changing sensations,  a 
              story appearing <em>in</em> awareness? Can you find any limit to  
              present awareness?<br></p>

              <p>What is being pointed to is not something you can  
              formulate and take hold of and possess. Zen, Advaita, Dzogchen, Taoism, 
               meditative inquiry, the power of now, presence-awareness, radical  
              non-duality -- many names have been given to this aliveness. The danger 
               in names is that they so easily solidify, codify, and deaden into 
              dogma.  Next thing we know, we have priests, scriptures, lineages, 
              doctrines,  holy wars, blogs - right ways and wrong ways. You may 
              consider yourself a  free-thinking, anti-authoritarian type, but this 
              tendency toward  dogmatism, fundamentalism, and authoritarianism can 
              take subtler and  subtler forms. It's easier to see it "out there" than 
              it is to see it in  oneself. Faced with uncertainty and insecurity, we 
              want answers and  reassurance. It's easy to slide into believing 
              something, and then into  identifying with those beliefs, and then into 
              defending them to the  death (literally or metaphorically). Belief is 
              always shadowed by doubt.  Let go of everything that can be doubted, and
               see what remains. What is  beyond doubt takes no effort to maintain.<br> <br> The ability to think in highly complex and 
              abstract ways is  both our greatest gift and our greatest source of 
              suffering. Reactions  and behaviors that make perfect sense in the wild 
              often become useless  or destructive when they get carried over into the
               psychological realm.  We react to an insulting remark in the same way 
              we react to an attacking  tiger, or we search for enlightenment "out 
              there" in the same way we  search for food and shelter, and we end up 
              with anxiety, depression,  insomnia, and global warfare. We could say 
              that waking up is about  seeing through illusion, discerning the 
              difference between what is real  and what is imagination. Awakening 
              doesn't mean never thinking again or  throwing out all the conceptual 
              maps, but it does mean being able to see  (in the present moment) the 
              difference between the map and the  territory, and this seeing gets ever
               more subtle and refined.<br> <br> Thinking is not the 
              enemy. In practical matters, thinking  makes sense. It's a wonderful 
              tool. But much, maybe most, of our  thinking has nothing to do with 
              practical matters. Instead, it's a kind  of habitual spinning of our 
              wheels, chasing mental phantoms, battling  with ghosts, obsessing over 
              dreams. This kind of thinking never really  works or satisfies us in the
               way we want it to. If you pay careful  attention to it, you'll begin to
               notice how painful it is, and yet also  how compelling. It's very much 
              like an addiction. In fact, we could say  that this kind of thinking <em>is</em> our root addiction. You may also  notice that all of these obsessive 
              thoughts center around the fictional  "me" in some way or other: 
              evaluating "me," judging "me," trying to make  "me" happy or safe or 
              powerful or enlightened. Waking up is not about  bringing the story of 
              me to a satisfying conclusion. It's about seeing  through the story. 
              It's about recognizing that the story appears and  disappears within 
              you, within awareness. The story is ephemeral,  insubstantial, 
              intermittent, fleeting. Awakening doesn't mean you forget  your name or 
              your life history, or that you lose all sense of being a  particular 
              individual. It simply means recognizing that all of that is a  momentary
               appearance in awareness, a kind of play.<br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>In some spiritual
               circles, there is considerable  preoccupation with having a big bang 
              awakening, imagined to be some line  in the sand that "you" cross, after
               which the mirage of encapsulation  is forever, irrevocably ended, and 
              after which "you" are a liberated  sage at last! Among so-called 
              seekers, there is often great fascination  with teachers, sages, and 
              gurus who have supposedly crossed that  mythical line. Everyone wants to
               hear their story. And above all, we  want to know how this same 
              wonderful thing can happen to me! Is it  possible to see that this is 
              the same old story about me? There may be  people (but only ever in the 
              dream-like movie of waking life) who have  had all kinds of amazing 
              experiences, but enlightenment is the end of  the one who cares about 
              being enlightened or unenlightened. It is the  realization that there is
               not, and there has never <em>been</em> a  separate person to get 
              enlightened. And however many times the mirage of  encapsulation 
              appears, it is always only a mirage. And it isn't "me"  who wakes up 
              from this mirage because "me" <em>is</em> the mirage! In  fact, it isn't
               "me" who does anything.<br> <br> As "you" are reading 
              these words right now, little markings  appearing on this page in 
              various combinations are being seen and  instantly translated into 
              meaning. Is there someone doing this  remarkable activity, overseeing 
              all these elaborate optical and  neurological processes, or is it all 
              happening automatically, on its  own? We say, "I" am reading, "I" am 
              seeing, "I" am hearing, "I" am  thinking, "I" stopped smoking, "I" 
              overate. But what exactly is that  "I"? Do "you" really know (or 
              control) what "your" next thought or  "your" next action will be?<br> <br> Right <em>here</em>, there is the ability to put 
              attention on  your left foot and wiggle your toes. But how does all that
               actually  happen and what initiates it? Where do will and intention 
              come from?  Once the mind tries to capture this happening in words, it 
              instantly  creates the mirage of duality. Suddenly we are apparently 
              lost in  imaginary problems and conundrums: Do I have free will? If so, 
              why do I  do things I don't want to do? How can I change? What should I 
              do? Can I  do anything? Do I exist?<br> <br> This is all
               thought. Whenever there is confusion and seeking,  it's a clue that 
              thought is busy chasing its own tail. Actuality is  simple. The present 
              moment is simple. <em>Here</em>, there is no  confusion, no problem, no 
              free will, no absence of free will. You are  simply doing whatever you 
              are doing. And actually, there is no "you"  doing any of it. That "you" 
              is an after-thought, a mental image, a  grammatical convention, a 
              reification of some energetic flow that is  truly no-thing at all. In 
              actuality, life is simply living itself  through the appearance of "you"
               and "me." Truly seeing this eliminates  all guilt and blame.<br> <br> Given the "wrong" combination of genetics, 
              neurochemistry,  conditioning, provocation, and opportunity, what we 
              consider horrible  things can happen. "I" could be the perpetrator of 
              such things, or "you"  could. And while we would certainly want a serial
               killer or a child  molester locked up for the protection of everyone; 
              at the same time, if  we look deeply, we can see that they are 
              blameless. No one would commit  atrocities if they really had a choice, 
              if they were really free.  Looking closely, it can be seen that if "I" 
              were in "their" shoes (that  is to say, if "I" had the same combination 
              of genetics, neurochemistry,  conditioning, provocation, and 
              opportunity), then "I" would do exactly  the same thing "they" did, 
              because there is no "I" and no "them" apart  from the "shoes" (the ten 
              million conditions -- nature and nurture).<br> <br> Does
               that mean that we should be totally passive or inert or  maybe wildly 
              licentious because, "It's all just happening," and "We have  no choice"?
               No. It means that the "me" who could apparently <em>choose</em> to be 
              this way or that way is a phantom, a mental image with no  substance. 
              Does that mean we are powerless, that nothing can be done?<br> <br> Rather than slap down a conceptual answer (yes or no), is it  
              possible to live with the question, to not know? Watch carefully as  
              actions occur, as choices are made and decisions are reached - from the 
               little ones like whether to get up from the chair, to the big ones like
                whether to get married or move across country - watch carefully. See 
              if  you can find the one in control, or if you can catch the decisive  
              moment, or if you can explain how it all happens. You may find that you 
               can't find anyone at the helm or say how it is that "you" do the  
              simplest things, like raising your arm or reading these words. On the  
              other hand, you can't really say that you <em>can't</em> do things  
              either, since there is clearly an ability <em>right here</em> to act.  
              You simply can't get hold (conceptually) of exactly what that is or how 
               it works. And the more awareness is brought to any particular activity,
                the more refined the activity and the awareness seem to become, and 
              the  more possibilities open up. But who brings awareness to an 
              activity? Is  there a choice involved? You may find that words and 
              concepts simply  can't contain the actuality.<br> <br> <em>Here</em>,
               in non-conceptual actuality, is the natural  response-ability and 
              intelligence, the choiceless choice or effortless  effort exerted by 
              life itself: breathing, circulating blood, thinking,  awareness of 
              thinking, dreaming, waking up, appearing, disappearing --  one 
              indivisible wholeness in which there is nothing separate to have or  not
               have free will, to cause or be caused, to be born or to die, to be  
              enlightened or unenlightened.<br> <br> Thought seemingly
               divides this wholeness up. It imposes a  grid on top of the emptiness 
              and conceptually sorts it into little  squares. Then it imagines that 
              Square A causes Square B, or that Square B  is the result of Square A, 
              or that Square A has free will to choose  between Square B and Square C,
               or that Square A comes before Square B in  time and space. This is all 
              imagination, a way of conceptualizing. The  squares aren't really 
              separate; the boundaries don't actually exist;  they're only conceptual,
               as are the imagined relationships between the  squares, including time 
              and space. The squares are actually not related  at all because they're 
              not two. And this thinking process that imposes  conceptual grids on 
              wholeness is itself an aspect of the same wholeness,  as is the 
              awareness that sees through the imaginary grids. <em>Everything</em> is
               included in the Absolute. We could say that the Absolute includes  the 
              relative (the world of apparent grids), but isn't bound by it.  
              Awakening doesn't mean ignoring, discounting or denying relative  
              reality, but awakening sees through it. It recognizes the emptiness of  
              everything. But in relative reality, the show goes on, and you (as an  
              apparent character) play your part, apparently making choices and taking
                actions.<br> <br> What we often think of or <em>call</em> choices are simply  thoughts that arise unbidden that may or may not be
               followed by the  result they appear to select. A thought such as "I am 
              going to quit  smoking" arises on its own out of the ten million 
              conditions and may or  may not be followed by the cessation of smoking 
              because that thought has  no power. The "I" to which it refers is a 
              powerless mirage, an  illusion. A mirage cannot choose to do (or not do)
               anything. To the  mind, this idea of having no choice and no free will 
              sounds scary, as if  "I" might then be a robot with no control. But this
               apparent dilemma  vanishes into thin air with the realization that 
              there is no "I" here in  the first place to be either bound or free.<br> <br> And actually, thought and conditioned existence <em>are</em> quite robotic and mechanical, but there is something prior to thought 
               and conditioned existence that is free and unbound. The energy and  
              aliveness is in that boundlessness. "You" as the character in the story 
               of your life are an imagination, a phantom, an ever-changing 
              appearance.  You (in Truth) are the emptiness that is being and 
              beholding it all,  the no-<em>thing</em>-ness, the boundlessness that is
               appearing as  everything, including you (the character) and the story 
              of your life.  Whatever appears will disappear. Whatever comes can go 
              again, and  whatever goes, can always come back. But boundlessness is 
              ever-present. <em>That</em> is all there is. There can be the <em>idea</em> of "your mind" and  "your body" and "your free will" or your "lack of 
              free will." But look  closely and see if any of this is really here.<br></p>

              <p>Zoom in close enough or back far enough, or turn attention 
               to the source of seeing or to awareness itself, and you find nothing  
              that you can grasp, and yet, you find <em>everything</em>! You <em>know</em> that you (as presence-awareness) are here, and you know this with  
              absolute doubtless certainty. <em>Being here</em> is beyond doubt.<br> <br> No word can contain or describe what has been called
               the  Unborn, the Absolute, the Tao, Pure Awareness, Oneness, 
              Buddha-Nature,  the Self, Truth, Totality, the One Mind -- the words are
               only pointers.  They point beyond conceptualization, to what is utterly
               obvious and  omnipresent. They point to Here and Now, the One Eternal 
              Present Moment.<br> <br> And <em>what</em> is that?<br> <br> Any attempt to grasp it ends in frustration. And 
              yet, it's  unavoidably right here. It is not something mystical and 
              transcendental  that you have to work very hard to see. It is this 
              direct experiencing  right now. It is <em>seemingly</em> obscured by the
               very effort to pin  it down, grasp it mentally, conceptualize it. In 
              that grasping and the  ensuing frustration, we feel confused and 
              separate. Waking up is simply  relaxing that mental grasping. In the 
              words of one Zen teacher, waking  up is opening the hand of thought.<br> <br> Buddha-Nature (or the Self) is actually 
              omnipresent---it  never really leaves us, even in the midst of grasping 
              and seeking, for  even the grasping and seeking is an activity of the 
              same indivisible  boundlessness. Boundlessness is the ever-present 
              reality <em>in spite</em> of whatever form it appears to take, never <em>because
               of</em> any form  it apparently takes. But whenever attention becomes 
              absorbed in  thoughts (mental movies, worries, obsessions), then it <em>seems</em> that boundlessness has been lost. It <em>seems</em> that "I" am a  
              separate somebody struggling to regain "Oneness" or "awareness" or "the 
               present moment,"  as if that were some object apart from me that I need
                to find, grasp, understand, experience, merge with, identify with, or 
               become. The mental mirage-world fills the screen and the story <em>seems</em> utterly real, all-pervasive and convincing. And paradoxically, every  
              attempt to resist suffering only seems to confirm the imaginary problem 
               and make the suffering worse. Ultimately, there is no way out except to
                see that there is no need of a way out.<br> <br> See 
              how transparent it all is. These thoughts and the movies  they unfold on
               the screen of awareness are simply secretions of the  brain, 
              conditioned habit patterns, mental weather -- there is nothing  personal
               about them. There is no need to resist or vanquish them; simply  see 
              them for what they are.<br> <br> Seeing the mirage-world
               of thoughts and mental movies for  what it is gets ever more subtle. 
              Being down on yourself for "thinking  too much" is just more thinking! 
              There is no "you" doing the thinking or  the seeing; that "you" is only 
              another thought, another mental image.  Liberation isn't about <em>getting
               rid</em> of anything; it's about <em>seeing</em> that there is nothing
               separate from anything else. The "me" who wants  to stop thinking is 
              just another mental image, another thought, another  movie character in 
              another story.<br> <br> Reality is unavoidable. It is 
              right here in the smell of  rain, the song of a bird, the whoosh of 
              traffic, sensations -- the  nondual absolute. Totally alive. 
              Ungraspable. No final result, no finish  line, no Big Bang event, no you
               -- just what is, as it is. No need for  exotic experiences. Nothing to 
              be eliminated or held on to, and nothing  to be acquired or understood. 
              Nothing excluded. Nothing singled out.  Freedom is utterly simple and 
              uncomplicated.<br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>Although everything is seamless and without division,  
              entrancement in the story of separation is a different <em>experience</em> from open, spacious, unclouded awareness. In the extremes of  
              entrancement, people torture and exterminate millions of other people  
              because it seems like a good idea. Naturally, we want to wake up from  
              such entrancement on both the personal and global levels. But there's a 
               very subtle catch here.<br> <br> Resisting suffering or
               <em>trying</em> to wake up is itself  part of the suffering, part of 
              the confusion. It doesn't work because it  is rooted in the illusion of 
              separation, the same illusion and  confusion that generates the 
              suffering. Suffering can only end here and  now with the total 
              acceptance of what is. It is the very <em>nature</em> of Now 
              (awareness, emptiness, beingness) to include and accept  everything. 
              Everything <em>is</em> allowed to be, obviously, because  it's here! 
              Everything <em>is</em> as it is, and could not be otherwise.<br> <br> Taking action (or non-action) to relieve pain, heal injury,  
              or correct injustice arises naturally. The universe acts. Ultimately,  
              what is healed will be broken down again. All form is impermanent; it  
              never even exists in the way we <em>think</em> it does. True freedom is 
               recognizing the emptiness (or boundlessness) that is unborn and 
              undying,  the emptiness that is here <em>regardless</em> of relative  
              circumstances and never <em>because of</em> relative circumstances.<br> <br> If the movie begins playing in which "you" are 
              trying to  "get" this recognition, and feeling badly when it appears 
              that "you"  have failed, then simply notice that this is yet another 
              movie, another  dream-like appearance in consciousness, another story 
              about the  imaginary character. Emptiness is already here. It can't be 
              lost (or  found). Awareness includes everything and sticks to nothing. 
              Clouds  appear. Contraction appears. Pain appears. Resistance and 
              tension  appear. Expansion and relaxation appear. Mental movies appear 
              and  disappear. Dreams come and go. Everything disappears in deep sleep 
              and  death and reappears again in waking life. It's all a boundless ebb 
              and  flow that includes absolutely <em>everything</em>, even contraction
               and  distraction and resistance and the <em>appearance</em> of 
              separation and  encapsulation -- even so-called "evil." It all <em>is</em>.<br> <br> But that doesn't mean losing the ability to 
              differentiate  between clarity and confusion, nor does it mean not 
              flossing your teeth  or not working to correct injustice if you are 
              moved to do so. Wholeness  includes discernment and the ability to act. 
              It includes the ability to  notice errors and correct them. So awakening
               doesn't mean we have to  sit back and do nothing about problems because
               we have the <em>idea</em> that everything is "okay" as it is. As my 
              first Zen teacher told me:  "You're perfect just as you are, and that 
              doesn't mean there's no room  for improvement." There's room for 
              everything! But the true <em>source</em> of any action is the Totality,
               not the imaginary separate person. And  whatever happens is a 
              dream-like appearance. The last moment has already  totally vanished 
              into thin air! How real was it?<br> <br> There is no 
              distance at all between samsara and nirvana. The <em>illusion</em> of 
              distance is samsara, and nirvana is simply the realization that this  
              distance, or separation, is imaginary. Liberation is not about "you"  
              getting from samsara to nirvana. That is illusion. Liberation is the  
              absence of that whole story of separation and lack.<br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>But 
              as a belief, all this is meaningless. Liberation isn't  about picking up
               a new belief system or a new set of answers (for  example, that, "All 
              is One," or "There is nothing to attain," or,  "Consciousness is all 
              there is," or, "There is no free will," or,  "Everything is perfect."). 
              Liberation is the aliveness and immediacy  beyond belief. Liberation is 
              when <em>all</em> the answers, explanations  and positions disappear, 
              and what remains is the open mind of not  knowing.<br> <br> Thus it has been said, if you meet the Buddha, kill it. If  you find
               the answer, drop it. Yesterday's answer is today's dead meat.  Let it 
              go. There is no enlightened person. There is only enlightened  seeing, 
              enlightened being, enlightened consciousness -- impersonal  clarity. 
              There is no unenlightened person either -- only confusion and  
              entrancement, impersonal obscuration. <em>All</em> of this is like  
              weather -- it comes and goes -- and <em>all</em> of it is an aspect of  
              the undivided whole, inseparable from every other aspect: the confusion,
                the clarity, the desire to wake up, the impulse to clarify and heal,  
              the various forms of meditative inquiry and exploration, the practices, 
               the waking up from practices -- all of it is what is.<br> <br> If you try to make sense of all this and adopt some fixed  
              position or view, sooner or later, the ground you imagine yourself  
              standing on will be swept away. Liberation is not a matter of pinning  
              down the "right" answer or the "correct" position. Reality cannot be  
              pinned down or put into a box. Does waking up take effort or is it  
              effortless? Is there a choice or is it choiceless? Is the world real or 
               unreal? Does what happens matter or not matter? Will I still be here  
              after death or not? Such questions defy answers because they are all  
              rooted in trying to describe the indescribable, and/or they are rooted  
              in conceptual fallacies, like flat-earth questions (What will happen to 
               me if I fall off the edge of the earth? You and the edge are both  
              imaginary; the question is based on a misconception).<br> <br> As soon as we have words like "Oneness" or "Emptiness" or  
              "Awareness," the word instantly creates the mirage-sense of an object.  
              But that object isn't real, it is conceptual, and it isn't what these  
              words are pointing to. Boundlessness is inconceivable, and yet it is  
              visible everywhere, as everything.<br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>Boundlessness, 
              Oneness, or Non-duality does not mean that a  bunch of separate pieces 
              are now joined together. It doesn't mean that  everything is made of one
               primal substance. It means that everything is  equally insubstantial, 
              that there are no separate "things" to be joined,  that there is no 
              substance to get hold of anywhere. And yet, that  doesn't mean there is 
              nothing. Emptiness does not mean voidness or  formless nothingness. 
              There is an old Zen story where a Master asks a  student to grab 
              emptiness. The student makes a gesture of grabbing a  handful of empty 
              space. The Master says, "That's nice, but there's an  even better way to
               grab emptiness." He takes hold of the student's nose  and twists it. 
              Everything is emptiness! The sensations of nose twisting  are emptiness.
               Your nose is emptiness. And emptiness is nothing other  than your nose.
               Emptiness means everything (including your nose) is  empty of solidity 
              and permanence and separation. Form and emptiness  cannot be teased 
              apart except in thought. Truth is not something  mysterious you need to 
              search for. It is just <em>this</em> -- the  computer screen, the shapes
               of these words, the roar of traffic, the  gurgling stomach, the barking
               dog, your nose -- just this. No-thing at  all!<br> <br> Ultimately, the universe is a fleeting dream, a bubble in a  stream. 
              Wipe your forehead and you've killed and maimed billions of  
              micro-organisms. Horrible events and misfortunes are often the source of
                tremendous wisdom, insight, compassion, and awakening. Light and dark 
               are two sides of the same coin, and there are no one-sided coins. 
              Seeing  this, there is more acceptance of life as it is. Enlightenment 
              is not  about "you" getting to the sunny side of the street and staying 
              there  permanently. Enlightenment includes the whole picture. 
              Groundlessness <em>is</em> everything, and <em>everything</em> is 
              groundlessness. Enlightenment  doesn't mean dissociation or lack of 
              caring, for it is the realization  that everything is myself. The 
              dividing lines are all imaginary.  Enlightenment is unconditional love. 
              Each drop of dew, each snowflake,  each piece of trash in the gutter, 
              each human being is unique and  precious, and it's all one seamless 
              being, marvelously diverse but  utterly without separation. When we 
              really <em>see</em> that, naturally,  there is compassion for all beings
               including ourselves. Sometimes the  greatest compassion does not look 
              like what we usually think of as  compassion.<br> <br> <em>Whatever</em> appears -- whether it is confusion,  resistance, pain, pleasure, 
              efforting, bliss, boredom, me-stories, clear  skies or thunderstorms -- <em>all</em> of it is allowed to be Here,  even judgments and preferences! It all <em>is</em> Here! There is space  Here for <em>everything.</em><br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>If 
              you're beginning to think that "awareness" is actually <em>something</em> (a Blank Screen, an Empty Container, or a Mirror), notice that these  
              are all mental images, conceptual ideas, subtle imaginary objects.  
              "Awareness" is a word that points to what remains when <em>everything</em> perceivable and conceivable falls away. Are you trying to see what 
              that  is? Can you see the joke in trying to do that?<br> <br> Don't think that everything perceivable and conceivable has  to 
              disappear. But how solid is anything perceivable or conceivable (any  
              image, any idea, any memory, any sensation, any thought, any emotion,  
              any event, any object, any experience)? Where is your childhood or  
              yesterday or a minute ago or the last second? On close inspection,  
              everything is insubstantial, ungraspable, vanishing. The mind keeps  
              trying to get a grip. It wants answers, certainty, a place to stand.  
              What is this Whole Thing? The mind wants to understand. Thought imagines
                that "you" can step back and take a look at yourself, at Totality. But
                no matter how hard it tries, the eye cannot see itself. You already <em>are</em> what you are seeking. You always have been. There is no possibility of
                separation. You can't <em>not</em> be what you are.<br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>Experiences
               come and go. This is not about having a  special experience, a big 
              event, a final breakthrough, or a psychedelic  vision of some kind. It 
              is not about regaining any previous experience  or achieving something 
              you've read about or imagined. All of that is in  the world of 
              dream-like appearances.<br> <br> Simply notice that <em>everything</em> (mental movies,  dreams, perceptions, thoughts, waking life, mirages, 
              the I-illusion,  apparent duality, time and space, chairs, tables, 
              expansion,  contraction, meditation retreats, traffic jams, <em>everything</em>)
               is  without substance or continuity, and it all appears and disappears 
              right  here. Here is always here. It's always Now. Even memories of the 
              past,  fantasies about the future, and thoughts of elsewhere can only 
              appear  Here and Now. Awareness is always here, whether it appears clear
               or  "clouded" by thoughts. In deep sleep, the entire universe 
              disappears.  All words and ideas disappear. Even the <em>sense</em> of 
              awareness or  presence disappears. The whole quest for understanding and
               awakening  disappears. You (as anything perceivable or conceivable) 
              disappear.  There is no "you" left to notice that "you" have 
              disappeared! Nothing  perceivable or conceivable remains. Out of this 
              vast emptiness, dreams  arise, and then the movie of waking life. Wave 
              after wave crashes on the  shore, and the ocean remains, waving. 
              People-ing is something that  Being is doing, in the same way that the 
              ocean is waving. There are no  waves apart from the ocean, and no people
               apart from being. What is born  and what dies? Boundlessness cannot be 
              captured by the mind. <em>Something</em> is happening here, but it 
              can't be grasped by thought. And it doesn't <em>need</em> to be grasped
               or explained! You can't <em>find</em> the Totality  because you <em>are</em> the Totality. There is nothing <em>other</em> than the Totality. You 
              contain the whole universe and the whole universe  is showing up as you.<br> <br> <em>Awakening is never about achieving something 
              that isn't  right here, right now.</em><br> <br> Ordinary present awareness. The shape of these words, the hum  of the 
              computer, the sound of the traffic, the listening presence, the  
              sensations that appear and disappear. Only thought divides it up and  
              tries to figure it all out. And that very movement of thought is itself 
               only energy and vibration, another appearance, mental weather. No-thing
                at all.<br></p>
              <p><strong>***</strong></p>
              <p>So what to do? Effort or no effort, practice or no  
              practice? The question is like a cloud floating across the sky.  
              Practices may appear or disappear, efforts may happen or cease  
              happening. Either way, there is only this one present moment, just as it
                is. So-called meditation (in the truest sense) is not about going  
              anywhere or achieving anything. It has nothing to do with special  
              postures, techniques, results or experiences. It is simply effortless  
              awareness, awake to what is. It is the direct discovery that there is no
                meditator and no possibility of stepping in or out of the 
              boundlessness  of Here and Now. When that is seen, the whole concept of 
              "meditation"  falls away. What remains is not a new belief system, but 
              rather,  eveything, just as it is.<br> <br> So, if 
              you're feeling confused, trying to figure out whether  or not you have 
              free will, or whether or not you exist, or whether or  not you should 
              meditate or do nothing, or whether to believe this  teacher or that 
              teacher, simply wake up right now from these mental  conundrums. Stop. 
              Look. Listen. Hear the traffic, the birds, the wind.  Feel the 
              breathing. Nothing special. Simply the extraordinary miracle of  what 
              actually is.<br> <br> All that (apparently) stands in 
              the way is the story that  this isn't it, that something more or less or
               different is needed. You  can't make that story disappear because that 
              very effort is part of the  story, as is the "you" who longs to be free 
              of the story. The stories  and the illusion of encapsulation can only be
               seen for what they are, as  they arise, here and now. If they are not 
              seen through, then it may <em>appear</em> that "you" are lost or bound 
              or in trouble. But is there <em>really</em> a "you" who is lost? Is the
               screen ever burned by the fire in the  movie?<br> <br> Words and concepts are complicated; reality is utterly  simple. You 
              can't eat the menu or live in the map, and these words are  an 
              invitation to see through all beliefs and ideas, even the very subtle  
              ones from Advaita or Zen or this text. Truth is not in the future, but  
              Now. Not hidden, but obvious and unavoidable. Not in concepts, but in  
              actuality. When all that mental clutter of seeking and trying to figure 
               everything out and trying to get somewhere is seen to be nothing at all
                (and nothing personal), when it is clear that you are beyond all  
              appearances, and that all appearances are nothing but you, the One Mind,
                then there is no one left to awaken. This can be called liberation, 
              but  why call it anything?</p>
