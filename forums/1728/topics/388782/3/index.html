              <p>One simply is present to what is - that presupposes what is one being when one is with another or eg chatting, ..... most of us tend to be <em>physically present</em> only, cos the sense of 'I" / 'self' precludes totality. Being ABSENT to the 'I' or the 'self' - one is present to another or even present to what one does cos one is being present to one's "UN self" or 'no-self" . In other words what one is not is what one is. Thinking that i m clever does not make me clever. However if i m being clever now - that is what i am.</p>
              <p> By  'I' n 'self' - is implied identifications with values, belifes, rituals, family, traditions, definitions of eg love, happiness n ....</p>
              <p>Hence, the 'self' is no longer the 'self' but all these identifications (attachments to ..) that creates one's centre which is a weak foundation and one mistakenly assumes it to be one's self.</p>
              <p>Remove all these - one collapses cos one's identity is lost. One's centre is gone. It was never real - it was an illusion. So many try to preserve this image(s) of what they think or what they were - however, it suffocates, it imprisons and later one tries to escape.</p>
              <p>Pix this - if one is <em>total in being</em> ... or in doing something and after that one is not attached or identified with ... one is free. Inwardly one can be detached from anything. What happens to one is always external - work, family, friends and so on so forth. The reality though is that it is the inner process that makes for one's being joyful, sad, angry. How does one know - simply see whether if one is responding to what is at hand or one is reacting. Reacting is always from the past. Response is a here-now existential thing.   </p>
              <p>Also, many try to do first and then be ... eg happy, be joyful or .... hence the constant anxiety , the constant struggle. Being is primary, always. Doing is secondary.</p>
              <p>Being - by that I mean <strong>what is one being now</strong> - eg being kind, being angry ..... it is an existential experience. there is no past/future in being.</p>
              <p>Eg As i m writing to u now - m i being nasty, sarcastic .... or m i being . that is the essence of totality.</p>
              <p>Living life to the fullest entails choices and choices divide. The <strong>only sin</strong> is that of or the <em>lack of understanding</em> n acceptance to what is within one. The <strong>only virtue</strong> there is that of understanding, accepting and <strong>within one be</strong> ... and do whatsoever comes or needs to be done is totality.</p>
              <p>There are two banks to a river - one is the past(memories) and the other is the future( dreams/expectations). Many straddle or <strong>psychologically</strong> are mired in either one of the  banks. They watch life and confuse and mistake or even assume that to be living or as presence/totality. If, on the other hand, one flows with the river and allow  - one lives and is living. When one flows, one is being present (presupposing one is absent to the I/self) to the presence of ... and one is being total.</p>

                  happens to one is always external - work, family, friends and so on
                  so forth. The reality though is that it is the inner
                  process that makes for one's being joyful, sad, angry. How
                  does one know - simply see whether if one is responding to
                  what is at hand or one is reacting. Reacting is always from the
                  past. Response is a here-now existential
                  thing.   </p>
              <p>Also, many try to do first and then be ... eg happy, be joyful
                  or .... hence the constant anxiety , the constant struggle. Being
                  is primary, always. Doing is secondary.</p>
              <p>Being - by that I mean <strong>what is one being now</strong> -
                  eg being kind, being angry ..... it is an existential experience.
                  there is no past/future in being.</p>
              <p>Eg As i m writing to u now - m i being nasty, sarcastic .... or
                  m i being . that is the essence of totality.</p>
              <p>Living life to the fullest entails choices and choices divide.
                  The <strong>only sin</strong> is that of or the <em>lack of
                  understanding</em> n acceptance to what is within one.
                  The <strong>only virtue</strong> there is that of understanding,
                  accepting and <strong>within one be</strong> ... and do whatsoever
                  comes or needs to be done is totality.</p>
              <p>There are two banks to a river - one is the past(memories) and
                  the other is the future( dreams/expectations). Many straddle or
                  <strong>psychologically</strong> are mired in either one of
                  the  banks. They watch life and confuse and mistake or
                  even assume that to be living or
                  as presence/totality. If, on the other hand, one
                  flows with the river and allow  - one lives and is living.
                  When one flows, one is being present (presupposing one is absent to
                  the I/self) to the presence of ... and one is being total.</p>

              <p>The problem is from the moment we are born, we learn who" I" am in relation to , in reference to, later who or what is in relation or in reference to me or "I'.</p>
              <p>The modern human has the longer growing up period as compared to animals, even if compared to primitive cultures. Takes a longer time of unlearning.</p>
              <p>There are a few phases of a human, as a toddler, who relates with everything he sees or hear with his mouth. As a young kid, always asking a continuous why, testing the limits of authority by pushing it. The teenager, the transition of the kid to adult, awareness of one's own sexuality, looking at the opposite sex in different light, one's own impulses, awkwardness of fast growing body,social relationships and authority, finally as adult, with  husband/wife, in laws, children.</p>
              <p>Living in totality begins with awareness of,  a shifting of perspective, so to speak. Until that happens, we will still go through motion of living.   </p>

              <p>In Tibetan Buddhism, if you see your teacher as a person, you will benefit from him as a person. If you see your Guru as a Bodhisattva, or Buddha, you will gain the benefits from a Bodhisattva or Buddha!</p>
              <p>The term Living Buddha refers to reincarnated Tulkus, a honorific title given by chinese devotees in veneration.</p>
              <p>Just like everybody(well almost!) calling a tibetan monk a Lama, which actually means teacher or guru! </p>
              <p>When you put faith in your Lama, his is the embodiment of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha!</p>
