              If you are Buddhist, you may want to try the 32 parts of body meditation or meditation on the repulsiveness of the form.(assubha). Kindly be advised that these types of meditation must be done under supervision from a qualified teachers.

              <p>2) In this sutraæ™®é—¨å“�, it says by reciting the name of å�—æ— è§‚ä¸–éŸ³è�©è�¨ will also help.</p>

              <p>What is holy is not sex itself. It is that in having an orgasm, there is suddenly a gap between two dualistic state of seeking, or between two thoughts, where Consciousness experiences Itself as Itself. This is what is spiritual. This is in contrast to the usual dualistic state of seeking where there is a projection of 'me' separate from a perceived desirable/undesirable object, and then the 'me' must chase after or get rid of the 'object'. However if we recognise non-dual consciousness, there is just Self-Aware Consciousness which is itself bliss and peace. And it is bliss and peace surpassing all you have ever experienced or will ever understand in our ordinary dualistic mind. And actually this is possible at any moment and is not just in sex.</p>
              <p>True bliss cannot be found in any particular experience, but in the gap that certain experiences temporarily opens up to the possibility for Consciousness to experience its true face. Thus we should never chase after experiences, since it is not the experience that is the source of bliss, but the gap and possibility the experience opens up to for Consciousness to experience Itself. But we should also not come to depend on having certain experiences, like mountain climbing, jumping from a plane, engaging in other dangerous or intense acts, or having orgasm, etc, to enter into the state of Presence and bliss. It is not required, though such acts may open a door to that experience. For most people however, after that experience they go back into unconscious seeking, and fails to understand that the peace and happiness is actually not found 'outside' but is inherent in one's own Consciousness. They fail to understand that they have never been separated from that bliss and peace which is the qualities of primordial intrinsic Awareness, that it is always by nature already non-dual.</p>

              <p><em>Most activities are governed by the desire for Happiness. Happiness is a non-objective experience. It is simply the presence of Consciousness.</em></p>
              <p><em>As Consciousness is by nature conscious, it could be said that Happiness is the experience of Consciousness knowing itself knowingly.</em></p>
              <p><em>It is the experience that is revealed every time a desire comes to an end. Desire is agitation and Happiness is the ever-present background of all states that is revealed when this agitation ceases.</em></p>
              <p><em>Of course, it is also present during the agitation itself as it is the background of all states, but it is not experienced as such.</em></p>
              <p><em>This desire for Happiness does not come from memory. Happiness cannot be remembered for it has no objective qualities. It is inherent in Consciousness, which in its unmanifest condition is objectless, such as in the experience of deep sleep.</em></p>
              <p><em>Consciousness cannot be experienced as an object and therefore cannot be remembered. However, it is always present and therefore whatever is inherent in it must also be ever-present.</em></p>
              <p><em>The current object is continually changing but the desire for Happiness always remains the same. Therefore, Happiness cannot be caused by the object that is present.</em></p>
              <p><em>Likewise the experience of Happiness is always the same irrespective of the object that seems to deliver, so the object itself cannot be the aim of the search for Happiness.</em></p>
              <p><em>Once it is understood that Happiness cannot be a memory, it has to be concluded that the desire for Happiness comes from the current experience itself, even if the experience is unpleasant. Where else could it come from?</em></p>
              <p><em>However, it is not from the objective aspect of the current experience that Happiness is sought. It is from the knowing or experiencing aspect.</em></p>
              <p><em>The fact that Happiness is sought in such a wide variety of objects and activities indicates the intuition that Happiness resides in the knowing and experiencing aspects of an experience or an object, in the Consciousness aspect, not in the objective aspect, because the knowing or experiencing aspect of all experiences is always the same.</em></p>
              <p><em>However, the knowing and experiencing aspect of experience is veiled by the name and the form of the experience, and therefore we keep looking for Happiness in new and different objects.</em></p>
              <p><em>in fact our engagement with objects is, in most cases, precisely for the purpose of unveiling the Peace and Happiness that is inherent in every experience. However, we wrongly assign Peace and Happiness to the objective aspect of the experience.</em></p>
              <p><em>Our exclusive focus on the objective aspect of the experience veils this Happiness. However, failing to notice that Happiness is in fact already present, we search elsewhere for it. We search for it in a new situation, in a new object.</em></p>
              <p><em>In fact even the desire for Happiness comes from Happiness itself.</em></p>
              <p><em>Desire is the form of Happiness. It is the shape that Happiness itself takes when it overlooks its own presence and begins to search for itself elsewhere.</em></p>
              <p><em>It is Happiness itself that seeks itself.</em></p>
              <p><em>We are already what we seek.</em></p>
              <p><em>What governs the type of object in which we search for Happiness will depend on the objects that, in the past, immediately preceded the non-objective experience of Happiness.</em></p>
              <p><em>Unlike Happiness itself, these objects can be remembered and so we try to reproduce them in the hopes that they will deliver the same Happiness.</em></p>
              <p><em>Once this is clearly seen, the nature of desire changes radically. An object is no longer desired in order to produce Happiness but rather to express it.</em></p>
              <p><em> Once desire is liberated from the requirement to produce Happiness, it does not disappear. It is simply liberated from the confines of serving a non-existent entity.</em></p>
              <p><em>Desire as such is experienced as energy, as life. It is already its own fulfillment.</em></p>
