              <p>Dear Franceso Totti,</p>
              <p>This is a hard one. It is too easy to slide into the hole and too difficult to get out.</p>
              <p>Firstly,
              you got to have lots of determination and patience with yourself and
              never give up no matter how many times you give in to your desires.
              Unlike other kinds of wants, this is a really tough one. I do not know
              how deep you are into it, but regardless, never give up.</p>
              <p>Next, it
              takes a whole lot of restraining. Restraining your eyes is the first
              step. If you know that some sights or some pictures are going to
              stimulate you, then force yourself not to look at it. Restrain
              yourself. However, take everything gradually. If you feel that the more
              you restrain yourself, the worse your urge becomes, then release some
              restraint. You got to adjust yourself. Always make the training tough
              but not so tough until it breaks and it back-fires on you.</p>
              <p>Next,
              find a temple or teacher and practice concentration meditation.
              Establish yourself FIRMLY in it. I mean really firmly that you really
              like to be meditating and it becomes almost a second nature to you.
              This takes a whole lot of time. So have patience. A deep addiction in
              sex and lust can easily take several years to cure and many many
              relapses. I mean really many! But you just have to keep on trying. So
              during this whole time, cultivate your concentration meditation skill.
              The best is that you can get into Jhana. A monk, Ajahn Brahm mentioned
              that the bliss in Jhana is better than sex. Anyhow, if you have
              established your mind enough in concentration, then whenever such
              thoughts arise, you are able to disengage yourself from such thoughts
              and hold it at arms length without getting affected. Actually if you
              notice, these sexual thoughts come only when your mind is relatively
              free. When you have a lot of work to do and you throw yourself into
              your work, you realise that it does not appear. Sometimes, when they
              appear, and someone calls you to do something impt and that issue takes
              your mind away, you realise the sexual thoughts are immediately gone
              and replaced by those other thoughts. So these urges can disappear. It
              is just the mind. These sexual thoughts really do not have power over
              your mind. They are also guests. so they can leave. Realising this, you
              know that sometimes when you feel totally gripped by these thoughts and
              you have no choice, it is just like they have a veil over you. But
              surely you can make them leave if you master your mind and or if you
              have the right thought replacing techniques.</p>
              <p>The third thing you can do is that you can make a promise to
              someone you really respect and love that you will restrain yourself.
              And you try really hard not to break the promise. This helps. So
              whenever you think of these thoughts, then you will also think of your
              promise and it gives you strength when your mind is weak.</p>
              <p>Basically,
              these kind of things happen when one's mind is weak and one is lacking
              in determination. So training of the mind is essential. Thus while
              training do not be too concerned with failures. Once your mind is well
              trained enough, plus using the third technique, you should be able to
              do it.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I would like to say that the training of the
              mind takes time, so sometimes it may be unrealistic to expect results
              in like months or maybe a year. A few years is more like it. And never
              give up in the face of failures. One's mind is not constant. Sometimes
              it's strong, sometimes weak. And when these thoughts meet you when you
              are strong, no problem, you can overcome them and not get affected by
              them. And you are happy when you have overcome them. However, sometimes
              when your mind is weak and these thoughts arise, you just succumb to
              them so easily and you become sad. Don't worry about the failures, just
              keep trying. You will make it one day. It is a gradual process.</p>
              <p>Hmmm....when
              these thoughts come, it is like a battle ground, you become very
              'high', your whole body changes (i think you understand), but just try
              to live through it with great determination and steadfastness.</p>
              <p>Hopefully this helps and may the Buddha and all the devas bless you in your endeavour!</p>

              <p>Only people who are too free will have time to have lust and sexual thoughts. It will be good if Francesco looks for a stressful job that requires him to work late. He will be mentally and physically stress out. By then, he will have no energy and no mood to do and think of other things. The first thing he looks forward to is to sleep when he reaches home.</p>

              <p>Yea, only Anagami-Magga (path moment of the Anagami) can eradicate illwill and sensual desire (including sex). Jhanas only suppress the sensual desire, not eradicate it.</p>
              <p>Has the topic starter any inclination to learn meditation? perhaps he could be instructed in the 32 parts/  foulness of the form meditation by a competent teacher.</p>

              <p>Oh yes, the methods I mentioned are 2nd grade methods. They are comprised mainly of thought substitution methods and methods that help reduce your latent tendencies in these area. The best method is of course the meditation on the foulness of body meditation if you can find a teacher who teaches that. If you do not know any teacher, I would recommend learning from the Pa Auk Meditation Centre at 15 Teo Kim Eng Road.</p>

              <p>Drugs cannot affect such persons because what the person experience is an insight is the empty and self-liberating nature of all phenomena. There is absolutely no more clinging as a result</p>
              <p>I also posted before (sidenote: interestingly at that time which is Nov 06 I did not have much powerful glimpses of nondual yet, so my knowledge was pretty intellectual, but even right now I merely have occasional glimpses so cannot speak about this topic of overcoming pain authoratatively):<em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>Pain is different from suffering... but when the mind grasps on
                                                  it... suffering comes. Pain can only be get rid off by physical
                                                  means - healing, medicine, or anaesthetic, etc. Suffering due to
                                                  pain should be liberated through dharma practise.<br></em></p>

                                                  the pure sensation of the pain and no one 'feeling' the pain, just
                                                  the pure sensation as it is.. it is impermanent, ever changing, it
                                                  is not self, there is no self experiencing pain.. in short even
                                                  this pain is empty in nature.. but the sensation of pain is
                                                  present, just that no one is suffering the pain... the pain itself
                                                  'pains'. Of course I am far from such... so am only deducing from
                                                  knowledge and might be wrong.<br><br> My taiwanese teacher went for operation last time... doctors gave
                                                  him two dose of anaesthetic. Usually one dose is enough to make a
                                                  person completely unconscious... first dose doesnt work, he is
                                                  still completely awake. Second dose still the same... the nurse ask
                                                  whether should give another dose, the doctor say... nope, like that
                                                  will kill him. Then my teacher said... go ahead with the
                                                  procedures, no amount of anaesthetic can numb my senses/make me

                                                  shouting at all, just calming watching it... The doctors are

              <p>...In 1981, the Karmapa began to manifest signs of cancer, and
                                                  his life was known to be near its end. His Holiness went through
                                                  various recurrences and remissions. He was soon brought to the
                                                  Clinic Hospital in Zion, Illinois.<br> <br> His Holiness began contracting various harmful illnesses, all taken
                                                  upon by himself to rid the suffering of others, and he allowed the
                                                  doctors to experiment on him. <strong>They found that no matter how
                                                  much sedatives were given to the Karmapa, these medicines had
                                                  completely no affect on his mental clarity.</strong> One day an
                                                  illness was cured, and the next a new one would be found. The
                                                  doctors were baffled at how the machines would somehow be turned on
                                                  and off automatically.<br> <br> Through all this, they were amazed at the serene atmosphere the
                                                  16th Gyalwa Karmapa created.<br> <br> In the evening on November 5th, 1981, His Holiness passed away. For
                                                  three days, the heart region of the KarmapaÂ’s body remained warm to
                                                  the amazement of the medical staff, and as the medical physician
                                                  put it, Â“I have no medical explanation for this.Â” His body was left
                                                  in the room for these days and remained in meditation position. The
                                                  Karmapa's disciples, such as Tai Situ Rinpoche, attended his body
                                                  after his death. Then, on November 9th, his remains were flown back
                                                  to Sikkim....</p>

              <p>You're right. Jhana cannot end fetters. It is only that one is temporarily absorbed in jhanic bliss, but when one returns to ordinary life, the habits will return, because there is no insight into the true nature of our worldly experience.</p>
              <p>As Thusness said before, you have to reach deep stages of insight and experience the 2nd door of impermanence to a deep degree to dissolve sexual desire.</p>
              <p>Only when one experiences everything as dissolving on the moment it appears, then desire cannot form. Whatever thoughts, sensations, just liberates as it arises.</p>
              <p>When insight is deep, fetters cannot even take hold and have no basis. The deep insight can end the fetters. There is only pure sensations and thoughts, arising and liberating as it arise, it's nature and three characteristics are clearly perceived as it is and there is no delusion.</p>

                  principles are no longer practiced in present-day Buddhism. As Buddhists, we constantly allow our minds to be agi- 
                  tated and confused, engulfed in mental defilements that assail us from every direction. They so overpower our 
                  minds that we never rise above these contaminating influences, no matter how hard we try. The vast majority of 
                  people are not even interested enough to try: They simply close their eyes and allow the onslaught to overwhelm 
                  them. They don’t even attempt to put up the least amount of resistance. Since they lack the mindfulness needed to 
                  pay attention to the consequences of their thoughts, all their thinking and all they do and say are instances of the 
                  kilesas giving them a beating. They surrendered to the power of these ruinous forces such a long time ago that 
                  they now lack any motivation to restrain their wayward thoughts..."</td>

              <p>I think the major problem is we have been influenced  ,</p>
              <p>My advise ,</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Body is just a shell , feeling is just a moment . If you are determined to overcome this thought , no matter what religion you are , we have have to starts with our mind to be "Determine" ,</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Think of one simple examples ,  have you ever think that 3 days i am not going to eat and you can do that , where u see everybody is enjoying the food?? It is always possible if you are determine.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Mankind is being influence the moment we are born , we start to choose when we are baby , this is influence. So we have to find a way to be determined ourself first.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Whatever your religion is , there is always an answer , do some read up and abide to it.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Well, Tiger Wood , is just too rich to spent to get whatever he want , he lost his determination thats why he start to fail in his golf before everybody know he is addicted. So he has an influence to cause him to be in this way. By right , he has a very calm personality , thats why he plays his golf well , now he cant anymore , his error has cause him and media has influenced him even deeper , his time is up. He has a Thai mother , he should go back to his beginning to get back. This Karma. He should get back to his family for his karma.</p>

              <p>I have already started, to investigate. I am just responding to you saying not bothering to think! Possible that i read it out of context, but,with all things interconnected, we will probably ultimately come to the same conclusion.</p>
