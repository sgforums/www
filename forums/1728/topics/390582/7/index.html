              <p>Found some quotations by Indian teacher Sri Nisargadatta
                                                      Maharaj, and wrote some comments in red:</p>
              <p><em>"Now the consciousness, when it gets involved with the
                                                      body-mind, is the individual. It is conditioned by body and mind.
                                                      Mind is concepts. Whatever it receives through the five senses, and
                                                      is stored, that is the mind. And whatever the words that flow out,
                                                      that is also mind. So when that consciousness is conditioned by the
                                                      body and the mind, it is individualistic, a personality."</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Comments: this is the normal state
                                                      of ordinary sentient beings, identified totally with their stories,
                                                      mind, body, "I am this and that".</span></p>
              <p><em>"And I always tell people, you depersonify yourself by not
                                                      identifying with the body-mind. When you do that, you are that
                                                      manifest principle; you are no more a personality, you are only
                                                      consciousness. When you are in that consciousness state, you are in
                                                      a position to observe the mind flow, any thoughts occurring to you
                                                      - you are apart from thought. You don't identify with that thought.
                                                      Since you observe the body and its actions, you are not one with
                                                      those; you are apart from that body. Thus, you are now in
                                                      consciousness; this is the first stage. So when you are only
                                                      consciousness, you are all manifest; this is to be realized. Then,
                                                      provided you are, everything is, your world is, and your god is.
                                                      You are the primary cause, the prerequisite for anything else to
                                                      exist, whether it be your god or your world. You abide only in
                                                      consciousness. In your attention, only consciousness should be
                                                      there. That is the meditation."</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Comments: this is one of the four
                                                      aspects of I AM: the impersonality aspect (see first page for more
                                                      info on the four aspects). It is seen here that everything is the
                                                      manifestation of the Universal Source, the Consciousness, and no

                                                      Impersonal Consciousness alone is that which manifests and animates
                                                      all lives. A personal self as such is non-operational and
                                                      non-existent.<br></span></p>
              <p><em>"Now the next step is - the question raised in the morning -
                                                      are you in a position to observe consciousness? This is also the
                                                      final step. When you are in a position to observe or witness

                                                      actions - then by virtue of that very observation, you are apart
                                                      from the consciousness.</em></p>
              <p><em>So when you are in a position to observe consciousness, you
                                                      are out of consciousness. Then you are what we call 'the awareness
                                                      state,' the vijnana or jnana state. Is it firmly stabilized in you,
                                                      or are you still wavering, vacillating?</em><em>"</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Comments: this is the Realization
                                                      of I AM. The realization of the True Essence of Being that
                                                      transcends and is prior to all manifest. It is that Existence, that
                                                      Self-Existing, Self-Shining Awareness, that stands prior to and
                                                      witnesses manifest-consciousness. IT does not come and go, it is
                                                      Pure Existence-Awareness that is Still, Unmoving, Abiding - the
                                                      non-objective Principle of Awareness alone that witnesses the
                                                      coming and going of consciousness, as well as dream, and deep
                                                      sleep.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">For my case, impersonality is
                                                      experienced only after the Realization of I AM - but why is
                                                      Nisargadatta talking about impersonality first? I asked Thusness
                                                      this question and he said the order does not matter. And yes, it
                                                      makes sense - I remember in the past I had episodes of experiencing
                                                      the 'Intensity of Luminosity' (one of the four aspects of I AM)
                                                      even before Realization of I AM. Also, Thusness mentioned how
                                                      Christians can experience the Impersonality aspect and have the
                                                      experience of 'being lived' through prayer and submission to God
                                                      alone (without going through the I AM realization). So there is no
                                                      particular order, they are all important insights and complements
                                                      each other. There is no 'higher' or 'lower' realizations, they are
                                                      all necessary.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The reason why Nisargadatta spoke
                                                      of Impersonality as 'first step' is probably because that is how it
                                                      unfolded for him, just as I would speak of the realization of I AM
                                                      as 'first step' because this is how it unfolded for me. It does not
                                                      have to apply for everyone. The important thing isn't about how it 'unfolds', since these are just some timeless facts that can be discovered/verified at any 'time' (actually, only discovered in timeless Now) with no particular necessary order. Stories of 'unfolding' are simply relative truths.<br></span></p>

              <p>Nowadays, in daily living, I try to experience the intensity of luminosity. In some ways it is pretty much like mindfulness practice.</p>
              <p>It may sound like I am doing a very dualistic practice... as if 
                                                      awareness is not here, and I am trying to 'reach' a state of awareness.</p>
              <p>This is not what I mean.</p>
              <p>Awareness is already shining in full view Right Here, Right Now, couldn't be anywhere else... It is what you already are, so stop looking elsewhere. It is just about relaxing the focus on the mind and letting Luminosity/Presence-Awareness reveal itself in its fullness and richness.</p>
              <p>Just that our focus (by habit) goes so often into mental stories 
                                                      and mental noise that we totally miss out the aliveness and wonder of
                                                       life itself. We have overlooked the power and intensity of Presence to 
                                                      put it in Eckhart Tolle's terms...</p>
              <p>You cannot experience intensity of Presence by trying to seek a 
                                                      'better' state... it is not about having a 'better' state... it is about
                                                       experiencing Presence-Awareness in its fullness in the Here-Now (as it 
                                                      cannot be anywhere else)... be careful not to fall into subtle traps of 
                                                      thinking there is a better experience in the future.</p>
              <p>Simply be brightly aware of what is... Whatever Is, Is! You just 
                                                      have to be brightly aware of it. Even if you are feeling sleepy, being 
                                                      brightly aware of that sensation of sleepiness will bring you back into 
                                                      the intensity of Presence... Whatever you are experiencing at that 
                                                      moment, whether it is apparent clarity or non-clarity, you can always be
                                                       brightly aware of What Is and bring the intensity of Presence into 
                                                      focus. In sports term, it is 'being in the zone' - except that you don't have to be doing something dangerous to be 'in the zone', it can simply (and only) be Right Here, Right Now!</p>
              <p>Life becomes miraculous, wonderful, 'paradisiacal' (yes this is 
                                                      how it feels like - like walking in a magical wonderland even in your

              <p><strong>Five kinds of bodhi</strong><br><br>        The ancients say, “One may cultivate for billions of kalpas, but enlightenment takes only an instant.” Knowing this, we still need to make efforts everyday to bring forth the bodhi mind. To fully realize the bodhi mind there are five stages: “give rise to the bodhi mind,” “taming the mind,” “awaken to the bodhi mind,” “progressive realization of the bodhi mind,” and “ultimate bodhi mind.”        <br><br>        The first stage is “give rise to the bodhi mind.” This means we make a great resolve to cultivate the Way, vow to realize the bodhi mind, attain buddhahood, and liberate all sentient beings. We constantly work in this direction, to do no evil, to perform all good, and to purify our mind. Whether practicing gradual cultivation or sudden enlightenment, in motion or in stillness, busy or idle, our every thought must be clear and in command. We should adhere to Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha’s great vows, Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara’s great compassion, Bodhisattva Samantabhadra’s great conduct, Bodhisattva Manjushri’s great wisdom, and incorporate these into our daily lives. This is the beginning of the bodhisattva way.     <br>       The second stage is “taming the mind” – this means we resolve to study hard, constantly examine and reflect inwardly, harbor a mind of repentance, and work to gradually gain a control of our delusive thoughts and afflictions. For example, if we reflect and find that we have been angry, we can immediately subdue it and not create bad karma. If greed arises, we can also detect it and subdue it. Or, as soon as sensual desires and lust arise, we immediately subdue them. This is “taming the mind.”<br><br>        The third stage is “awaken to the bodhi mind.” Due to the power resulting from practicing “taming the mind,” we can finally attain awakening. “Awakening” is to awaken the deluded mind and see its true nature. When we see our original self, we will realize that our mind is inherent, unborn, and undying.<br><br>        A Chan patriarch said, “The darkness of a thousand years is shattered instantly by a single lamp.” If we awaken to this present mind, always abide in right mindfulness, all our past karmic obstacles can be totally swept away. For example, after a thousand years in a dark room, if we suddenly turn on the light, the room is instantly filled with brightness. But if we lose our right mindfulness, it is like turning the light off; then everything will again be filled with darkness. Therefore, once we are enlightened, we still must constantly maintain right mindfulness in our daily lives, abide in pure awareness, be totally clear in every thought, and always be master of ourselves.        <br>        The ancient sages say, “When hungry, eat; when drowsy, sleep.” Also, “Eating all day, one has not chewed a single grain of rice; fully dressed, one has not put on a single thread.” What does this mean? It means to know yet not cling, and to firmly abide in right mindfulness. For example, when eating, do not daydream. The “knowing” that can differentiate among the sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy always exists. Neither overeat when the food is tasty, nor complain when it is unsavory. Whether facing pleasant or unpleasant circumstances, we know yet do not cling, and do not give rise to greed or anger. This is to truly abide in right mindfulness.<br>       <br>        The aim of cultivation is to attain right mindfulness. Right mindfulness is a mind of clarity and purity; it is liberation; it is the buddha. Right mindfulness is the place of enlightenment; it is also the Pure Land. Therefore, “Hauling wood and carrying rice is the Way.” In our daily lives, in our eating, dressing, working, and moving, always maintain right mindfulness. Maintain the existence of this “knowing” mind. Thus maintaining inner peace and rightful conduct in life is to cultivate the Way.<br><br>       The fourth stage is “progressive realization of the bodhi mind.” After we know where our mind is, we must continue to practice after enlightenment, continue to abide firmly in right mindfulness, and maintain our pure awareness, so that ignorance is totally eradicated and the Dharma body fully manifests. This process is the progressive realization of the ultimate bodhi mind.<br><br>        After we have eradicated the last traces of ignorance, afflictions, and delusions, we arrive at “ultimate bodhi mind.” This is the perfection of our awareness and conduct, the perfection of benefiting others and ourselves. This is the ultimate stage.</p>

              <p>It doesn't take even a moment of practice to Dive into your Self.</p>
              <p>Because you never left and can never be other than Who You Are.</p>
              <p>Without moving a step forward (or backward), You Are - Self-Shining, Self-Certain/Doubtless, Still, Unmoved, Abiding Existence-Awareness.</p>
              <p>All frustrations exist because you are moving forward and backward to find your Self. Stop, pause, You Are, full-stop.</p>
              <p>What's next, you say? Notice that the 'what's next' is simply a thought desiring to move forward or backward again in search of something (which presumes separation between 'you' and 'Source'), but leading nowhere - because even as you are apparently moving forward and backward towards your illusory goal, your True Self remains ever unmoved but by being lost in your seeking you are overlooking that simplicity. See the erroneous-ness of conceptual thoughts which presumes separation and goal instead of the completeness and perfection of your Self which is your direct experience.</p>
              <p>There is no next except to Abide as You Are. It is an effortless abiding, because you cannot <em>not</em> be Who You Are - just stop believing in false thoughts and simply rest in the non-conceptual and non-dual authentication of your innate nature, pure being-consciousness.</p>

              <p>A friend asked me: If Awareness is the true nature, then how come effort/willpower is necessary to realize it?</p>
              <p>My answer: This is because we are always lost and chasing after thoughts and outer things that we have become totally ignorant of our true identity. We confuse ourselves with those stories, mind, body, objects and experiences.</p>
              <p>For example, when we turn off the lights, one might claim "I no longer see!" But that statement is made because one has misidentified oneself with the object of sight, in which case darkness implies 'no seeing' and light implies 'seeing'.</p>
              <p>But in actual fact, your true identity as the all-perceiving Awareness is still present, only that you have misidentified yourself with objects (e.g. light or dark), that one experience implies the presence of seeing and the other implies the absence of seeing. In actual fact, 'seeing'/'awareness' is equally present to perceive the darkness! You have utterly confused the ever-present luminosity which is your true essence, with the comings and goings of objects, light or darkness. In actual fact, luminosity is never lost, never comes, never goes. But sentient beings are utterly confused and have become totally fixated on objects and experiences, falling into a dream of being a separate self, and thus lost sight of their essence.</p>
              <p>That is why effort is required, to turn the light around and investigate the Source of everything... the source of radiance... the source of all seeing, all hearing, etc.</p>
              <p>Who am I? What hears? Then... eventually you realize your true identity and realize that Awareness never ceases even after sounds and sights and thoughts have gone... the position of your true identity as Pure Awareness is then 'restored' (or rather, 'realized'), and you no longer confuse or misidentify yourself in the face of experiences. You realize you are indestructible, untouched by light or darkness, fire or ice, knife or water... yet the basis of all such illusory experiences.</p>
              <p>'Willpower' is important, it is more of an 'intense desire to know the truth of who I really am'. And this is absolutely important in Self Inquiry and determines the success of your practice... why? Because if you do not give rise to this doubt and intense desire to find out who you truly are, then you are simply verbally reciting 'Who am I' like a mantra without true investigation.</p>
              <p>The intense desire to resolve the question of who you truly are is that which allows you to challenge and cut through all notions of who you think you are, cut through all conceptual thoughts, to truly touch the essence of your being... without which your notions are not challenged and your true being is not revealed.</p>

              <p>Yesterday I was dancing and just letting the seen be the seen, the heard be the heard, and suddenly my perspective changed... suddenly all there is is the shapes and sounds and colours... everything  presenting/experiencing by itself... there is only THAT.. there is no self...and its seen that these shapes and sounds and  colours are the only actuality there is... there is nothing else... everywhere i look, there is only that - shapes, sounds,  colours... in the seen only the seen, in the heard only the heard..... no distance... only IS.... even the notion 'there is no seer just scenery' is more mental stories... in actuality there is only THAT... an inescapable reality and that alone is  extremely blissful even though totally ordinary.</p>
              <p>Somehow the experience was not as dramatic as some of my previous nondual experience, but its full of  vividness and a sense of 'inescapableness' like whatever i experience, there it is, complete, nondual as it is. And its like I dont even know who I am anymore... now i  know why when Bodhidharma was asked by the emperor who he was, he simply answered 'I dont know'. Existence is undeniably present  everywhere and yet all mental proclamations of self are an illusion..  A separate self is unfindable. Actuality: sceneries,  sounds, taste, touch, smell, thoughts..... so obvious I wonder why it wasn't noticed from the beginning!</p>
              <p>Even when I woke up the physical/sensate actuality is pretty obvious to me even though not as intense as yesterday. More involvement in contents thoughts today, whereas yesterday all contents of thoughts are just dropped immediately in favour of just pure delighting in the sensuous actualities.</p>
              <p>Thusness said that experience I described was 'not bad' but told me to avoid alcohol (and it is my experience that alcohol doesn't affect my clarity but is detrimental to samadhi) and have proper practice. Incidentally, while I told him about this, he has just written a related article for me which I will post next.</p>
              <p>p.s. somehow my experience yesterday was different from the other times. It's like less dramatic and much more continuous... and in the previous non-dual experiences, I do not know how to 'repeat' them... but this time it's like whatever I experience, there it is - even now.</p>
              <p>Thusness informed me that it is a good sign, however, that sense of self still hovers.  The access is not so much of a problem now... as the 'how' is seen clearly. And that I  might think I have already directly accessed to it... as in here and now the experience, but it will be gone in few months time.</p>

              <div class="author"><span class="fn">Posted by: PasserBy (Thusness)</span></div>
              <div class="author"><br></div>
              <div class="author">
              <p>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>Saw your enlistment date in your facebook, 
              good luck to you!  3 weeks is a short period so start working on your 
              physical fitness before the enlistment. There are certain fitness 
              expectations for basic combat training, for guys they must at least able
               to perform 13 push-ups and 17 sit-ups in a minute and run one mile 
              within 8:30 minutes.  You are, of course, expected to do much better 
              than that.</p>
              <p>It is also appropriate at this juncture to 
              talk about your recent realization of the ‘Eternal Witness’.  I am glad 
              that you are clear on the part about experience and realization through 
              direct experiential insight, it is an invaluable insight.  After this, 
              you are very much on your own and the ‘taste’ of a pure, original, 
              primordial, non-conceptual and non-dual luminous state of existence will
               serve as an internal compass for you. Treasure it!</p>
              <p>After
               the initial realization, there is a strong desire to ‘relive’ the 
              experience -- this pure sense of existence; in fact the mind wishes the 
              experience be made permanent and it is not uncommon that practitioners 
              perceive the permanent, natural and effortless abiding of this state as 
              ‘Nirvana’.  Therefore it is a natural progression for you to seek 
              permanent abiding in the Self as a background at this point in time.  If
               you intensify your meditation and abide in the Self, an oceanic 
              blissful experience may arise as a result of deep absorption but it is 
              still a contrived effort, it is not the ‘key’ towards effortlessness.  
              Nonetheless having a ‘taste’ of deep Samadhi bliss and understanding the
               relationship between deep concentration and this oceanic bliss is still
               crucial.</p>
              <p>Having said that, since none of your recent 
              posts are about the absorptive state but are experiences relating to 
              non-dual in transience, it is appropriate to practice bringing this 
              ‘taste’ of pure luminous brilliance to the foreground.  By ‘foreground’,
               I am referring to all your six entries and exits (eyes, ears, nose, 
              tongue, body and mind) and experience vivid luminous aliveness in 
              colors, forms, shape, sound, scent, taste and thoughts.  It is essential
               for Phase 4 and 5 insights, that is, experiencing directly the 18 
              dhatus and aggregates and realize that the entire idea of 'I and Mine' 
              is learnt. Also, I do not think you have the time to practice deep 
              absorptive meditation in army. You can re-visit this ‘Oceanic Samadhi 
              Bliss’ later when there is thoroughness and fearlessness in forgoing the
               sense of self/Self.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The universe is this arising thought.</p>
              <p>The universe is this arising sound.</p>
              <p>Just this magnificent arising!</p>
              <p>Is Tao.</p>
              <p>Homage to all arising.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Doing this foreground practice, <strong>you are effectively refining your realization from “You as pure Existence” to “Existence is the very stuff of whatever arises”.</strong> The actual stuff - the screen, the keyboard, the clicking sound, the 
              cool air, the taste, the vibration…is the actuality of Universe itself, 
              there is no other.  Nevertheless do take note that these are still 
              experiences, they are not realizations.  You will have to go through 
              what you have gone through in the phase of ‘I AM’ from intermittent 
              experiences to realizations.</p>
              <p>I have read some of the 
              articles written by Richard, they are very well written and will be of 
              great help in this 'foreground' practice.  There are values in the 
              teachings of Actual Freedom but there is no need to over-claim anything.
                In my opinion, saying what that is more than necessary does not make 
              one superior.</p>
              <p>Also do not get overwhelmed by the 
              vivid luminous brilliance that manifests as the background source or 
              foreground phenomena, let go of all; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSLU9PiXgRk&amp;feature=related">much
               like lamas building a sand mandala that is so vivid, colorful and 
              beautiful, is destroyed immediately after it is completed. It is not 
              just about the 'brilliant luminosity', it is also about the 'Gone'</a>; therefore vividly present and instantly gone -- <strong>GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA</strong>.</p>
              <p>Lastly
               be sincere to the deeper dispositions, they reveal more about us more 
              than the ‘surface’ achievements, not to take it likely.  You are a 
              sincere guy so allow your sincerity and your realizations be your inner 
              guides -- they are your only ‘true teachers’, I am not.  :-)</p>

              My opinion and observation is that 
              some people are simply not inclined towards the spiritual. This does not
               mean they do not have a potential to awaken because everyone have 
              Buddha Nature, the potential to awaken. We are all equal in that sense. 
              However... many may not be at that level of 'evolution' (which spans 
              many lifetimes!) to truly be interested in spiritual things.<br>

              <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset;">It seems to me it is like that, because all of my life I have been 
              asking questions about many aspects of life and wondering about stuff, 
              always curios and ready to learn something new from others about life. 
              Some people on the other hand just do not care about things life that, 
              or not some people but most people. That is something I think is so 
              strange... they are just robots at times.</td>

              </div>
              <div>It's like they are so obsessed with
               outward seeking that they have overlooked something fundamental, 
              something that is what they are in their very essence... It's like 
              looking all over the world for riches whereas they forgotten and 
              overlooked the diamond that is right there all along in his/her pocket.<br> <br> This is the case for most people in the world... having lost sight of 
              their pure luminous essence, they looked for peace, happiness, 
              fulfillment, contentment, love, etc... on the 'outside'. They have 
              forgotten that true happiness, peace, etc, is to be found in your very 
              true nature and by overlooking it.. we are finding peace, happiness, 
              love, in temporary things that are ultimately dissatisfactory (what 
              satisfaction can be found in something that comes and goes?) For as the 
              Buddha said, all transient phenomena are characterized by 
              unsatisfactoriness (dukkha)! And the sooner they found this out, the 
              sooner they awaken... (think about many people who had spontaneous 
              awakenings after a period of depression and suffering: Eckhart Tolle, 
              Byron Katie, etc) For some people, like us... who are beginning to 
              awaken even without necessarily going through such awful experiences... 
              it's probably because we don't totally believe in/give in to the notions
               of self and reality and be willing to inquire, question, and find out 
              things for ourselves... unfortunately not many find value or interest in
               them because they have very fixed ideas and notions about what their 
              reality and identity and life is and what they want from life and how to
               get them. They'd rather spend their time finding happiness in other 
              things, than to investigate their notions and experience of reality. But
               we know better... because we have glimpses of the bliss and clarity, 
              i.e. what's possible, if we truly live life awakened.<br> <br> Most of all, they are totally identified with the world of 
              experiences... they have identified themselves to be their own body and 
              mind, and their own concepts and images of who they are over the years 
              'I am a successful businessman', 'I am ...'. Totally identified 
              unconsciously with their conceptual images, thoughts, stories... and 
              they seek to 'find themselves' through the world of experiences, by 
              becoming richer, more famous, more successful, etc, so that they can 
              make a nicer story of themselves to feel good about it. In this way they
               seek to find their identity through stories, through past and future...
               and through this, lose sight of themselves completely. As Eckhart Tolle
               says, <em>"You cannot find yourself by going into the past. You can find yourself by coming into the present." ~Eckhart Tolle</em> - I would also include "You cannot find yourself in the future".<br> <br> So as you can see... whether it is spiritual or non-spiritual persons, 
              we all seek happiness. We all have the same goals... it's just that 
              spiritual seekers don't completely seek/grasp after happiness and peace 
              in what is inherently transient and dissatisfactory. We realise that 
              true Bliss, Happiness, Peace, is in our very Essence itself. Doesn't 
              mean spiritual people all retreat into the mountains with no aims in 
              life... just that they abide in/as their true essence and source as Pure
               Consciousness even as they live their ordinary lives, free of the 
              suffering and unhappiness due to their false identifications and 
              grasping. Non-spiritual seekers, unaware of their spiritual nature... 
              continue searching and identifying unconsciously in the world 
              confused... not knowing the great importance of learning to 'take the 
              backward step that turns the light and shines it inward'. But it does 
              not become apparent to them that the spiritual path is what they 
              (everyone) really wanted... it may appear contrary to their life aims 
              (they have many ideas and desires in life, everything except to have 
              more spiritual awareness), until eventually of course they find out how 
              relevant and essential it is to live spiritually/with spiritual 
              awareness or rather to discover their spiritual essence. If they knew 
              better... they would find spiritual practice appealing.<br> <br> 'Robots' is a very good way of describing such people... totally lost 
              sight of themselves and directions, simply following their own 
              programming of doing whatever they want to/have been doing without any 
              deeper awareness of their own minds and nature.</div>

              A common notion is that 
              enlightenment is a one final event thingy... however this is far from 
              truth, as many can attest that there are in fact many stages of 
              enlightenment/awakening. For example, my friend 'Thusness' writes about 
              his experience of enlightenment in the article <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a> - there are also other maps of enlightenment that are related. It has 
              been 25 years since his first awakening at the age of 17... and he spoke
               of many stages of unfoldment in realizations, many of which are still 
              beyond my experience.<br> <br> I have my own experiences of awakening (particularly since 9th February 
              this year, but it is not exactly a 'one-time-event' but an on-going 
              thing). Enlightenment, at my current level of awareness, is a pure 
              certainty of being-existence-consciousness, a realization of Who I Truly
               Am... beyond any doubts.<br>

              Yes, definitely awakening is 
              something achievable! It just takes a mind who is interested in waking 
              up... in investigating and clarifying all his false notions and 
              misconceptions... in truly getting down and resolving the true nature of
               his identity... For me, self-inquiry would be the direct path towards 
              self-realization. I personally think it would be bullshit to say that 
              enlightenment takes decades or perhaps not even in this lifetime: I'd 
              say, from personal experience and observation of others, the initial 
              awakening takes only months or a few years (for me 1+ year from the time
               I started self-inquiry), but there is a subsequent process of deepening
               insights.<br> <br> It's not exactly a dream world, it is only a dream mind! The mind 
              (thoughts/concepts) that mis-identifies with thoughts, mind, body, and 
              losing sight of your true Essence...<br> <br> As I wrote in my self-inquiry journal 'Who am I', <em>In that moment of 
              awakening, Consciousness awakens/withdraws its identification from the 
              dream of being a separate person, to its true identity as ItSelf</em><br>

              The Buddha path isn't about getting
               rid of your ego. Yes, you may have moments of 'egolessness', but those 
              experiences (which are all impermanent) are not ultimately what the 
              Buddha wants us to experience: rather, he want us to have <strong>realizations</strong>, which are permanent.<br> <br> It's about investigating and finding whether the "ego" truly even exist 
              in the first place! This separate individual self that I think I am, can
               I find it right now in my experience? Where is it? Or is it just a 
              figment of my imagination without any substance? If it cannot be located
               to begin, what is there to relinquish? To say I want to 'get rid of my 
              ego' is giving your ego too much reality/solidity than it deserves, 
              because it doesn't truly exist!<br> <br> It's all about a deeper insight and wisdom of the nature of your 
              experience... First realize (a direct and time-tested way would be via 
              self-inquiry) your true essence as Pure Consciousness, then investigate 
              to dissolve any remaining notions of an individual person, doer, or 
              experiencer of life... what remains is impersonal, universal, 
              all-pervasive Awareness itself, expressing in the myriads of life and 
              experiences...<br>

              thoughts, or do you believe that all people are conscious (well most are

              Before
               you think 'are they projections of your own thoughts', why don't you 
              find out 'am I a projection of my own thought?' If you drop all thoughts
               right now... in that gap of no-thought, can you deny your own 
              Existence, Presence, Consciousness? The answer is definitely no - your 
              Existence-Consciousness is vividly self-shining, self-knowing, and 
              self-evident even in that absence of thoughts! It is the most undeniable
               and irrefutible fact of Existence Itself. By asking yourself 'Who am I'
               and tracing all perceptions to the Source... you will touch the 
              innermost reality of our own core being where thoughts play absolutely 
              no role in that moment of experience and have a powerful conviction of 
              Who You Truly Are in Essence.<br> <br> If you figure this one out, you'll discover the true essence of 
              Consciousness, then you'll realize you're nothing like a machine, and 
              you'll realize that nobody is like a machine. You are not a mere 
              body/lifeless corpse. The body is simply an instrument, it is run by the
               One Consciousness... like various electrical instruments in your room 
              are run by the same electrical power source. You (and everybody) are 
              Life, utterly real and undeniable!<br> <br> As Buddhist monk/teacher Ajahn Brahmavamso says (note: in this excerpt, his term 'mind' means 'consciousness' and not thoughts),<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/B%20-%20Theravada/Teachers/Ajahn%20Brahmavamso/Meditation%20The%20Heart%20of%20Buddhism/Meditation%20The%20Heart%20of%20Buddhism-%20Ajahn%20Brahm.htm">Meditation: The Heart of Buddhism- Ajahn Brahm</a><br> <br> <em>When
               you know that mind, when you see it for yourself, one of the results 
              will be an insight that the mind is independent of this body. 
              Independence means that when this body breaks up and dies, when it's 
              cremated or when it's buried, or however it's destroyed after death, it 
              will not affect the mind. You know this because you see the nature of 
              the mind. That mind which you see will transcend bodily death. The first
               thing which you will see for yourself, the insight which is as clear as
               the nose on your face, is that there is something more to life than 
              this physical body that we take to be me. <strong>Secondly you can recognise 
              that that mind, essentially, is no different than that process of 
              consciousness which is in all beings. Whether it's human beings or 
              animals or even insects, of any gender, age or race, you see that that 
              which is in common to all life is this mind, this consciousness, the

              <p>Instead of being fully identified with or engaging in the contents of thoughts... if you simply step back and witness the arising of thoughts and the body and everything... you will see how thoughts arise totally spontaneously on its own according to imprints and habits. There is absolutely no thinker involved! Thoughts simply arise, they just happen, and you are simply this non-interfering witness. You are not a thinker, or a doer, or a controller, but the witness. Even apparent choices are simply thoughts spontaneously happening due to conditioning and imprints. Just notice next time how thoughts arise! Watch!</p>
              <p>This is an absolutely essential element to your daily practice or your meditation (without which your practice/meditation will utterly fail): because otherwise you will either be 1) lost in your thinking (the contents/stories of your thoughts), or 2) lost in trying to get rid of thinking (because you think you're the controller/thinker) which is just more false thinking and thus never works. The third alternative here is to realize your true identity not as a thinker or controller of thoughts, but as this Awareness that witnesses and allows thoughts but never grasps on them. Same goes for bodily movements... from the position of Witnessing Awareness, they simply arise due to certain mental and bodily programming, habits, and subtle intentions. They just happen on its own accord... there is no doer.</p>
              <p>Simply resting as Awareness, allow everything to unfold on its own and eventually these stuff subside into the background while Pure Consciousness-Existence 'comes' into the foreground of your experience. Simply abiding in just This.</p>
              <p>But notice that the stuff arising in awareness is really nothing but the manifestation of awareness... there is no separation or division anywhere whatsoever. If Awareness is limitless and borderless, how can you say that Awareness is here, and the sound is over there? Isn't the 'over there' also 'here', as Awareness? Where does Awareness end and manifestation begin? There are no borders, no boundaries, no divisions, no limits, no center and no circumference...</p>

Pause your thoughts for a moment, aren't you still aware, perceiving, hearing, seeing, etc? Isn't consciousness instantly obvious without a second-thought, or without even a moment of pondering necessary? Imagine if you were a baby without a single word or idea in your head, wouldn't aliveness still be obvious and present? Isn't this what babies 'do': simply living in a state of wonder of aliveness?</p>
              <p>Aliveness is seamless presence awareness without subject object division. Right now, you are alive and present. But is aliveness confined anywhere? Is it only located in the body? This is an assumption, an assumption that aliveness is confined only to 'my' body, in contrast to other experiences or objects. Yes, undeniably, your body is a field of aliveness, and the skin covering the body is a sensitive organ capable of allowing the perception and feeling (not that it is in and of itself a 'feeler') of the air, the wind blowing on the skin, the warmth and heat, the sensations on the fingertips now touching the keyboard, the sensation of your back leaning against the chair, the feet on the floor, etc... but ultimately it is not the body that feels, the eyes that sees, the ears that hears. Why? A corpse cannot feel even though it has skin, a corpse cannot see though it has eyes, a corpse cannot hear though it has ears. What is lacking in the corpse? Aliveness! Consciousness!</p>
              <p>But it is not that 'aliveness' is 'located in my body'... rather, it is that 'aliveness' is currently expressing through and as this body-mind, while this body is still alive. When the body goes through death, consciousness gradually stops expressing through and as this body-mind. And according to Buddhism, rebirth takes place (if you are not liberated): which means dependent on the wholesome and unwholesome karma of the 'individual', a new birth of consciousness takes place in and as another body-mind. But not so much on this now... my point of this paragraph is this: The body is not the feeler, the eyes are not the seer, the ears is not the 
                                                                  hearer. You are not the eyes looking outwards, the ears hearing outwards, etc... rather, sights and sounds manifest through consciousness, and not only 'through' consciousness but those sights and sounds precisely IS aliveness, awareness, consciousness... there is no duality. The bodily organ is simply one of the conditions for a particular manifestation of 
                                                                  aliveness, but there is no separate feeler located behind the sense organ, rather, there is only direct experience/consciousness, there is only aliveness 
                                                                  vividly manifesting everywhere without a subject/object dichotomy present! (more on that later) Our entire field of experience is just one seamless field of consciousness with no divisions whatsoever.</p>
              <p>As I was saying, the body is a field of aliveness. However, aliveness is not just confined to bodily sensations. And it is not just a sense of aliveness or existence confined to a space behind everything. Initially, aliveness may appear to be this background sense of existence, livingness, knowing... but notice when a sound suddenly arises in the field of consciousness... what is it? Pure consciousness, pure aliveness too! Utterly present and undeniable and vivid. There is no other. There is this sense that aliveness/consciousness/awareness has infinite 
                                                  potentiality and has no fixed forms/formlessness - whatever arises is 
                                                  another form and expression of aliveness. Aliveness is this dynamic 
                                                  manifestation.... and there is no center, no boundary, no circumference 
                                                  to aliveness... whatever arises IS aliveness. Consciousness is without any (fixed, inherent) traits, essence, attributes... but precisely because there is no fixed traits and attributes, aliveness manifests as literally everything - in all kinds of manifestations with all kinds of (apparent) traits. What I'm getting to is this: aliveness is nothing static at all - it is dynamic and ungraspable: luminosity is ever-present and can never be lost, and yet is unique and fresh in expression every single moment. And being dynamic, there is no place to abide in - there is no static place of consciousness for you to abide in, for consciousness is this momentary, flowing luminous reflection. This is why the Buddha taught mindfulness instead of sustaining any particular meditative state of absorption – mindfulness being an ingenious way of being intimate with our moment-to-moment experience, to experience the mirror-like clarity in all manifestation. Any sense of a self, a centerpoint, simply dissolves into the luminous mirror bright clarity shining in all directions without a border.</p>
              <p>But don't take my word for it! My words if taken for granted as 'the truth' will ultimately become utterly useless and fail to deliver it's intended purpose, instead, you must make a perceptual shift in your direct experience via contemplation. To challenge the subject-object division, the sense of a center, border and circumference to awareness, always ask yourself these questions with regards to whatever you are experiencing, and contemplate, 'Is there anything other [than awareness/being the forms of awareness]?', 'What is this?', 'Where does Awareness end and manifestation begin?' And always go by direct experience, not some insignificant thought or concept (no matter how clever or convincing the theory may sound - they are ultimately a bunch of words without any substance) that pops up in your head! Having a contemplation practice is very important. But more on that later on.*</p>
              <p>Sound arising, sight, sensations on the skin, the smells perceived through the nose, the taste of ice cream, thoughts manifesting, isn't it a whole seamless field of aliveness not separable in terms of subject and object? Are you something in your body, in your head, looking outwards through your eyes, or is everything simply self-present as consciousness not dividable in terms of inside and outside? Doesn't everything have a single taste of pure luminosity and emptiness? Yet aren't they also the various variety of 'forms' of aliveness, a sound being radically different from say, a smell? Aren't these various forms of aliveness different in variations and forms, and yet having the same intensity and quality of livingness and perceivingness?</p>
              <p>Isn't it all Pure Consciousness itself? The pure sense of a background presence and pure beingness, apparently solidifying the position of a Subject... now collapses into seamlessness without a subject and object. It is not Aliveness or Presence (I use these words synonymously, some may have distinguished meanings for each) that is denied, it is the denial of a border, a center, a confinement, a location, an inside or an outside/subject-object separation to Consciousness... what remains is a field of seamless consciousness manifesting in various forms.</p>
              <p>Lastly... isn't the full intensity of Consciousness already shining in plain sight effortlessly, with the only apparent obscuration being our constant 'ignoring' and blocking out Wholeness by dualizing and attaching (to a particular point of view, including the attachment to a sense of self) and rejecting (the other points of views*)?</p>
              <p>*Points of view: any particular sensation, thought, feeling, etc. Any particular constituents of the field of experience.</p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing :)</p>
              <p>Understand how you feel and why you laugh. Sometimes, the bliss
                      come and i laugh, my wife will then say 'what are you doing.. that
                      is so funny.'</p>
              <p>She doesn't understand. But she is taking Vipassana class now.
                      Hope she can understand eventually too:)</p>
              <p>Sometimes, there are no laughter, but just an expressionless
                      stone-face ;)</p>

              <p>Hi Simpo and AEN,</p>
              <p>Yet we cannot get carried away by all these blissful experiences.  Blissfulness is the result of luminosity whereas liberation is due to prajna wisdom.   :)</p>
              <p>To AEN,</p>
              <p>For intense luminosity in the foreground, you will not only have vivid experience of ‘brilliant aliveness’, ‘you’ must also completely disappear.  It is an experience of being totally ‘transparent’ and without boundaries.  These experiences are quite obvious, u will not miss it.  However the body-mind will not rest in great content due to an experience of intense luminosity.  Contrary it can make a practitioner more attach to a non-dual ultimate luminous state.</p>
              <p>For the mind to rest, it must have an experience of ‘great dissolve’ that whatever arises perpetually self liberates.  It is not about phenomena dissolving into some great void but it is the empty nature of whatever arises that self-liberates.   It is the direct experience of groundlessness and non –abiding due to direct insight of the empty nature of phenomena and that includes the non-dual luminous essence.</p>
              <p>Therefore In addition to bringing this ‘taste’ to the foreground, u must also ‘realize’ the difference between wrong and right view.  There is also a difference in saying “Different forms of Aliveness” and “There is just breath, sound, scenery...magical display that is utterly unfindable, ungraspable and without essence- empty.”</p>
              <p>In the former case, realize how the mind is manifesting a subtle tendency of attempting to ‘pin’ and locate something that inherently exists. The mind feels uneasy and needs to seek for something due to its existing paradigm.   It is not simply a matter of expression for communication sake but a habit that runs deep because it lacks a ‘view’ that is able to cater for reality that is dynamic, ungraspable, non-local , center-less and interdependent. </p>
              <p>After direct realization of the non-dual essence and empty nature, the mind can then have a direct glimpse of what is meant by being ‘natural’, otherwise there will always be a ‘sense of contrivance’. </p>
              <p>My 2 cents and have fun with ur army life. :-)</p>
