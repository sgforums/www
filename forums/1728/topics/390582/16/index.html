              <p><strong>Which Path Should I Choose?</strong></p>
              <p>I am often asked what practice suits them. Theravada, Advaita, Zen, Tibetan, self-inquiry, direct path, gradual path, direct contemplation, vipassana, it's all so confusing. How do they know which path to take?</p>
              <p>My answer is, basically, discern for yourself (or if you meet a master or teacher who can advise you that'll be helpful too).</p>
              <p>For me, I chose to go through the path to realize I AM... as I am influenced by Advaita, Zen, etc. If you are influenced by Zen, Advaita, etc, I will recommend self-inquiry to you. But self-inquiry is not suitable for all and sundry: it depends on the person's inclinations.</p>
              <p>If you are strictly Theravada you might not be interested. However Kenneth Folk is an exception and is a mix of various traditions: Theravada, Zen, Advaita, Tibetan, etc.</p>
              <p>Direct path, self inquiry, all feels right to me... as in it resonates with me. Its more interesting than entering many many stages of nanas and jhanas, that's why I practiced it -  the path that stresses on the Immediate truth rather than gradual development. After self-realization I switched to direct contemplation on non-dual and anatta (e.g. Bahiya Sutta style contemplation).</p>

              <p><strong>The Non-contingent Joy Not Born Out of Stimulus</strong></p>
              <p>Participant 1: How would you convince someone about the visible fruits of the Buddhist practice here and now?<br><br>Me: <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html</a><br><br>Participant 1: Hmm I'm thinking of something more relevant to a westerner lol, they would be sceptical about super powers etc. Furthermore, how to convince a westerner that it is possible to transcend suffering? Where does suffering come from?<br><br>Me: Supernatural powers are only a small part of the visible fruits mentioned in the sutta<br><br>Participant 1: Ya but I don't want to give him a sutta to read.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Me: You can summarise the sutta. Suffering arises due to ignorance, attachments and cravings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Participant 1: From this notion of a self right? From a subject-object dichotomy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Me: Yes but not just subject-object dichotomy. Various forms of attachment to self.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Participant 1: Such as?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Me: Duality is part of the sense of self. It is removed in Thusness Stage 4. At </span><span style="color: #000000;">Thusness </span><span style="color: #000000;">Stage 5 realization of Anatta, the 'I' agent is gone. But the 'mine' attachment lingers. There are many degrees of attachment to 'I'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Participant 1: Hmm but, for westerners who enjoy sense pleasures, how would you convince them?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Me: Every pleasure deriving from sensual stimulus is impermanent and thus ultimately unsatisfactory. However there is a joy that does not depend on the senses. It does not come from sensory stimulus. It does fade with the absence of sensory stimulus. In fact, speaking from experience, you can experience deep joy and equanimity even if your body is experiencing very unpleasant sensations. By tranquilising bodily and mental formations, giving rise to bliss and joy, centering the mind in samadhi, one is able to overcome all bodily hindrances and experience deep clarity, joy and equanimity even in the midst of unpleasantness. You will not experience aversion to life, and a non-contingent joy manifests. A non-contingent perfection and purity lies right there even in the midst of pleasant/unpleasant sensations.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Joy that arise non-contingent on senses is the joy arising from abandonment. When you abandon the body, the mind, and the self, joy naturally arises. This can happen via two ways. Either via opening, though that is more for insight practitioners after certain realization like anatta, or it is via absorption like the practice of jhanas. When you practice insight meditation in daily life, you experience joy and delight even in ordinary seeing and hearing in mundane activities. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But it is not joy born out of sensory stimulus. For if that were the case, the joy would be contingent and unsatisfactory. Rather, it is the joy arising when you drop your self and simply immerse in direct experience.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Participant 1: Why are we reborn after realizing not-self?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Me: We are reborn due to latent tendencies. When you overcome sensual attachments, cravings and aversions, you no longer have the cause for rebirth in the sensual realms. That is the anagami level. If you overcome even subtle cravings for jhanic existence, then you have destroyed the cause of birth even in these subtler realms.<br></span></p>

                                                When we see the mindâs nature, there is nothing to hold. As there is nothing 
                                                unchanging to ground. Phenomena is itself mind, so how is âmindâ unchanging? The

                                                has the same natureâ¦ we then realize, it is mind. The five aggregates all share

                                                wisdom which "flows" into our post-equipoise and causes us to truly perceive the 
                                                world in the following way in Nagarjuna's Bodhicittavivarana:<br><br>"Form is 
                                                similar to a foam,<br>Feeling is like water bubbles,<br>Ideation is equivalent 
                                                with a mirage,<br>Formations are similar with a banana tree,<br>Consciousness is 
                                                like an illusion."<br><br>...<br><br>"In other words, right view is the 
                                                beginning of the noble path. It is certainly the case that dependent origination 
                                                is "correct view"; when one analyzes a bit deeper, one discovers that in the 
                                                case "view" means being free from views. The teaching of dependent origination 
                                                is what permits this freedom f<br>views. The teaching of dependent origination 
                                                is what permits this freedom from views."</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 14pt;">Thusness: 
                                                The real purpose is the âfreedomâ from âinherentâ view and then releases itself 
                                                from any forming of âviewsâ so that the magic of functioning can be realized and 
                                                directly experienced. However during the journey, there is always attachment 
                                                here and thereâ¦ therefore the âemptying of emptinessâ.   We go through step by 
                                                step in dissolving the knot of âinherencyâ till we see that âmindâ is the full 
                                                embodiment of the immediate marvelous activity.  Just eating, seeing, sensing, 
                                                tasting, thinking...simply sound, thoughts, scenery and scents.  Nothing within 
                                                and without, only this spontaneous miraculous functioning, an interplay of 
                                                dharma.  When we entertain conceptual knowledge and seek unchanging Awareness or 
                                                Self, the marvelous âinterconnectednessâ of functioning is being misunderstood 
                                                as âsomethingâ being transformed into âsomethingâ as if âwinterâ has been 
                                                transformed into âspringâ. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 14pt;">It 
                                                is also important to take note not to ascribe the functioning to a âhigherâ 
                                                power. That is because of âa thought of personalityâ that creates the confusion. 
                                                If there is no attachment to a self, identity, personality, then the functioning 
                                                itself is marvellous without reification, or any form of 
                                                personification.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 14pt;">Also, 
                                                to truly get into this âmagicâ of functioning, the doing away of the âhowâ is 
                                                also important. It arises when we penetrate and look deeply the where-about of 
                                                anything. Just magical appearances.</span></p>

                                                Yeahâ¦ Now, I realize my practice sort of switched a lot into penetrating and 
                                                looking deeply into the non locality of everythingâ¦ itâs like what Buddha taught 
                                                in Phena Sutta,<em> âThat's the way it goes: 
                                                it's a magic trick, an idiot's babbling. It's said to be a murderer.[1] No 
                                                substance here is found. Thus a monk, persistence aroused, should view the 
                                                aggregates by day &amp; by night, mindful, alert; should discard all fetters; 
                                                should make himself his own refuge; should live as if his head were on fire â in 
                                                hopes of the state with no falling away.â</em></span></p>

                                                Yes, until the mind becomes uncontrived and groundless. If we stay on with the 
                                                Self, unchanging awareness, we will not be able to realize the essence in the 
                                                teachings of emptiness. The purpose is not to get attached to the ânon-inherentâ 
                                                view either.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span style="line-height: 14pt;">As 
                                                such, it is not a "view" in the sense that is something we hold as concept, it 
                                                is rather a wisdom which "flows" into our post-equipoise and causes us to truly

                                                experience directly, the magic of empty luminosity.</span></p>

              <div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">
              <div id="post-body-10269857" class="body">Emptiness... emptiness....<br> <br> In normal, everyday life, when someone uses the word âemptinessâ,                         it usually has a negative connotion.<br> <br> Like a 'lack of something'... like as if life is lacking                
                       something (e.g. "life feels so empty nowadays"). If anything,  
                                     things lack âinherent, unchanging, independent 
              existenceââ¦ yet they                         are wondrously, intensely 
              vividly luminous and apparent!<br> <br> Unfortunately, the teaching of 'emptiness', along with other            
                           teachings of Buddha (including the most common 
              misperception of                         Buddha's teaching as 'Life is 
              Suffering' which is certainly NOT                         what he 
              said!*) gives the misconception of Buddhism as having a                 
                      life-denying, pessimistic view of the world.<br> <br> But this is NOT the Buddhist understanding of Emptiness!<br> <br> Form is emptiness, emptiness IS form!<br> <br> Emptiness IS Fullness!<br> <br> I can assure you when you realize emptiness, you will marvel, be        
                               amazed, at the whole universe as a magical 
              apparition... it's like                         Whoa, the universe is 
              magic, luminous and empty, clearly manifest                         yet 
              no-thing 'there'! No place of origin, place of abidance, and destination
               - to thoughts, to sensate experiences... just a clear display of 
              luminous apparitions. Shunyata is a wonder.<br> <br> This is a wonderful truth... This is nothing dreadful... and is                         nothing short of Great Bliss.<br> <br> The luminous and empty universe is spontaneously perfected, lacking                         nothing, amazing!<br> <br> <br> *The Buddha taught that suffering is a part and parcel of life, or      
                                 to put it more simply, 'there is suffering in life', 
              and that there                         is a way to end suffering. He did
               NOT say "Life is Suffering" or                         "Life can only 
              be suffering" even though sadly, this is what many                      
                 teachers are promoting - their own distortion of Buddha's original   
                                    words. For more info see this well-written
