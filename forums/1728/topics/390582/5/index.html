              <p>--------------------------------------------------<br>From: J<br>Sent: Saturday, 
                          June 19, 2010 10:47 AM<br>To: AEN<br>Subject: 
                          help<br><br>&gt; AEN,</p>
              <p>.....</p>
              <p><br>&gt; Speaking frankly, I 
                                  don't know how to avoid turning slef-inquiry into<br>&gt; intellectual pursue. 
                                  When I have time, I just practice rest as<br>&gt; awareness as taught by 
                                  Adyashanti.<br>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIX_zk5NN6g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIX_zk5NN6g</a><br>&gt; 
                                  I haven't seen any effect on me so far. This method I think is better<br>&gt; 
                                  than Awareness Watching Awareness method. AWA method may make a person<br>&gt; 
                                  fall into the trap of watcher.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Regards,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; J<br>&gt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hi,<br><br>Will do.<br><br>Btw, I just recently read a book by Adyashanti called 
                                  'True Meditation'. <br>Recommended.<br><br>In it he describes two methods which 
                                  he says cannot be done without, cannot <br>take out either elements for true 
                                  successful and insightful meditation.<br><br>One is a practice of surrendering 
                                  and letting go of doership, the other is <br>spiritual self inquiry (Who am I?). 
                                  Basically Adyashanti is a teacher of <br>self inquiry as well. Also, spiritual 
                                  self inquiry is what led to <br>Adyashanti's awakening. Quite a good book and 
                                  contains detailed instructions <br>for both parts of the meditation.<br><br>As 
                                  for AWA, it is a pretty good method that leads to the I AM experience. It <br>is 
                                  also a good method for those who have experienced the I AM to build up 
                                  <br>meditative strength and samadhi/absorption in the Self. However, as I said 
                                  <br>earlier, many methods lead to experiences and glimpses of recognition of the 
                                  <br>I AM/Eternal Witness, but they do not lead to the realization. For 
                                  <br>realization, you should practice self-inquiry.<br><br>Last year I asked 
                                  Thusness:<br><br>(10:39 PM) Me: btw is it possible to experience I AMness 
                                  without self <br>inquiry? for example the person who wrote "awareness watching 
                                  awareness" <br>just focus on awareness alone then experienced I AMness. he didnt 
                                  ask "who <br>am i". but i tink "who am i" is v useful<br>(10:43 PM) Thusness: it 
                                  is possible but the sort it is a more gradual <br>approach.  It will not have 
                                  that sort of 'Eureka' factor.<br> (10:45 PM) Thusness: the next step (into 
                                  non-dual) is to bring this into <br>the foreground by practicing bare attention 
                                  of our body sensations.<br><br><br>The Eureka factor is very important part for 
                                  Realization. Self Inquiry is <br>the Direct (not gradual) method to 
                                  Self-Realization. The difference between <br>experience and realization is 
                                  written in <br><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/09/realization-and-experience-and-non-dual.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/09/realization-and-experience-and-non-dual.html</a><br><br>- 
                                  when I had had glimpses and recognitions since 2007 or 2008 of the I AM, 
                                  <br>those were not considered Realizations, not the realization of 'You' I 
                                  <br>articulated in the Who am I document.<br><br><br>If you have a recognition 
                                  of the Observer sort of experience, that is simply <br>recognition, but not the 
                                  Zen sort of Satori which comes in a form of <br>realization - that is the I AM. 
                                  An experience/recognition by itself does not <br>mean 
                                  realization.<br><br>Regards<br>AEN</p>

                  and have a question
                                          here.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><br> &gt;<br> &gt; But right now, your body is alive and 
                  functioning well, so you
                                          next<br> &gt; time when you are walking or jogging on the
                   street you can
                                          inquire on<br> &gt; 'Who is dragging this corpse along?' 
                  Certainly the corpse
                                          cannot walk<br> &gt; or move by itself without the power of the
                                          Source/Consciousness/Life.<br> &gt; What is this core/source of aliveness? Who 
                  is it?<br> &gt;<br> &gt; So you can do self inquiry in all kinds of 
                  situations: hearing
                                          a bird<br> &gt; chirping (or experiencing anything else), 
                  walking on the
                                          street, or<br> &gt; simply sitting meditation (just ask Before 
                  birth, Who am
                                          I?)<br> &gt;</em></span><br> &gt; How can you tell who, the ego or the Self, 
                  is doing and
                                          observing? I<br> &gt; believe all I know now is my ego. 
                  Everything is perceived,
                                          processed<br> &gt; and done by my ego. The ego knows the ego. 
                  The ego sees the
                                          things.<br> &gt; The ego does the things....<br> &gt;<br> &gt;<br> &gt; Regards,<br> &gt;<br> &gt; J<br> &gt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hi,<br> <br> What is the ego? Ego is defined as the false 
                  identification with
                                          mind and<br> body and objects.<br> <br> I like what Daniel M. Ingram said about this:<br> <br> "ego is a process<br> of identification, not a thing in and of itself.
                   It is like a bad
                                          habit, but<br> it<br> doesn't exist as something that can be found. 
                  This is important, as
                                          this<br> bad habit can quickly co-opt the language of 
                  egolessness and come
                                          up<br> with phrases as absurd as: "I will destroy my 
                  ego!" But, not being
                                          a<br> thing, it cannot be destroyed, but by 
                  understanding our bare
                                          experience,<br> our minds, the process of identification can 
                  stop. Any thoughts
                                          with "I,"<br> "me," "my" and "mine" in them should be 
                  understood to be just<br> thoughts which come and go. This is not 
                  something you can
                                          talk<br> yourself out of. You have to perceive things as 
                  they are to stop
                                          this<br> process."<br> <br> <br> So, ego is not a thing! But, it is a process, a 
                  process of
                                          mentally<br> identifying perceived objects as 'me' or 'mine'.
                   It is a
                                          conceptual<br> fabrication of the mind. It is not natural. It 
                  is constructed. It
                                          is an<br> illusion.<br> <br> However, what is the True Self?<br> <br> True Self is something that is unconstructed and
                   natural, that is
                                          why<br> Adyashanti talked about letting go of doership 
                  and surrendering. If
                                          you are<br> still 'doing' something to your experience, 
                  trying to change it or
                                          whatever,<br> it will never lead to realization. What leads to
                   realization is to
                                          inquire<br> and look into What am I?<br> <br> In the gap between two thoughts, when you ask 
                  'Who am I?' There is
                                          a<br> natural, unfabricated, lucid clarity and 
                  aliveness that is 'there'
                                          by<br> default, doesn't move, is completely still, and 
                  is simply what You
                                          are.<br> There will be no doubts if you 
                  experience/realize this, so doubts
                                          will not<br> arise as to 'is this ego?' at that point at all.
                   You just see it,
                                          it is<br> utterly real, and there is no beliefs at that 
                  point: it is a
                                          non-conceptual<br> knowing.<br> <br> This is different from the ego because the ego 
                  means a form of
                                          mental<br> identification, or mentally constructed state of
                   identification,
                                          but<br> Awareness or True Self is what is naturally 
                  there - unconstructed -
                                          in the<br> absence or presence of thoughts.<br> <br> Now, regarding "&gt; How can you tell who, the 
                  ego or the Self, is
                                          doing and<br> observing? I<br> &gt; believe all I know now is my ego. 
                  Everything is perceived,
                                          processed<br> &gt; and done by my ego. The ego knows the ego. 
                  The ego sees the
                                          things.<br> &gt; The ego does the things....<br> &gt;"<br> <br> This is just an assumption, and as you rightly 
                  say, 'a belief'. In
                                          truth however, it is just the opposite. Don't 
                  believe in your
                                          thoughts, question them.<br> Investigate.<br> <br> Everything is perceived, processed, and done by 
                  and through<br> Consciousness/Awareness. Awareness knows ego. 
                  Awareness sees
                                          things. Things<br> are spontaneously arising through Awareness.<br> <br> There is no separate person that is a doer or 
                  perceiver of things.
                                          This is<br> an illusory construct. You ARE Awareness, and 
                  through Awareness,
                                          everything<br> is spontaneously perceived/accomplished.<br> <br> When you see an apple, does your awareness or 
                  eye say 'I see
                                          apple?' No, the<br> 'I see apple' is an after-thought. Does the 
                  thought 'I see apple'
                                          have the<br> power of seeing the apple? No, 
                  Presence-Awareness is what is
                                          Seeing. 'I see<br> apple' is merely an after-thought that separates
                   an imaginary 'I'
                                          and an<br> imaginary separate object 'apple'. The actual 
                  seeing precedes
                                          subject-object<br> division, the actuality of it does not have a 
                  separate 'I'
                                          involved.<br> <br> Similarly, does thoughts or actions arise 
                  spontaneously or are you
                                          the<br> doer/thinker of thoughts/actions? Can you know 
                  what your next
                                          moment of<br> thought will be? No, you can't. Thoughts simply 
                  arise spontaneously
                                          on its<br> own accord. Ditto to actions. All the causes and
                   conditions come
                                          together<br> and something pops up, but no separate 
                  doer/thinker/controller can
                                          be found.<br> There is only conditioned and spontaneous 
                  arisings.<br> <br> The ego is simply false mental identification 
                  that will dissolve
                                          upon a bit<br> of investigation where you see the illusori-ness
                   of such mental
                                          clinging and<br> constructs.<br> <br> The ego is not real and has no real power to 
                  'do' or 'perceive'
                                          things at<br> all. The 'ego' is simply an 
                  after-thought/after-identification of
                                          an actual<br> act or perception. It is the identification of 
                  something
                                          done/perceived as<br> 'me' or 'mine' or perceived/done through a 
                  'perceiver'/'doer' which
                                          is<br> false.<br> <br> <br> Regards<br> AEN</p>

                              Re: self-inquiry<br> <br> &gt; When you talk to an ordinary unenlightened person 
                              who has no knowledge<br> &gt; of spiritual literature, if he says it is me who is 
                              doing and seeing,<br> &gt; you probably would tell him "that me" is not the Self. 
                              I am just<br> &gt; another ordinary unenlightened person except I have some 
                              exposure to<br> &gt; spiritual literature so I labeled "that me" as the 
                              ego.<br> &gt;</p>
              <p>Right. Certainly, the "me" that people usually think of would be their 
                  mind,<br>their body, their personality. In fact they don't know of anything 
                  beyond<br>that in their lives.<br><br>So they think that they (as personalities) 
                  are in control of their lives or<br>are experiencers of their life.<br><br>That 
                  is of course... until they do serious spiritual inquiry and discover<br>who they 
                  really are.<br><br>That ego is certainly not true, it cannot be found. Just 
                  investigate in your<br>own experience and you see that whatever you labeled as 
                  'me' is in fact, not<br>you at all. They are simply more transient thoughts and 
                  feelings arising in<br>the field of awareness, they come and go. What we 
                  perceive as an individual<br>person, or a personality, at the center of lives... 
                  simply is more patterns<br>of thoughts, actions, feelings, behavior arising in 
                  the field of awareness.<br>There isn't a 'me' actually. 'That me' that sentient 
                  beings identify with is<br>actually not a 'me' at all. It is only impersonal 
                  thoughts, feelings, <br>sensations arising and subsiding momentarily in the 
                  field of awareness without any<br>substantiality or separate doer, they are only 
                  effortless/spontaneous <br>expression of One Life. You clearly see that we are 
                  not separate selves <br>living our lives, but we are all being lived as an 
                  effortless expression of <br>One Life.<br><br>Seeing this, what you labeled as 
                  'me' is seen to not have any existence in<br>the first place. There is no 
                  separate 'me' in control of their lives, there<br>is no separate 'me' 
                  experiencing their life. This 'separate me' is a figment<br>of imagination, it 
                  is a made-up entity that cannot be found or located, and<br>has no power to 
                  perceive, act, or control anything.<br><br>But does that mean you do not exist? 
                  Your Being, your sense of Existence, is<br>undoubtedly present, and Aware. You 
                  will not be able to doubt it, I.e. your<br>existence. If you do self-inquiry, 
                  'Who am I?' sooner or later you will<br>eventually see/realize what this is all 
                  about, you will find what you truly<br>are.<br><br>Don't see your self as an 
                  unenlightened person (and likewise even if you<br>realize your Self, don't see 
                  yourself as an enlightened person), because<br>both images are illusory images 
                  of ego (false self identification). In other<br>words, if you even start to say 
                  that you are a 'person', you have believed<br>in a lie fabricated by the mind. 
                  You are not a person (whether enlightened<br>or unenlightened). You are 
                  Awareness only (and even this is not true on a <br>mental level - that is, if 
                  the mind believes in this statement and make it into a<br>mental/egoic 
                  identification). This can only be known intuitively through<br>direct 
                  investigation.<br><br>Regards<br>AEN</p>

              <p>Hi,<br><br>You will have to do self inquiry... it is the 
                                                direct path to Seeing. By the<br>way I can see from your posts that you really 
                                                'yearn' for enlightenment, and<br>this is also in my experience for quite some 
                                                time in the past - seeking<br>after some sort of 'event' or 'experience' (well 
                                                even now these concepts may<br>pop up due to habit but aren't taken so seriously 
                                                anymore because it is seen<br>that the truth of Being lies not in a future/past 
                                                experience but is an<br>experiential *fact* shining in plain view). This is a 
                                                good sign and is an<br>indication that you are now yearning to know and get to 
                                                the bottom of<br>knowing Who You Are. However, try not to rush through the 
                                                process of<br>self-inquiry in hopes of/expectations of gaining enlightenment 
                                                quickly or<br>gaining anything at all. Don't hold on to any expectations, 
                                                because any<br>holding is going to distract you from the truth of your Being, 
                                                not to<br>mention very painful as well. Do it slowly and patiently. It's 
                                                actually good<br>(even important and necessary) to have a yearning to know the 
                                                truth, but<br>direct that yearning/attention to Being Itself. What you want is 
                                                to know and<br>get intimate with (not that you ever left it) the truth of your 
                                                Being, not<br>'gaining a state of enlightenment' which leads to chasing after 
                                                illusory<br>future events and causes you to overlook your immediate 
                                                ever-present<br>timeless Truth. After all this is only about the already-present naked<br>Truth of your Being, and nothing else.<br><br>Anything 
                                                else is mind-made illusions, it is not the Truth. What you want is<br>the Truth. 
                                                'Enlightenment' is simply the ever-present truth of your Being,<br>it is not a 
                                                future (or past) event happening to someone (which is an<br>illusion). This is 
                                                the problem with people giving you expectations, and why<br>I am hesitant and 
                                                reluctant to even mention things like 'enlightenment<br>should happen to you in 
                                                xx months or years if you do this' because it sets<br>up false hopes and 
                                                expectations and illusions to dwell in. All these<br>statements presume the 
                                                reality of time and separate persons and are merely<br>appearances or 'relative 
                                                truths', but can be easily and mistakenly grasped<br>as 'ultimate truth'. 
                                                However, I did mention that to let you know that<br>self-realization is 
                                                definitely possible and is not a distant thing, so there<br>is no reason to be 
                                                disheartened because you have spent the last 15 years<br>intellectualizing over 
                                                these and not found the answer (because you are<br>looking at your 
                                                conceptualizing mind and not the Self)... now you have the<br>key, simply apply 
                                                it and investigate your own direct experience to find out<br>who/what you truly 
                                                are, and the truth will be 'revealed' (as it always has,<br>so self-evidently

                                                on his opinion on the matter... but as far as I know, there is no 
                                                <br>short<br>cut in spirituality. But at the same time Thusness has told me 
                                                years ago,<br>self inquiry is a short cut to realization. Both are true. Self 
                                                Inquiry is<br>in fact the short cut (Thusness calls it 'direct path' in contrast 
                                                to<br>'gradual path') to self-realization, it leads to realizing your luminous 
                                                <br>essence very quickly. However the first realization of I<br>AM does not mean 
                                                it is the end of the path - there is a gradual deepening of<br>insight through 
                                                integrating non-duality and anatta and emptiness just as<br>described in

                                                this<br>way, there is no 'short cut' - everyone will have to go through a 
                                                process<br>that often takes several years and decades... even though it is true 
                                                that<br>Self Inquiry can lead to a sudden awakening of our true self very

                                                with<br>you, this means that either he is not a real teacher, or that 
                                                you<br>yourself are spiritually immature." by Anadi<br><br>Is very true, 
                                                however, most of us are 'spiritually immature' because<br>'maturity' means many 
                                                factors like investigation, past insights and<br>experience, deep interest in 
                                                truth, possibly/probably conditions and factors<br>from past lives... all coming 
                                                together and makes a student 'ripe for<br>picking' by the master. Seldom do you 
                                                hear of people who are spontaneously<br>woken up by a teacher upon their first 
                                                meeting (though it happens), however<br>I have heard of many people who woke up 
                                                after years of practicing... then,<br>when they are ripe, all the master has to 
                                                do is to point them out, sometimes<br>just hitting them with their shoes, 
                                                sometimes hitting them on their head, or<br>just a short pointer, and everything 
                                                falls into picture. Sometimes if the<br>person is ripe no teacher is even 
                                                necessary (but he/she would probably have<br>trained for years under a teacher 
                                                previously) - all it takes is a sound or a<br>sight, pebbles hitting each other, 
                                                something fell down, bell sounded, a cup<br>broke, or just seeing something... 
                                                that is how many Zen masters of the past got enlightened. Much like how Thusness got 
                                                enlightened after hearing the 'Tonggg'. They were ready, and so a Master, or 
                                                a sound, a sight, is all it takes to wake them<br>up. But what is often not 
                                                mentioned is that they often have a history of<br>spiritual inquiry and practice 
                                                and that is why they are 'ripe' at that<br>particular moment.<br><br>Sometimes 
                                                they are already ripe... but what is lacking is a true teacher to<br>point them 
                                                out. Often however, we start as beginners, 'unripe'. For<br>example... Someone 
                                                in my forum by the name of JonLS realized non-duality<br>simply by reading a 
                                                phrase written by Thusness, 'Manifestation is Source'.<br>Thusness wrote to him 
                                                because he knew that JonLS is 'ripe', his conditions<br>were there for certain 
                                                insights to arise, just needed some pointers. All it<br>took was a few posts, a 
                                                few days of conversation in the forum since they<br>ever knew each other, and it 
                                                'happened'. My Taiwanese teacher woke up 4 days <br>after meeting my Master (he 
                                                was already ripe then - and my Master knew he <br>was coming even before he 
                                                arrived, and said upon his first meeting 'you have <br>finally come!' as if he 
                                                knew him before - which is true, because they had <br>Master-Student 
                                                relationship even from past lives and both were abbots and <br>Zen masters of a 
                                                Zen monastery in Kyoto, Japan in their past lives). For me <br>however, it has 
                                                been years<br>since I knew Thusness and my dharma teachers and Master but I am only only beginning to scratch the 
                                                surface.<br>That is the difference.<br><br>BTW, it is often the case that a 
                                                teacher may be able to lead even beginner<br>students to a spontaneous 
                                                recognition of their true nature simply by<br>pointing out instructions. 
                                                However, a deep and lasting realization will not<br>usually come so fast. But 
                                                the 'recognitions' eventually leads to the <br>'realization'. Again, 
                                                'recognition' and 'realization' are different<br>as I discussed 
                                                earlier. As discussed <a href="/forums/1728/topics/390582?page=2#post_9787387">here</a>, even Ramana Maharshi's first experience at age 16 is a form of 'recognition' arising after a process of inference, but that is still not the direct experience/realization of the Self. That arose afterwards, so we can say that his initial recognition led on to the realization.<br><br>FYI. <a class="l" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's

                              itself. If this is<br> &gt; true, I have another question here: is discriminative 
                              power part of<br> &gt; Awareness and not some illusory 
                              existence?<br> &gt;<br> &gt;<br> &gt; Regards,<br> &gt;<br> &gt; 
                              J<br> <br> &amp;<br> <br> I meant I should be earnest in practice but setting no 
                              goal or not<br> expecting any end result according to you and other teachers.</p>
              <p>------------------</p>
              <p>Hi,<br><br>Both Adya and the self-inquiry I'm talking about are essentially 
                              exactly the <br>same thing.<br><br>I am not so sure of Jed McKenna's Spiritual 
                              Autolysis, haven't really read it.<br><br>But Adyashanti is basically asking 'What am I?'<br><br>By 
                              dropping everything else, he describes tracing back to Awareness itself, <br>or 
                              whatever remains after everything else is dropped.<br><br>The 'discrimination' 
                              is not a mental discrimination, it is simply the <br>discrimination between Self 
                              and not-Self, in other words by <br>rejecting/letting go of whatever is 
                              not-Self, what remains is Self which is <br>beyond discrimination. But this is 
                              not a mental rejection. For example, a <br>thought arises, "I am J", then in 
                              spiritual self inquiry you <br>discriminate and know that the thought "I am 
                              J" is not your true Self <br>and is merely an arising thought and label, so 
                              you simply let go of it and <br>continue inquiring. This kind of 
                              'discrimination' is important in any <br>self-inquiry (whether Adya, or Ramana 
                              Maharshi, or Master Hsu Yun, or <br>whomever) because otherwise you will 
                              continue identifying with whatever you <br>identify with as your self and not 
                              progressing in your inquiry. But as you <br>can see it is not a mental 
                              discrimination or labeling 'this is not true <br>self', rather, it is simply a 
                              spontaneous seeing and letting go. But that doesn't <br>mean you forcefully try 
                              to get rid of your experiences or your thoughts, <br>that is too much 
                              contrivance and doesn't help, rather you simply notice that <br>whatever you 
                              identify as your self is not in fact who you Truly are. That is <br>enough. To 
                              see the false as false is enough, you will naturally stop believe <br>in them - 
                              the stories/ego/false identifications. As Nisargadatta puts it - <br>"Truth can 
                              be expressed only by the denial of the false -in action. For <br>this, you must 
                              see the false as false (viveka) and reject it (vairagya). <br>Renunciation of 
                              the false is liberating and energizing. It lays open the <br>road to perfection. 
                              (314)"<br><br>It is also not an intellectual exercise because intellectual 
                              exercise gets <br>you nowhere. The discrimination part simply aids in the 
                              letting go of the <br>not-Self so that what is your True Self can manifest. But 
                              ultimately what <br>you are interested to know is your True Self, the emphasis 
                              is to know the <br>positive truth of your nature, not the 'neti neti' part which 
                              is endless and <br>inconclusive and doesn't resolve the issue (but merely is an 
                              aid to let go <br>of the false - but don't fall into the mistake of endlessly 
                              labeling every <br>experience as not-self and not looking into the nature of 
                              Being which is the <br>main point), but knowing your True Self resolves the 
                              issue because no doubts <br>can arise any more after you experience the 
                              Certainty of Being. So don't <br>mentally look for things to reject, simply look 
                              into what you truly are, <br>but if thoughts arise that says 'I am this or that' 
                              simply let go of them as <br>'neti neti' through the 'discriminative power' you 
                              mentioned and continue <br>your inquiry. Do note that this is meant to be an 
                              'experiential inquiry', it <br>is to look directly in your experience to realize 
                              your true Self itself.<br><br>Here is what Adyashanti said about his 
                              self-inquiry,<br><br>"...this "I" is not what the mind thinks it is. Meditative 
                              self-inquiry <br>allows you to discover for yourself who and what this "I" 
                              really is. I call <br>it "meditative self-inquiry" because it is very 
                              experiential. It is not <br>philosophical. It is not intellectual. Here, 
                              "meditative" means <br>"experiential." Inquiry is only powerful when it is 
                              meditative, when we are <br>looking in a sustained and focused and quiet way 
                              into our own experience."<br><br>This is what Ramana Maharshi taught as well, or 
                              what Master Hsu Yun and <br>others taught as well. It's all the same.<br><br>And 
                              yes, earnestness to know Truth, while not clinging to expectations... <br>this 
                              is an important attitude.<br><br>Regards<br>AEN</p>

                      Adya and Jed McKenna propose 2-step model for enlightenment

                      the 1st step/awakening is very important. After that,<br> &gt; reaching the final 
                      awakening is just a matter of time and inevitable.<br> &gt; It is like after 
                      something is very hard to break, but once you crack a<br> &gt; hole, the task 
                      becomes much easier. That said, 1st step is the most<br> &gt; elusive and there 
                      is no guarantee that would happen regardless of how<br> &gt; much effort is 
                      spent. That is why some teachers even say: "Awakening<br> &gt; is a gift, the 
                      supreme act of grace from the divine."<br> &gt;<br> &gt; I think what you said 
                      about 'recognition'(initial glimpses) and<br> &gt; 'realization'  is equivalent 
                      to the above model. Correct?<br> &gt;<br> &gt;<br> &gt; Regards,<br> &gt;<br> &gt; 
                      J</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hi,<br><br>I am not too sure. It could be that Adyashanti was describing two 
                      distinct <br>realizations. It could also be the recognition/realization 
                      issue.<br><br>By the way... I don't like to call anything 'final awakening'. 
                      Even <br>Adyashanti is only beginning to penetrate the depths of Non-Dual (Stage 
                      4 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's
                       Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a>), <br>IMO, as of the most recent book. Some of his earlier books and 
                      expressions <br>were rather dualistic. And even now the Anatta and Emptiness 
                      part is still <br>not clear. Nevertheless, this is no matter because there are 
                      valuable things <br>to be learnt from no matter what level of insight they have. 
                      I still like to <br>read Eckhart Tolle sometimes even though it is on the I 
                      AM.<br><br>Do watch this short video by Vishrant because it is very important: <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQMhKJ_nPMk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQMhKJ_nPMk</a><br><br>In 
                      this video, Vishrant said, "the teachers that are flying in and out and 
                      <br>telling people they are awake are actually misleading people. The terrible 
                      <br>side of that is when somebody is told they are awake, the ego grasps it and 
                      <br>says, 'I am awake', and then stop seeking, and then these people stop 
                      <br>looking because they think they've already found. So it cuts off their 
                      <br>chances for ongoing awakening. It's very sad."<br><br>Very important 
                      point.<br><br>Also, what he said is true about self-inquiry because self-inquiry 
                      and <br>'turning the light within' only leads to I AM (and in his own words, 
                      only <br>the 'first day in kindergarten'), but what Vishrant is saying is the 
                      way <br>that leads to non-dual realization.<br><br>However, go through 
                      self-inquiry first. Then when your I AM insight matures <br>(via the four 
                      aspects of I AM in the earlier email), gradually progress to <br>non-dual (and 
                      further) insights.<br><br>But no matter, a progression of insights is inevitable 
                      if one is earnest in <br>practice, and of course avoiding early conclusions like 
                      'I am awake', etc.<br><br>Regards<br>AEN</p>

The Self is universal and infinite, but the mind (the part that doesn't know what will happen) is a finite subset and therefore cannot comprehend Totality, and hence this is not contradictory at all. But what you can feel is the connection with the Will of the Universe, 
                                                              that you are one with the workings of Totality and you are the very expression of the Will of the Universe.</p>

There is only Universal Awareness observing and manifesting spontaneously on its own accord, and the so called 'individual' and 'mind' is not an observer or doer: it is merely arising observed perceptions, and an arising perception cannot perceive nor create/control. It is not the case that there is a division between the 'Self doing' and the 'Self observing', since it is equally the Universal Consciousness that is doing (manifesting) and observing and no individual doers or observers can be found.<br><br>You are being lived by One Life,

                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi,</span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Steps are not necessary in self inquiry, because this 
                                  method is meant to cut through all steps, thought-inference-process, 
                                  conceptualizations, to directly awaken to your True Self. This is why Koan and 
                                  Zen is known as the method and school of Sudden or Instantaneous Awakening, not gradual or 
                                  step-by-step awakening. This is the Direct Path.</span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For example,</span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hear a bird chirping.</span></div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">What/who is hearing?</span></div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">(silence)</span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Silence means you aren't trying to answer the question using your mind (because the answer cannot be found there - the more you try to figure out with your mind the more time is wasted because you are looking at the wrong direction), but instead you are directly looking at 'What Hears' and experiencing your True Self, your Hearing-Nature/Pure Awareness. The inner cognizer (I AM) turns within and cognizes itself, it's true nature.<br></span></div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The pure silence underneath the sound is your true nature, 
                                  but it is not an inert nothingness, in fact not even silence as such, but more 
                                  accurately a featureless wide-awake space which perceives all sounds, all 
                                  sights, all thoughts, etc. It cannot be understood by the mind. You have to 
                                  trace the hearing, the radiance, the seeing, to its Source.</span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If you truly and successfully traced all perceptions to its Source, you will realize and experience a Certainty of Being, an undeniability of your very Consciousness which is formless and intangible but at the same time a most solid self-evident fact of your being. </span></div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However if during the process of self-inquiry a thought arise like "could this be it, what is 
                                  Awareness, etc", just ignore the thought, don't attempt to answer them using the 
                                  mind/logic, but continue turning the light around, asking "Who am I" or "Who is 
                                  aware of the thought?" and so on. Turn away from all doubts to the Doubtless Certainty/Undeniability of Being/Consciousness, and all your doubts and questions are resolved in an instant.</span></div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div>As Jason Swason said:</div>
                  <div><strong><em><br></em></strong></div>
                  <div><strong><em>By turning the attention to the mind, immediately there are doubts. More thoughts rush in to question the questions, confirm or contradict other thoughts. A maddening cycle...</em></strong></div>
                  <div><strong><em><br>Notice when thoughts are paused there are no doubts; the certainty of (doubtless)Being is obviously present; the unquestionable FACT of EXISTENCE. Notice that the Being is ALWAYS presently shining, effortlessly and spontaneously. Stay with that undeniable non-conceptual confidence. Your Being has always been present for every single experience. That natural cognition in which all experiences arise is not a person.</em></strong></div>
                  <div><strong><em><br>Be as you ARE and not what you imagine yourself to be.</em></strong><br><br></div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And as Ramana Maharshi 
                                  instructed<em>:</em></span></div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><em></em></span> </div>
                  <div><strong><em>If other thoughts arise, one should, without attempting to 
                                  complete them, enquire, 'To whom did they occur?' What does it matter if ever so 
                                  many thoughts arise? At the very moment that each thought rises, if one 
                                  vigilantly enquires 'To whom did this appear?' it will be known 'To me'. If one 
                                  then enquires 'Who am I?' the mind will turn back to its source and the thought 
                                  that had arisen will also subside. By repeatedly practising in this way, the 
                                  mind will increasingly acquire the power to abide at its source. When the mind, 
                                  which is subtle, is externalised via the brain and the sense organs, names and 
                                  forms, which are material, appear. When it abides in the Heart, names and forms 
                                  disappear. Keeping the mind in the Heart, not allowing it to go out, is called 
                                  'facing the Self' or 'facing inwards'. Allowing it to go out from the Heart is 
                                  termed 'facing outwards' When the mind abides in the Heart in this way, the 'I', 
                                  the root of all thoughts, [vanishes]. Having vanished, the ever-existing Self 
                                  alone will shine. The state where not even the slightest trace of the thought 
                                  'I' remains is alone swarupa [one's real nature]. This alone is called mauna 
                                  [silence]. Being still in this way can alone be called jnana drishti [seeing 
                                  through true knowledge]. Making the mind subside into the Self is 'being still'. 
                                  On the other hand, knowing the thoughts of others, knowing the three times [past 
                                  present and future] and knowing events in distant places - these can never be 
                                  jnana drishti.</em> </strong></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Don't try to comprehend the process intellectually. 
                                  Don't stop at any thought-conclusion, like "to me" (which is simply an inferred 
                                  thought), but trace all thoughts and perceptions to its source by asking "Who am 
                                  I?" to discover your True Self. Spending more time trying to figure out how this 
                                  works in the mind is just going to prevent you from directly realizing and 
                                  experiencing your True Mind. The purpose is to trace the radiance back to the 
                                  source, then abide at the Source as Ramana Maharshi said. This is what I warned 
                                  you earlier (as I know you will have such doubts and questions which I myself 
                                  did earlier on):</span></div>

                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><em>Nevertheless, the method is indeed 
                                  important to give rise to realization. Any method that leads to realization must 
                                  be <strong>direct</strong> - means it must be a means that makes a practitioner 
                                  bypass all the mind's conceptualizations and inference processes which are all 
                                  indirect and secondary (which is not a direct realization and experience of your 
                                  true essence and hence leaves doubts), so that you can touch directly and with 
                                  certainty the essence of your Being without intermediary. <strong>On hindsight 
                                  there was a period when I first started practicing self-inquiry where I was 
                                  still intellectualizing about this, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">like how should I practice self inquiry, 
                                  what does asking 'Before birth Who am I' mean and leads to, etc, which are all 
                                  sidetracks and distractions because it is still using the mind and indirect 
                                  inference and hence not a 'direct' approach to realize the essence of 
                                  Being.</span></strong></em></span></div>

                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><em>There are many things that I can doubt, 
                                  but I cannot doubt my own consciousness in this moment. My consciousness IS, and 
                                  even if I tried to doubt it, it would be my consciousness doubting. I can 
                                  imagine that my senses are being presented with a fake reality – say, a 
                                  completely virtual reality or digital reality, which looks real but is merely a 
                                  series of extremely realist images. But even then, I cannot doubt the 
                                  consciousness that is doing the watching…<br><br>The very undeniability of my 
                                  present awareness, the undeniability of my consciousness, immediately delivers 
                                  to me a certainty of existence in this moment, a certainty of Being in the 
                                  now-ness of this moment. I cannot doubt consciousness and Being in this moment, 
                                  for it is the ground of all knowing, all seeing, all existing…<br><br>Who am I? 
                                  Ask that question over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is it in me that 
                                  is conscious of everything?<br><br>If you think that you know Spirit, or if you 
                                  think you don’t, Spirit is actually that which is thinking both of those 
                                  thoughts. So you can doubt the objects of consciousness, but you can never 
                                  believably doubt the doubter, never really doubt the Witness of the entire 
                                  display. Therefore, rest in the Witness, whether it is thinking that it knows 
                                  God or not, and that witnessing, that undeniable immediacy of now-consciousness, 
                                  is itself God, Spirit, Buddha-mind. The certainty lies in the pure self-felt 
                                  Consciousness to which objects appear, not in the objects themselves. You will 
                                  never, never, never see God, because God is the Seer, not any finite, mortal, 
                                  bounded object that can be seen…<br><br>This pure I AM state is not hard to 
                                  achieve but impossible to escape, because it is ever present and can never 
                                  really be doubted. You can never run from Spirit, because Spirit is the Runner. 
                                  To put it very bluntly, Spirit is not hard to find but impossible to avoid: it 
                                  is that which is looking at this page right now. Can’t you feel That One? Why on 
                                  earth do you keep looking for God when God is actually the Looker?<br><br>Simply 
                                  ask, Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?<br><br>I am aware of my feelings, so I am not 
                                  my feelings – Who am I? I am aware of my thoughts, so I am not my thoughts – Who 
                                  am I? Clouds float by in the sky, thoughts float by in the mind, feelings float 
                                  by in the body – and I am none of those because I can Witness them 
                                  all.<br><br>Moreover, I can doubt that clouds exist, I can doubt that feelings 
                                  exist, I can doubt that objects of thought exist – but I cannot doubt that the 
                                  Witness exists in this moment, because the Witness would still be there to 
                                  witness the doubt.<br><br>I am not objects in nature, not feelings in the body, 
                                  not thoughts in the mind, for I can Witness them all. I am that Witness – a 
                                  vast, spacious, empty, clear, pure, transparent Openness that impartially 
                                  notices all that arises, as a mirror spontaneously reflects all its 
                                  objects…<br><br>You can already feel some of this Great Liberation in that, as 
                                  you rest in the ease of witnessing this moment, you already feel that you are 
                                  free from the suffocating constriction of mere objects, mere feelings, mere 
                                  thoughts – they all come and go, but you are that vast, free, empty, open 
                                  Witness of them all, untouched by their torments and tortures.<br><br>This is 
                                  actually the profound discovery of… the pure divine Self, the formless Witness, 
                                  causal nothingness, the vast Emptiness in which the entire world arises, stays a 
                                  bit, and passes. And you are That. You are not the body, not the ego, not 
                                  nature, not thoughts, not this, not that – you are a vast Emptiness, Freedom, 
                                  Release, and Liberation.<br><br>With this discovery… you are halfway home. You 
                                  have disidentified from any and all finite objects; you rest as infinite 
                                  Consciousness. You are free, open, empty, clear, radiant, released, liberated, 
                                  exalted, drenched in a blissful emptiness that exists prior to space, prior to 
                                  time, prior to tears and terror, prior to pain and mortality and suffering and 
                                  death. You have found the great Unborn, the vast Abyss, the unqualifiable Ground 
                                  of all that is, and all that was, and all that ever shall be.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">But why is that only halfway home? </span>Because as 
                                  you rest in the infinite ease of consciousness, spontaneously aware of all that 
                                  is arising, there will soon enough come the great catastrophe of Freedom and 
                                  Fullness: the Witness itself will disappear entirely, and instead of witnessing 
                                  the sky, you are the sky; instead of touching the earth, you are the earth; 
                                  instead of hearing the thunder, you are the thunder. You and the entire Kosmos 
                                  because One Taste – you can drink the Pacific Ocean in a single gulp, hold Mt. 
                                  Everest in the palm of your hand; supernovas swirl in your heart and the solar 
                                  system replaces your head…<br><br>You are One Taste, the empty mirror that is 
                                  one with any and all objects that arise in its embrace, a mindlessly vast 
                                  translucent expanse: infinite, eternal, radiant beyond release. And you… are… 
                                  That…<br><br>So the primary Cartesian dualism – which is simply the dualism 
                                  between… in here and out there, subject and object, the empty Witness and all 
                                  things witnessed – is finally undone and overcome in nondual One Taste. Once you 
                                  actually and fully contact the Witness, then – and only then – can it be 
                                  transcended into radical Nonduality, and halfway home becomes fully home, here 
                                  in the ever-present wonder of what is…<br><br>And so how do you know that you 
                                  have finally and really overcome the Cartesian dualism? Very simple: if you 
                                  really overcome the Cartesian dualism, then you no longer feel that you are on 
                                  this side of your face looking at the world out there. There is only the world, 
                                  and you are all of that; you actually feel that you are one with everything that 
                                  is arising moment to moment. You are not merely on this side of your face 
                                  looking out there. “In here” and “out there” have become One Taste with a 
                                  shuddering obviousness and certainty so profound it feels like a five-ton rock 
                                  just dropped on your head. It is, shall we say, a feeling hard to 
                                  miss.<br><br>At that point, which is actually your ever-present condition, there 
                                  is no exclusive identity with this particular organism, no constriction of 
                                  consciousness to the head, a constriction that makes it seem that “you” are in 
                                  the head looking at the rest of the world out there; there is no binding of 
                                  attention to the personal bodymind: instead, consciousness is one with all that 
                                  is arising – a vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely Free and infinitely 
                                  Full expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so that every single subject and 
                                  every single object are erotically united in the Great Embrace of One Taste. You 
                                  disappear from merely being behind your eyes, and you become the All, you 
                                  directly and actually feel that your basic identity is everything that is 
                                  arising moment to moment (just as previously you felt that your identity was 
                                  with this finite, partial, separate, mortal coil of flesh you call a body). 
                                  Inside and outside have become One Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like 
                                  that!<br><br>(Source: Boomeritis, Sidebar E: “The Genius Descartes Gets a

              <div><blockquote>
              <p><br>Previously:</p>
              <p>p.s. "If a teacher cannot awaken you in his first meeting with<br>you, this 
              means that either he is not a real teacher, or that you<br>yourself are 
              spiritually immature." by Anadi<br><br>Is very true, however, most of us are 
              'spiritually immature' because<br>'maturity' means many factors like 
              investigation, past insights and<br>experience, deep interest in truth, 
              possibly/probably conditions and factors<br>from past lives... all coming 
              together and makes a student 'ripe for<br>picking' by the master. Seldom do you 
              hear of people who are spontaneously<br>woken up by a teacher upon their first 
              meeting (though it happens), however<br>I have heard of many people who woke up 
              after years of practicing... then,<br>when they are ripe, all the master has to 
              do is to point them out, sometimes<br>just hitting them with their shoes, 
              sometimes hitting them on their head, or<br>just a short pointer, and everything 
              falls into picture. Sometimes if the<br>person is ripe no teacher is even 
              necessary (but he/she would probably have<br>trained for years under a teacher 
              previously) - all it takes is a sound or a<br>sight, pebbles hitting each other, 
              something fell down, bell sounded, a cup<br>broke, or just seeing something... 
              that is how many Zen masters of the past got enlightened. Much like how Thusness 
              got enlightened after hearing the 'Tonggg'. They were ready, and so a Master, or 
              a sound, a sight, is all it takes to wake them<br>up. But what is often not 
              mentioned is that they often have a history of<br>spiritual inquiry and practice 
              and that is why they are 'ripe' at that<br>particular moment.<br><br>Sometimes 
              they are already ripe... but what is lacking is a true teacher to<br>point them 
              out. Often however, we start as beginners, 'unripe'. For<br>example... Someone 
              in my forum by the name of JonLS realized non-duality<br>simply by reading a 
              phrase written by Thusness, 'Manifestation is Source'.<br>Thusness wrote to him 
              because he knew that JonLS is 'ripe', his conditions<br>were there for certain 
              insights to arise, just needed some pointers. All it<br>took was a few posts, a 
              few days of conversation in the forum since they<br>ever knew each other, and it 
              'happened'. My Taiwanese teacher woke up 4 days<br>after meeting my Master (he 
              was already ripe then - and my Master knew he<br>was coming even before he 
              arrived, and said upon his first meeting 'you have<br>finally come!' as if he 
              knew him before - which is true, because they had<br>Master-Student relationship 
              even from past lives and both were abbots and<br>Zen masters of a Zen monastery 
              in Kyoto, Japan in their past lives). For me<br>however, it has been 
              years<br>since I knew Thusness and my dharma teachers and Master but I am only 
              only beginning to scratch the surface.<br>That is the difference.<br><br>BTW, it 
              is often the case that a teacher may be able to lead even beginner<br>students 
              to a spontaneous recognition of their true nature simply by<br>pointing out 
              instructions. However, a deep and lasting realization will not<br>usually come 
              so fast. But the 'recognitions' eventually leads to the<br>'realization'. Again, 
              'recognition' and 'realization' are different<br>as I discussed earlier. As 
              discussed <a rel="nofollow" href="390582?page=2#post_9787387">here</a>, even Ramana Maharshi's first experience at age 16 is a 
              form of 'recognition' arising after a process of inference, but that is still 
              not the direct experience/realization of the Self. That arose afterwards, so we 
              can say that his initial recognition led on to the realization.<br><br>FYI. <a title="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Just flipped to a few random pages in 'I Am That' by Nisargadatta, and found 
              something relevant to what I was discussing earlier, so I'm sharing with 
              you.</p>
              <p>---------------------------</p>
              <div><span><strong>Q:<span>  </span></strong></span><span>Ups and downs in 
              <em>sadhana</em></span><span> are inevitable. Yet the earnest seeker plods on in 
              spite of all. What can the <em>gnani </em></span><span>do for such a 
              seeker?</span></div>
              <div><span><strong>M:<span>  </span></strong></span><span>If the seeker is 
              earnest, the light can be given. The light is for all and always there, but the 
              seekers are few, and among those few, those who are ready are very rare. 
              Ripeness of heart and mind is indispensable.</span></div>
              <div><span><strong>Q:<span>  </span></strong></span><span>Did you get your own 
              realisation through effort or by the grace of your Guru?</span></div>
              <div><span><strong>M:<span>  </span></strong></span><span>His was the teaching 
              and mine was the trust. My confidence in him made me accept his words as true, 
              go deep into them, live them, and that is how I came to realise what I am. The 
              Guru’s person and words made me trust him and my trust made them 
              fruitful.</span></div>
              <div><span><strong>Q:<span>  </span></strong></span><span>But can a Guru give 
              realisation without words, without trust, just like this, without any 
              preparation?</span></div>
              <div><span><strong>M:<span>  </span></strong></span><span>Yes, one can, but 
              where is the taker? You see, I was so attuned to my Guru, so completely trusting 
              him, there was so little of resistance in me, that it all happened easily and 
              quickly. But not everybody is so fortunate. Laziness and restlessness often 
              stand in the way and until they are seen and removed, the progress is slow. All 
              those who have realised on the spot, by mere touch, look or thought have been 
              ripe for it. But such are very few. The majority needs some time for ripening. 
              <em>Sadhana</em></span><span> is accelerated ripening.</span></div>
              <div><span><strong>Q:<span>  </span></strong></span><span>What makes one ripe? 
              What is the ripening factor?</span></div>
              <div><span><strong>M:<span>  </span></strong></span><span>Earnestness of course, 
              one must be really anxious. After all, the realised man is the most earnest man. 
              Whatever he does, he does it completely, without limitations and reservations. 
              Integrity will take you to reality.</span></div>

              <div><strong>Q: </strong>In the beginning we may have to pray and meditate for some time 
              before we are ready for self-inquiry.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>M: </strong>If you believe so, go on. To me, all delay is a waste of time. 
              You can skip all the preparation and go directly for the ultimate search within.

              <div><br></div>
              <div>To know what you are, you must first investigate and know what you are

              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi,</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Steve is describing non-dual. But it is still Brahman 
                          type of non-dual, Stage 4. Meaning he still treats Consciousness as ontological 
                          reality. At Anatta (Stage 5), Consciousness is realized as non-inherent.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Self is another name for Consciousness. Without 
                          Consciousness, body won't be moved, so of course this is true - a body by itself 
                          is inert, inanimate like a log, like a corpse. What you have to understand is 
                          that Consciousness, the Witnessing, isn't denied at the Anatta level. Therefore 
                          start with I AM - the direct realization of luminosity is important. Then refine 
                          the view in terms of non-dual and non-inherency. See my 
                          article <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/11/keep-experience-refine-view.html"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Keep the experience, Refine the

              method is meant to cut through all steps, thought-inference-process, 
              conceptualizations, to directly awaken to your True Self. This is why Koan and 
              Zen is known as the method and school of Sudden Awakening, not gradual or 
              step-by-step awakening. This is the Direct Path.</span></div>

                                There are two kinds of 
                                    bond: one is the bond of seeing dualistically, experiencing in terms of subject 
                                    and object. The other is the bond of seeing inherently, where consciousness and 
                                    objects of consciousness are treated to have inherent existence/essence. Both 
                                    bonds must be removed, but they are separate bonds.<br><br>Seeing, hearing, 
                                    smelling, etc... even thoughts, when realised as not divided into an observer 
                                    and observed, inside and outside, then everything is experienced as the display 
                                    of consciousness. To see everything is consciousness is non-dual insight, but 
                                    there must be further insight into anatta and emptiness to realise the empty 
                                    nature of consciousness. This is the transition from Stage 4 to Stage 5 and 6 of 
                                    <a title="http://thusness/PasserBy%27s%20Seven%20Stages%20of%20Enlightenment

                                    not that manifestation are 'display of THE Consciousness' - there is no 'The 
                                    Consciousness' as Consciousness is empty, in the same way we cannot accurately 
                                    say that 'Clouds and Rain are the display of THE Weather', as 'Weather' as such 
                                    is a convention but utterly without substantiality, essence, and 
                                    location.<br><br>In other words, we may have notions of an all-pervasive 
                                    Awareness, or Self, and experientially it is non-dual and this is a correct 
                                    experience. But it is like the word 'Weather' - you can say everywhere you look 
                                    into the sky, weather is not apart from that, but is there a truly existing 
                                    'Weather' apart from thinking about it? Is it located somewhere, or is it only 
                                    these patterns of weather that dependently originate moment to moment? Similarly 
                                    'Awareness', 'Self' is simply a convention but is ultimately 'empty' - it is 
                                    simply these self-luminous manifestation that dependently originate, it is just 
                                    the stream of aggregates. That is why the Buddha talks about five skandhas 
                                    instead of a One Consciousness, however non-duality (no subject and object) is 
                                    already automatically implied by fully understanding anatta and five aggregates 
                                    or eighteen dhatus. It is not that all five skandhas are just one awareness - 
                                    that is just non-dual insight, but the insight into anatta is to see that the 
                                    'one awareness' cannot be found in or apart from the skandhas and dhatus, that 
                                    there is simply the stream of aggregates. The experience is however still 
                                    non-dual. When we understand that 'Awareness' like 'Weather' isn't something 
                                    inherent, we also free ourselves from notions like 'things happening in 
                                    Awareness' - just like you cannot say 'things happen in Weather' - weather isn't 
                                    a findable essence or container of those phenomena, rather there is just those 
                                    stream of phenomena which are conventionally called 'weather'.<br><br>Next is... 
                                    can there be Consciousness without conditions? In Buddhism, no. In other 
                                    religions, Consciousness is treated as a metaphysical essence, Self, substance, 
                                    an ultimate source of everything that is one with yet transcends all 
                                    manifestation, God, that has inherent existence. But in Buddhism we do not 
                                    understand Consciousness in such ways. We have to factor in dependent 
                                    origination.<br><br>So in other words, those in other religions who experience 
                                    non-duality (subsuming subject and object into undivided One Mind) may claim 
                                    something like "All There Is Is Consciousness", but they disregard conditions. 
                                    They treat Consciousness as something inherent. But in Buddhism, we have to 
                                    factor in causes and conditions. As Thusness commented on my friend <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/06/non-solidity-of-existence.html">Longchen's insight into Emptiness</a> after realisation of 
                                    non-dual,<br><br><em>I can see the synchronization of emptiness view into your 
                                    non-dual experiences --. Integrating view, practice and experience. This is the 
                                    essence of our emptiness nature and right understanding of non-dual experience 
                                    in Buddhism that is different from Advaita Vedanta teaching. This is also the 
                                    understanding of why Everything is the One Reality incorporating causes, 
                                    conditions and luminosity of our Empty nature as One and inseparable. Everything 
                                    as the One Reality should never be understood from a dualistic/inherent 
                                    standpoint.</em><br><br>And as Longchen also wrote, <em>"the conditions and 
                                    factors are also inseparable from the non-dual oneness."</em><br><br>To 
                                    understand the relationship between Dependent Origination and Consciousness one 
                                    must study the Buddha's teachings on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha#cite_ref-67">18 
                                    dhatus</a>, the relation of conditions to the manifestation of consciousness, 
                                    emphasis on anatta and emptiness instead of just emphasizing on discovering 
                                    Brahman, One Consciousness, etc. It is not to deny All is Mind, but it is to 
                                    understand All is Mind "due to" its empty nature and luminous essence, due to 
                                    dependent origination and anatta. It is to see Consciousness not as an ultimate 
                                    source of everything, but as interdependently originated manifestation, as 
                                    Vajrahridaya puts it: <em>there is the concept of the creative matrix in Buddhism 
                                    and this matrix is without limit and is infinite. But it's not an eternal self 
                                    standing infinite. It's an infinitude of mutually dependent finites... or 
                                    "infinite finites" that persist eternally without beginning or end and without a 
                                    source due to mutual, interpersonal causation you could say.</em><br><br>First of 
                                    all Awareness is not like a mirror reflecting the world, but rather Awareness is 
                                    a manifestation. Luminosity is an arising luminous manifestation rather than a 
                                    mirror reflecting. The center here is being replaced with Dependent Origination, 
                                    the experience however is non-dual.<br><br>One must learn how to see Appearances 
                                    as Awareness and all others as conditions. Example, sound is awareness. The 
                                    person, the stick, the bell, hitting, air, ears...are conditions. One should 
                                    learn to see in this way. All problems arise because we cannot experience 
                                    Awareness this way.<br><br><a title="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/06/bodhidharma-on-awareness-and-conditions.html

                                    condition of nose, smells are smelled, With the condition of tongue, tastes are 
                                    tasted, every movement or states are all one's Mind."<br><br>Also, <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/12/dependent-arising-of-consciousness.html">Nagarjuna explains</a>, "When sound and ear assume their right 
                                    relation, A consciousness free of thought occurs. These three are in essence the 
                                    dharmadhatu, free of other characteristics, But they become "hearing" when 
                                    thought of conceptually."<br><br>When consciousness experiences the pure sense 
                                    of “I AM”, overwhelmed by the transcendental thoughtless moment of Beingness, 
                                    consciousness clings to that experience as its purest identity. By doing so, it 
                                    subtly creates a ‘watcher’ and fails to see that the ‘Pure Sense of Existence’ 
                                    is nothing but an aspect of pure consciousness relating to the thought realm. 
                                    This in turn serves as the karmic condition that prevents the experience of pure 
                                    consciousness that arises from other sense-objects. Extending it to the other 
                                    senses, there is hearing without a hearer and seeing without a seer -- the 
                                    experience of Pure Sound-Consciousness is radically different from Pure 
                                    Sight-Consciousness. Sincerely, if we are able to give up ‘I’ and replaces it 
                                    with “Emptiness Nature”, Consciousness is experienced as non-local. No one state 
                                    is purer than the other. All is just One Taste, the manifold of Presence.</div>

                                 important. The shentongpas have a point, they are trying to point out 
                                that you cannot deny the luminous aware nature to prevent over negation 
                                by certain Madhyamika followers. But in that process they reified 
                                luminous awareness into something unchanging. However, true Buddhism, as
                                 Traleg Rinpoche suggested, does not deny 
                                luminous-awareness/Buddha-Nature, but it also understands it's empty 
                                nature (empty of inherent existence).</em><br> <em><br> </em><br> <em>Traleg Rinpoche:</em><em><br> </em><br> <em>Accepting the reality of buddhanature does not mean that one has to 
                                accept the  Shentong interpretation of emptiness. Shentongpas regard the
                                 nature of mind as  empty of defilements but not empty of its intrinsic 
                                nature. The notion of  buddhanature, however, does not in itself imply 
                                that mind has any intrinsic  nature. Many of the great Kagyü and Nyingma
                                 masters, in fact, have interpreted  buddhanature to mean that mind is 
                                empty of both the defilements and any kind of  inherent existence. </em></div>

              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This is actually 'your' experience too. Can you say that a 
                          world exist outside awareness? Isn't that notion a thought only, happening in 
                          awareness? Isn't there simply just thoughts, sensations and perceptions 
                          happening within awareness?</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Actually there is no such thing as 'my experience' or 'your 
                          experience' btw, there is only spontaneous, impersonal arisings of awareness. Furthermore there is no such thing as 'my awareness' or 'your awareness' - Awareness is absolutely impersonal, we (the body-mind) are objects arising from space-like impersonal/universal Awareness, in the same way that tables and chairs are appearing out of Awareness but Awareness does not belong to the tables and chairs. And there is absolutely no difference as far as Awareness is concerned (just like there can be no difference as far as space is concerned)... just 
                          investigate and you'll see how simple this is. Nothing changes as far as experiences are concerned - so do not treat enlightenment as an experience to be 'had'. Rather, you simply realize your true identity as (always been) Awareness, and that all experiences are arising and subsiding in Awareness, all along...<br></span></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">No. What you have done is that you get stuck and 
                                                        identified with a subtle mental state or experience, in this case an experience 
                                                        of blankness. Don't stop here. You are now progressing from total identification 
                                                        with mind and concepts to identification with a state of blankness. So you are 
                                                        progressing beyond the mind, but this is still not 'it', it is still another 
                                                        experience, so do not get stuck. This state of blankness is well known and many 
                                                        masters have warned us against getting stuck in such a state. However, do not 
                                                        seek for a conceptual answer - if the mind becomes blank and no answers come 
                                                        up, know that this is still much better than clinging to a conceptual answer - do not try to make up your 'no answer' with a 
                                                        conceptual answer - if you don't know through direct experience, keeping a 'don't know' attitude is much better as that means you are open to continue <em>exploring</em> your direct experience, rather than clinging to a mental conclusion/speculation that blocks direct realization. Yes, there is an answer to your Koan, but the answer cannot 
                                                        be found in the mind. The answer is found through an immediate, intuitive 
                                                        Realization, it cannot be fabricated.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If you experience the blankness, ask yourself, "Who is aware of 
                                                        that blankness?" What you are looking for is not an experience or state (whether 
                                                        blankness or somethingness), but what you are investigating is 'What is Aware of 
                                                        those states and experiences', whether the states be blank, something, or what 
                                                        not. To have an experience of blankness or somethingness, there must be a 
                                                        Witnessing, an Awareness of that experience. You are that ever-present 
                                                        Awareness. So What is Aware? Don't think - but <em>look, investigate,</em> until you touch 
                                                        your Being so directly that a non-conceptual certainty arises. All certainty and 
                                                        doubtlessness comes from immediate non-conceptual directness (direct 
                                                        experience), all doubts and questions come from conceptual thinking and 
                                                        inference. By doing this inquiry, you are turning the light around even from the 
                                                        <em>experience</em> of blankness, to the <em>Source</em> of the experience of 
                                                        blankness. Underneath the comings and goings of thoughts and blankness, there is 
                                                        a constant shining Presence-Awareness that allows these experiences to arise, and 
                                                        That is what you are.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Looking back, right before the Certainty of Being arose, 
                                                        thoughts gradually died down until only a state of blankness prevailed. But 
                                                        there is still a sense of dullness or unclarity in this state. This is just one 
                                                        step away from realization, because if you are unable to let the thoughts 'die 
                                                        down', it is very difficult to look non-conceptually. But a blank state is still 
                                                        not it. But anyway, at that point, while I was in that blank state, I turned 
                                                        around and look at Who am I? Even in that blank state, I am undeniably Present 
                                                        and Aware, to <em>know/see</em> that blank state. I cannot deny my sense of 
                                                        existence. So What is This? What am I? What is Aware? It all happened very 
                                                        quickly through this inquiry and though by writing this made it sound like a 
                                                        narrative or inferential/conceptual process, the process of inquiry was 
                                                        actually much more direct and intuitive than narrative and inferential... 
                                                        through this direct inquiry/direct <em>looking</em>, a sudden noticing and

                                                        Yun cautioned; "in our meditation if we lose sight of the hua tou, while 
                                                        dwelling in stillness, there results an indistinct void ness where-in there is

                                                        never contract while undergoing our training. This is the unrecordable dead 
                                                        emptiness." On another occasion he said; "awareness without contemplation will 
                                                        lead to confusion and instability, and contemplation without awareness will

                                                        state where there is little activity of mind - no thoughts. It is a state where 
                                                        cognition is lost or diminished and the meditator has entered a trance. It is 
                                                        important that a highly focused state of mind be maintained at all times. This 
                                                        is the mind that dwells on and in the hua tou it is a union with that which is

                                                        implies a movement. Movement is energy. So, I call it 'pure

                                                        It ever expresses as that living, vibrant sense of presence, which translates 
                                                        through the mind as the thought 'I am'. The primary thought 'I am' is not the 
                                                        reality. It is the closest the mind or thought can ever get to reality, for 
                                                        reality to the mind is inconceivable. It is no thing. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Without the thought 'I am', is it stillness? Is it silence? Or is 
                                                        there a vibrancy about it, a livingness, a self-shining-ness? All these 
                                                        expressions are mental concepts or pointers towards it, but the bottom line is 
                                                        that you know that you are. You cannot negate that knowing that you are. It is 
                                                        not a dead, empty, silent stillness. It is not about keeping the mind silent, 
                                                        but seeing that what is prior to the mind is the very livingness itself. It is 
                                                        very subtle.</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Self-Inquiry will lead to a Realization, a sudden, 
                                                        intuitive, unshakeable 'Eureka!'-like Realization of You/Who You Are. It is not 
                                                        simply an experience of Awareness, but the Realization of YOU, your true 
                                                        identity, as that Awareness. It is a non-conceptual realization, certainty, of 
                                                        your very Being. I had lots of glimpses, experiences and recognitions of Awareness prior to 
                                                        the Certainty of Being that I wrote, but the experience is different from the 
                                                        Realization. Resting as Awareness is important prior and after the Realization 
                                                        of Awareness (and the Realization will also make you understand the importance 
                                                        of natural resting in the non-conceptual certainty of your Being rather than 
                                                        chasing after thoughts), but the Realization part is very important as well. 
                                                        Otherwise, why would Adyashanti teach self-inquiry apart from 'resting as 
                                                        Awareness'?</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">What you must understand is this: Resting as Awareness 
                                                        is important, because you need to rest the mind's conceptualizations in order to 
                                                        directly <em>touch </em>the essence of Awareness. However that 'resting of 
                                                        conceptualization' <strong>should not prevent you from 
                                                        investigating/self-inquiring in a non-conceptual way. </strong>It is actually not contradictory. But if you simply stop defining and conceptualizing and neglect the investigation part, you will never know Who You Are. You have to 
                                                        directly and intuitively experience that non-conceptual certainty of I AM. And 
                                                        this is what I have been trying to tell you.</span></div>

                                                        on a difficult math question, I noticed my mind was intensively processing the

              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">All these are conceptual thoughts arising in the mind. 
                                                        There is no problem using the mind to solve practical daily problems. That is 
                                                        what the mind is good at, and it is a necessary tool for us to function 
                                                        intelligently as human beings in the world (though 'intelligence' has a far 
                                                        deeper depth than the conceptual realm which is merely a tiny figment of it). 
                                                        There is no need to reject or deny thoughts in daily lives as they are part of 
                                                        the natural functioning of Intelligence/Awareness/Life. There is no point making 
                                                        ourselves into zombies or animals. Just make sure you don't get so caught up in 
                                                        the mind until you lose direct-intuitive recognition of Reality into the 
                                                        believing/attaching to the fictional stories of the conceptual mind as 
                                                        facts/reality.* By believing in them as reality, you are perpetuating the 
                                                        stories of a fictional self and fictional world/objects. In other words, don't 
                                                        give transient thoughts more solidity/reality than they are: as transient 
                                                        dream-like phenomena arising and dissolving instantly in infinite Awareness, 
                                                        leaving no traces. It is like a ball, if you throw it into space, it has no 
                                                        place to stay/abide/latch on to, and it just falls back as soon as it goes 
                                                        up. The space in this analogy is referring to your space-like Awareness, the 
                                                        ball is referring to your thoughts. In this way, thoughts that do arise don't 
                                                        leave traces, they just come and go naturally according to circumstances but 
                                                        there is no latching on to them. You are like a non-stick pan of Awareness 
                                                        itself.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However if you use the mind in the same way as you use 
                                                        the mind to solve maths at solving 'Who am I', it will never work. Why? Because 
                                                        you are using the wrong tool. The mind is the right tool for practical, daily 
                                                        lives situations, but the wrong tool at solving spiritual inquiries and koans. 
                                                        Yes, sure, even thoughts are manifestation of Awareness, but the problem is that 
                                                        we will never realize that if we are lost in and continue engaging in conceptual

                                                        separation, doubts, problems and confusion. If a sense and concept of self and 
                                                        separation arise (out of habit and conditioning), question and investigate that 
                                                        assumption of a 'self' and let those concepts dissolve into the clear light of 
                                                        Awareness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Non-conceptual Awareness is different from conceptual 
                                                        thinking as it only knows Itself by Being itself in a clear, direct, and 
                                                        non-dual way without intermediary. It allows no doubts and confusion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From direct seeing, thoughts are almost like waves 
                                                        appearing in vast ocean, it is seen as insubstantial arisings in infinite

              <div><br><br><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Qn: I think for unenlightened people, the 
                                                        problem is their awareness is "too close" to the mind/thoughts so that they 
                                                        can't differentiate them and notice the existence of the awareness. Is this a 
                                                        correct description?</span></em></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">No I do not see it this way. Awareness is simply 
                                                        Awareness, there is no question of Awareness being closer or more distant to 
                                                        thoughts. Thoughts come and go in Awareness, but Awareness remains as it is. But 
                                                        as thoughts cannot arise without/apart from Awareness in just the same way that 
                                                        the hearing of sounds cannot arise without/apart from Awareness or the seeing of 
                                                        a mountain cannot arise without/apart from Awareness, and hence they cannot be 
                                                        said to be 'distant' from Awareness as well - rather, thoughts are the very 
                                                        self-manifestation of Awareness. As all thoughts are made of Awareness, 
                                                        they have 0 distance from Awareness as well. In a piece of mirror the images in 
                                                        the mirror appear to have depths and distance, but in actuality they are all 
                                                        equally happening in and as the mirror itself - there is absolutely no 
                                                        'distance', everywhere you touch in the mirror is the 'flat' mirror itself 
                                                        expressing as those apparent forms and 'distance'.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Awareness is a fact/truth of Reality and the essence of 
                                                        your Being that is always so and is not an object of ownership - it is the same 
                                                        for every person, and the question of 'unenlightened' and 'enlightened' person 
                                                        is moot and irrelevant here. You are not a person, You are Awareness, but 
                                                        Awareness cannot be termed 'unenlightened' or 'enlightened' - it just IS and 
                                                        remains the same for every single Buddha or sentient being. It will remain the 
                                                        same whether you are so called 'enlightened' or not - it will remain the same 
                                                        from 10 years old to 80 years old, the same formless Presence of Awareness that 
                                                        looks through your eyes still remains and feels the same even though your body 
                                                        and mind has undergone many gradual transformations. Awareness is simply a Timeless, 
                                                        Ageless Truth of your Being. And anyway 'Your' Awareness and 'Buddha's' 
                                                        Awareness is not in any way different, and even the conceptual divide 
                                                        into 'yours' and 'buddha's' is simply more conceptual nonsense. There is only 
                                                        Awareness, One without Second, just like Space cannot be divided into 'your 
                                                        space' and 'my space' - there is only One Space from which everything 
                                                        manifests.</span></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">What happens however, is that most people are so fixated 
                                                        and caught up in their thoughts and feelings, that they never even notice the 
                                                        Reality, the existence of Awareness. It is like you are so caught up in a cloud 
                                                        that you lose sight of the whole sky. Or in the mirror analogy, you are so 
                                                        engrossed in a particular reflection that you have mistaken to be 'objectively 
                                                        existing' or an object of identity ('me'/'mine') that you lose sight of the fact 
                                                        that the appearance is simply a reflection of an all-encompassing mirror-like 
                                                        Awareness. Actually the sky or mirror is always here - just overlooked. Most 
                                                        people's identities and understandings are entirely limited to their thoughts 
                                                        and feelings. They do not even know anything other than that. Yet all it takes 
                                                        is a bit of looking to realize what they have missed all along, the truth of 
                                                        their own nature which is always shining right here, right now.</span></div>

                                                        for Buddhahood. By their very seeking they lose it, for that is using the Buddha

              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi,</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It depends what you mean by "Mind", which sometimes 
                              means Awareness, or sometimes means thoughts, depending on context. Mind 
                              (defined here as thinking) is a reflection of Awareness, just as all phenomena 
                              are the reflection/manifestation of Awareness. The mind does not cognize 
                              Awareness.  </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">First of all, the mind is an 
                              arising perception, a cognition, and being a transient perception that comes and goes from the field of awareness, it cannot possibly be 
                              a perceiver. How can a perception perceive it's perceiver? How can the table you 
                              see in front of you perceive Awareness? Awareness perceives the table. You are 
                              Awareness, the perceiver of mind, not the other way round. </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Secondly, as mentioned earlier, mind has no power of cognition - 
                              I.e. the thought 'I see apple' has no power to be aware of apple. The seeing of 
                              apple precedes mind. Awareness precedes mind.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Awareness cognizes the mind. Awareness cognizes ItSelf 
                              through and as the body-mind in the miracle we call Life - even the mind is part 
                              of the field of awareness. Everything is the manifestation of Awareness. There 
                              is no such thing as an unheard sound, unseen sight, uncognized thought, etc. All 
                              phenomena are consciousness, cognition, and all cognitions are only Awareness - 
                              there is no such thing as an un-awared cognition, or cognition that exists independently of Awareness. So in finality, there 
                              is Awareness only, in experience. Whatever you see, hear, smell, is also 
                              Awareness only. So my previous statement 'You are Awareness, the perceiver of 
                              mind, not the other way round.' is not the final realization, since it implies 
                              a perceiver and perceived, but in reality Awareness is non-dual. It is an 
                              integrated, undivided reality that is utterly indistinguishable in terms of 
                              subject and objects. At this point, there is no question of 'something' being aware of 'something else', since there is only Oneness.<br></span></div>

                          as a tool when solving a math problem?</p>

                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi,</span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Seeing depends on awareness/aliveness. Hearing depends 
                          on awareness/aliveness. Thinking depends on awareness/aliveness. They are all 
                          the manifestation of Awareness. They are all the natural functioning of 
                          awareness. The mind is a tool just as the ear or the eyes are a tool to help us function in life. They are all part of the natural functioning.<br></span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The only problem with thoughts is when we believe and identify with and 
                          attach to a story of a separate self, and this causes all other kinds of 
                          problems/sufferings. Otherwise thoughts are just like any other kinds of 
                          phenomena (like sights and sounds), arising naturally according to circumstances, and then subsiding 
                          without leaving traces (attachments).</span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Know that no thoughts actually make you lose awareness. 
                          Thoughts cannot exist outside or apart from awareness. Awareness only becomes 
                          apparently obscured when you believe/become hypnotized in dualistic thoughts and 
                          lose intuitive awareness, direct experience/recognition of non-dual reality. In 
                          actuality it is ever-present as your self-shining nature, never lost (even in 
                          the midst of thoughts). Thoughts come and go, but your true nature of Awareness 
                          is abiding. Let thoughts come and go of it's own accord, don't grasp, don't 
                          reject.</span></div>

                                <p>I meant you said mind can't do perceiving. But you 
                                also said when 
                                a person tries to solve a math problem, all the work is done by the mind
                                 because 
                                the mind is the best/right tool for this. Solving a math problem 
                                requires 
                                connecting the dots together and figure out the solution. This means the
                                 mind 
                                needs to connecting the thoughts together. Does this mean the mind is 
                                aware of 
                                the thoughts?</p>

                                <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You must understand I am using the term 'mind' and 
                                'thoughts' interchangeably (some others may use the terms differently - I.e. 
                                Mind is Buddha-Nature). Since mind = thoughts, how can 'mind' be 'aware' of 
                                'thoughts' as if they are two things? Mind is simply a 'label' to the 
                                functioning we call 'thinking'. And this functioning depends/manifests through 
                                Awareness.</span></div>
                                <div> </div>
                                <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You must also understand that thoughts arise without a 
                                thinker. There is no agent behind thoughts. Things arise spontaneously on their 
                                own accord, there is no such thing as an entity called 'mind' behind the arising 
                                of thoughts. The mind IS the thoughts, the thinking process only. They all 
                                happen spontaneously without a doer/thinker.</span></div>

                                                            then again both are two separate manifestations. The intention is also a spontaneous arising, not an agent or self. You will discover that the 'I' 
                                                            cannot be located at all, that all that is happening is universal functioning - 
                                                            non-personal, spontaneous functioning of Awareness. </span></div>
                                <div> </div>
                                <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">That is why I said the identification with a separate 
                                                            'I' or a subject-object division is always an after-thought of an actual act or 
                                                            experience. During that action or experience, it is just non-personal, 
                                                            spontaneous function, but later on the mind identifies with it by referencing to 
                                                            a central 'I' entity that is doing them or experiencing them, I.e. 'I did', 'I see', 'I 
                                                            hear', 'I smell'. But upon closer investigation this central and separate entity 
                                                            simply cannot be found. There is no 'I' that persisted from just now till now. 
                                                            There is simply ownerless actions and experiences arising and subsiding moment 
                                                            to moment until right now, with no consistent self or agent behind their 
                                                            functioning.</span></div>
                                <div> </div>
                                <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If you look at your thought and see that all thoughts of 
                                                            'me' are referencing to a non-existent entity, much less energy will be invested 
                                                            in the mind stories. You simply see that it is not true. You do not believe in 
                                                            dualistic and separate-self stories.</span></div>
                                <div> </div>
                                <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Suddenly, thoughts become integrated with the field of 
                                                            objects, like anything else - totally impersonal happenings. When you first 
                                                            noticed this, it may seem funny because it is so different from the way we 
                                                            normally perceive our experience and thoughts in a dualistic way. All thoughts 
                                                            and experiences are happening on its own in spite of you, or rather, without a you (as a 
                                                            personal self/doer), and yet not apart from You (as Awareness). There is no 
                                                            sense of thought as 'mine' in contrast with the environment as 'not mine'. 
                                                            Thoughts are part of the environment, so to speak. And being the case, these 
                                                            thoughts no longer serve as a cause of your fears and anxieties and sufferings. 
                                                            You clearly see thought as it is: simply being a thought as an ownerless object, 
                                                            not a 'me/mine' subject or object.</span></div>
                                <div> </div>
                                <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Realizing Awareness is a step towards total 
                                                            non-identification with a personal agent/self. </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It 
                                                            frees the mind from identification to realize the freedom of spontaneity. That 
                                                            is the 'influence' of realization.</span></div>
                                <div> </div>
                                <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Now you clearly see that actions have no influence from 
                                                            a pseudo subject or agent which is non-existent. A separate controller/doer/thinker/experiencer simply cannot be found. But surely, actions must have 
                                                            their influence. They always have, they can't just appear for no reason. What is 
                                                            the influence? </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">They are influenced by intentions and 
                                                            imprints. This has always been the case whether before or after 
                                                            realization. </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I believe I told you this in an e-mail very long ago regarding free will and Dharma Dan's reply. But anyway, any 
                                                            influence on the spontaneity that are happening are also part of the 
                                                            spontaneity. There is nothing outside spontaneity. Awareness is spontaneously 
                                                            manifesting... as this sound, this sight, this thought.</span></div>
                                <div> </div>
                                <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">But to finally answer your question: you can't 
                                                            say Awareness is an influence: because only phenomena (like events, imprints, 
                                                            intentions, friends [e.g. peer pressure], etc etc) can be an influence to your 
                                                            actions or experiences, but Awareness is not a particular experience or 
                                                            phenomena but simply a non-interfering substance/ground of all 
                                                            phenomena/experience. It is simply the basis for which experience can arise 
                                                            (whether before or after realization): how can phenomena arise without 
                                                            perceiving-awareness? </span></div>

                                <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Or you can ask, does the mirror (Awareness itself) 
                                                            influence or interfere with its reflections? The answer is no. The Mirror simply 
                                                            <em>reflects </em>all phenomena as it is, without judging it as a good or bad, 
                                                            without altering its contents.</span></div>

                                is aware 
                                of this process. A thought is like a distinct entity out there and its

                                <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And Nathan Gill puts it:</span></div>

                                appearing'? They aren't created, they spontaneously emerged due to the meeting

                                <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I highly recommend reading the article I just posted to my 
                                blog which I (and Thusness) think is superb, <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/06/magical-illusion-of-self.html">The Magical Illusion of Self</a></span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Read the analogy on the sound and the drum and the eye 
                                consciousness. Then read the whole article... it really clarifies a lot. You'll 
                                understand how phenomena including vision, sounds, and thoughts, spontaneously 
                                emerge without origin ('out of nowhere' so to speak), but arises in dependence 
                                with factors and conditions. You'll see how there is no 'I' or 'me' 
                                involved.</span></p>

                                                                  determinism. You can do something about it. Nothing is fated or fixed. For

                                                                  as opposed to someone who laze around and gets nothing done in life, for example. So obviously <strong><em>something</em></strong> can be done to change the future. But the action that is 
                                                                  arising is done without a doer.</span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So:</span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Action arises, just no doer.</span></div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Sound is heard, just no hearer.</span></div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">etc etc...</span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Everything: actions, experiences, etc continue to arise 
                                                                  without a personal doer. As I explained earlier, the ego or personal doer does 
                                                                  not even exist and hence has no power to influence your life, actions and

                                                                  non-existent). Yet, actions and experiences still arises to get something 
                                                                  done.</span></div>

                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I don't see any contradictions at all. We always think that to act, to do something (to change the future), implies a controller/doer. <strong>This is just an assumption, not a fact. The only fact is that action arose. To reference that action to a doer is simply an after-thought, an assumption.</strong><br></span></div>
                  <div> </div>
                  <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Changing the future is possible, nothing is pre-determined. But contrary to what people think - i.e. 'I, the controller, am going to control and change the future by doing this and this', in actual fact, it is more like, the thought of wanting to change the future happened, then the subsequent actions to 'change the future' followed. None of these thoughts or actions are actually produced by a personal doer or controller. They simply arose spontaneously. Is hard work necessary for success? Absolutely. Is there a doer behind the hard work? No.<br></span></div>

              <p>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>Not to talk too much about me, just focus on ur experience.</p>
              <p>Also what you said about the no observer can be quite misleading.  It does not mean there is 'no one doing anything' and 'everything is arising spontaneously'. You should understand anatta from below quotations taken <span style="font-family: arial;">from 'The Sun My Heart' by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sunshine and Green Leaves</span></p>
              <p>"When we say I know the wind is blowing, we don't think that there is something blowing something else. "Wind' goes with 'blowing'. If there is no blowing, there is no wind. It is the same with knowing. Mind is the knower; the knower is mind. We are talking about knowing in relation to the wind. 'To know' is to know something. Knowing is inseparable from the wind. Wind and knowing are one. We can say, 'Wind,' and that is enough. The presence of wind indicates the presence of knowing, and the presence of the action of blowing'."</p>
              <p style="FONT-FAMILY: arial">"..The most universal verb is the verb 'to be'': I am, you are, the mountain is, a river is. The verb 'to be' does not express the dynamic living state of the universe. To express that we must say 'become.' These two verbs can also be used as nouns: 'being", "becoming". But being what? Becoming what? 'Becoming' means 'evolving ceaselessly', and is as universal as the verb "to be." It is not possible to express the "being" of a phenomenon and its "becoming" as if the two were independent. In the case of wind, blowing is the being and the becoming...."</p>
              <p style="FONT-FAMILY: arial">"In any phenomena, whether psychological, physiological, or physical, there is dynamic movement, life. We can say that this movement, this life, is the universal manifestation, the most commonly recognized action of knowing. We must not regard 'knowing' as something from the outside which comes to breathe life into the universe. It is the life of the universe itself. The dance and the dancer are one."</p>
