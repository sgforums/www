              <p>Sounds arising, vivid, clear, luminous, empty, without self/hearer. Sight/vision arising... vivid, clear, luminous, empty, without self/seer.</p>
              <p>Don't just keep thinking about the future... the truth is already shining Right Now... what are you waiting for.</p>
              <p>Don't think enlightenment is distant, because I can assure you, it is not. From my experience and the experience of countless others.... even though there is no 'my' or 'others', just experiencing.</p>

              <p>When I was still 16 around 4 years ago, I asked Thusness, is paying attention to details the same as awareness? For example, is paying attention to what the teacher is saying... the same as awareness? And how do I know if I am 'merely sensing' (like Vipassana) or am I simply focusing?</p>
              <p>His reply was 'clarity and luminosity is a measurement', 'the degree of clarity and luminosity will tell you' and '(in the) complete abeyance of self, you will experience luminosity, everything becomes a flow of clarity, it is non-dual, without object and subject, without self'.</p>
              <p>And yes, indeed, attention is not the same as luminosity. Attention is simply a mental phenomena... a particular focus on the details and contents of an experience. It is the focusing on a particular phenomena... for example the sound of teacher speaking. Attention works by focusing on a particular phenomena to the exclusion of other phenomena. Attention itself IS a mental phenomenon.</p>
              <p>However, attention can be mistaken to be a part of a self... in other words, we may have the notion that attention is being controlled by the self... that there is a self directing attention from one object to another.</p>
              <p>But if we look, we see that there is simply that mental phenomenon of attention. In every experience... this is it. Whether or not you are paying attention to me, this is it. There is just this phenomenon arising... be it an 'unfocused' experience or a 'focused' experience... there is only that experience arising without an experiencer or controller.</p>
              <p>There is attending, there is focusing (or not-focusing and not-attending)... there is no attender.</p>
              <p>There is no 'me' 'attending to' 'object'... just as there is no 'me' 'hearing' 'sound'... there is just THIS experience, whatever it is, be it with attention or not... That phenomenon of attending-object is also part of the flow of experience spontaneously arising without an agent... Attention is not tied to a subject, object of attention is not tied to an external object, there is just a seamless stream of mental and physical activities happening without a self.</p>
              <p><strong>Enlightenment is not any particular state of attention or experience, but an insight into the nature of all experiences. </strong>And after these insights, it doesn't mean you become very alert every moment in the sense that you attend to all the details and notice what others are telling you and so on. Luminosity and attention are different things... there can be vivid luminosity without engagement in the contents/details of the arising, which requires thought-focus/attention. If I am attending a class, I can definitely still lose focus or tune out totally sometimes (oh and I never was good in concentrating to a speaker, and my primary school teacher used to tell me to go seek medical help for attention deficit disorder though I didn't... lol). The fact remains however that there is just that phenomenon arising without a controller or experiencer.</p>
              <p>And that phenomenon... be it an unfocused or focused phenomenon... is a luminous arising. Luminosity does not depend on attention or focus, so do not make it contrived... luminosity is effortless, ever-present, never lost... for luminosity is the essence of ALL arisings... in whatever forms it takes... in the mental phenomenon of attention... or in the engagement of thoughts... or in sounds... or sight... or whatever. In seeing, just shapes and forms... In hearing, just the da-da-da of the keyboard... just appearances alone is the luminosity. Luminosity is the effortless and spontaneous flow of manifestation happening without a director or perceiver. Hearing does not require focused attention, it just happens... seeing does not require focused attention, it just happens… focused-attention does not require or have an attender, it just happens. But whatever IS, IS luminosity.</p>
              <p>It does not depend on whether you are paying attention to something particular.. or listening to the contents of what someone else is saying... or whatever ways the mental phenomenon of attention is taking shape. Sounds spontaneously arise without hearer (it does not take effort or focus to hear the airplane - it just happens), sights spontaneously arise without seer (it does not take effort or focus for scenery to be seen - it just happens), thoughts spontaneously arise without thinker (it does not take effort or focus for thoughts to arise - it just happens), that alone is luminosity. Focusing and interpreting what another person is saying, is just one kind of mental phenomenon.</p>
              <p>When this is seen, 'efforting' due to grasping onto an agent/controller/perceiver shifts into effortless seeing - and in the seeing there is simply effortless spontaneous manifestation. There is no "me" trying to "do something" to get into a special "state". As Toni Packer used to say,</p>
              <p><em>[An airplane is flying overhead.] The sound of a plane! Both the thought/word plane, and, maybe, a mental image of it are right here - aren't they? There is no one doing any attending. Just the sound, the image! [silence] But you were asking, "Isn't the attention turning toward something?" Is it? Let's look and listen! [silence] Can't discern any turning, can you? There is no need for awareness to turn anywhere. It's here! Everything is here in awareness! When there is a waking up from fantasy, there is no one who does it. Awareness and the sound of a plane are here with no one in the middle trying to "do" them or bring them together. They are here together! The only thing that keeps things (and people) apart is the "me"-circuit with its separative thinking. When that is quiet, divisions do not exist.</em></p>

              <p>All experiences, even the most beautiful NDNCDIMOP (non-dual, non-conceptual, direct, immediate mode of perception) are more experiences that arises and subsides.</p>
              <p>Which isn't a problem... In fact I am not suggesting transcendence of experience to reach something that doesn't arise and subside. The notion of an Awareness that doesn't arise and subside has been seen through... now it is seen that Awareness is precisely the arising and subsiding, even though each luminous arising is timeless and without coming and going (sounds confusing but isn't so in direct experience).</p>
              <p>I am also not suggesting you to detach from such experiences... let them
                                                                       come, let the bliss and clarity come and go (which they will, it is the
                                                                       nature of all experiences to arise and subside), and 'who' is there to detach from experience anyway? No one! Only experiences without experiencer.</p>
              <p>What I am suggesting however... is that grasping on any experiences, even what appears 'ultimate' like the NDNCDIMOP is going to result in suffering. Why? Because the nature of all experiences is that they arise and subside instantaneously. They are ungraspable and empty and as such they are unsatisfactory. The nature of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and non-self marks every single experience/dharma, even those that appears 'ultimate'. But actually there is no 'ultimate experience'.</p>
              <p>Ordinary perceptions, ordinary seeing, hearing, smelling, are all marked by these characteristics. Each experience arises without an observer or experiencer or agent, they are simply as they are... scenery sees, noise hears.... and they arise and subside simultaneously leaving no traces. By the way... non-dual is the nature of all experience, it is not that 
                                                              there is a Presence non-dual with arisings... but rather there is only 
                                                              arising, and each arising does not have a separate perceiver and hence 
                                                              each perception as it is is free from duality. Just hearing, seeing, 
                                                              touching, thinking, etc is Truth. Truth is found in the most ordinary experiences and perceptions... to chase after some better experience is to overlook what is present right in front of... well... experience. If we fail to see that This ordinary arising is already the non-dual actuality, then we'll forever chase after some future experience that never exists. Actuality is... just hearing, just seeing, just smelling, just touching, just tasting, just thinking, everything happening as it is is already non-dual, complete, self-luminous, without self, impermanent, ungraspable, empty.</p>
              <p>Seeing that everything arises and subsides by nature... we no longer form views of self and world as having any sort of inherency. We no longer perceive a world consisting of things located in fixed places. What we call 'places' are really more perceptions that arise and subside... there is nothing truly 'there'. What we call 'there' is not truly a 'there' but is more arisings that subside as soon as it manifest. Likewise what we call 'self', 'here', anything that implies 'location' and so on are also in actuality nothing inherent - only perceptions arising and subsiding.</p>
              <p><strong>Everything thought to be inherent (world, locations, self, body, mind, etc) is upon investigation not a solid 'thing' but simply an Arising... and as an Arising, its cessation follows</strong><strong>. Existence/inherency, Non-existence/nihilism does not apply to reality.</strong></p>

              <p>There is really just sensations and perceptions arising and subsiding each moment... its arising is the manifestation of undeniable Presence... its immediate subsidence proves there is no solid substance to anything perceived.

              <p>No... can't say so. Just starting to see the arising and subsiding of things more clearly... this breaks the perception of solidity. It's deconstructing what we feel to be solid to be more arisings... as I just updated:</p>

              <p>Dwelling at <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>... Then <a id="kaccayana" name="kaccayana">Ven. Kaccayana Gotta</a> approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to 
              one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Lord, '<a id="right-view" name="right-view">Right view</a>, right view,' it is said. To what extent is there right view?"</p>
              <p>"By &amp; large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by (takes as its 
              object) a polarity, that of existence &amp; non-existence. But when one 
              sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right 
              discernment, 'non-existence' with reference to the world does not occur 
              to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with 
              right discernment, 'existence' with reference to the world does not 
              occur to one.</p>
              <p>"By &amp; large, Kaccayana, this world is in bondage to attachments, 
              clingings (sustenances), &amp; biases. But one such as this does not get
               involved with or cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of 
              awareness, biases, or obsessions; nor is he resolved on 'my self.' He 
              has no uncertainty or doubt that just stress, when arising, is arising; 
              stress, when passing away, is passing away. In this, his knowledge is 
              independent of others. It's to this extent, Kaccayana, that there is 
              right view.</p>
              <p>"'Everything exists': <a id="extremes2" name="extremes2">That is one</a> extreme. 'Everything doesn't exist': That is a second extreme. Avoiding
               these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle: 
              From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. From 
              fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness. From 
              consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form. From 
              name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the <a id="media6" name="media6">six sense</a> media. From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.
               From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a 
              requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition
               comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite 
              condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes 
              birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging &amp; death, 
              sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. Such 
              is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.</p>
              <p>"Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very 
              ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of 
              fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of
               consciousness comes the cessation of name-&amp;-form. From the 
              cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.
               From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of 
              contact. From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling. 
              From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving. From the 
              cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From 
              the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. 
              From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the 
              cessation of birth, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, 
              distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire 
              mass of stress &amp; suffering."</p>

              <p>Great questions btw... Yes indeed, without a self or agent, there is no escape from karmic tendencies and arisings (no sinking back into a 'great void' to escape from manifestation)... rather it is just seen that karmic tendencies is what affects our every moment of action, thinking, behavior and experiential reality.</p>
              <p>I have seen that after all those insights... the tendencies continue in a very similar way. My personality and behavior and habits continue to manifest in a very similar way. Even feelings and emotions continue to manifest in quite a similar way... However perhaps what is different now is that there is not so much of self-referencing... that is what has fallen away because the insight is that there is simply phenomena arising and subsiding, hearing, seeing, thinking (which is really just sound, sights, thoughts, etc) arising and subsiding without a self (that said it doesn't mean self contraction stops arising... but even then they arise it can be seen as simply more sensations and dropped). Other than that... tendencies continue to arise and affect every moment of experience and it takes practice to let go of some of these manifesting tendencies. Experiences, hearing, seeing, thinking, etc... all happen *exactly the same way as before*... just this ordinary experiential reality is truth... only that now, ordinary experiences are no longer seen with delusion - i.e. seen as made out of objects happening 'at a distance out there' to a subject/self... or seen as 'me', 'mine', or happening to an experiencing/controlling agent.</p>
              <p>Can I stop an arising thought from arising?  No, whatever arises does so due to conditions. There is no thinker or controller or agent behind an arising... an arising arises spontaneously due to interdependent origination... the entire universe interacting and manifesting in this moment of experience.</p>
              <p>Can I stop an arising thought from subsiding? No, whatever subsides also does so due to conditions (or the lack thereof). Due to the lack of insight into 'no agent', we may think that there is a thinker or controller that can create or stop a thought... but thought arises and subsides without an agent, thought arises and subsides due to dependent origination.</p>
              <p>Can a moment of thought not affect the next moment of thought? A moment of thought doesn't 'touch' or 'cause' another moment of thought... each thought is a complete, whole, unconditioned reality of itself. And yet each thought does inevitably serve as a supporting condition for another manifestation (of thought, action, etc)...</p>
              <p>Our entire experiential reality is really only sensations, sights, sounds, and so on... popping in and out according to dependent origination. There is no perceiver or even a thing called 'awareness' apart from these arising and subsiding...</p>

              <p>Like watching TV flashing out Buddha Amitabha image, the eyes and the Budda are perfect harmonious peace. However, if there is an anti-glare filter stick on the TV screen, it becomes "dreamy", and the state of dreamy depends on the colour and thickness of that anti-glare filter. In spite of the dreamy state, the pureness of Buddha Amitabha image on the TV and eyes are not tainted a slightest.</p>

              <p><br>I see it otherwise.  :-)</p>
              <p>Be it "dreamy" or "pureness" both are appearances,  nothing ultimate.  The truth of 'empty nature' of appearances however is ultimate.  In Buddhism, there is no ultimate reality, only ultimate truth.</p>

                  <p>We often think that the difference between dream and waking life is that dream consists of insubstantial everchanging images without solidity. And yet, waking life consists of interaction with 'real life objects' that exists inherently and is real.</p>
                  <p>But insight tells us that there is no such 'real solidity' out there even in waking life... it is really just this flow of arising and subsiding phenomena... there is nothing solid at all. Like a dream, like an illusion, like bubbles, and shadows.... like dewdrops and lightning flash. Only just this arising and subsiding, arising and popping out according to conditions.</p>
