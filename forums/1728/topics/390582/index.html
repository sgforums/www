              <p> </p>
              <p>Thusness told me to write down. So I'll just note down some of my meditation experience yesterday.</p>
              <p>I was doing self inquiry, 'Who am I', 'Before Birth Who am I'... with an intense desire to know the truth of my being. As the thoughts subside, an intense and palpable sense of beingness and presence, the only 'thing' that remains that I feel to be my innermost essence... became very obvious... very very vivid and intense, and feels like a constant background in which everything is taking place, thoughts (almost none at that moment, but arise afterwards) that arise are also taking place in this unchanging background... and there is this certainty and doubtlessness about this I AM-ness, IT is absolutely real and undeniable. IT/I AMness/The Witness is the only solid and undoubtable Presence and is clearly present with or without thoughts. I remembered briefly thinking after having experienced that, "So this is it! This is enlightenment!" and "No, not enlightenment", but its funny how these thoughts are just passing thoughts like wind, occuring in this solid constant undoubtable sense of presence. Inconsequential and illusory doubts and concepts is arising within undoubtable presence... passes away as soon as it arises because there is no more identification with the mind/ego. After all, I am just this Reality, this background of awareness that is ever-present and watching, I'm not any of those thoughts that come and go. The part that thinks 'I am enlightened' or 'I am not enlightened', that is not what I am and can never be 'enlightened' and thus totally irrelevant, while what I am, is always already completely clear and perfect beyond doubt, already perfectly 'awake'/'aware'. I just found a quote by Nisargadatta Maharaj that puts it so well: "<span style="color: #800080;">This 
                                                                  reality is so concrete, so actual, so much more tangible than mind and 
                                                                  matter, that compared to it even diamond is soft like butter. This 
                                                                  overwhelming actuality makes the world dreamlike, misty, irrelevant.</span>"</p>
              <p>Just a pure sense of existence and beingness. An unmoving context, like a screen in which the entire display of life is shown in. This background of presence and awareness is formless, behind, and prior to all thoughts and forms. Feels most vivid when there is no engagement in thoughts, no thoughts, just BEING it. Though, thoughts that arise didn't affect the background sense of presence. Presence remains unmoved, unaffected, undeniably present. It may be apparently obscured when the attention goes all out at thoughts and feelings, such that we are so totally identified with them that we think that they are the entirety of our being. That is why we need to self-inquire seriously, not taking any concepts to be truth, but unrelentlessly inquire into the depths of our being without any conceptual perception until we feel with confidence this solid, thoughtless being and presence is the undeniable, unmoving essence of being. It reveals itself easily if we let go of our thoughts in meditation, like a jewel at the bottom of the lake reveals itself if the surface is calm.</p>
              <p>Thusness commented I should experience the impersonality aspect (note: not anatta, but the impersonally aspect of AMness), and also realise that it is the 'non-conceptual, direct' that gives the 'certainty', the undoubtedness. This is what makes the experience of I AM different from ordinary dualistic experience, which has intermediary, is dualistic, and secondary. No direct-ness. And... the depth and intensity of experience can still be improved. He said that if I pursue the experience then non-conceptuality becomes a hindrance and I will suffer because I cannot overcome the arising thoughts, which I fully agree because the next thing after meditation, frustration started happening for me, when theres an attempt to 'get back' to the experience and don't know how. Yet, all attempts are secondary, like trying to rest the mind in awareness when awareness has always been at rest, trying to stop mind movement when Awareness has always been the still point of the turning world.  He also told me deeply inquire on the old philosophical question about whether a tree in the forest would make a sound if no one were there to hear it. It will lead to nondual experience. If I were to go through the motion, I will not realise it. It must be the sort of experience I have with I AMness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>note... this is not enlightenment in Buddhism... in fact far from the realisation of anatta and emptiness. Closer to Hinduism in fact. (though the conviction of luminosity essence is also important in Buddhism) See <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's
                           Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a> for more info. I am merely noting some of the experiences I have, I'm just a learner and practitioner.</p>
              <p>With regards to the above experience, Thusness also said that this is the Rigpa, the luminous presence, the light... it is just (a matter of having) the right understanding of this with the right view.</p>

              <div class="content"><em>Observe yourself this very moment... Is there 
              any desire, however subtle, towards a new sensation? A good feeling?<br><br>Why
               are you reading this article? Are you anticipating what I am going to 
              say next? Are you hoping for moments of clarity, of peace, good 
              feelings?<br><br>Do you want to know the amazing nature of your self? Do

              for everything? Do you want to be relieved of your unhappiness and be 
              completely happy? <br>- Then there is only one thing that you 'need':<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Stop wanting and wishing for that good 
              feeling that you believe to be somewhere around the next corner. Just 
              be... </span><br><br>You dan 'do' this <span style="font-weight: bold;">right
               now</span> as you are reading this, or rather: you can let go of that 
              subtle doing, that subtle searching, Right Now... Just relax and notice 
              awareness..........................................<br>.....................................<br>.....................................<br><br>Do
               you see? There is a peaceful seeing that is there without your effort. 
              It is not dependent on the 'you' you think you are, it's not dependent 
              in any way on the doer or what is done, it's just naturally there as the
               soul of all that is. <br><br>If you only relax your need for being 
              satisfied through sensations and good feelings and notice that you are 
              naturally aware, you have discovered who you are.<br><br>You are that 
              formless, indestructible seeing, that perfect awareness, that is here 
              whether you are aware of it or not, as the background of all of life's 
              happenings. It's the changeless essence of all changing experiences and 
              it does not need any sort of feeling or sensation in order to be. It's 
              free from any need.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You
               have just had a taste of your true nature. It's as simple as that: </span><br><br>1)
               Notice that you are subtly urging towards relief, and that you are 
              hoping to find that relief in a sensation, an experience. <br><br>2) 
              Then, seeing this, let it be, leave it alone however it wants, just be 
              there. <br><br>3) Then just notice that you are aware without any effort
               and that even as thoughts arise, you are still effortless awareness. 
              You cannot change the fact that you are aware.<br><br>So just rest as 
              you are, free from believing in the subconscious need for relief through
               sensation, and realize that the only true relief you will ever find 
              that is accessible at all times, is your natural presence... <br><br>So 
              instead of you chasing mindlessly after people, places and things under 
              the belief that the sensations that come from associating with them will
               relieve that discontent that drives your constant wheel of desires, 
              simply notice the background of that desire in which the desire is known
               to even exist: Awareness.<br><br>Just be. Stop chasing after relief and
               notice that you <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> relief. 
              Then stay with this peaceful seeing, or repeat the letting go/be and 
              noticing awareness part. Then again just maintain the attention thats 
              aware of awareness and take delight in awareness alone, non-distracted 
              for that moment by anything, only enjoying your own nature, your 
              presence.<br><br>Just commit to seeing the peace that is already present
               and repeat that recognition until it is your second nature.<br><br>Your
               first nature is Awareness - Being - which you are already. Now make <span style="font-style: italic;">'being aware of your first nature'</span> your second nature; through a firm commitment and repetition of this 
              recognition.<br><br>Abide in the recognition of Awareness<br><br>Love,<br>Bentinho.</em></div>

              <p>Who am I?</p>
              <p>Doubt (stop following) every single thought until only the undoubtable, vivid, non-conceptual self-knowing Presence and Beingness remains. It is free from all conceptual construct, separation and attributes. Understand that no concepts and thoughts are an accurate representation of reality, self, or the world. Absolutely no thought is the (absolute) truth. Naked Self-Knowing Presence is the only source of true certainty, all thoughts are doubtable and disposable, like a dream that when we wake up we realise to be simply projections and imaginations.</p>
              <p>You are non-dual self-knowing Awareness. Without even using thoughts, you can't deny that sense of existence that You Are. That which knows/is certain of I AM is I AM itself.</p>
              <p><em>That which is sure of its existence – the innermost<br>certainty of I Am – is what you essentially are. In<br>other words: I Am this knowing that knows that I Am.</em> - Leo Hartong</p>

              <p>Being is not an experience to gain nor can it be lost. Don't ride on a bull searching for the bull. IT is the undeniable unmoving substratum and light in which experiences and forms are manifested, perceived and illuminated, but in itself, is formless. No conceptual understanding of this is necessary or even possible, nor can there be a 'someone' who understands (which would imply a separate person and the existence of duality). No thought is an accurate representation of reality, and there is absolutely no separation, no separate person, doer, perceiver, etc. Only I (Presence) can be awake to mySelf because I AM Awakeness. I AM Self-Knowing Presence.</p>

              <p><em>Imagine watching a movie in which two men walk toward<br>you. The setting is a desert. The sun is blazing overhead, and<br>a huge mountain range is visible in the distance.<br>One of the men stops and says to his companion, ‘Do you realize</em></p>
              <p><em>that this is all an illusion and we are just variations in one</em></p>
              <p><em>single light appearing as us, the sun, the sky, and the whole<br>landscape?’ His friend looks puzzled as he continues. ‘ This<br>whole world we see is a flat screen, though it appears as if there<br>is space all around us.’<br>Now his friend gets slightly worried. He thinks perhaps his<br>buddy has been affected by the heat, so he asks, ‘Are you feeling<br>all right?’<br>‘Absolutely fine! It is just suddenly obvious that all this is really<br>nothing but a very clever illusion appearing on a single<br>background.’<br>‘Really,’ says his friend getting slightly annoyed. ‘Please show<br>me this background.’<br>‘Well look, here it is; right here touching us, carrying us. It<br>contains everything we see.’ He turns and points to the screen.<br>His friend follows his finger, but sees nothing but the far off<br>mountains.</em></p>

              <p>I had a discussion with Thusness where I told him about my experience where the sense of self dissolved into an impersonal space, where Awareness becomes separated from the sense of self and becomes/IS the space in which everything arises, and I cannot say that Awareness is mine anymore than it is the door's or anything's. Somehow it is like nondual experience as the sense of self dissolved, yet I do not think it is exactly non-dual since it is not an experience of no subject-object division with everything, but it becomes clearer how Awareness/Presence is confused with individuality where in fact it is not the same.</p>
              <p>He replied that it is not non-duality but more related to the aspect of impersonality of I AMness. However it is not the 'impersonality' he is speaking of, but the beginning of it. He also told me I was able to recognise that and the term 'impersonality' came when I experienced it because he had told me before, otherwise I will not be able to discern it correctly.</p>
              <p>He also told me that the sense of self/personality/individuality is another 'mental construct' that prevents me from refining the experience of 'I AMness'. Similarly, when I experienced the "I AM", the 'non-dual' aspect isn't present, as I still experience the world as divided (in terms of subject and object). Furthermore, when one experienced "non dual", it does not necessarily mean one also experiences the "no coming and going". It is not automatic.</p>
              <p>Only through maturing one's experience that one realizes the relationship between mental constructs and the experience/realisation I have. And that these mental constructs when "inherently" held, blinds us. A predictable relationship exists.</p>

              <p>You may think "I still don't know who I am".</p>
              <p>But then, your 
                  true self is the only thing you can ever know. You think you know all 
                  the things in the world but not yourself, whereas in reality, your own 
                  Mind is the only thing you can ever truly know. But this is not a form of mental knowledge. It is a form of certainty coming from a source prior to thinking.</p>
              <p>What is the 
                  only thing that is undeniably present even without thought?</p>
              <p>And 
                  even when there is thoughts?</p>
              <p>What is it that is independent of 
                  mental analysis or projections?</p>
              <p>Anything that depends on mental 
                  analysis is simply more after thoughts, commentaries and analysis, and 
                  there is no certainty in thoughts. Thoughts change every moment but 
                  mental knowledge of something is not the same as the unrefutable present
                   reality itself. You can believe in your thoughts, but there will not be
                   true certainty. You can always doubt your thoughts, but even without 
                  thoughts, what is undoubtedly present?</p>
              <p>What is always present 
                  undeniably, is there whether you think you know it, or think you don't 
                  know it, or whether you are not thinking at all?</p>
              <p>So how can you 
                  say you don't know your true nature, and in the first place is it 
                  possible for the mind to intellectually understand what it is? (since 
                  this reality is prior to thinking)</p>
              <p>It just IS, just look. It's
                   undeniable. You feel certain. You feel that all you are ever certain 
                  of, is this presence, beingness, awareness. You feel you never truly 
                  know of anything other than this. All else is just thoughts, which are 
                  doubtable mental positions. There is no true certainty in mental 
                  knowledge.</p>
              <p>Certainty lies in directness, without even a thought, 
                  without even a concept, without intemediary, without anything secondary.
                   Just ISness.</p>
              <p>The sense 'I AM' as pure presence and beingness even
                   without a word, is undeniably present. The afterthought 'I am this and 
                  that' are doubtable positions and imaginations.</p>
              <p>The sensation of a
                   sight, a sound, even without a word, is undeniably present. The thought
                   'oh, that must be a flower, oh that is ...' are doubtable positions and
                   imaginations.</p>

              <p>While I was meditating, suddenly there were sounds of thunder and the sound of rain pouring was very loud... a spontaneous inquiry started on "Who is listening to the sounds". As a result of this inquiry I noticed that Awareness doesn't seem like a localized witness, but it is more like a field of knowing which is impersonal and universal. And I am this universal consciousness, and everything emerges and subsides from this field of awareness. Literally everything manifests from IT.</p>
              <p>The answer to "Who Listens" or "Who Perceives" is this impersonal non-localized space-like field of awareness, not a dead physical space but an all-encompassing space with an intrinsically aware essence, the non-localized Witness which actually is universal. Consciousness is simultaneously nowhere, everywhere, and also here and now. I notice that the sense of self dissolves just by resting in awareness, where previously there was a sense of self and locality tied to awareness... a sense that there is a Witness 'in here' watching things out there. Now, it is more like I am this universal consciousness perceiving/manifesting everything, whether it is thoughts, sounds, visual objects... all popping in and out in this non-localized all-pervasive awareness. Consciousness is totally not related to me as an individual or person (and in fact an individual person as such doesn't truly exist and is only really thoughts and sensations arising in this field of awareness, nothing substantial), and whatever we consider as 'me, the individual' is too cognized by and manifested from this universal non-personal consciousness, like dust appearing in space. There are no individual experiencers of life, only individuals experienced by the Universal Life.</p>
              <p>If there is no locality to Awareness (i.e. over here in contrast to over there), but is all-pervasive and encompassing, then nothing exists outside of consciousness, but rather everything is an appearance of, and perceived by, this field of consciousness. I also noticed that no matter how the mind appears to move, it is still an appearance of unmoving consciousness, like the fast-moving scenes in an action movie are still images displayed on an unmoving screen (i.e. consciousness).</p>
              <p>Thusness also discussed with me on this, told me to focus on this impersonal and universal aspect of consciousness just described by me, refine the four aspects of I AMness*, then experience non-dual.</p>

              eventually the question is "who am I?" and "what am I?"  Who/what am I 
              really...apart from stories.  Realize the Self, and the mirage/stories 
              cease to be problematic and cease to cause suffering.  Then it does not 
              matter what thoughts or feelings or sensations there may be.
              <br> <br> Just being present and aware is not enough.</span></p>

              <p>TravisE: Indeed! Without having plumbed the question "What am I?", or "Who am I?"
               we begin our being present and aware from an off-center place.  Our 
              footing is illusory and we miss the mark every time.  The thing which 
              brings us home from our dreaming journey is this very "I" itself, 
              looking to that.  Once that is tasted consciously to the point that the 
              lie of being the life dissolves we can then be present and aware just as
               we always were.</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>While I was meditating, suddenly there were sounds of thunder
                              and the sound of rain pouring was very loud... a spontaneous
                              inquiry started on "Who is listening to the sounds". As a result of
                              this inquiry I noticed that Awareness doesn't seem like a localized
                              witness, but it is more like a field of knowing which is impersonal
                              and universal. And I am this universal consciousness, and
                              everything emerges and subsides from this field of awareness.
                              Literally everything manifests from IT.</p>
              <p>The answer to "Who Listens" or "Who Perceives" is this
                              impersonal non-localized space-like field of awareness, not a dead
                              physical space but an all-encompassing space with an intrinsically
                              aware essence, the non-localized Witness which actually is
                              universal. Consciousness is simultaneously nowhere, everywhere, and
                              also here and now. I notice that the sense of self dissolves just
                              by resting in awareness, where previously there was a sense of self
                              and locality tied to awareness... a sense that there is a Witness
                              'in here' watching things out there. Now, it is more like I am this
                              universal consciousness perceiving/manifesting everything, whether
                              it is thoughts, sounds, visual objects... all popping in and out in
                              this non-localized all-pervasive awareness. Consciousness is
                              totally not related to me as an individual or person (and in fact
                              an individual person as such doesn't truly exist and is only really
                              thoughts and sensations arising in this field of awareness, nothing
                              substantial), and whatever we consider as 'me, the individual' is
                              too cognized by and manifested from this universal non-personal
                              consciousness, like dust appearing in space. There are no
                              individual experiencers of life, only individuals experienced by
                              the Universal Life.</p>
              <p>If there is no locality to Awareness (i.e. over here in contrast
                              to over there), but is all-pervasive and encompassing, then nothing
                              exists outside of consciousness, but rather everything is an
                              appearance of, and perceived by, this field of consciousness. I
                              also noticed that no matter how the mind appears to move, it is
                              still an appearance of unmoving consciousness, like the fast-moving
                              scenes in an action movie are still images displayed on an unmoving
                              screen (i.e. consciousness).</p>
              <p>Thusness also discussed with me on this, told me to focus on
                              this impersonal and universal aspect of consciousness just
                              described by me, refine the four aspects of I AMness*, then
                              experience non-dual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*(from an old post about the 4 aspects)</p>
              <p><em>Thusness told me that at present try not to talk too much
                              about non-dual (to someone else in another forum) and he also
                              talked to me about the deepening of the "I AM" in 4 aspects: 1) the
                              aspect of impersonality, 2) the aspect of the degree of luminosity,
                              3) the aspect of dissolving the need to re-confirm and abide in I
                              AMness and understanding why such a need is irrelevant, 4) the
                              aspect of experiencing effortlessness.<br> <br> Impersonality will help dissolve the sense of self but it has the
                              danger of making one attached to a metaphysical essence. It makes a
                              practitioner feel "God".</em> <em><br> <br> The degree of luminosity refers to feeling with entire being, feel
                              wholely and directly without thoughts. Feeling 'realness' of
                              whatever one encounters, the tree bark, the sand, etc. (see the
                              next post)</em> <em><br> <br> Dissolving the need to re-confirm is important as whatever is done
                              is an attempt to distant itself from itself, if there is no way one
                              can distant from the "I AM", the attempt to abide in it is itself
                              an illusion.</em> <em><br> <br> On the other hand, abiding in presence is a form of meditative
                              practice, like chanting, and leads to absorption. It can result in
                              the oceanic experience. But once one focuses on the 4 aspects
                              mentioned above, one will have that experience too.</em> <em><br> </em></p>

                              own demise. Not that there is really anything present to be eradicated.
                              But the looking shows that what was assumed as present is not actually
                              present. That is the so-called "death" of the ego. It is a euphemism.
                              It is really the cancellation of what was never there in the first
                              place. This is generally misunderstood. People get worked up about
                              overcoming the ego, losing the ego, etc. That is all imaginary. This is
                              more like looking under the bed and seeing the bogey man you thought
                              existed is not present. It is an understanding or seeing, not a process
                              in time. However, it is not merely an intellectual understanding.
                              Intellectually understanding that the bogey man is not real is not the
                              same as knowing through direct cognition the actual truth of the
                              situation. That is why intellectual understanding about who we are has
                              little power to cancel the illusion (the assumed identity). Very often,
                              such knowledge just becomes another adornment for the false ego
                              perspective and strengthens the assumed identity. Just like the map is
                              not the terrain, intellectual concepts of reality are not the
                              non-conceptual reality itself. This reality, your natural state, is not
                              a limited person or separate individual.</td>

              <p class="bodyRegular">The "story" is only relevant for the seeming
                              individual. The belief in the individual is what causes us to seek
                              within the story for a resolve for the unsatisfied "me". The story is
                              not the problem! It is the "me" who thinks it is being defined by it.
                              People tend to deal with effects, such as presumed stories,
                              conditioning, karma, environment, body/mind functioning, etc. These
                              never were the actual root of the problem.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.naturalstate.us/images/extras/diamond.gif" alt="" width="14" height="13"></p>
              <p class="bodyRegular">The problem is not phenomenal. It does not exist
                              in the appearances at all. It is the metaphysical assumption at the
                              basis of the appearance. That is why you cannot find a solution in
                              appearances. This predicament is traditionally called the endless loop
                              of suffering. It is a loop with no exit at its own level. But diving to
                              the root of the wheel, which is the separate "I" notion or the concept
                              that there is someone present having the limiting experience, is the
                              way out. Why? Because the root of the problem is found to be not real,
                              only assumed.</p>

              <p class="bodyRegular">The "I" concept, as a thought generated by the
                              mind, does not create appearances per se. But it is the root of the
                              conceptual overlay that seemingly divides what is given. The "I"
                              notion is the erroneous or fictitious idea of an isolated, separate
                              entity. But that is not really present. Without belief in that notion,
                              there are appearances, but they are not conceptually divided or
                              divorced from the given reality.</p>

              <p class="bodyRegular">To know any experience, there must be a knowing
                              that "I am". That is just the basic conscious knowing of being present.
                              That is what first appears out of deep sleep. It is not a personal "I"
                              or any other notion. Call it impersonal knowing. Subsequently, the mind
                              begins operating and the separate "I" notion is created in thought.</p>

              <p class="bodyRegular">Pure awareness, or non-conceptual reality, is
                              non-dual. Upon or within this arises self-consciousness, which is the
                              pure sense of "I am", but not yet individualized. Then follows the "I"
                              concept, or the notion of separate individuality. Lastly, there
                              appear notions such as I am this or that (body, mind, personality,
                              etc.). </p>

              <p class="bodyRegular">Without the belief in the "I" and simply being
                              what you are here and now, there are no problems, no seeking, no
                              suffering, no doubts, no issues, no development, no deepening, etc.
                              Why? Because the innate reality has none of those things.</p>

              <p class="bodyRegular">From the perspective of reality, there is NO
                              appearance to speak of, because the seeming appearance is the
                              appearance of THAT. It is all THAT.</p>

              <p class="bodyRegular">You know Santa Claus is not real by
                              investigation. You never found him and there is nothing to find. End of
                              the story. The "I" entity is the same. Looking for it and finding its 
                              absence
                              is the end of the story.</p>

              <p class="bodyRegular">The point is to see what is what, to
                              see what you really are as well as the falsity of the concept of
                              limited
                              individuality. There is no personal reference point
                              "doing" any of this, just like there is no "I" seeing through your eyes
                              right now, only seeing. Seeing, understanding or recognizing is not
                              done
                              by an entity. Yet seeing is happening. There never has been a person or
                              limited reference point. The point sometimes made that investigating
                              the "I" notion would only reinforce it is totally unfounded and
                              erroneous.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.naturalstate.us/images/extras/diamond.gif" alt="" width="14" height="13"></p>
              <p class="bodyRegular">All phenomena appear in consciousness. That
                              consciousness is NOT personal. It is the primordial or first experience
                              in duality. It is the pure sense of "I am" with no other content, just
                              knowing "I am" without words, or being self-consciously aware. But that 
                              is still an
                              experience. You are the space in which even that comes and goes.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.naturalstate.us/images/extras/diamond.gif" alt="" width="14" height="13"></p>
              <p class="bodyRegular">Speaking of subsequent experiences "after
                              realization" is already a concession that one is moving off target.
                              There is no "after realization". That implies that even after seeing the
                              basic truth of non-duality (all there is is that), that time,
                              individuality and duality continue. Needless to say, that is still 
                              viewing things within a dualistic perspective. </p>

              <p>Some notes on mind and identification:</p>
              <p>If there is any 
                                                  fears, suffering, doubts, worries, 
                                                  discontent, etc... or simply an incessant stream of thinking beyond your
                                                   control... it means there is still some kind of misidentification - 
                                                  i.e. identifying yourself with the mind, body, who you think you are, 
                                                  your stories. The habit of false identification to 'pull us back to 
                                                  samsara' is hard to avoid and has a momentum on its own unless we take our stand as presence-awareness. The apparent 
                                                  'loss of presence' is not an actual loss of presence (presence is 
                                                  always there and can never be lost), but rather the habit of mind to 
                                                  fixate and misidentify with the conceptual mind and stories, thus losing
                                                   vivid sight of non-conceptual naked awareness.</p>
              <p>But actually 
                                                  you are not your mind, and just to realise 
                                                  this there is immense liberation. It is because when you exclusively 
                                                  identify with your mind and its stories.. when one identifies purely 
                                                  with the conceptual.. one invests belief in the thoughts and one will be
                                                   compelled to react to and chase after every single thought that arise, 
                                                  whether they are happy or sad stories, identifying with all thoughts in a
                                                   personal manner.</p>
              <p>But if we go beyond pure conceptual view and simply directly 
                                                  SEE... we see that really these mind movements are only impersonal 
                                                  happenings spontaneously arising and perceived in consciousness. When we
                                                   go beyond purely identifying with the conceptual mind/false self, 
                                                  beyond the notion of individuality and all its stories, there is no 
                                                  basis for the fears, suffering, etc. You see that the notion of being an
                                                   individual self is purely conceptual and never was real or present to 
                                                  begin 
                                                  with. You see that what you are this non-conceptual reality without 
                                                  limitations. The belief in a conceptual identity is dropped, along with 
                                                  all the suffering, fears, unhappiness, etc. The key lies in discovering one's identity as the timeless non-conceptual presence-awareness.</p>
              <p>If we truly see a 
                                                  thought as just an impersonal 
                                                  transient arising in awareness rather than identifying with it or 
                                                  getting lost in the conceptual content, then 
                                                  they can be left as they are, seen for what it is, but not being reacted
                                                   to. Awareness is like a non-stick pan, the thoughts that appear are not
                                                   being identified with, and so they lose the power to 'chain up' into 
                                                  further stories. In other words, they just dissolve on its own accord. 
                                                  Being rooted in the non-conceptual clarity, conceptual thoughts and 
                                                  stories that
                                                   appear are not being taken with absolute seriousness. One will find 
                                                  oneself increasingly simply resting in non-conceptual naked perception 
                                                  of Awareness. One will know a much vaster realm of knowing, 
                                                  intelligence, clarity, bliss, joy, peace.</p>
              <p>All suffering have their origins in a root sense of being an 
                                                  individual person, a 'me' that owns or is its mind, stories, its body, 
                                                  its history, etc. Investigate who you are, remove the core false 
                                                  assumptions 
                                                  we have of our being. You are not the mind, the mind are transient waves
                                                   appearing in non-conceptual, oceanic awareness. Rather than fully 
                                                  fixated on thoughts... release your fixation and identifications by recognizing the 
                                                  non-conceptual wide-open
                                                   space of awareness in which thought appears in. Rather than being 
                                                  identified with one of the waves separate from all else... have your 
                                                  stand as your true identity, infinite-being-awareness, beyond the realm 
                                                  of conceptual, and be free. (and you are still free to use your mind as a
                                                   tool without being binded by it)</p>
              <p>In a way it is like lucid dreaming: you can still dream/think, yet you won't fear because of the dream image of a tiger as you know the dream self and the dream tiger are not absolutely real but are just illusory projections manifesting in one's consciousness. Rather than being lost in one's stories, if you realise we are not the dream self and dream content but the Awareness in which all that appears, we can be lucid and aware in the thinking and playfully 'manipulate' the objects of the 'dream' without suffering and being absolutely lost in the stories.</p>

Rather than fully fixated on thoughts... release your fixation and identifications by recognizing the non-conceptual wide-open space of awareness in which thought appears in. Rather than being identified with one of the waves separate from all else... have your stand as your true identity, infinite-being-awareness, beyond the realm of conceptual, and be free. (and you are still free to use your mind as a tool without being binded by it)</p>
              <p>In a way it is like lucid dreaming: you can still dream/think, yet you won't fear because of the dream image of a tiger as you know the dream self and the dream tiger are not absolutely real but are just illusory projections manifesting in one's consciousness.</p>

              <p>I'm saying this, because I feel that people who cannot achieve all the requirements of such teachings could end up even more lost than before they started, impacting their personal relationships.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Rainbow Jigsaw of Life,</p>
              <p>I think it is ok for AEN to share his views cos there may be people who may find confirmation/leads and then can go further... such discusssions may be fruitful. There is also the potential for confusion, dun know, depends on mindset of person. But potential for confusion always exists in all teachings.</p>
              <p>This kind of practice is most catered for people who have family, work etc... because it is pared down to the bare essentials of Buddhism... awareness. of course, i would always have to add that one shd have a emphasis on compassion/bodhichitta too...</p>
              <p>the whole thing about nature of mind and rigpa is quite straightforward n simple.  We shouldn't get lost in the forest of jargon n descriptions.  If the person actually sits then sooner or later the forest of complication doesn't seem complicated and it becomes easier to relate to.</p>
              <p>Best have a teacher!</p>
              <p>Maybe you can be more specific on where a person might not be able to handle...talking in general is difficult.</p>

              <p>the good thing about this forum is it has sharings that is suitable for all Buddhists from all walks of life.</p>
              <p>what AEN has shared here will appear cohesive and will help to put meaning into experiences which, otherwise, one may not be able to understand.</p>
              <p>to one who does not have any experience, these sharings may appear confusing or meaningless so one may naturally just leave them alone.</p>
              <p>there are actually many other sharings that also help one to build up compassion, sharings that help one to start off meditation, sharings that help one stay grounded in our everyday lives.</p>
              <p>my experience is not enough nor am i eloquent enough to write down my experiences accurately so i chose to share articles instead, with the intention to help whoever can relate to them. it is also in gratitude to some of the writings other forummers have contributed that make my journey meaningful.</p>
              <p>the information available is massive. Buddha has taught us not to just take teachings by reading, whats more important is to practice and taste the teachings for ourselves.</p>

              <p>First of all, I don't think this practice can ever harm relationships. It can however enhance relationships. Why? Because if there is no Presence when relating to others, you are relating to them through your own stories, you are not really meeting that other person. That is not a true relationship, it is a relationship with your thoughts. Without Presence, you also easily get into bad relationships, because the mind is very unstable, sometimes it gets emotional, etc, and when one is totally identified with one's stories and emotions, the actions that follow are without much wisdom. That is why having Presence in relationships is very important, and in fact in every area of one's life.</p>
              <p>At a deeper level... when have your stand in Presence... 
                      you start see the others as Presence Awareness in their essence too. 
                      That means you go beyond forms and see their essence, and you feel there is no 'other'. It is hard to 
                      describe, it can only be intuitively felt.</p>
              <p>If we live our lives without awareness, our lives will be lived in a very inefficient way because most of our attention and energies are wasted on needless sufferings, worries, incessant thinking, etc. We do not divert our energies in the right way. If we have our stand in Presence-Awareness, wisdom spontaneously flows in reaction to whatever circumstances requires us to act in life, without the filters of the egoic mind (likes, dislikes, worries, etc etc).</p>
              <p>As I see it, the practice actually enhances and improves the way we live, which is why it is very important. If this were something not practical in life, I don't think it will serve a lot of purpose.</p>
              <p>BTW currently all the enlightened persons I know personally (have met, talked with, etc) are lay men. I don't have much contacts with monks now since my Master (who is a monk) passed away when I was much younger. But it also shows that lay men can just as possibly get enlightened as monks.</p>
              <p>btw, I recommend getting Eckhart Tolle's book 'The Power of Now' on this as it has many practical advices, and is one of the more transformative and inspiring books I have read. Eckhart Tolle's books are bestsellers, very popular (one of the most popular spiritual books in bookstores currently I believe), becoming some kind of spiritual classic... and with its reasons.</p>

              <p>I would also like to add that it is important to set aside some time, maybe at least 20 to 45 minutes a day (can be more if you have the time), practicing sitting meditation in an undistracted environment.</p>
              <p>For me personally, I would practice self inquiry, just asking 'who am I'. It is possible that by practicing meditation one can have an initial glimpse of pure awareness. Self Inquiry is a very powerful tool at leading to the initial realisation. Then try as much as possible to maintain recognition in our daily lives.</p>
