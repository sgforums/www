              <p>What is actual is this impersonal awareness that is non-conceptual: it transcends the imaginative, conceptual faculty of the human mind, it cannot be placed under any mental categories of 'individual' or 'collective' or anything - but there is indeed the intuition that everyone and everything is the expression of the One Mind.</p>

They are interdependent and that is the essence of middle path. If one neglects the view and conceptual clarity, our non-dual and non-conceptual experience will not be stable and mature. Telling someone to drop all concepts and views is not to tell him/her how irrelevant these rafts are but to intensify one's direct experience of luminous presence. Without the right view, our progress will be hindered. Both must be put in the right place, right perspective for the maturing of one's insight.</span></strong></p>

                  				Natural State—Not What You Think!</span></a></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080; font-size: x-large;"> <strong>T</strong></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000080; font-size: normal;">HE
                   
                  				NATURAL STATE is not the state of a self-realized, God-realized 
                  				man. It is not a thing to be achieved or attained. It is not a 
                  				thing to be willed into existence; it is there—it is the living 
                  				state. This state is the functional activity of 
                  				life. By 'life' I do not mean something abstract; it is the life 
                  				of the senses, functioning naturally without the interference of 
                  				thought. Thought is an interloper, which thrusts itself into the 
                  				affairs of the senses. It has a profit motive: thought directs 
                  				the activity of the senses to get something out of them, and 
                  				uses them to give continuity to itself.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000080; font-size: normal;"> Your natural state has no relationship whatsoever with the 
                  				religious states of bliss, beatitude and ecstasy; they lie 
                  				within the field of experience. Those who have led man on his 
                  				search for religiousness throughout the centuries have perhaps 
                  				experienced those religious states. So can you. They are 
                  				thought-induced states of being, and as they come, so do they 
                  				go. Krishna Consciousness, Buddha Consciousness, Christ 
                  				Consciousness, or what have you, are all trips in the wrong 
                  				direction: they are all within the field of time. The timeless 
                  				can never be experienced, can never be grasped, contained, much 
                  				less given expression to, by any man. That beaten track will 
                  				lead you nowhere. There is no oasis situated yonder; you are 
                  				stuck with the mirage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000080; font-size: normal;"> You can never understand the tremendous peace that is always 
                  				there within you, that is your natural state. Your trying to 
                  				create a peaceful state of mind is in fact creating disturbance 
                  				within you. You can only talk of peace, create a state of mind 
                  				and say to yourself that you are very peaceful—but that is not 
                  				peace; that is violence. So there is no use in practicing peace, 
                  				there is no reason to practice silence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000080; font-size: normal;"> <img style="border: 3px double #808080; padding: 1px;" src="http://livinginpeace-thenaturalstate.com/heimaey1.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="400" height="246"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000080; font-size: normal;"> Real silence is explosive; it is not the dead state of mind that 
                  				spiritual seekers think. "Oh, I am at peace with myself! There 
                  				is silence, a tremendous silence! I experience silence!" That 
                  				doesn't mean anything at all. This is volcanic in its nature: 
                  				it's bubbling all the time—the energy, the life—that is its 
                  				quality. You may ask how I know. I don't know. Life is aware of 
                  				itself, if we can put it that way—it is conscious of itself.</span></p>

If one objects that the self corresponds to the meeting of those parts, the objection amounts to conceding that it’s just a simple label that the intellect imposes on the temporary meeting of various independent elements. The self doesn’t exist in any of those elements, for when those elements separate the very notion of self disappears. Not to unmask the imposter of the self is ignorance, the momentary inability to recognize the Buddha-nature, the true nature, the intrinsic nature, the absolute nature, unveiled, unencumbered from all concepts. </span></span></p>

Once ridden of our erroneous understanding of the self and our belief in the true and solid existence of phenomena, once we recognize this “I” does not exist, we awaken to the ultimate state of complete clarity, of spiritual realization. All the negative emotions, all the obscurations that render the underlying wisdom invisible, have dissolved having never been, and there is awareness, a clear state of consciousness free of representation or concept. It is the cessation of discursive thought, of association of ideas, subject-and-object. It is direct knowledge, the flux of native consciousness, the unencumbered, and the ultimate and independent reality. It is the awareness, present and perfected intrinsically within the Buddha-nature of every sentient thing; you, me, and the cricket I hear just now.</span></span></p>

              knowledge, the flux of native consciousness, the unencumbered, and
              the ultimate and independent reality. It is the awareness, present
              and perfected intrinsically within the Buddha-nature of every
              sentient thing; you, me, and the cricket I hear just
              now.</span></span></p>

              <p>Just to add something for Arapahoe and other forummers... before we can understand other aspects like impersonality, and so on, it is important to give rise to the realization of who You are. In other words before going to the next step, start from Step 1. This is the only way before you can productively look at anything else.</p>
              <p>Begin by investigating this sense of existence, this sense of being. What is it? Who am I? This is not meant to be verbally or mentally recited (as Self-Inquiry teacher Zen/Ch'an Master Hsu Yun says, if you want to chant, chanting Amitabha wholeheartedly would be more meritorious than chanting Who am I? or Who is chanting Buddha?), nor should it be an intellectual inquiry by engaging the mind in concepts to figure things out. No. Rather it is a non-conceptual and non-verbal exploration, investigation, examination of this sense of Presence, what is this Self, what is true, beyond all thoughts and conceptualizations and images we have about who I am. Your conceptualizing mind needs to calm down for true insight to arise (but calmness alone does not result in insight - inquiry does). The inquiry 'Who am I' is a tool to turn the attention inward, to turn the light around and investigate our essential being so that direct realization of this 'I', Beingness, AMness can occur.</p>
              <p>Keep inquiring in that manner until unshakeable conviction arises through a sudden illumination: the undoubtable sense that I AM, which is beyond all thoughts and concepts - this undeniable, undoubtable sense of presence and existence that is at the same time aware and knows itself and aware of everything. It is both present, and aware. As I wrote: <em>You
                                                                                                  Are That Knowing which is certain that You Are! 
                                                                          The distinction

              <p>After this realization, your understanding of spirituality will not 
              remain intellectual/conceptual.</p>
              <p>However this is just the beginning, as Thusness said before in <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/09/realization-and-experience-and-non-dual.html">Realization

              <p>Something I think is quite important, which Thusness wrote to me last year when I have had glimpses of the Witness, but not experienced the 'Certainty of Being' <a href="/forums/1728/topics/390582?page=2#post_9787387">(also see the post I made on 14 May 2010, on the conversation I had with Thusness about the different phases of I AM in February 2009)</a>:</p>
              <p>Excerpt from</p>
              <h3><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/09/realization-and-experience-and-non-dual.html">Realization
                           and Experience and Non-Dual Experience from Different Perspectives</a></h3>
              <p><br><span><a name="ExperienceAndRealization">1.
                           On Experience and Realization</a></span><br><br>One of the direct and 
                          immediate response I get after reading the articles by Rob Burbea and 
                          Rupert is that they missed one very and most important point when 
                          talking about the Eternal Witness Experience -- The Realization.  They 
                          focus too much on the experience but overlook the realization.  Honestly
                           I do not like to make this distinction as I see realization also as a 
                          form of experience.  However in this particular case, it seems 
                          appropriate as it could better illustrate what I am trying to convey.  
                          It also relates to the few occasions where you described to me your 
                          space-like experiences of Awareness and asked whether they correspond to
                           the phase one insight of Eternal Witness. While your experiences are 
                          there, I told you ‘not exactly’ even though you told me you clearly 
                          experienced a pure sense of presence.<br><br>So what is lacking?  You do
                           not lack the experience, you lack the realization.   You may have the 
                          blissful sensation or feeling of vast and open spaciousness; you may 
                          experience a non-conceptual and objectless state; you may experience the
                           mirror like clarity but all these experiences are not Realization. 
                          There is no ‘eureka’, no ‘aha’, no moment of immediate and intuitive 
                          illumination that you understood something undeniable and unshakable -- a
                           conviction so powerful that no one, not even Buddha can sway you from 
                          this realization because the practitioner so clearly sees the truth of 
                          it.  It is the direct and unshakable insight of ‘You’.  This is the 
                          realization that a practitioner must have in order to realize the Zen 
                          satori.  You will understand clearly why it is so difficult for those 
                          practitioners to forgo this ‘I AMness’ and accept the doctrine of 
                          anatta.  Actually there is no forgoing of this ‘Witness’, it is rather a
                           deepening of insight to include the non-dual, groundlessness and 
                          interconnectedness of our luminous nature.  Like what Rob said, "keep 
                          the experience but refine the views".<br><br>Lastly this realization is 
                          not an end by itself, it is the beginning.  If we are truthful and not 
                          over exaggerate and get carried away by this initial glimpse, we will 
                          realize that we do not gain liberation from this realization; contrary 
                          we suffer more after this realization.  However it is a powerful 
                          condition that motivates a practitioner to embark on a spiritual journey
                           in search of true freedom. :)</p>

              <p class="bodyRegular">Appearances are appearances of THAT. All
              experiences are only movements in and of that clear, cognizing
              emptiness. There is no "you" apart from that either. All there is, is
              THAT.</p>

              <p class="bodyRegular">No awakening is needed, as that clear and
              evident natural being-awareness is with you right now. Even the notion
              of visiting teachers is only a concept. Why the need to visit others
              when you are standing as that perfect reality here and now? And by
              visiting others, could they do anything other than point to what you
              already know and ARE? Embrace the finality of “You are THAT”. All sense
              of duality comes from overlooking the meaning of this one statement.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.naturalstate.us/images/extras/diamond.gif" alt="" width="14" height="13"></p>
              <p class="bodyRegular">Keeping with the direct knowing and
              consideration of your real being. Let that be solid and clear. That
              being is always with you and is pointed out as the unconditioned
              reality. All other issues are only a result of being in doubt about
              what your nature is. All the questions and analysis of those issues is
              done by the mind. This keeps the focus all on the concepts. Hence, no
              real peace or confidence is available. So, take some time to get very
              well acquainted with your real nature. This is really the point of it.
              If that is not clear, nothing else really “works”, because the basic
              point is not clear. Perhaps you are getting a taste of the simplicity
              of your natural being as it is, but then jumping back to following the
              mind and getting wrapped up in doubts and questions. See that by doing
              that you are not really staying with your real nature but following the
              mind. It should be clear that this is not really the way to peace
              and self-knowledge.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.naturalstate.us/images/extras/diamond.gif" alt="" width="14" height="13"></p>
              <p class="bodyRegular">You ARE. That is a fact even your mind cannot
              doubt. Be willing to pause the interest in the doubts and questions a
              bit and appreciate what your real being is. Trying to answer questions
              and resolve "issues" is done in the mind and keeps the attention at a
              conceptual level. When you turn to being itself, you are immediately
              out of the doubts and concepts. Why? Because your real nature is not
              even in the mind and cannot be recognized through the mind. However, it
              is a doubtless reality for everyone at every moment.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.naturalstate.us/images/extras/diamond.gif" alt="" width="14" height="13"></p>
              <p class="bodyRegular">Always remember something very important. There
              is never any doubt or question about your being. This is why it is
              reality. All doubts and questions are thoughts. If you look at them
              closely, they will, in one way or another, trace back to the separate
              “I” assumption. This means the notion that you are something other than
              that doubtless reality itself. That is what is so powerful about seeing
              what you are and that you are not that separate “I” assumption. Just
              this much is all that is needed, nothing more. To be what you are and
              to know for certain that all doubts are only for a fictitious entity
              that is not existent, completely ends all seeking, suffering and doubt.
              In fact, the need for spirituality, teachers, answers, further
              progress, etc., is completely resolved. Any doubts or questions are due
              to not being clear on these basic points.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.naturalstate.us/images/extras/diamond.gif" alt="" width="14" height="13"></p>
              <p class="bodyRegular">What is the mind appearing IN? Only the clear
              space of being and knowing, your natural state. Then, what are the
              thoughts? Only the energy of consciousness itself (like waves coming
              and going on the surface of the sea). So nothing is happening. There is
              only THAT and the display of THAT. Looking in this way annihilates
              duality and ends all struggle.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.naturalstate.us/images/extras/diamond.gif" alt="" width="14" height="13"></p>
              <p class="bodyRegular">Your being is before the mind. Your being is not
              a concept. It is a doubtless reality. Being cannot be grasped in
              thought, because the mind works in concepts and what you are is not a
              concept. Searching for who you are in the mind is like trying to find
              water in a mirage. It cannot happen. There is no need to spend your
              time trying to think about your being. That is an exercise in futility.
              The best use of the mind is for dealing with practical affairs.
              However, what you are can certainly be appreciated and seen for what it
              is. But that is by direct, immediate non-conceptual experience, not
              thinking about it. You can easily see that what you are is that
              doubtless, changeless clarity of being and knowing that illuminates all
              states of mind and even the absence of states of mind.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.naturalstate.us/images/extras/diamond.gif" alt="" width="14" height="13"></p>
              <p class="bodyRegular">If you look at any moment of experience, you can
              perhaps see some thoughts, feelings and perceptions coming and going.
              But you are not coming and going. Are you? Make sure this is clear and
              makes sense. Whatever the experience, your own being is here beyond
              doubt. True? So what can you see about this being that is here and now?
              If anything is you, it must be this — as it is the one constant that is
              always with you. Clearly you are not an object, because you are not
              standing apart from yourself looking at yourself “over there”
              somewhere. All thoughts, feelings and perceptions are, in fact,
              objects. The point is that your own nature or being is doubtlessly
              present, very sure and well known. That is not intellectual, as no one
              says “I exist intellectually”.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.naturalstate.us/images/extras/diamond.gif" alt="" width="14" height="13"></p>
              <p class="bodyRegular">Do not waste time in speculative “what if”
              questions. This is just a way for the mental machinery to stay “front
              and center”. We can come up with all types of plausible “answers” or
              explanations for hypothetical issues. Get back to basics. If you take
              yourself to be something you are not, there is limitation and
              suffering. If not, there is genuine, lived clarity and peace. This is
              direct experience. Why dabble in provisional matters, when
              you are the doubtless reality itself?</p>

              <p class="bodyRegular">Come what may, you cannot deny your very being
              and you have never been anything other than that. Any bit of looking
              shows that this is not a limited, defective entity standing apart from
              reality, but is the light of being and knowing itself, the very space
              of reality that is ever shining in, through and AS all experiences.
              There are no experiences outside of your natural state. So even now
              they are non-separate from that. All there is, is that. And you are
              THAT. That is that!</p>

              <p>A summary of some points my teacher told me during a roughly 50 min phone call:</p>
              <p>(3:46 PM) AEN: <br>*she said what i experience is like meeting my true nature face to face, but its only like a glimpse, not a full understanding, for a higher level of understanding must practice for some time... i must practice in daily activities to have a deeper understanding. she  <br>(3:47 PM) AEN:  also said the 'zhi di' is emptiness, i said the zhi di is 'awareness' but i think we use different terms. then she said regarding the 'no movement in environment' that its bcos i dun grasp and follow after appearance that i feel no movement, but at the same time i should not fear movement and grasp after the emptiness.</p>
              <p>*update: she also said that she agrees that in awareness, there is no limits and in that awareness no differentiation of 'me' or 'you', 'mine' or 'yours', but added a few points as follows:</p>
              <p><br>(3:48 PM) AEN: then she said awareness enables the body to function, but if a person is paralyzed, even if he has awareness he is also not able to move, so its the body function rely on awareness, not exactly everything is functioning of awareness itself. something that</p>
              <p>*note: forgot to mention also, my teacher also said that a corpse clinically dead within 8 hours still have awareness, bcos the mind consciousness is still present and is able to hear the instructions of a teacher during the bardo proceedings.</p>
              <p>she also said that without using thoughts, you react to something (like touching something hot) by pulling away, that is an example of non-conceptual intelligence/awareness.<br><br>(3:49 PM) AEN: then she said when i practice until this level its easy to attach to the empty awareness and reject form, then become like arhat, 'zhi kong' (attach to emptiness) <br>(3:49 PM) AEN: a bodhisattva doesnt reject but also doesnt grasp on any forms, bodhisattva is also 'jue xing yuan man', that means awareness in action is complete <br>(3:51 PM) AEN: and arhat still have attachment, except that its attachment to emptiness instead of attachment to forms of sentient beings <br>(3:52 PM) AEN: then she said i have to go through different challenges in life to understand the interaction between jue xing ben ti and 'xin' (mind/thoughts), like how they interact <br>(3:52 PM) AEN: and that also dun fear thoughts, thoughts arise for practical purpose but awareness is aware and not attached <br>(3:53 PM) AEN: she said what i experienced is only a form of understanding (ç�†), like last time nai min (i sent u one of his letters long ago) last time also wrote alot of his meditative experience, but after a while lzls told him to stop sending ç�† but send äº‹ instead <br>(3:54 PM) AEN: that means send her his daily experiences... cos its through daily experience (doing things, meeting people, etc) that we practice and have a better understanding of our nature <br>then she told me do send her emails about äº‹ next time  <br>(3:56 PM) AEN: oh and she said<br>last time teacher chen emphasize meditation <br>(3:56 PM) AEN: but later on he also break ppl's attachment to meditation, like saying bodhisattvas have so many things to do, where got time to meditate <br>(3:57 PM) AEN: its bcos some ppl attach to meditation... and see it as more able to lead to 'ming xin jian xing'... but thats like not the full picture or something <br>(4:25 PM) AEN: luo han å��ç©ºï¼Œbut pu sa é�žç©ºé�žæœ‰ <br>(4:26 PM) AEN: oh and she said <br>(4:26 PM) AEN: regarding what i wrote "ä¸€åˆ‡æ„�å¿µä¸Žæ„Ÿå�—éƒ½åœ¨è§‰æ€§ä¸­èµ·è�½"<br>actually if got 'gan shou', and 'yi nian' then is no longer jue<br>gan shou and jue is different <br>(4:27 PM) AEN: she also said we will have thoughts but must ä¸Žè§‰å�Œåœ¨ï¼Œnot ä¸Žå¿µå¤´å�Œåœ¨ or something like that <br>(4:28 PM) AEN: i think she said ä¸Žä¼—ç”Ÿå�Œåœ¨ <br>(4:28 PM) AEN: then she said all that has arising and passing is all mind and thoughts, self-nature has no arising and passing <br>(4:58 PM) Thusness: zhi di is what? <br>(4:58 PM) AEN: i wrote å®ƒçš„æœ¬æ€§/è´¨åœ°å°±æ˜¯è§‰:å®ƒæ˜¯äº†äº†åˆ†æ˜Žçš„ç�µæ•�è§‰çŸ¥, èƒ½è§‰ç…§ä¸‡ç‰©ï¼Œå°±åƒ�é•œå­�æœ‰ç…§ä¸‡ç‰©çš„åŠŸèƒ½ <br>(4:59 PM) AEN: i think she based on teacher chen definition, the è´¨åœ° is kong<br>i think its something like the issue of 'nature' and 'essence' <br>(4:59 PM) AEN: teacher chen talk about nature and essence or something like that... <br>(5:00 PM) Thusness: her advice is quite good. <br>(5:01 PM) AEN: icic..</p>

              <p><strong>Walking/Jogging/Running meditation</strong></p>
              <p>While jogging just now, I 'forgot' my mind and body. It feels
              like I'm the still presence in which the world moves through.
              Instead of being a body running on the road from here to there,
              it's seen that I am the space that encompasses the whole world and
              the whole world moves through me. I am not moving. The world is
              moving through me.</p>
              <p>It feels like you're running on the threadmill, you're not
              actually moving! Except that the scenery moves through you.</p>
              <p>You can practice seeing this next time when you walk or jog.
              This space of awareness is unmoving, whether or not the world is
              moving.</p>

              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial Black,Helvetica Bold,Charcoal,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">July 15 – Day 1</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: You say that 
                  the reference point is false. Can’t we say that the mind, or thoughts, 
                  are the reference point?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Yes, but 
                  thought has no substance; you can’t grasp a thought—it has no 
                  independent nature. Can you have a thought without awareness? Is a 
                  thought 
                                                  independent?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: No.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: So, the thought
                   is believed to be the reference point because we’ve never questioned 
                  it. As soon as that “I” thought comes upon a little child, he 
                                                  believes “this is what I am.” He goes 
                  through his reasoning, and if he wasn’t good at school that day, he 
                  thinks, “I’m not good enough,” or “I’m not smart enough.” He adds all 
                  these thoughts to form that mental 
                                                  picture. But that “I” thought on its own
                   can’t be grasped. It’s nothing. The reference point, or self center, is
                   just a bunch of images. It’s got no independent nature. We’re being 
                  driven by a phantom.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Ever since 
                  I’ve been studying Advaita, I’ve been wondering this: If it’s not us 
                  doing things, who’s doing it? We’re being lived, right? Who’s living 
                                                  us?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: [<em>Laughing</em>]
                   James . . . who wants to know? That’s your false self center again. 
                  That’s the ego again, thinking you and I are so great that we’re 
                                                  doing the thinking, or something “out 
                  there” is doing the thinking.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;"> In nature, there’s 
                  just <em>one</em> movement of energy!</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Did something
                   create all this existence?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: It isn’t 
                  created; it’s transient. As our reference point, we think of a life of 
                  billions of years, and we can’t <em>conceptualize</em> it. But nothing’s 
                  ever been created.</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: So, this 
                  conversation is not happening?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Well, it’s 
                  happening in the appearance. If a cloud comes along, is it attached to 
                  the sky?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: No.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Well, that’s 
                  just like the concepts that come into your mind. What happens to the 
                  cloud in the sky? It comes along and then blows away. Use the 
                                                  metaphor of “space-like awareness.” It’s
                   like space, empty. But, instead of being empty in a void, like space, 
                  it’s <em>“cognizing emptiness</em>.” It has that capacity of knowing. It’s
                   imbued with a natural 
                                                  intelligence—not like the intellect that
                   knows this and that. But pure intelligence, the same intelligence that 
                  is functioning in the universe, is keeping the stars in orbit and 
                  causing the wind to blow and all 
                                                  that. The pure intelligence is making 
                  the trees grow, and it’s beating your heart and growing your 
                  fingernails; it’s doing all those things right now. It’s causing your 
                  thoughts to happen. But that’s just like 
                                                  clouds in the sky, not attached 
                  anywhere. It just comes and then moves on. The energy is constantly 
                  vibrating.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: I have this 
                  concept that there is this consciousness, or oneness.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Yes, you have a
                   <em>concept</em>.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: From this 
                  oneness sprang the appearance, right? That makes consciousness the 
                  creator, no?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Just take the 
                  ocean and the waves. On the ocean, a ripple or a wave appears. The wave 
                  may rise and splash or spray, but, what is it? It’s only water. 
                                                  It’s never been anything other than 
                  water—appearing as difference.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Okay, so 
                  what’s happening now between you and me is consciousness appearing as a 
                  conversation.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Don’t try to 
                  conceptualize consciousness. That’s only a label we put on it. It’s 
                  emptiness that has the capacity of knowing. I don’t mean knowing this 
                                                  or that, or the intellect. But knowing 
                  that you <em>are</em> right now. That’s prior to thought. Just that pure 
                  knowing, which you can’t negate.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: So, it’s 
                  emptiness that is capable of knowing?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: It’s not one 
                  that is capable of something. The two are actually one and the same. 
                  “Cognizing emptiness” or “emptiness cognizing.” That’s all.</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: What is 
                  cognizing?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Just seeing.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: So, it’s just
                   cognizing. There’s no intelligence behind it?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Well, you can 
                  say that cognizing is intelligence. Knowing is intelligence. Not the 
                  knower and the known, but pure knowing. So it’s the activity of 
                                                  knowing. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;"> Right now, that 
                  knowing that you are is with you, isn’t it?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Yes. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Now, knowing is
                   not the knower or the known. It’s actually what is happening now: 
                  knowing. So, it’s going on right now. That knowing is an activity, 
                                                  and activity is energy. So, pure 
                  intelligence energy is activity of knowing. That’s all it is. The world 
                  appears and disappears in that knowingness. The knowingness is just 
                  purely knowing. The appearance and 
                                                  disappearance can only be conceptualized
                   from a reference point—from an erroneous belief! For example, take 
                  seeing. You’re seeing right now. Then the thought comes up, “I see.” But
                   the actual seeing was happening 
                                                  before the thought. With the thought, 
                  you’ve created a pseudo-seer. When you say, “I see the tree,” you’ve 
                  created a pseudo-object—a subject and object in form. But can there be a
                   seer or a seen without seeing?</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: No.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Those are just 
                  labels that we attach. Like the thinker and the thought. Always remember
                   what Nisargadatta said, “You try to grasp it with a concept 
                                                  and you fail. And you are bound to fail,
                   because you can never grasp it with a concept.” You must stop trying to
                   conceptualize everything.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: So everything
                   is just happening?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Exactly. It’s 
                  all happening by itself, as itself. And nothing is happening!</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: How do you 
                  explain that nothing is happening?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Using the 
                  metaphor of space-like awareness, all this manifestation is the content 
                  of space. There’s nothing you can think of that’s outside of space. 
                                                  So the appearance is the content of 
                  space. If space is nothing, can something come from nothing?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Why does it 
                  feel so real?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: [<em>Laughing</em>]
                   To <em>who</em>?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: To my 
                  thoughts.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Yes, and the 
                  thoughts are part of the appearance also! In essence, the appearance is 
                  real because it is made of presence awareness, which is real. 
                                                  Look at how a mirage appears real. Or 
                  the blue color of the sea. Within intelligence energy, patterns are 
                  forming and displaying as this manifestation.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: For so many 
                  years, I’ve wondered how there could be a God that could allow all the 
                  horrible wars and torture and so on. But if the manifestation is 
                                                  an appearance, none of this is really 
                  happening. Right? Nothing is tragic, correct?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: That’s right. 
                  The people were never born, and they can never die. They’re just 
                  patterns of energy. They appear, play around for a while, and then 
                                                  disappear. In fact, they’re still just 
                  the one intelligence energy. It’s never changed.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: I have a 
                  question about spiritual experiences. Sometimes, usually late at night 
                  in bed, I suddenly feel infinite or vast—without any boundaries or 
                                                  limitations. The next day, I’ll tell my 
                  wife or my friend Kerry, “I had an experience.” But, actually, what has 
                  happened is that the feelings and thoughts that are usually going on 
                  have disappeared. The 
                                                  unboundedness I sometimes experience at 
                  night is actually always present, isn’t it.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Yes, but as 
                  soon as you labeled it an experience, then you’ve “taken delivery” of it
                   from the reference point.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Yes, I 
                  understand that.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: What happened 
                  was just experiencing<em>, </em>which the experience and the experiencer 
                  appear on. If your senses are wide open, and you’re not labeling 
                                                  everything, then you’re just seeing what
                   is. And you’ll see the wonderful, magical display of it all, appearing 
                  and disappearing, without attributing it to a “me.”</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Does life 
                  appear particularly interesting to you?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Again, to be 
                  interesting or boring, it has to be from a reference point. Sometimes 
                  there are periods of silence, even long periods; other times the 
                                                  chatter can be going on. I don’t prefer 
                  either one. The so-called silence that seekers talk about, I couldn’t 
                  care less about. Any more than I care about the chatter. They’re both 
                  experiences. I am that in which the 
                                                  experience takes place. And that’s 
                  constantly and always ever been the same. It is no thing. It’s no use 
                  trying to grasp it as a thing; it contains all things.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Now, when you
                   make that statement, like Nisargadatta did, that you are that in which 
                  everything takes place, I understand it. But I can’t say that 
                                                  about myself. I am constantly taking 
                  delivery of stuff. You say you don’t care whether there are lots of 
                  thoughts or no thoughts. I can’t do that.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: If I took 
                  delivery of the reference point, it would be the same. I’d be 
                  thinking,“I shouldn’t have done this,” or “I shouldn’t have said that.” 
                  But 
                                                  I’ve seen through the reference point. 
                  I’ve seen clearly. So, what comes up, comes up. That’s what I mean when I
                   say, “I couldn’t care less.” It’s not me. It’s just that there’s no 
                  preference, there’s no partiality, 
                                                  no comparison. It’s just what is: 
                  unaltered, unmodified, uncorrected. The Buddhists talk about “what is.” 
                  Just the seeing—the actual functioning.<em> </em>The only thing you’ll 
                  ever alter, modify, or correct is a 
                                                  thought.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: So, we’re 
                  going to have thoughts. The point is not to take delivery of them.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Yes, and 
                  there’s no one to<em> not </em>take delivery of them. Just seeing and 
                  recognizing.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Yes, well, 
                  you can say all this and write the books, and people will hear you and 
                  say, “Well, Sailor Bob can do that, and that’s great for him. But 
                                                  I can’t do that.” It seems to me that 
                  the significant part is conviction. I understand what you’re saying, but
                   I don’t yet have the full conviction. . . .</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: <em>Who </em>doesn’t
                   have the conviction? You’ve got that concept of you, and so you think 
                  things should be different. You’re seeing right now? You’re 
                                                  hearing right now? That knowingness that
                   you are is with you now, right? You can’t negate that.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Right.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: So, what’s this
                   rubbish about not having the conviction? You go off on some conceptual 
                  thing. . . .</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Right, but 
                  why don’t you go off on some conceptual thing?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Because I’ve 
                  seen that the reference point is false. Do you see what you’re doing? 
                  I’m pointing it out to you, and you’re going into the ifs and the 
                                                  buts and all. You’re going into the 
                  future. You move into time again. Time is a mental concept. You move 
                  into a so-called imaginary future. Or you go back into the past. But you
                   don’t live in the future and the 
                                                  past. Everything happens in the Now. 
                  It’s like a cloud over the sun. It’s blocking out the knowingness of the
                   Now. These ideas that “I don’t have this” or “I’ll get the conviction 
                  in the future” are keeping you away 
                                                  from it.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: So it’s right
                   here, right now?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Yes, it’s 
                  immediate. There’s nowhere to go.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Well, 
                  yesterday I got really angry at someone. A lady wrote me a letter that 
                  really bothered me.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: That was 
                  yesterday, never mind the past. . . .</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: When it 
                  happened, I thought to myself, “Wait a minute; there is no James.” And 
                  still the upset remained.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Yes, because 
                  when you say, “There is no me,” that’s become a reference point. You 
                  might have seen there’s no James last week or last month or 
                                                  yesterday. But that’s dead, like all 
                  your other thoughts. You have to see it right now. Instead of simply 
                  saying, “There’s no me,” have a look. Investigate, in the Now. Look and 
                  see if you can find a self center or 
                                                  a “me.”</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Well, at the 
                  time I got upset, I stopped and said to myself, “Who am I? I am presence
                   awareness.” That was clear to me. And still upsetting thoughts 
                                                  continued.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: But you were 
                  putting the concept “I’m presence awareness” on it. Without that 
                  concept, it’s simply “I am.” Full stop.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: I tried being
                   aware of the present moment. I looked around the room without labeling 
                  anything—just being aware. . . .</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Without 
                  labeling anything, you just take in the whole thing. You notice that 
                  seeing is happening spontaneously, hearing is happening spontaneously, 
                                                  immediately.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Well, in any 
                  case, I still have to answer her letter.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: That’s fine. 
                  Just do what you have to do. Let happen whatever happens. You might 
                  write to her while you’re pissed off. Or you might tell her off or 
                                                  whatever. But there’s no “you” that’s 
                  doing any of that. Whatever occurs is just the way it happens.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: I see. Can we
                   talk about this non-doer issue? That’s very conceptual for me.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Well, I’ll show
                   you. You’re seeing right now, aren’t you?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Yes.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: You’re hearing 
                  right now. Is your eye saying to you, “I see”? Is your ear saying to 
                  you, “I hear”?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: No.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: So the thought 
                  comes up to translate “I see” and “I hear.” But can that thought“I 
                  see”—can it see? And can the thought “I hear”—can it hear?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: You’re 
                  telling me something that I’ve read in your book, or heard you say, 
                  twenty times. . . .</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Well, listen to
                   me right now. Can the thought “I see”—can it see?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: No. The 
                  thought is garbage. It’s just a translation.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: So the thought 
                  has <em>no power whatsoever</em>.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: If the 
                  thought has no power, then there is no doer?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: The thought “I 
                  am aware”—is that the awareness?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: No, of course
                   not.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: The thought “I 
                  choose”—is that the choice maker? The thought “I think”—is that the 
                  thinker?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: So, if the 
                  thought has no power, there is simply no doer?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Of course not. 
                  You see, thought has been so closely aligned to that intelligence. But, 
                  in fact, all it does is translate. It translates into words and 
                                                  labels that we communicate with. <em>Thought
                   is so closely aligned to pure intelligence energy that it’s come to 
                  believe that it is the pure intelligence energy.</em> Now, when you see 
                  that the mind and the thoughts have no power, do you fall apart? Do you 
                  disappear?</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: No.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: You realize 
                  that the living is going on quite effortlessly, without thinking. What’s
                   wrong with right now, unless you think about it? You pause from 
                                                  thinking for a moment, and you still 
                  haven’t fallen apart. You’re still hearing, seeing, tasting, and life is
                   still going on. You’re not relying on the thinking.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Yes. Bob, you
                   have students who have been coming to you for years. What’s their 
                  story? Why don’t they eventually “full stop?”</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Well, they 
                  don’t. . . . The same as you’re going on right now. [<em>Laughter</em>] 
                  But, there are also those who come along and see it right away.</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: So far, there
                   is no “full stop” for me. My mind keeps going on and questioning. The 
                  mind keeps wanting a reference point.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: You’re trying 
                  to stop the mind. But once you see it’s rubbish, just like the mirage on
                   the road, you’re not bound by it.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Well, 
                  something is happening. Yesterday, I had that annoying letter from that 
                  lady, and I knew that my reaction was nonsense. So it only bothered me 
                                                  for an hour or so, and then it was gone.
                   A few years ago, it would have upset me all day long, maybe longer. 
                  It’s gotten better.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Yes, it will.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: But I don’t 
                  like that “it will” part. That’s in the future.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: That’s true. 
                  But you will drop it quicker. The habit pattern is to see everything 
                  from a reference point. You’ve done that not once or twice, but 
                                                  constantly—day in and day out for all 
                  your life. We’ve hypnotized ourselves. But when you’ve questioned it and
                   seen the falseness of it, you can no longer believe in it. Just like 
                  you can no longer believe there’s 
                                                  any water in a mirage.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Earlier I 
                  asked you if you find life exciting or boring. I asked because it seems 
                  like sometimes, when I am remarkably free of the reference point, 
                                                  everything suddenly appears new and 
                  fresh and amazing. Do you have judgments about the way life looks?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: I don’t have 
                  judgments, but judgments come up.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: What do you 
                  do with them?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: They’re not 
                  mine. Who’s to take delivery of them. They come up and then they go. The
                   whole pattern just goes on.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: So, even the 
                  people who appear to take delivery of thoughts, they’re not really 
                  taking delivery—they’re just appearing to take delivery. Right?</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Yes.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: So the people
                   who are suffering massively are really no different from us. It’s 
                  insignificant whether anyone awakens or not. You know, it’s hard for 
                                                  me to grasp sometimes. It reminds me of 
                  an expression my father used to say: “It doesn’t go through my head.”</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: <em>Don’t try to
                   conceptualize it.</em> Stay in the experiencing and then you’ll enjoy 
                  it.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Bob, I <em>love</em> the thinking process, and that makes me want to conceptualize 
                  everything. Look at the magnificence of creation: math, science, art, 
                  millions of creatures, open-heart surgery, and so on. I always want to 
                  know who made existence. And the creation isn’t even real!</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: It’s like a 
                  reflection in a mirror. What’s making all these reflections? Why is this
                   reflection better than the other one? [<em>Laughing</em>]</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Life is so 
                  miraculous. There are millions of cells in the body constantly replacing
                   themselves. Do you ever wonder how or why?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: The hows and 
                  the whys are finished. Those would be movements <em>away</em> from it.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Because 
                  everything’s already happened?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Just be with 
                  the happening, and little insights will come up. And you’ll get answers 
                  that are satisfying.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: When you had 
                  the experience with Nisargadatta where you suddenly understood what he 
                  was saying. . . .</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: I understood 
                  him, and I realized, “I’ll never be trapped in the mind again.” Then I 
                  walked out the door, and I was back in it! [<em>Laughter] But it 
                                                  was never the same again. Of course, 
                  sooner or later the reference point would come up again, but then I’d 
                  realize, “Wait a minute; this is the same old nonsense,” and I’d see 
                  through it. Sometimes, like you said, 
                                                  it would hang around a few hours or a 
                  few days, and then it’s gone.</em></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: When did you 
                  see Nisargadatta?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: In 1976.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: Was there 
                  much of a difference in your experience of life in 1976 than ten years 
                  later because your experience had deepened?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: It doesn’t 
                  deepen. But the stuff that is covering up presence awareness just drops 
                  off. It can’t deepen, because it’s purely That and That alone.</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James: If, for 
                  example, you had an upsetting experience in 1976 like the one I had 
                  yesterday, wouldn’t there have been more annoyance than if it had 
                                                  happened in 1986?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob: Sure. But even 
                  in 1976 there was an immediate change....</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial Black,Helvetica Bold,Charcoal,Sans-serif,sans-serif;"> July 15 – Day 1</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  You say that the reference point is false. Can’t we say that the
                                  mind, or thoughts, are the reference point?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  Yes, but thought has no substance; you can’t grasp a thought—it has
                                  no independent nature. Can you have a thought without awareness? Is
                                  a thought independent?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  No.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  So, the thought is believed to be the reference point because we’ve
                                  never questioned it. As soon as that “I” thought comes upon a
                                  little child, he believes “this is what I am.” He goes through his
                                  reasoning, and if he wasn’t good at school that day, he thinks,
                                  “I’m not good enough,” or “I’m not smart enough.” He adds all these
                                  thoughts to form that mental picture. But that “I” thought on its
                                  own can’t be grasped. It’s nothing. The reference point, or self
                                  center, is just a bunch of images. It’s got no independent nature.
                                  We’re being driven by a phantom.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  Ever since I’ve been studying Advaita, I’ve been wondering this: If
                                  it’s not us doing things, who’s doing it? We’re being lived, right?
                                  Who’s living us?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  [<em>Laughing</em>] James . . . who wants to know? That’s your
                                  false self center again. That’s the ego again, thinking you and I
                                  are so great that we’re doing the thinking, or something “out
                                  there” is doing the thinking.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;"> In
                                  nature, there’s just <em>one</em> movement of
                                  energy!</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  Did something create all this existence?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  It isn’t created; it’s transient. As our reference point, we think
                                  of a life of billions of years, and we can’t <em>conceptualize</em> it. But nothing’s ever been created.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  So, this conversation is not happening?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  Well, it’s happening in the appearance. If a cloud comes along, is
                                  it attached to the sky?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  No.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  Well, that’s just like the concepts that come into your mind. What
                                  happens to the cloud in the sky? It comes along and then blows
                                  away. Use the metaphor of “space-like awareness.” It’s like space,
                                  empty. But, instead of being empty in a void, like space, it’s
                                  <em>“cognizing emptiness</em>.” It has that capacity of knowing.
                                  It’s imbued with a natural intelligence—not like the intellect that
                                  knows this and that. But pure intelligence, the same intelligence
                                  that is functioning in the universe, is keeping the stars in orbit
                                  and causing the wind to blow and all that. The pure intelligence is
                                  making the trees grow, and it’s beating your heart and growing your
                                  fingernails; it’s doing all those things right now. It’s causing
                                  your thoughts to happen. But that’s just like clouds in the sky,
                                  not attached anywhere. It just comes and then moves on. The energy
                                  is constantly vibrating.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  I have this concept that there is this consciousness, or
                                  oneness.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  Yes, you have a <em>concept</em>.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  From this oneness sprang the appearance, right? That makes
                                  consciousness the creator, no?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  Just take the ocean and the waves. On the ocean, a ripple or a wave
                                  appears. The wave may rise and splash or spray, but, what is it?
                                  It’s only water. It’s never been anything other than
                                  water—appearing as difference.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  Okay, so what’s happening now between you and me is consciousness
                                  appearing as a conversation.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  Don’t try to conceptualize consciousness. That’s only a label we
                                  put on it. It’s emptiness that has the capacity of knowing. I don’t
                                  mean knowing this or that, or the intellect. But knowing that you
                                  <em>are</em> right now. That’s prior to thought. Just that pure
                                  knowing, which you can’t negate.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  So, it’s emptiness that is capable of knowing?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  It’s not one that is capable of something. The two are actually one
                                  and the same. “Cognizing emptiness” or “emptiness cognizing.”
                                  That’s all.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  What is cognizing?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  Just seeing.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  So, it’s just cognizing. There’s no intelligence behind
                                  it?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  Well, you can say that cognizing is intelligence. Knowing is
                                  intelligence. Not the knower and the known, but pure knowing. So
                                  it’s the activity of knowing.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;"> Right
                                  now, that knowing that you are is with you, isn’t
                                  it?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">James:
                                  Yes.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  Now, knowing is not the knower or the known. It’s actually what is
                                  happening now: knowing. So, it’s going on right now. That knowing
                                  is an activity, and activity is energy. So, pure intelligence
                                  energy is activity of knowing. That’s all it is. The world appears
                                  and disappears in that knowingness. The knowingness is just purely
                                  knowing. The appearance and disappearance can only be
                                  conceptualized from a reference point—from an erroneous belief! For
                                  example, take seeing. You’re seeing right now. Then the thought
                                  comes up, “I see.” But the actual seeing was happening before the
                                  thought. With the thought, you’ve created a pseudo-seer. When you
                                  say, “I see the tree,” you’ve created a pseudo-object—a subject and
                                  object in form. But can there be a seer or a seen without
                                  seeing?</span></strong></p>

                                  is the content of space. There’s nothing you can think of that’s
                                  outside of space. So the appearance is the content of space. If
                                  space is nothing, can something come from

                                  Yes, and the thoughts are part of the appearance also! In essence,
                                  the appearance is real because it is made of presence awareness,
                                  which is real. Look at how a mirage appears real. Or the blue color
                                  of the sea. Within intelligence energy, patterns are forming and
                                  displaying as this manifestation.</span></strong></p>

                                  manifestation is an appearance, none of this is really happening.

                                  That’s right. The people were never born, and they can never die.
                                  They’re just patterns of energy. They appear, play around for a
                                  while, and then disappear. In fact, they’re still just the one
                                  intelligence energy. It’s never changed.</span></strong></p>

                                  I have a question about spiritual experiences. Sometimes, usually
                                  late at night in bed, I suddenly feel infinite or vast—without any
                                  boundaries or limitations. The next day, I’ll tell my wife or my
                                  friend Kerry, “I had an experience.” But, actually, what has
                                  happened is that the feelings and thoughts that are usually going
                                  on have disappeared. The unboundedness I sometimes experience at
                                  night is actually always present, isn’t it.</span></strong></p>

                                  Yes, but as soon as you labeled it an experience, then you’ve
                                  “taken delivery” of it from the reference
                                  point.</span></strong></p>

                                  you’re not labeling everything, then you’re just seeing what is.
                                  And you’ll see the wonderful, magical display of it all, appearing
                                  and disappearing, without attributing it to a

                                  Again, to be interesting or boring, it has to be from a reference
                                  point. Sometimes there are periods of silence, even long periods;
                                  other times the chatter can be going on. I don’t prefer either one.
                                  The so-called silence that seekers talk about, I couldn’t care less
                                  about. Any more than I care about the chatter. They’re both
                                  experiences. I am that in which the experience takes place. And
                                  that’s constantly and always ever been the same. It is no thing.
                                  It’s no use trying to grasp it as a thing; it contains all
                                  things.</span></strong></p>

                                  can’t say that about myself. I am constantly taking delivery of
                                  stuff. You say you don’t care whether there are lots of thoughts or
                                  no thoughts. I can’t do that.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Bob:
                                  If I took delivery of the reference point, it would be the same.
                                  I’d be thinking,“I shouldn’t have done this,” or “I shouldn’t have
                                  said that.” But I’ve seen through the reference point. I’ve seen
                                  clearly. So, what comes up, comes up. That’s what I mean when I
                                  say, “I couldn’t care less.” It’s not me. It’s just that there’s no
                                  preference, there’s no partiality, no comparison. It’s just what
                                  is: unaltered, unmodified, uncorrected. The Buddhists talk about
                                  “what is.” Just the seeing—the actual functioning. The only thing
                                  you’ll ever alter, modify, or correct is a
                                  thought.</span></strong></p>

                                  great for him. But I can’t do that.” It seems to me that the
                                  significant part is conviction. I understand what you’re saying,

                                  into the ifs and the buts and all. You’re going into the future.
                                  You move into time again. Time is a mental concept. You move into a

                                  don’t live in the future and the past. Everything happens in the

                                  Was there much of a difference in your experience of life in 1976
                                  than ten years later because your experience had

                                  It doesn’t deepen. But the stuff that is covering up presence
                                  awareness just drops off. It can’t deepen, because it’s purely That
                                  and That alone.</span></strong></p>

                                  one I had yesterday, wouldn’t there have been more annoyance than
                                  if it had happened in 1986?</span></strong></p>

              <p>Awareness/Presence is imbued with knowingness. However, this knowingness has been hijacked by a sense of self due to ignorant and false identification. Stripped of identifications as an individual person, the knowingness will still remain but here it is presence knowingness instead of an imaginary/believed self that knows.</p>
              <p>It is not an 'I' that know. It is not 'I' that experiences the life. It is not 'I' that thinks. All these are naturally already imbued in awareness/presence.</p>

              <p>Something I just wrote:</p>
              <p>Awareness, like a mirror, is 
                                          totally unconcerned by apparently pleasant or unpleasant experiences.<br> <br> It's sole 'job' or 'function' is to reflect What Is, without rejecting 
                                          or accepting apparently pleasant, or unpleasant appearances.<br> <br> Sweetness is sweet, pain is painful, but there is no one there 
                                          experiencing it, rejoicing in it, or rejecting it. It is only witnessed 
                                          as it is, no more, no less.<br> <br> When we rest as the space-like all-encompassing Essence of Awareness 
                                          rather than as a false identity of a separate self, there is a natural 
                                          fearlessness in facing everything (all experiences and all activities) as it is. No longer are we seeking 
                                          pleasant experiences or pushing away unpleasant ones. No longer are we 
                                          trying to disassociate ourselves or escape from experiences out of fear.<br> <br> To try to get rid of unpleasant experiences and 'get back' to the freedom of 
                                          Awareness is the big mistake of a deluded mind (and this is one of the things my dharma teacher told me on phone the other day but I forgot to mention), as if Awareness had 
                                          anything to do with a pleasant state of experience or as if the freedom of Awareness is opposed to unpleasant states of experience. Awareness is never 
                                          obscured by unpleasant experiences, nor improved by pleasant ones, it 
                                          simply reflects everything as it is.<br> <br> There is actually nothing that obscures Awareness, Awareness is 
                                          reflecting everything as it is, including even thoughts and concepts. 
                                          Through our grasping on thoughts and concepts we lose sight/intuitive 
                                          vision of Awareness.<br> <br> But it is not the thoughts and concepts (which are equally an appearance
                                           of Awareness) that is obscuring. Rather it is the deeply rooted habit 
                                          energy we developed since we were born to *believe in the 'me' stories 
                                          and concepts* to the extent of losing sight of everything else and most 
                                          importantly our directness and intuitiveness (or the non-conceptual 
                                          vivid recognition of Awareness). And through the belief in a separate 
                                          identity comes the chasing after of pleasant experiences (or maybe even 
                                          'Awareness', if Awareness is deludedly mistaken as a 'pleasant 
                                          experience' or even an 'experience' at all), and the rejection of unpleasant ones, all part of the same
                                           story of 'me' and 'mine'.<br> <br> In fact we can continue in the recognition of fundamental non-conceptual
                                           Awareness even in the midst of concepts, then thoughts do not serve as a problem.<br> <br> Through resting as awareness rather than as an illusory identity as a 
                                          separate self/thinker/doer, thoughts are seen to be happening 
                                          spontaneously on its own accord as a self-manifestation of mirror-like 
                                          Awareness, and spontaneously leaves without leaving a trace. There is no
                                           need to even 'stand back' from thought and watch it, it (and 
                                          everything) is simply and already the natural manifestation of 
                                          all-pervading Awareness.<br> <br> Because the self-reference is seen through as an illusion, belief into 
                                          the dualistic concepts and self-centered stories are gradually reduced and they no longer have 
                                          such a strong hold on us.<br> <br> Everything is still spontaneously arising and left as it is in its 
                                          Suchness: vivid, unaltered, unmodified, and uncorrected.</p>

              <p>pointers only serve their purpose until you directly experience what is being spoken about with such certainty that no doubts remain<br><br>it is the doubtless certainty of your true Being<br><br>once that is being realized, then words no longer serve their purpose. you may still read them, but you do not require them, because you find a wordless and unshakeable certainty in simply Being, you do not need words or people to confirm your understanding<br><br>all of the pointers only point to that non-verbal, non-conceptual certainty of being<br><br>trying to figure what the pointers mean at a conceptual level is totally meaningless<br><br>trying to collect pointers as mental concepts is also totally meaningless (and the pointers will fail to serve its purpose), as in the realm of concepts there will always be doubts (as the mind will always think 'is this correct? am I getting this right? why is this so, what about this and that...' endless relating, questions, and doubts)</p>
              <p>trying to figure out the pointers at the conceptual level is endless and inconclusive (because the mind has endless doubts and questions) and the mind will never find satisfaction and peace - but once you touch the Certainty of Being, the mind comes to a complete rest. only complete stillness remains, and in that stillness the Truth is manifested in its entirety, with a full non-conceptual and unshakeable conviction<br><br>the only thing certain about your existence is Existence, Being, and Knowing Itself. everything else is speculation<br><br>true spirituality isn't about figuring things out at the mind level (the mind is useful for other practical purpose, but not the direct understanding and experience of our true nature). simply Rest in that blissful non-conceptual certainty of being-awareness</p>
              <p>with all doubts cast aside with that certainty of being, you begin to truly and directly penetrate into the depths of your being and discover its immense aliveness, knowingness, intelligence, presence, spaciousness<br><br>collecting 1000 pointers to the moon is not as good as a direct glimpse of the moon itself<br><br>ultimately pointers point beyond themselves and becomes useless at that point (when what is being pointed to is Seen)<br><br>.................</p>
              <p><strong>Thoughts</strong><br><br>as being-awareness, thoughts do not become a problem</p>
              <p>thoughts only become a problem when they are identified with as 'me' or 'mine'<br><br>when thoughts are identified as 'me' or 'mine', we become engrossed in it and its seriousness. we become hypnotized by our thoughts in an unconscious manner, completely drawn/glued to it.</p>
              <p>it is very much like watching a movie, and becoming so deluded as to think that we are the characters in the movie, and along with it the belief in the stories, drama, pain and suffering, and all kinds of problems relating to that fictitious self-entity.<br><br>when we discover our true identity as being-awareness, we simply watch the characters of the movie but we are not identified with them. we see that there is no separate self identity to be found, except as an illusory image/concept of the mind.<br><br>in the same way, thoughts arise and pass but are not taken seriously because we no longer identify with the mind<br><br>as being-awareness, there is an undercurrent of peace and equanimity in the face of thoughts<br><br>like the luminous sky is ever free and unaffected in the face of clouds. it doesn't grasp, doesn't reject, doesn't rejoice in any clouds. it simply reveals the clouds for what they are, they simply pass by on its own accord.</p>
              <p>all that has ever happened in your life is some thoughts, feelings, sensations, coming and going from the abiding vast presence-awareness.<br><br>thoughts still arise on its own accord spontaneously in response to practical situations, but by resting as presence-awareness, they no longer have a hold on us. endless uncontrollable/compulsive mind chatter ceases</p>
              <p>most importantly, we must not lose intuitive direct non-conceptual recognition of awareness by believing into the dualistic concepts of thoughts. thoughts only understands things indirectly through separation, between 'me' and 'it', be it God, people, things... but the truth is always direct and non-dual. you are one with all that is. through direct realization of our true nature, you'll see the problems of the conceptual/dualistic mind and its inability to comprehend Truth.<br><br>sometimes, mind chatter returns. this is due to strong habitual energy. when the mind chatter is seen to return, simply by recognizing/resting as that pure presence-awareness rather than believing in the thoughts will allow the mind to return to its natural state.<br><br>however there is no need to fight the mind, sometimes the mind refuses to stop, so be it. you are not a thinker or controller of thoughts anyway, you are the awareness of the thoughts</p>
              <p>however realising your true nature does not mean you will feel calmness and peace forever (due to the strong habit energy of the mind to <em>attach</em> and <em>think</em>), though the mind begins to tend towards the natural peace and silence of pure awareness. if however you still feel you do not have calmness in life or you have plenty of concerns and attachments in daily lives, the best practical thing may be to keep a consistent sitting meditation practice, and try as much as possible to extend that meditation into daily lives. see the first post in the thread <span class="forum"> </span> <span class="topic"> <a href="/forums/1728/topics/398247">The

              <p>the greatest rest is not in stopping what you do</p>
              <p>rather, it's in 
                                                                              realizing that you have never been doing anything - ever - everything

              <p>so just be as you are, and you'll see that everything gets spontaneously done in its own time, and everything continues flowing as before in an effortless way without resistance or interference (they are simply left to function as they are in their own ways, with no one at the center doing them/interfering with them)</p>

              <p>Just notice that no matter how sticky or heavy the thoughts or emotions, they are all just appearances arising in the space of bright awareness that you are. Do not fall into the trap that you need to make those things go away. Put the emphasis on what is clear and present. Emphasize your true nature rather than looking to the appearances as a sign for where you stand. Recognition of your ever-free state is natural and simple. The feeling is more of a non-doing, a simple understanding, a relaxation into what is already present and clear. With this, the energy ceases to flow into thoughts and they come to balance of themselves. From there you can also have a good look at the thoughts to see if their basis is true. You do not have to get rid of shadows to see the light of the sun. You just turn in the direction of the sun and see its light. The light of reality is your own presence, your own being. That is what is always present, knowing all the thoughts and feelings.</p>

              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The I AM is already fully present right now, so much so 
                                                                                      that it is like asking 'how do I obtain my eyes?'. You cannot obtain your eye, 
                                                                                      you are already seeing with your eyes. It will be silly to go looking/searching 
                                                                                      outward (with your eyes) for your eyes. Similarly, it would be silly to go 
                                                                                      looking outward (through your Self) for your Self. You just have to notice that 
                                                                                      all along, you are the seeing! You are the non objective Seer, so to go looking 
                                                                                      for your Self outside is to look into the wrong direction. So know that there is 
                                                                                      no need to look for Awareness and Presence. It is simply a matter of pointing 
                                                                                      out, noticing, realizing that Awareness is already present and is what you are. 
                                                                                      It is a simple statement/description of fact, and not a prescription to go out 
                                                                                      and search for it. You will realize that You Are, and that is an ever-present 
                                                                                      fact that always has been so. When you realize, you realize you gained nothing 
                                                                                      new from it: you do not enter a new state, you simply realize something you 
                                                                                      overlooked all along.</span></div>
              <div><em></em> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Nevertheless, the method is indeed important to give 
                                                                                      rise to realization. Any method that leads to realization must be <strong>direct</strong> - means it must be a means that makes a practitioner bypass all the mind's conceptualizations and inference processes which are all indirect and secondary (which is not a direct realization and experience of your true essence and hence leaves doubts), so that you can touch directly and with certainty the essence of your Being without intermediary. On hindsight there was a period when I first started practicing self-inquiry where I was still intellectualizing about this, like how should I practice self inquiry, what does asking 'Before birth Who am I' mean and leads to, etc, which are all sidetracks and distractions because it is still using the mind and indirect inference and hence not a 'direct' approach to realize the essence of Being. </span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So do beware of intellectualizing these things, because it will not lead to Self-Realization - only the direct approach to investigate and look (a non-conceptual exploration) into the essence of Self leads to realization.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>As you may have seen, <span style="font-family: Calibri;">my method of practice is self-inquiry. </span><span style="font-family: 
                  Calibri;"> Self-Inquiry is the method that leads to direct experience 
                  and 
                                                                                      
                  realization of your own essence, presence-awareness, so that no doubts 
                  can arise 
                                                                                      any 
                  more, because that is clearly seen as a self-evident, solid, undeniable 
                  fact of your

              <p>While resting as witnessing awareness just now, theres a glimpse, a shift in perception where its noticed that everything is spontaneously occuring in presence and awareness... such that awareness is recognized as not being 'here' looking at 'there'... the sound is not 'there'.. but its equally 'here' in awareness. Awareness is experiencing the sound from the sound, not from a separate vantage point.. so space like awareness is not in here as a background, rather its a space that encompasses everything and is all-pervasive, non local and without a center. Background and foreground is indistinguishable in Oneness.</p>
              <p>Everything you see, hear, feel, is not 'there'... it's here, in and as Presence-Awareness. It is the self identification that separates subject and object.. but that mental identification is simply more mental stories and subtle mental clinging that sections one part of reality from another... but it does not represent reality as it is. To perceive non-duality one must investigate and see through any 'veils' of separate self identification that prevents non-dual clarity from being fully experienced.</p>
              <p>It's not so much that we have to apply effort to enter a state of non-duality... rather it's that the 'veils' have to be lifted to discover and see the nature of reality as non-dual clearly.</p>
