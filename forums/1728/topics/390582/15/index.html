              <p>AEN: Hi S,</p>
              <div>The self seems so real, the division seems so obvious, it will not be 
                                      obvious that it is simply a ‘view’. That is, the existing framework we use to 
                                      orientate the world is obscuring and shaping our experience.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The magic of ‘view’, its power to ‘blind’ is amazing... much like a 
                                      magical spell creating a made belief division. We will have to revisit the 
                                      transformation of ‘view’ again...</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Therefore we start by loosening the grip by being ‘bare’ in attention as 
                                      a first step towards deconstruction. Means to sense everything in bare, naked, 
                                      awareness... as Thusness have taught: <a title="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/390582?page=14#post_10208045" href="/forums/1728/topics/390582?page=14#post_10208045">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/390582?page=14#post_10208045</a></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>After which we investigate mind-objects, such as ‘body’, ‘face’, ‘self’, 
                                      and so on.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>That is – investigate all the constructs of a ‘body’, a ‘face’, a 
                                      ‘self’.... what we call self or even a face or a body is merely a projected 
                                      felt-sense or image... we feel that there is a face here, but on direct 
                                      evidence, there isn’t a face, a head that is ‘in here’. That felt-sense of a 
                                      face, a head, a body, is actually inferred – for example, by looking into the 
                                      mirror, there is the reflected image of a face, but to imagine that there is a 
                                      real face ‘here’ behind what is being seen is simply that – an imagination, an 
                                      inference. It really cannot be found but is something like a trick of the 
                                      mind, an illusion that we conjured out. Likewise, the sense of a body with a 
                                      specific shape and solid mass ‘here’ is really an inferred construct... it is 
                                      just bits of sensations that we link up to form an apparently solid shape of a 
                                      body which we then identify with.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>If we go by direct observation of experience... a self inside the head, 
                                      behind the face, cannot be found. There is only in the seeing just the seen, 
                                      in the hearing just the heard... without a seer or hearer - just more 
                                      perceptions and sensations, some of which we then reify into an entity with a 
                                      solid shape and characteristic... some of which we then take to imply a self, 
                                      a centerpoint, and so on, yet when that sense of a centerpoint or a self is 
                                      investigated, all we find are only more sensations, perceptions, popping in 
                                      and out like bubbles - which are simply being ‘sensed’ where they are, 
                                      self-luminous as it is, without a cognizer... in the same way that all 
                                      sensations are simply ‘felt’ where they are without a perceiver. At that point 
                                      all constructs are seen through and dropped.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The Bahiya Sutta style of contemplation would be a powerful way to

              <p>Me: If you 
                                    practice noting, and following MTCB style... you should take note that it lacks 
                                    the PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) aspect. I described it in the link to my forum I provided you. Without 
                                    that aspect, the insight into Anatta will be incomplete. The luminous clarity of 
                                    PCE is lacking from such approach... they are dissolving the sense of self from 
                                    the arising and passing.</p>

              <p>Me: Hi S,<br> <br> You are a sincere and humble practitioner and I truthfully hope that you
                                     will achieve swift spiritual break-through. As I am too in a learning 
                                    process, I will try to share with you what I have learnt.<br> <br> First you should break-through the division between subject and object. 
                                    It is OK to experience substantial non-duality first, but it is good to 
                                    bear in mind that there are further phases.<br> <br> When we challenge the boundaries and division between subject and 
                                    object, we are able to collapse our experience into oneness. This is the
                                     phase of substantial non-dual. By challenging the boundary where 
                                    awareness ends and manifestation begin, or the border between awareness 
                                    and content, everything reveals itself to be an expression of a single 
                                    field of undivided awareness. Such that things no longer occur 'In' 
                                    awareness, but 'As' awareness. Everything is equally an expression of 
                                    the infinite field of awareness... and there is no separation whatsoever
                                     between awareness and content, perceiver and perceived, subject and 
                                    object.<br> <br> That is the substantial non-dual phase. After which you can try to 
                                    contemplate, 'in seeing just the seen', 'in hearing just the heard' like
                                     in Bahiya Sutta. This is not just a matter of substantial non-dualism. 
                                    It is not 'everything is Awareness' but that 'there is no Awareness 
                                    apart from the sights, sounds, etc'. So effectively, the term 
                                    'Awareness' is just a label, like the word 'weather', for the myriad of 
                                    self-luminous experiences... it has no independent, permanent existence 
                                    of its own. In seeing, ONLY just the seen. Apart from that there is no 
                                    seeing or awareness. Just the seen, heard, cognized, thought, etc... 
                                    just manifestation. So we no longer see a metaphysical essence. We no 
                                    longer see anything inherent. Not even an 'Awareness'. Instead, we see a
                                     dynamic stream of luminous activities, without an agent, without a 
                                    perceiver, a doer, controller, etc. This is not the inseparability of 
                                    subject and object, but seeing how there is no subject to begin with – 
                                    only self-luminous processes, activities, dharmas.<br> <br> When a person undergo awareness practice until a certain phase – 
                                    non-dual, it is very very important to keep instilling the right view 
                                    and keep breaking the 'essence'. At this point you will need to have 
                                    clarity on anatta and dependent origination in order to refine the 
                                    experience of anatta. Even if one had glimpses and experiences of 
                                    no-mind, one will still be unable to realize anatta, until practitioners
                                     realize that it is not necessary to have an 'essence' at all – it is 
                                    simply a distorted view. So, to penetrate into Anatta, there must be the
                                     willingness to let go of the wrong 'view' entirely – the entire idea of
                                     an 'essence' must be gone. So with the adoption of view, we perfect the
                                     experience until all doubts are gone, and the center is completely gone
                                     – just flat, disjoint, unsupported, dimensionless and pure experience, 
                                    manifested as whatever arises.<br> <br> First investigate and clear the bond of duality, then investigate and clear the bond of inherency.<br> <br> Regards,</p>

              <p><strong>Gradual Path and Direct Path</strong></p>
              <p>Chat took place on 15th April 2011. Slightly edited.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> So gradual method is more stable, while direct method allows you to skip stages, but may be unstable and disconcerting.</p>
              <p><strong>Me:</strong> You can skip stages (referring to <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a>) in gradual methods (depending on which method you practice) as well. Means if you practice Vipassana alone, you will not go through I AM.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> I see. Is it possible to do meditation when walking?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Yes.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>But it is very distracting. A lot of noise. Scenery, movement, and heat even, these days. What kind of meditation is best while walking?</p>
              <p><strong>Me:</strong> If you read Thusness's Vipassana instructions ( <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/419870?page=1">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/419870?page=1</a> ) you would see that his instructions were given to 'Truthz' who asked, '<em>john, how to practise vipassana in daily life?</em>'.</p>
              <p>He also stated that you do not need to concentrate. If you need to concentrate on something, like a particular object, or breath, then you will not be able to focus on your other work in daily living. It is not necessary to focus or concentrate in Thusness's Vipassana. You just need to immerse yourself in sensate clarity, whatever it is that appears at the moment.</p>
              <p>Noise, scenery, movement, all becomes sensuous and delightful. They are all part of your Vipassana practice. You must sort of 'trip on' sensuousness, on sensate actualities. Then even traffic sounds become clear, incredible, wonderful, delightful.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>So basically, just try and immerse yourself in the sensations. But there are so many different sensations.</p>
              <p><strong>Me:</strong> Yes, but at each moment, there is one global sensation so to speak... if we do not hold on to separative constructs. Not a state of oneness, but it is diverse multiplicity being seamlessly experienced.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> You can only direct your mind to one sensation at a time?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>You don't have to direct your mind to anything. It is best to let go of control and just let whatever manifest, manifest in its vivid clarity.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>What about traffic lights?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Traffic sound is part of what manifests. And what manifests is vividly clear, luminous, alive. It is 'aware' of its own accord. There is no 'you' being aware, the sound is its awareness.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> I mean it requires some thinking and awareness to be aware of crossing the road, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Then thinking and focusing would happen.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>You can't just let go, at least not in my experience.</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>You don't have to let go. What I meant was letting go of contrived effort to focus on some particular thing all the time. This is not necessary (unless you are practicing something like mindfulness of breathing in sitting meditation). But focusing, thinking, happens on its own accord according to circumstances. You need focusing to cross the road, drive the car, listen to a lecturer, etc. In any case, there isn't an actual thinker. They just arise according to conditions. But before realization we feel ourselves to be the thinker of thoughts, the doer of deeds, the feeler of feelings, the seer of sights, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 2 joined the conversation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>So far from what I have understood from your articles, the gradual path consists of three stages. The normal deluded stage, then the I AM stage where you feel in tune, interconnected with the world, but there is still a sense of self, a sense of presence, a sense of substance.</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>The I AM stage is the realization that You are that Presence... and this Presence is the universal ground of all beings and all phenomenon. But to answer your question, no, it is not the case that all gradual paths consists of three stages.</p>
              <p>There are many types of gradual path, just as there are many types of direct path. Gradual paths are any path that 'is like polishing the mirror to reveal the luminosity' while the direct path 'aims for direct realization straight away' as stated in my previous conversation. Gradual path focus on the experience first, the realization happens later. Direct path focus on investigating and getting a direct realization.</p>
              <p>For example, Michael Langford's 'Awareness Watching Awareness/Turning Awareness upon itself, to the Pure Presence, to Pure Being' - this is a gradual path leading to I AM.</p>
              <p>Self-inquiry, asking 'Before birth, Who am I?' is a direct path leading to I AM.</p>
              <p>Vipassana is a gradual path leading to Anatta realization. Whereas, contemplating Bahiya Sutta, Ven Buddhaghosa's verses on Anatta, or Thusness's two stanzas of Anatta, or Ruthless Truth/Ciaran's contemplation on 'There is no you, Look!' are all forms of direct path leading to the realization of Anatta.</p>
              <p>So in short, if you practice Vipassana, you do not enter I AM. You will just realize Anatta.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 2: </strong>I heard of this term, 'non-dual luminosity'. Exactly what does it refer to?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>It means if you see something, there is no you seeing something that is separate from you. There is no perceiver-perceived, subject-object duality, dichotomy. There is just pure awareness of whatever is, without distance, without separation, from what is perceived. There is just pure seeing, hearing, without a separate seer, hearer.</p>
              <p>However, non-dual luminosity may not be Anatta. It could be like Thusness Stage 4 kind of insight, substantial non-dualism. (check my last reply to S in the first post of <a href="/forums/1728/topics/390582?page=15">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/390582?page=15</a>) Or it can be a temporary experience of NDNCIDMOP or PCE, which is like a peak experience.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 2: </strong>Ok, with regards to Master Sheng Yen's article which you posted yesterday in the forum, <em>'When you are in the second stage, although you feel that the ‘I’ does not exist, 
                                              the basic substance of the universe, or the Supreme Truth, still exists. 
                                              Although you recognise that all the different phenomena are the extension of 
                                              this basic substance or Supreme Truth, yet there still exists the opposition of 
                                              basic substance versus external phenomena. Not until the distinctions of all 
                                              phenomena disappear, and everything goes back to truth or Heaven, will you have 
                                              absolute peace and unity. As long as the world of phenomena is still active, you 
                                              cannot do away with conflict, calamity, suffering and crime.'</em></p>
              <p>How should I understand Master Sheng Yen's use of "everything goes back to truth or Heaven", especially the word Heaven?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>I think it is a Chinese phrase, or expression. I need to see the Chinese words. But the 'Truth' here is this: <em>...One who has entered Ch’an does not see basic substance and phenomena as two 
                                              things standing in opposition to each other. They cannot even be illustrated as 
                                              being the back and palm of a hand. This is because phenomena themselves are 
                                              basic substance, and apart from phenomena there is no basic substance to be 
                                              found. The reality of basic substance exists right in the unreality of 
                                              phenomena, which change ceaselessly and have no constant form. This is the 
                                              Truth...</em></p>
              <p>You can replace the word 'basic substance' with the word 'weather', or the word 'self' with the word 'weather'. For example:</p>
              <p>...This is because weatherly phenomena (rain, lightning, wind, etc) themselves are weather, and apart from weatherly phenomena (rain, lightning, wind, etc) there is no basic substance to be found. The reality of weather exists right in the unreality of weatherly phenomena (rain, lightning, wind, etc), which change ceaselessly and have no constant form. This is the Truth...</p>
              <p>The problem with us is that, even if we have a transcendental glimpse of luminosity, of non-duality, and so on... due to our framework of viewing things inherently, we treat luminosity as something ultimate, as something inherent.</p>
              <p>Just like the word 'Weather'... Ok, weather is undeniable. But is weather a thing? An entity? If yes, then where is it located as a fixed position?</p>
              <p>It cannot be located, and is not other than these ceaselessly changing phenomenon. The same goes for 'self', 'awareness', 'luminosity', 'basic substance'. They are something being directly realized and experienced, yet reified into something independent and permanent and ultimate... but what we need to see is that the so called 'self' is merely a label collating the conglomerate of five ever-changing aggregates (matter, feelings, perceptions, volition, and consciousness) or the five skandhas, and 'awareness' is merely a label that denotes the six modes of cognizance (Visual consciousness (cakkhu-viññÄ�na), Auditory consciousness
                                                                      (sotÄ�-viññÄ�na), Nasal consciousness (ghÄ�na-viññÄ�na), Taste
                                                                      consciousness (jihvÄ�-viññÄ�na), Tactile consciousness
                                                                      (kÄ�ya-viññÄ�na), Mind-consciousness (mano-viññÄ�na), the same goes for 'luminosity' and 'basic substance'.</p>
              <p>There is nothing ultimate to be found. After realizing Anatta, you should apply the same insight onto objects: chairs, tables, weather, all are like the 'weather' analogy... unlocatable, apart from a stream of insubstantial activities. Vivid, luminous, alive, yet like a mirage, like bubbles, like a dream.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>To borrow Thusness's words, the realization of "I AM" is to be able to perceive without intermediary, the perceived?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>In the realization of "I AM", you are able to have direct perception of I AM without intermediary. Means there is just that, I AMness, no concepts, no division, no dualistic separation. And not only that, there is a realization and utter conviction of something undeniable. So you no longer have doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>Is "I AM" and luminosity synonymous with each other?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Yes and no. I AM is only an aspect of luminosity pertaining to mind consciousness. There are 18 dhatus (the six sense objects, six sense faculties, and six sense consciousness) - see <a href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Eighteen_dhatus">http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Eighteen_dhatus</a>. 'I AM' is simply pure consciousness of the mind realm. It is luminosity pertaining to the mental realm. Therefore, I AM is only the luminosity of a single dhatu. In particular, it is the luminosity of non-conceptual thought. Not the entirety of mind consciousness as mind consciousness can refer to a myriad of mental experiences like conceptualization, emotions, remembering, imagination, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>Then the realization of Anatta 'extends' the realization of luminosity from mind-consciousness to eye... ear... nose... tongue... body... consciousnesses?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Yes.</p>
              <p>What people realize as 'I AM' is simply the non-conceptual thought which is a particular manifestation of mind-consciousness, and this realization and experience is being reified into something ultimate, independent, permanent, Self. It is seen to be something special and more ultimate than other phenomena.</p>
              <p>In Anatta, all realms become 'flat'. Because if in seeing there is just the seen without seer, then everything becomes implicitly non-dual and luminous (without reifying a non-dual substance or Absolute). There is no more hierarchy, no more treating a particular dhatu as something more ultimate than another. There is no more 'treating a speck of dust as ultimate and making every other phenomena dusty' to put it in Thusness's way of speaking.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 2: </strong>If a person claims to not feel anger when insulted, even thanking the person who scolded him, for example, does that indicate No Self? (I have my own opinion, but I wanna hear from you guys)</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>Not necessarily, because realizing not-self does not mean the fetters are completely cut off. So if the conditions are right for anger to arise, then it is unavoidable. Only arhats and above are incapable of feeling anger. But realizing anatta is only stream-entry.</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>To Participant 2: Well first of all, No Self is not a state. It is a fact about existence. It means always already, there never was a self. There never was an agent. So this is about a realization. It is like what I said just now regarding 'weather'. All along, there is no 'weather' to be found. It is just a convenient label for a conglomerate of ceaselessly changing phenomena. So how can there be an entity called 'weather' to be found anywhere? So having realized this, do you say that suddenly, there is no more weather? This is obviously not the case. 'No Weather' is not talking about the disappearance of weather. It is simply pointing out a fact about reality, that there is no independent, unchanging, locatable entity called 'Weather' anywhere. 'Weather' is simply a convenient label for the everchanging weatherly phenomenon. The same goes for No Self. No Self is not a state, it is simply pointing out a fact about reality, that there is no independent, permanent, locatable self or agent. And Self is a mere convenient label for the five skandhas.</p>
              <p>A fetter-model first stage Sotapanna realizes Anatta or what you call No Self, whereas a fetter-model fourth stage Arhant has removed all traces of defilements, afflictions, attachments, passionate emotions, and sense of self. That is the difference.</p>
              <p>To Participant 1: Even the fetter-model third stage Anagamis have already stopped cravings for sensual pleasures as well as anger, worry and fear... needless to speak of the fetter-model Arhant.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 2: </strong>It (realising No Self) is about realising a fact.</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Precisely... you simply realize that it has always been so. All along, in seeing always just the seen, no seer. In hearing always just the heard, no hearer. So it is not the case that you dissolve the seer or hearer, it is that there never was a seer or hearer to begin with, and you realize that this has always been the case. However for those who experienced a peak experience, aka a NDNCDIMOP or a PCE, these people haven't realized anatta as a dharma seal, as a fact about reality. So they may be under the impression that suddenly, the self disappeared, and then returned later on. That is because the bond of 'self' temporarily goes into abeyance. But without the insight, it becomes just a state that comes and goes... he does not realize anything. So he might think that 'I became the sound' or 'I suddenly dissolved for a moment', not realizing that all along, there never was an 'I', a perceiver, an agent.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>I still can't believe you can memorise the acronym NDNCDIMOP lol.</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Non dual, non conceptual, direct, immediate mode of perception. Easy to remember.</p>

                                      realization but now it’s simply viewed as a thought - and no more intimately me
                                      than a sight or sound so it is nothing like a background. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is not that I AM is a still formless
                                      presence underlying forms. That so called I AM is simply a manifestation of intimate
                                      (non-dual) non-conceptual thought, reified into an ultimate identity. After
                                      non-dual is experienced, one no longer clings to that formless Presence as an
                                      ultimate identity.</span></p>

                                      clear nondual experience, so that person now has an grandiose,
                                      unified identity view like "I am everything and I am everywhere" or "Brahman
                                      is the world". It is like ‘firewood becomes ash’ - it is an illusion to
                                      think that awareness is, or becomes, the world. This is distinct from the
                                      realization of "in the seeing just the seen" such that the radiant
                                      world/every experience only references itself without dualistic and inherent
                                      thought. There is nothing I, nothing Me, just seeing/seen, hearing/heard,
                                      thinking/thought, activities occurring yet without anything linking a thought
                                      with another, an experience with another. </span></p>

                                      complete as it is, disjoint, and unsupported. ‘Awareness’ is a manifestation (and 'Awareness' is simply and only the six forms of cognizance: five senses + mental cognizance). ‘The

                                      coming, or going. When we have non-inherent and non-dual insight, we do not make the mistaken of those who have non-dual insight/experience but view of inherency (thinking that 'Awareness' is an entity identical with, or that it becomes, or that it transforms into the 'world').<br></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The insight of anatta (in the seeing
                                      just the seen) along with the insight of everything being disjoint and
                                      self-releasing allows one to become traceless.<br> <br> The nondual, noninherent view releases every dual and inherent though,
                                      releasing every experience without traces, so that there is only direct
                                      experiencing without views... Viewlessness.<br> <br> I think both the inquiry "what is nonconceptual thought without
                                      thinker" and "who am I" can lead to similar experiences yet very
                                      different realization. But imo it’s better for people to go through the I Am
                                      realization first, followed by non-dual and anatta, as otherwise it is not easy for there to be stable, deep, penetrating insight into Anatta.<br></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I was doing self inquiry yesterday, 'Who am
                      I', 'Before Birth Who am I'... with an intense desire to know the truth of my
                      being. As the thoughts subside, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>an intense and palpable sense of beingness and
                      presence, the only 'thing' that remains that I feel to be my innermost
                      essence... became very obvious... very very vivid and intense, and feels like a
                      constant background in which everything is taking place, thoughts (almost none
                      at that moment, but arise afterwards) that arise are also taking place in this
                      unchanging background... and there is this certainty and doubtlessness about
                      this I AM-ness, IT is absolutely real and undeniable. IT/I AMness/The Witness
                      is the only solid and undoubtable Presence and is clearly present with or
                      without thoughts.</strong></span></span> I remembered briefly thinking after having experienced that,
                      "So this is it! This is enlightenment!" and "No, not
                      enlightenment", but it’s funny how these thoughts are just passing
                      thoughts like wind, occurring in this solid constant undoubtable sense of
                      presence. Inconsequential and illusory doubts and concepts are arising within
                      undoubtable presence... passes away as soon as they arise because there is no
                      more identification with the mind/ego. After all, I am just this Reality, this
                      background of awareness that is ever-present and watching, I'm not any of those
                      thoughts that come and go. The part that thinks 'I am enlightened' or 'I am not
                      enlightened', that is not what I am and can never be 'enlightened' and thus
                      totally irrelevant, while what I am, is always already completely clear and
                      perfect beyond doubt, already and always perfectly 'awake'/'aware'. From the
                      perspective of Consciousness, all thoughts and perceptions are just illusory
                      appearances coming and going within consciousness. I just found a quote by
                      Nisargadatta Maharaj that puts it so well: "<span style="color: purple;">This
                      reality is so concrete, so actual, so much more tangible than mind and matter,
                      that compared to it even diamond is soft like butter. This overwhelming
                      actuality makes the world dreamlike, misty, irrelevant.</span>"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Just a pure sense of existence and beingness.
                      An unmoving context, like a screen in which the entire display of life is shown
                      in. This background of presence and awareness is formless, behind, and prior to
                      all thoughts and forms. Feels most vivid when there is no engagement in
                      thoughts, no thoughts, just BEING it. Though, thoughts that arise didn't affect
                      the background sense of presence. Presence remains unmoved, unaffected,
                      undeniably present. It may be apparently obscured when the attention goes all
                      out at thoughts and feelings, such that we are so totally identified with them
                      that we think that they are the entirety of our being. That is why we need to
                      self-inquire seriously, not taking any concepts to be truth, but relentlessly
                      inquire into the depths of our being without any conceptual perception until we
                      feel with confidence this solid, thoughtless being and presence is the
                      undeniable, unmoving essence of being. It reveals itself easily if we let go of
                      our thoughts in meditation, like a jewel at the bottom of the lake reveals
                      itself if the surface is calm.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Keep inquiring: Who am I?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Doubt (stop following) every single thought
                      until only the undoubtable, vivid, non-conceptual self-knowing Presence and
                      Beingness remains. It is free from all conceptual constructs, separation and
                      attributes. Understand that no concepts and thoughts are an accurate
                      representation of reality, self, or the world. Absolutely no thought is the
                      (absolute) truth. Naked Self-Knowing Presence is the only source of true
                      certainty, all thoughts are doubtable and disposable, like a dream that when we
                      wake up we realise to be simply projections and imaginations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You are non-dual self-knowing Awareness.
                      Without even using thoughts, you can't deny that sense of existence that You
                      Are. That which knows/is certain of I AM is I AM itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">That which is sure of its existence – the
                      innermost<br> certainty of I Am – is what you essentially are. In<br> other words: I Am this knowing that knows that I Am.</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> - Leo Hartong</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thusness commented I should experience the
                      impersonality aspect (note: not anatta, but the impersonally aspect of AMness) so
                      much so that I feel I share the ‘same source’, and though I have realised the
                      Self, I have not yet realised that it is the 'non-conceptual, direct' that
                      gives the 'certainty', the undoubtedness. This is what makes the experience of
                      I AM different from ordinary dualistic experience, which has intermediary, is
                      dualistic, and secondary. No direct-ness. And... the depth and intensity of
                      experience can still be improved. He said that if I pursue the experience then
                      non-conceptuality becomes a hindrance and I will suffer because I cannot
                      overcome the arising thoughts, which will lead to struggling. Which I fully
                      agree because the next thing after meditation, frustration started happening
                      for me, when there’s an attempt to 'get back' to the experience and don't know
                      how. Yet, all attempts are secondary, like trying to rest the mind in awareness
                      when awareness has always been at rest, trying to stop mind movement when
                      Awareness has always been the still point of the turning world.  He also
                      told me deeply inquire on the old philosophical question about whether a tree
                      in the forest would make a sound if no one were there to hear it. It will lead
                      to nondual experience. If I were to go through the motion, I will not realise
                      it. It must be the sort of experience I have with I AMness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Note: this is not enlightenment in Buddhism as
                      it is not the realisation of anatta and emptiness. It is Self-Realization, a
                      form of awakening, but not yet the enlightenment of Arhants or Bodhisattvas or
                      Buddhas. See </span><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thusness/PasserBy's
                      Seven Stages of Enlightenment</span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> for more info. I
                      am merely noting some of the experiences I have, I'm just a learner and
                      practitioner.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With regards to the above experience, Thusness
                      also said that this is the Rigpa, the luminous presence, the light... it is
                      just (a matter of having) the right understanding of this with the right view.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As the Buddha himself taught in the earliest
                      Pali suttas, "This mind, monks, is luminous, but it is defiled by taints
                      that come from without. But this the uninstructed worldlings understand not as
                      it really is, wherefore for the uninstructed worldlings there is no cultivation
                      of the mind, I declare. This mind, monks, is luminous, and it is cleansed of
                      taints that come from without. Wherefore, for the uninstructed noble disciple
                      there is cultivation of the mind, I declare." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Also, I have had many previous glimpses both
                      in and out of meditation of the I AM/Witness... what makes this somewhat
                      different from the previous experiences is the sense of certainty and
                      doubtlessness of Being. It is hard to explain.</span></p>

                                          <strong>is the practice of "without thinking" (hishiryo): which is
                                          also called no-mind (mushin; wu-hsin), the essence of Zen
                                          Enlightenment</strong>. Here we shall discuss "thinking,"
                                          "not-thinking" and "without thinking."<br> <br> A. THINKING (shiryo): This is our habitual tendency to stay in the
                                          mode of conceptualizing thought.<br> <br> 1. About "thinking" a) Noetic Attitude: positional (either
                                          affirming or negating); b) Noematic Content: conceptualized
                                          objects.<br> <br> a) Noetic Attitude is positional (either affirming or negating): A
                                          subject is adopting an intentional stance toward an object and,
                                          specifically, thinking about it in either a positive or negative
                                          way: "This is an X" or "This is not an X," "Do X" or "Do not do
                                          X."<br> <br> (1) Consciousness is an intentional vector proceeding from a
                                          subject to an object. The subject is a cognitive agent.<br> <br> b) Noematic Content: X is an intentional object pointed to and
                                          conceived through our thoughts.<br> <br> 2. "Thinking" can be pictured as follows:<br> <br> c) Aspects of "thinking":<br> <br> (1) Subject-object division present: an active subject thinks an
                                          object.<br> <br> (2) Non-immediacy: We do not experience the object immediately but
                                          only at a distance, as removed subjects, and only through the
                                          thoughts we have of the object.<br> <br> (3) Non-fullness: We do not experience the object in its fullness
                                          or "suchness" but, rather, only as filtered through our thinking
                                          about it.<br> <br> B. NOT-THINKING (fushiryo): About "not-thinking": (1) noetic
                                          attitude: positional (only negating); (2) noematic content:
                                          thinking (as objectified).<br> <br> 1. Noetic attitude is positional (only negating): Subject is agent
                                          seeking to suppress its thinking.<br> <br> 2. Noematic content: The object is now the "second-order" object
                                          "thinking about X."<br> <br> "Not-thinking" can be pictured as follows:<br> <br> 3. Aspects of "not-thinking": Same as for "thinking."<br> <br> a) Consciousness is still an intentional-vector proceeding from a
                                          subject to the object. The subject is still functioning as agent,
                                          even if one trying to bring an end to its own agency.<br> <br> <strong>C. WITHOUT THINKING (hishiryo): This is no-thought (munen;
                                          wu-nien) or no-mind (mushin; wu-hsin): pure immediacy in the
                                          fullness of things as they are.<br> <br> 1. About "not-thinking": (1) noetic attitude: nonpositional
                                          (neither affirming nor negating); (2) noematic content: pure
                                          presence of things as they are (genjokoan).<br> <br> a) Noetic attitude is nonpositional (neither affirming nor
                                          negating): Consciousness is no longer an intentional vector
                                          proceeding from a subject to an object but is, rather, an open
                                          dynamic field in which objects present themselves.<br> <br> b) Noematic content: The object is no longer an object that is the
                                          target of an intentional act but is, rather, the object itself as
                                          it presents itself within the open dynamic field of
                                          consciousness.<br> <br> c) Aspects of "without thinking":<br> <br> (1) No subject-object distinction: The subject has disappearedÂ—this
                                          being the Zen interpretation of Buddhist anatta or no-mind.<br> <br> (2) Immediacy: Without a subject standing back, the experience is
                                          one of immediacy within the dynamic field of consciousness.<br> <br> (3) Fullness: Because the object is not filtered through an
                                          intentional act, it presents itself in its fullness.<br> <br> (4) Such immediacy and fullness are genjokoan, "pure presence of
                                          things as they are."</strong><br> <br> It is a serious mistake in the understanding of Zen to refer merely
                                          to the "denial" or "cessation" of "conceptual thinking." Regardless
                                          of whether or not it can be proven than the pre-Buddhist Sanskrit
                                          etymology of the term Dhyana can be shown to have no-thought
                                          connotations, the main concern here is the semantic development
                                          undergone by the Chinese term ch'an in the course of the production
                                          of the Ch'an texts in East Asia.<br> <br> It is quite clear that in Ch'an Buddhism, <strong>no-mind, rather
                                          than referring to an absence of thought, refers to the condition of
                                          not being trapped in thoughts, not adhering to a certain conceptual
                                          habit or position.</strong><br> <br> The error of interpretation made by many scholars (and by Zen
                                          practitioners as well) lies precisely in taking the term
                                          "no-thought" to refer to some kind of permanent, or ongoing absence
                                          of thought. While this assumption is routinely made, it is
                                          impossible to corroborate it in the Ch'an canon. If we study the
                                          seminal texts carefully, we do find a description of the experience
                                          of an instantaneous severing of thought that occurs in the course
                                          of a thoroughgoing pursuit of a Buddhist meditative exercise.<br> <br> Nowhere in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Platform Sutra,

                                          of all conceptual activity. (source)</p>

              <p>On the contrary, Richard says that everybody has had PCEs some point in their lives before.</p>
              <p>....................</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: normal;"><em> </em> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 5px 0pt 5px 20px;"><strong>Richard: </strong>A
                   PCE is when one’s sense of
                  identity temporarily vacates the throne and apperception occurs. 
                  Apperception is the mind’s perception of itself … it is a
                  pure awareness . Normally the mind perceives through the senses and 
                  sorts the data received according to its predilection; but the
                  mind itself remains unperceived ... it is taken to be unknowable. 
                  Apperception is when the ‘thinker’ and the ‘feeler’ is
                  not and an unmediated awareness occurs. The pure consciousness 
                  experience is as if one has eyes in the back of one’s head; there
                  is a three hundred and sixty degree awareness and all is self-evidently 
                  clear.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px 0pt 5px 20px;">This is knowing by direct experience, unmoderated by
                  any ‘self’ whatsoever. One is able to see that ‘I’ and ‘me’ have been standing in the way of the perfection and purity
                  that is the essential character of this moment of being here becoming apparent. Here a solid and irrefutable native intelligence
                  can operate freely because the ‘thinker’ and the ‘feeler’ is in abeyance. One is the universe ’s experience of itself as
                  a human being ... after all, the very stuff this body is made of is the very stuff of the universe. There is no ‘outside’ to
                  the perfection of the universe to come from; one only thought and felt that one was a separate identity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 5px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Apperception is something that brings the facticity born out of a
                  direct experience of the actual . Then what one is (‘what’ not ‘who’) is these sense organs in operation: this seeing is
                  me, this hearing is me, this tasting is me, this touching is me, this smelling is me, and this thinking is me. Whereas ‘I’,
                  the identity, am inside the body: looking out through ‘my’ eyes as if looking out through a window, listening through ‘my’
                  ears as if they were microphones, tasting through ‘my’ tongue, touching through ‘my’ skin, smelling through ‘my’ nose,
                  and thinking through ‘my’ brain.</span> <span style="font-size: normal;">Of course ‘I’ must feel isolated, alienated, alone and lonely, for
                  ‘I’ am cut off from the magnificence of the actual world – the world as-it-is – by ‘my’ very presence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 5px 13px 5px 10px;">To get out of stuckness and induce a
                  Pure Consciousness Experience one gets off one’s backside and does whatever one knows best to activate delight. From the
                  position of delight, one can vitalize one’s joie de vivre by the amazement at the fun of it all ... and then one can – with
                  sufficient abandon – become over-joyed and move into marvelling at being here and doing this business called being alive. Then
                  one is no longer intellectually making sense of life ... the wonder of it all drives all intellectual sense away. Such delicious
                  wonder fosters the innate condition of naiveté (which is the closest one can get to innocence ) the nourishing of which is
                  essential if the charm of it all is to occur. Then, as one stares intently at the world about by glancing lightly with caressing
                  eyes, out of the corner of one’s eye comes – sweetly – the magical fairy-tale-like paradise that this verdant earth actually
                  is ... and I am the experiencing of what is happening. But try not to possess it and make it your own ... or else ‘twill vanish
                  as softly as it appeared.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px 13px 5px 10px;">When one remembers a PCE – or
                  precipitates another – then one is well on the way to freedom ... this is what actualism is all about. Scattered along the wide
                  and wondrous path to an actual freedom are as many PCEs as one may need ... repeated peak experiences may very well be brought
                  about on maybe a daily basis with constant application of reflective and fascinated contemplation . In such pure contemplation,
                  ‘I’ cease seeing and seeing takes place of its own accord. ‘I’ can never be here now in this actual world for ‘I’ am
                  an interloper, an alien in psychic possession of the body. ‘I’ do not belong here.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 13px; margin-top: 8px;">All
                   this is impossible to imagine which is why it is
                  essential to be confident that the actual world does exist. This 
                  confidence is born out of knowing, which is derived from the PCE,
                  and is an essential ingredient to ensure success. One does not have to 
                  generate confidence oneself – as the religions require of
                  one with regard to their blind faith – the purity of the actual world 
                  bestows this confidence upon one. The experience of purity
                  is a benefaction. Out of this blessing comes pure intent, which will 
                  consistently guide one through daily life, gently ushering in
                  an increasing ease and generosity of character. With this growing 
                  magnanimity, one becomes more and more anonymous, more and more
                  self-less. With this expanding altruism one becomes less and less 
                  self-centred, less and less egocentric. Eventually the moment
                  comes wherein something definitive happens, physically, inside the brain
                   and ‘I’ am nevermore.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 13px; margin-top: 8px;">...............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>RICHARD:</strong> As a generalisation, pure consciousness experiences (PCE’s) are more
                  prevalent in childhood and the memory is tucked away in an area of the brain not normally accessed. Because a PCE has no
                  emotional/ passional qualities whatsoever – there is no affective being present to record the memory in its affective memory
                  banks – it cannot be remembered in the normal way (reverie, reminiscence, nostalgia, and so on).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Also, ‘I’ can have a vested interest in disremembering a PCE as it could very well
                  be the beginning of the end of ‘me’.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Mostly PCE’s happen for no demonstrable reason at all – as in being a serendipitous
                  event – and quite often occur in everyday surroundings doing everyday things such as washing the dishes (for instance) and can
                  be quite brief ... I can recall being on a farmhouse veranda at age eight, looking into the glistening white of a full glass of
                  milk in the early morning sunshine, when it happened for the entity within.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Often in my early childhood there would be a ‘slippage’ of the brain, somewhat
                  analogous to an automatic transmission changing into a higher gear too soon, and the magical world where time had no workaday
                  meaning would emerge in all its sparkling wonder ... where I could wander for hours at a time in gay abandon with whatever was
                  happening.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">They were the pre-school 
                  years: soon such experiences would occur of a weekend ... so
                  much so that I would later on call them ‘Saturday Morning’ experiences 
                  where, contrary to having to be dragged out of bed
                  during the week, I would be up and about at first light, traipsing 
                  through the fields and the forests with the early morning rays
                  of sunshine dancing their magic on the glistening dew-drops suspended 
                  from the greenery everywhere; where kookaburras are echoing
                  their laughing-like calls to one another and magpies are warbling their 
                  liquid sounds; where an abundance of aromas and scents are
                  drifting fragrantly all about; where every pore of the skin is being 
                  caressed by the friendly ambience of the balmy air; where
                  benevolence and benignity streams endlessly bathing all in its 
                  impeccable integrity.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">This magical world is what occasions me to write like this:</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">• [Richard]: ‘When one walks 
                  naked (sans ‘I’ as ego and ‘me’ as soul) in
                  the infinitude of this actual universe there is the direct experiencing 
                  that there is something precious in living itself.
                  Something beyond compare. Something more valuable than any ‘King’s 
                  Ransom’. It is not rare gemstones; it is not singular
                  works of art; it is not the much-prized bags of money; it is not the 
                  treasured loving relationships; it is not the highly esteemed
                  blissful and rapturous ‘States Of Being’ ... it is not any of these 
                  things usually considered precious. There is something
                  ultimately precious that makes the ‘sacred’ a mere bauble.<br> It is the essential character of the infinitude of the universe – which is the life-giving foundation of all that is apparent
                  – as a physical actuality. The limpid and lucid purity and perfection of actually being just here at this place in infinite
                  space right now at this moment in eternal time is akin to the crystalline perfection and purity seen in a dew-drop hanging from
                  the tip of a leaf in the early-morning sunshine; the sunrise strikes the transparent bead of moisture with its warming rays,
                  highlighting the flawless correctness of the tear-drop shape with its bellied form. One is left almost breathless with wonder at
                  the immaculate simplicity so exemplified ... and everyone I have spoken with at length has experienced this impeccable integrity
                  and excellence in some way or another at varying stages in their life.<br> This preciosity is what one is as-one-is – me as I am in actuality as distinct from ‘me’ as ‘I’ am in reality – for
                  one is the universe’s experience of itself’.<a href="http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/listbcorrespondence/listb19k.htm#27Oct01"><img src="http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/images/footnote-link.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="9"></a></p>

              <p><strong class="bbc">Experience, Realization, and View</strong></p>
              <p>Our paradigm, view, insights, experiences, affect our every moment perception of life, self, the universe. Speaking from experience, this is what a seeker might go through:</p>
              <p><strong>Duality</strong></p>
              <p>Generally every normal non-spiritual person sees himself as a subject, self, perceiver, doer, which is a psychic entity conceived as locating inside the body - be it inside the head behind the eyes or in the heart or some other locations.</p>
              <p>This conceived psychic entity causes a sense of alienation as 'I' am inside my body, looking outwards at the world through my eyes, ears, etc. I am self-contracted, separated from the world out there, and so experience is divided into 'inner' and 'outer'. Reality consists of three components: I, the seer, sees the world out there. (Seer, seeing, seen) I, the doer, does the deed (Doer, doing, done). All these actions, and perceptions, are felt to have occured by virtue of this psychic entity residing inside my body, which I call Me.</p>
              <p>This mentally conceived sense of alienation from a separate objective world resulting from the perceived existence of a separate self and psychic entity residing within this body-mind results in all manners of passionate feelings such as fear, anger, craving, malice, sorrow, and all forms of destructive undertakings endemic in our world: war, murder, torture, rape, domestic violence, corruption and so on.</p>
              <p>Basically it comes down to this: craving (craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for extermination), which arises due to the view of there being an inherently existing self alienated from the world, whereby the self must always get away from unpleasant experiences and chase after pleasant experiences, in search for happiness and the attenuation of suffering, not knowing this process of craving is precisely what causes suffering.</p>
              <p><strong>Self-Realization, Partial Duality</strong></p>
              <p>By the practice of contemplating on the Source of experiencing ("Who am I?", "Who is the Source?"), we trace the radiance back to the essence of mind-consciousness. At the moment where the seeker reaches the pinnacle of his self-inquiry, one has a non-dual, non-conceptual, direct, immediate perception of the self-luminosity of mind's Presence. The self-felt certainty arising from the non-dual, non-conceptual, 
                                                                                                                                                                                                        direct, immediate mode of perception (NDNCDIMOP) of mind's luminosity leads to a self-felt 
                                                                                                                                                                                                        certainty that results in utter conviction of having touched the essence
                                                                                                                                                                                                         of being and existence. As all doubts pertaining to the nature of one's identity can no longer linger, one's self-inquiry into 'Who am I' comes to a closing conclusion. Being absolutely intimate as a sheer sense of Presence, Beingness, and Existence, shining in plain view prior to conceptual sullying, it is nevertheless immediately reified due to the paradigm and view of duality and inherency, even though in itself it is a non-dual perception.</p>
              <p>What it is reified into is a grander entity than the psychic entity conceived as locating in the body as previously conceived. Though the psychic entity located inside the body, aka. the ego, is now being released through seeing the falsity of a personal self, the Identity remains intact at large, now expanding to become a Metaphysical entity transcending space and time, the grand, impersonal, and universal Self that is birthless and deathless. Due to the view of duality still largely being intact - Presence and Awareness is also seen as the Eternal Witness, an impartial and unchanging watcher of all phenomena that passes. 'I' am God, the ground of being, the source of all animate and inanimate objects, the universal consciousness underlying all my manifestations which comes and goes like waves in the ocean of Being.</p>
              <p>All along not knowing that what they have realized is simply an aspect of luminosity pertaining to non-conceptual thought, a manifestation of mind-cognizance, and is as such nothing ultimate or special (as compared to any other manifestations).</p>
              <p><strong>Non-Duality</strong></p>
              <p>Via the contemplation into the absence of a separate self or the seamlessness of awareness and its contents, a direct and experiential realization that the subject-object separation and dichotomy is illusory arises. Everything is experienced at zero-distance in the absence of the bond of dualistic psychic construct.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless at the beginning, as the insight of non-duality arises but not the insight into no-inherency, one ends up falling into:</p>
              <p><strong>Substantial Non-duality</strong></p>
              <p>- subject-object dichotomy collapses, and is subsumed, into inherent oneness</p>
              <p>- due to the view of inherency (that reality must have 'existence' located somewhere and somewhen, even if it is Here and Now), the vivid 'realness' of non-dual luminosity is being treated as something Absolute, as having inherent, independent and unchanging existence, and is being reified into Noumenon (in contrast to illusory phenomenon), and as being the ultimate non-dual Self</p>
              <p>- the intimacy experienced via the collapse of subject-object dichotomy is being referenced to a grandiose all-pervasive Self ("I am Everywhere and I am Everything")</p>
              <p>- all phenomena are seen to be illusory projections of a single underlying source, such that all phenomena are self-expressions of the single nature of Awareness, as depicted by the analogy of the mirror and its reflections - reflections as such do not have an objective, independent existence outside the mirror - and in fact only the Mirror is seen to have absolute, independent, inherent existence - only the Mirror is Real, and the appearances are only Real as the Mirror</p>
              <p>- appearances are inseparable from the Source, and yet the Source is independent of appearances</p>
              <p><strong>Insubstantial Non-duality</strong></p>
              <p>- also known as the arising insight into anatta, it is seen that seeing, cognizing, awareness is precisely and only what is seen, heard, tasted, touched, manifesting</p>
              <p>- the intimacy experienced via the lack of separation has no frame of reference due to the lack of something inherent - in the seeing is just the seen, in the hearing is just the heard, there is no True Self of any sorts - the world only references itself without an agent</p>
              <p>- there is no grandiose, universal consciousness, only individual bodies and mindstreams interacting with each other due to interdependent origination, without any conceived 'underlying oneness behind multiplicity' - absolutely no identity remains, even the notion that "I am you and you are me" is seen as absurd</p>
              <p>- there is no such thing as 'seamlessness of awareness and contents' or 'inseperability of awareness and its contents' - for awareness IS the process and activities of cognizance only, there is no such thing as 'awareness + its contents'</p>
              <p>- seeing, cognizing, awaring never exists as nouns pointing to a noumenon but as verbs collating various activities of cognizance - what is seen, heard, taste, touch, are activities manifesting on its own accord with the presence of requisite conditions and factors via interdependent origination, without an agent, perceiver, controller, doer</p>
              <p>- further penetration into anatta reveals that all phenomena are disjoint, unsupported, unlinked, bubble-like, insubstantial, dream-like, and self-releasing - there is absolutely nothing, not even an Awareness that underlies two thoughts, two manifestations - in fact there is not even two thoughts as such, just this thought, which spontaneously self-releases upon inception leaving absolutely no traces</p>
              <p>- there is absolutely no collapsing of subject-object dichotomy into a base existing somewhere, even as a Here/Now - there is no linking base or source at all, only the experience of dispersed-out and de-linked multiplicity</p>
              <p>- all manifestations are intrinstically luminous and vivid yet insubstantial and vanishes without a trace upon inception like drawing pictures on water manifests vivid appearances that does not leave trace - no existence of any sorts can leave traces when reality is a dream-like process with no inherent existence, like an illusion but not an illusion</p>

              <p>On the contrary, Richard says that everybody has had PCEs some
              point in their lives before.</p>
              <p>....................</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px 0pt 5px 20px;"><strong>Richard:</strong> A
              PCE is when one’s sense of identity temporarily vacates the throne
              and apperception occurs. Apperception is the mind’s perception of
              itself … it is a pure awareness . Normally the mind perceives
              through the senses and sorts the data received according to its
              predilection; but the mind itself remains unperceived ... it is
              taken to be unknowable. Apperception is when the ‘thinker’ and the
              ‘feeler’ is not and an unmediated awareness occurs. The pure
              consciousness experience is as if one has eyes in the back of one’s
              head; there is a three hundred and sixty degree awareness and all
              is self-evidently clear.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px 0pt 5px 20px;">This is knowing by direct
              experience, unmoderated by any ‘self’ whatsoever. One is able to
              see that ‘I’ and ‘me’ have been standing in the way of the
              perfection and purity that is the essential character of this
              moment of being here becoming apparent. Here a solid and
              irrefutable native intelligence can operate freely because the
              ‘thinker’ and the ‘feeler’ is in abeyance. One is the universe ’s
              experience of itself as a human being ... after all, the very stuff
              this body is made of is the very stuff of the universe. There is no
              ‘outside’ to the perfection of the universe to come from; one only
              thought and felt that one was a separate identity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 5px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Apperception is something that
              brings the facticity born out of a direct experience of the actual
              . Then what one is (‘what’ not ‘who’) is these sense organs in
              operation: this seeing is me, this hearing is me, this tasting is
              me, this touching is me, this smelling is me, and this thinking is
              me. Whereas ‘I’, the identity, am inside the body: looking out
              through ‘my’ eyes as if looking out through a window, listening
              through ‘my’ ears as if they were microphones, tasting through ‘my’
              tongue, touching through ‘my’ skin, smelling through ‘my’ nose, and
              thinking through ‘my’ brain.</span> <span>Of course ‘I’ must feel isolated, alienated,
              alone and lonely, for ‘I’ am cut off from the magnificence of the
              actual world – the world as-it-is – by ‘my’ very
              presence.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 5px 13px 5px 10px;">To get out of stuckness and
              induce a Pure Consciousness Experience one gets off one’s backside
              and does whatever one knows best to activate delight. From the
              position of delight, one can vitalize one’s joie de vivre by the
              amazement at the fun of it all ... and then one can – with
              sufficient abandon – become over-joyed and move into marvelling at
              being here and doing this business called being alive. Then one is
              no longer intellectually making sense of life ... the wonder of it
              all drives all intellectual sense away. Such delicious wonder
              fosters the innate condition of naiveté (which is the closest one
              can get to innocence ) the nourishing of which is essential if the
              charm of it all is to occur. Then, as one stares intently at the
              world about by glancing lightly with caressing eyes, out of the
              corner of one’s eye comes – sweetly – the magical fairy-tale-like
              paradise that this verdant earth actually is ... and I am the
              experiencing of what is happening. But try not to possess it and
              make it your own ... or else ‘twill vanish as softly as it
              appeared.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px 13px 5px 10px;">When one remembers a PCE – or
              precipitates another – then one is well on the way to freedom ...
              this is what actualism is all about. Scattered along the wide and
              wondrous path to an actual freedom are as many PCEs as one may need
              ... repeated peak experiences may very well be brought about on
              maybe a daily basis with constant application of reflective and
              fascinated contemplation . In such pure contemplation, ‘I’ cease
              seeing and seeing takes place of its own accord. ‘I’ can never be
              here now in this actual world for ‘I’ am an interloper, an alien in
              psychic possession of the body. ‘I’ do not belong here.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 13px; margin-top: 8px;">All this is impossible to imagine which is why it is essential to
              be confident that the actual world does exist. This confidence is
              born out of knowing, which is derived from the PCE, and is an
              essential ingredient to ensure success. One does not have to
              generate confidence oneself – as the religions require of one with
              regard to their blind faith – the purity of the actual world
              bestows this confidence upon one. The experience of purity is a
              benefaction. Out of this blessing comes pure intent, which will
              consistently guide one through daily life, gently ushering in an
              increasing ease and generosity of character. With this growing
              magnanimity, one becomes more and more anonymous, more and more
              self-less. With this expanding altruism one becomes less and less
              self-centred, less and less egocentric. Eventually the moment comes
              wherein something definitive happens, physically, inside the brain
              and ‘I’ am nevermore.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 13px; margin-top: 8px;">...............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>RICHARD:</strong> As a generalisation, pure consciousness
              experiences (PCE’s) are more prevalent in childhood and the memory
              is tucked away in an area of the brain not normally accessed.
              Because a PCE has no emotional/ passional qualities whatsoever –
              there is no affective being present to record the memory in its
              affective memory banks – it cannot be remembered in the normal way
              (reverie, reminiscence, nostalgia, and so on).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Also, ‘I’ can have
              a vested interest in disremembering a PCE as it could very well be
              the beginning of the end of ‘me’.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Mostly PCE’s happen
              for no demonstrable reason at all – as in being a serendipitous
              event – and quite often occur in everyday surroundings doing
              everyday things such as washing the dishes (for instance) and can
              be quite brief ... I can recall being on a farmhouse veranda at age
              eight, looking into the glistening white of a full glass of milk in
              the early morning sunshine, when it happened for the entity
              within.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Often in my early
              childhood there would be a ‘slippage’ of the brain, somewhat
              analogous to an automatic transmission changing into a higher gear
              too soon, and the magical world where time had no workaday meaning
              would emerge in all its sparkling wonder ... where I could wander
              for hours at a time in gay abandon with whatever was happening.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">They were the
              pre-school years: soon such experiences would occur of a weekend
              ... so much so that I would later on call them ‘Saturday Morning’
              experiences where, contrary to having to be dragged out of bed
              during the week, I would be up and about at first light, traipsing
              through the fields and the forests with the early morning rays of
              sunshine dancing their magic on the glistening dew-drops suspended
              from the greenery everywhere; where kookaburras are echoing their
              laughing-like calls to one another and magpies are warbling their
              liquid sounds; where an abundance of aromas and scents are drifting
              fragrantly all about; where every pore of the skin is being
              caressed by the friendly ambience of the balmy air; where
              benevolence and benignity streams endlessly bathing all in its
              impeccable integrity.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">This magical world
              is what occasions me to write like this:</p>

              <p>Ok.</p>
              <p>PCE: Pure Consciousness Experience.</p>
              <p>What it means: Suddenly, the sense of self dissolves. For a moment you don't feel like 'You' are a self inside your body, looking outwards at the world, through your eyes. For a moment, 'You' go into abeyance - 'You' dissolve.</p>
              <p>Suddenly it is like seeing, hearing takes place on its own accord - the tree being seen is itself the seeing. There is no distance between a seer and seen, because there is no conceived seer at that moment, so there is absolute intimacy with everything.

              <p>Who has it: everybody has it, but most people had it in childhood, and have forgotten. Due to the lack of emotions and feelings in a PCE event that can be easily registered in memory, you may have a hard time remembering it. But if you try to recall you may suddenly remember.</p>

              <p>Ok.</p>
              <p>PCE: Pure Consciousness Experience.</p>
              <p>What it means: Suddenly, the sense of self dissolves. For a
                      moment you don't feel like 'You' are a self inside your body,
                      looking outwards at the world, through your eyes. For a moment,
                      'You' go into abeyance - 'You' dissolve.</p>
              <p>Suddenly it is like seeing, hearing takes place on its own
                      accord - the tree being seen is itself the seeing. There is no
                      distance between a seer and seen, because there is no conceived
                      seer at that moment, so there is absolute intimacy with everything.

              <p>Yes. I got this experience. I looked at a tree. There was only the image of tree nothing else and no observer looking at It.</p>

              <p style="margin: 5px 13px 5px 10px;">To get out of stuckness and induce a
                  Pure Consciousness Experience one gets off one’s backside and does whatever one knows best to activate delight. From the
                  position of delight, one can vitalize one’s joie de vivre by the amazement at the fun of it all ... and then one can – with
                  sufficient abandon – become over-joyed and move into marvelling at being here and doing this business called being alive. Then
                  one is no longer intellectually making sense of life ... the wonder of it all drives all intellectual sense away. Such delicious
                  wonder fosters the innate condition of naiveté (which is the closest one can get to innocence ) the nourishing of which is
                  essential if the charm of it all is to occur. Then, as one stares intently at the world about by glancing lightly with caressing
                  eyes, out of the corner of one’s eye comes – sweetly – the magical fairy-tale-like paradise that this verdant earth actually
                  is ... and I am the experiencing of what is happening. But try not to possess it and make it your own ... or else ‘twill vanish
                  as softly as it appeared.</p>

              <p style="margin: 5px 13px 5px 10px;"><strong>When one remembers a PCE – or
                  precipitates another – then one is well on the way to freedom ... this is what actualism is all about. Scattered along the wide
                  and wondrous path to an actual freedom are as many PCEs as one may need ... repeated peak experiences may very well be brought
                  about on maybe a daily basis with constant application of reflective and fascinated contemplation . In such pure contemplation,
                  ‘I’ cease seeing and seeing takes place of its own accord. ‘I’ can never be here now in this actual world for ‘I’ am
                  an interloper, an alien in psychic possession of the body. ‘I’ do not belong here.</strong></p>

                   this is impossible to imagine which is why it is
                  essential to be confident that the actual world does exist. This 
                  confidence is born out of knowing, which is derived from the PCE,
                  and is an essential ingredient to ensure success. One does not have to 
                  generate confidence oneself – as the religions require of
                  one with regard to their blind faith – the purity of the actual world 
                  bestows this confidence upon one. The experience of purity
                  is a benefaction. Out of this blessing comes pure intent, which will 
                  consistently guide one through daily life, gently ushering in
                  an increasing ease and generosity of character. With this growing 
                  magnanimity, one becomes more and more anonymous, more and more
                  self-less. With this expanding altruism one becomes less and less 
                  self-centred, less and less egocentric. Eventually the moment
                  comes wherein something definitive happens, physically, inside the brain
                   and ‘I’ am nevermore.</p>
