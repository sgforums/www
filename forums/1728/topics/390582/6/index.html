              </p><p>My understanding is that Presence and Awareness is 'universal' and through universal awareness, everything spontaneously manifests. No doer involved. Bird chirping is registered spontaneously in Awareness without intention. Smell of garbage is registered spontaneously without intention. It is non-personal, but then the mind identifies with 'I heard', 'I saw', 'I did', etc. It references the actual universal functioning with a self-center who 'did that'. Actually seeing, hearing, everything is the universal function of awareness without a self-center. No individual doer or experiencer is there in actions and experiencing. Universal awareness alone is perceiving and manifesting experiences.</p>

              <p>Yesterday I realized the implications of Sailor Bob Adamson's book title
               'What's wrong with right now unless you think about it'. I realized 
              that we make a problem out of everything, including even our thoughts 
              and emotions, simply by naming them... but if we stop labeling them, 
              like 'fear', etc, then we don't make a problem out of anything. 
              Everything becomes a play or energy of Awareness rather than an 
              obscuration. You simply 'enter' into a sea of wordless vibration that 
              arises and passes in awareness but doesn't leave any traces. 
              <br> <br> In light of this, there is nothing that needs to be done... because 
              anything to 'do', to 'meditate', implies altering or changing this 
              moment of experience... but this moment of experience is as it is and 
              without making a problem out of it, is perfect/complete as it is without
               a need for alteration/meditation/etc.</p>

              <p>Just found something by Candice O Denver... and it's like, wow, just what I was talking about!<br><br>----------</p>
              <p><br>Points of view are countless, ceaseless and unpredictable. If you try to base well-being on rearranging or controlling the flow of points of view, you'll be lost in an endless world of labels and descriptions. Simply relax. Relax body and mind completely, no matter what point of view appears. Everything is totally free in the perception of it. Everything provides us with a simple choice: to recognize clarity or not.<br><br>....<br><br>(36)<br><br>If a painful perception comes up and you start elaborating on it, this is going to lead to all kinds of other thoughts about it. If you were standing in a muddy pond and wanted the pond to be clear, you would not stir the water with a stick. You would stand still until all the mud naturally settled out. The same is true with perceptions. When we allow perceptions to be by simply relying on clarity for short moments repeated again and again, it becomes clear that all perceptions are settled in and of themselves with nothing needing to be done. All points of view are pervaded with clarity.<br><br>By repeatedly relying on this inherent clarity, you come to see that you are not overwhelmed by any points of view - and you never have been. Thinking that you have been overwhelmed by ideas and descriptions is merely another point of view. When belief in any point of view starts to trouble you, rely on short moments to clarity instead.<br><br>Getting into descriptions and allowing them to trouble you is exhausting and painful. To indulge in descriptions, or to enjoy a moment of clarity - that is a very fundamental choice. Are you going to go for the pain, or are you going to enjoy the stability and power of clarity? Committing to the instinctive recognition of stable clarity has to be a priority above all else. By making it a priority above all else, you are able to truly come into the confidence of the instinctive recognition of inherent natural perfection, which is a reality of total power and relief at all times.<br><br>.........<br><br>Clarity takes each here-and-now all the way, clarity subsumes worry and concern. Clarity's sovereignty is comprehensive. The first moment that you choose clarity rather than the pain of a described reality, it's a moment of total clarity where you can say, "Wow, being troubled by worry is optional. It's not up to the other people, places or things - it's up to me, nobody else!" Based upon that realization, it's possible to enjoy the courage and power of relying on clarity again and again.<br><br>Being troubled by descriptive labels is actually a lucky thing, because it provides great motivation towards wanting to get out of that prison. In relying on short moments, repeatedly, we choose clarity over the confusion of descriptions again and again. This simple choice can be taken in every moment. It is entirely up to you.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">Nothing mystical, obscure, or distant is involved. People seeking the mystical and obscure are simply going off-track. They may attain some interesting (but transient) states and experiences, but not the enlightenment they seek. Enlightenment has the least to do with altered states of consciousness. It is a simple ever-present plain fact<span> for everyone to notice. It is ever-present throughout apparently heavenly or hellish states or experiences in life. </span>Effort can get you to interesting places, but effort can't get you to 
                                  where/what you already are. You already ARE, simply inquire into 'What am I?' - that is the only 'effort' you need until the need itself drops off upon clear seeing. As Ramana Maharshi says, "The thought 'Who am I?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-Realization."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">This <span>is literally simpler than A-B-C because it is prior to the use of mind and logic. Perhaps that is why this is overlooked since time immemorial for most of us, because by our usual habit of dealing with worldly matters, we naturally think that this (spiritual enlightenment) must be complicated, and we go searching (using the mind) for an answer where it cannot be found (in the mind, in experiences). Over-complicating this and searching all over the place (for higher experiences, higher understanding, etc) for your own Being doesn't help you, much like searching all around for your eye will never help you find your eye - you are already seeing/searching with your eyes. You are That which you are searching for. You can't obtain something you already 'have', you simply have to <em>realize</em> that fact.<br> <br> .......<br> <br> Don't try to be aware. You ARE Pure Awareness shining brighter than the sun.

                                                                                                                                          from Total Brilliance. Why do you attempt to put effort in lighting up a candle
                                                                                                                                          when you are already standing under the blazing sun?<br> <br> .......<br> <br> There is nothing you can understand about Awareness. If that's what you want to

                                                                                                                                          A thought that momentarily comes and goes from the Brilliant Awareness will

                                                                                                                                          and thus not within the field of knowledge, like an eye that sees but cannot

                                                                                                                                          Awareness.<br> <br> .......<br> <br> Remember what I said about the Certainty of Being? It doesn't come from
                                                                                                                                          knowledge. The 'I know that I exist' is not it. The pure sense of 'I AM', even without the words, is IT. All knowledge are within the realm of conjectures and speculations
                                                                                                                                          and therefore, has no quality of certainty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span>The REAL Certainty of Being comes from YOU, Existence-Awareness itself.

              <p>It feels like you're running on the threadmill, you're not

              <p>You can practice seeing this next time when you walk or jog.

              <p>Found something by Ken Wilber which talks about this (from One Taste):</p>

              <p><strong>Wednesday, June 4</strong></p>
              <p>Worked all morning; decided to go jogging down behind my house. If you remain as the Witness while you run, you don’t move, the ground does. You, as the Witness, are immobile—more precisely, you have no qualities at all, no traits, no motion and no commotion, as you rest in the vast Emptiness that you are. You are aware of movement, therefore you as the Witness are not movement. So when you run, it actually feels as if you are not moving at all—the Witness is free of motion and stillness—so the ground simply moves along. It’s like you’re sitting in a movie theater, never moving from your seat, and yet seeing the entire scenery move around you.<br><br>(This is easy to do when you’re driving down the highway. You can simply sit back, relax, and pretend that you are not moving, only the scenery is. This is often enough to flip people into the actual Witness, at which point you will simply rest as choiceless awareness, watching the world go by, and you won’t move at all. Thismotionless center of your own pure awareness is in fact thecenter of theentire Kos- mos, the eye or I-I of the Kosmic cyclone. This motionless center—there is only one in the entire world and it is identical in all beings, the circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference, nowhere—is also the center of gravity of your soul.)</p>
              <p>This is why Zen will say, “A man in New York drinks vodka, a man in Los Angeles gets drunk.” The same Big Mind is timelessly, spacelessly, present in both places. So drinking in New York and getting drunk in L.A. are the same to the motionless,spaceless Witness. This is why Zen will say, “Without moving, go to New York.” The answer: “I’m already there.”<br><br>As the Witness, I-I do not move through time, time moves through me. Just as clouds float through the sky, time floats through the open space of my primordial awareness, and I-I remain untouched by time and space and their complaints. Eternity does not mean living forever in time—a rather horrible notion—but living in thetimeles s moment, prior to time and its turmoils altogether. Likewise, infinity does not mean a really big space, it means completely spaceless. As the Witness, I-I am spaceless; as the Witness, I-I am timeless. I-I live in eternity and inhabit infinity, simply because the Witness is free of time and space. And that is why I can drink vodka in New York and get drunk in L.A.</p>
              <p>So this morning I went jogging, and nothing moved at all, except the scenery in the movie of my life.</p>

              <p>No matter what you are experiencing, You are always this Witnessing Awareness of the experience. See how effortless this is? This is not some special state of Awareness. You can never leave this. All things can leave your awareness but Awareness always remains, always effortlessly registering everything without your intention to do so. So Awareness is 1) Effortlessly present (regardless of your intention to make it present/absent), 2) Effortlessly registering everything  (regardless of your intention to make things registered/unregistered). IT is an inescapable fact of your being.</p>
              <p>Our life is like a movie displayed on a screen, being lost is like mistaking oneself as the central body-mind character in the movie and thus suffering the pain and drama of an apparent individual self, but even then the screen is there, showing the character (among other things) - without which the character in the movie cannot appear. Awakening is dis-identifying yourself as a limited entity in the movie, and realizing that you are the screen (the luminous, aware space) in which the movie plays. Yet to complicate this by searching for the screen in the movie is moving into the wrong direction again. Simply notice what is observing the whole show. You literally feel like waking up from a dream - and realizing that everything in your life is like a dream playing out in the light of Awareness.</p>
              <p>Imagine the relief when you discover that you are not the character in the movie, but you are simply watching a movie - a show - playing out in the cinema screen. The seriousness due to false self-identification with the story of life is taken out, and yet life continues as it has before - the body-mind continues doing effortlessly and spontaneously what it is meant to do (and it is now known that there is no doer, only spontaneous happenings, a movie playing out on its own accord) - with a greater sense of freedom and 'security' (in knowing that you are not the body-mind that is born, lives, and dies in time) as the Deathless. The Knowingness has no stake in birth and death - it observes the play of life, it observes the arising and subsiding of phenomena including the mind and body, but is itself timeless and deathless, non-arising and non-ceasing. The screen is not created due to the movie playing, and it is not destroyed by the death of the character in the movie, it cannot be burnt by fire or cut by knives of the movie, yet it (the screen/Awareness) allows all these to be displayed. Before Birth, Who are You?</p>
              <p>It's amazing how we over-complicate things and think we can ever 'lose' IT - which, in the first place, presumes that we are a limited self entity that can 'own' and 'lose' IT, whereas in reality, 'we' (all thoughts, sensations, perceptions) are being manifested by IT. IT is effortlessly present and registering everything and cannot ever not be so. Instead of endlessly searching, simply ask Who am I? and Rest as That which manifests/remains in the inquiry after all identifications have been rejected. Since You are already what You are, no doing is necessary, only Seeing and Being (which is the same) is necessary. A non-conceptual exploration (via self-inquiry) can lead to this Realization.</p>
              <p>Finally, realize that the Observer is the Observed. That which observes is not other than what is observed. Awareness is not merely standing back and watching, it is integrated and not separate with all manifestations. So the next 'step' is to realize Awareness 'AS' Manifestation.</p>
              <p>As John Welwood says,</p>
              <p>"If we use the 
              analogy of awareness as a mirror,                         prereflective 
              identification is like being captivated by and lost                     
                  in the reflections appearing in the mirror. Reflection involves     
                                  stepping back from the appearances, studying them, 
              and developing a                         more objective relationship 
              with them. And transreflective presence                         is like 
              being the mirror itself – that vast, illuminating openness              
                         and clarity that allows reality to be seen as what it is. In 
              pure                         presence, awareness is self-illuminating, 
              or aware of itself                         without objectification. The 
              mirror simply abides in its own                         nature, without 
              either separating from its reflections or confusing                     
                  itself with them. Negative reflections do not stain the mirror,     
                                  positive reflections do not improve on it. They are 
              all the                         mirror’s self-illuminating display."</p>

              <p>I remember that thoughts of losing awareness used to happen quite often for me in the past. But this is all seen to be totally baseless and ridiculous nowadays.</p>
              <p>All thoughts of "I lost awareness" or "I need more effort to maintain awareness" or anything along that line implies having had some 'recognition' or 'experience' of Awareness, but not having the Realization of Who You Are.</p>
              <p>This is why, looking back, I think Thusness was very apt in telling me the difference between Experience and Realization last year. He said <em>"You may have the blissful sensation or feeling of vast and open 
                                                                      spaciousness; you may experience a non-conceptual and objectless state; 
                                                                      you may experience the mirror like clarity but all these experiences are
                                                                       not Realization. There is no ‘eureka’, no ‘aha’, no moment of immediate
                                                                       and intuitive illumination that you understood something undeniable and
                                                                       unshakable -- a conviction so powerful that no one, not even Buddha can
                                                                       sway you from this realization because the practitioner so clearly sees
                                                                       the truth of it.  It is the direct and unshakable insight of ‘You’.  
                                                                      This is the realization that a practitioner must have in order to 
                                                                      realize the Zen satori. You will understand clearly why it is so difficult for those 
              practitioners to forgo this ‘I AMness’ and accept the doctrine of 
              anatta.  Actually there is no forgoing of this ‘Witness’, it is rather a
               deepening of insight to include the non-dual, groundlessness and 
              interconnectedness of our luminous nature.  Like what Rob said, "keep 
              the experience but refine the views".</em><em>"</em></p>
              <p>And this is just the case. Having an experience of Awareness still leaves doubts (including doubts like 'I lost awareness', 'I need to maintain it', etc). This is because you have not resolved the question of your true identity. You can have a clear sense of presence and spaciousness, and yet have no real understanding or insight and an <strong>unshakeable conviction </strong>of Who They Are which turns their sense of self and identity upside down. <strong>It is the realization beyond a trace of doubt the undeniability of your true identity as that Pure Awareness.</strong></p>
              <p>If you realized this, then doubts like "I lost awareness" will not be arising, and even if it had, the thought is <strong>completely seen as an illusion </strong>- an illusory thought arising in the undeniable presence of YOU. Such habits of mind once seen in the light of realization will <strong>never be able to shake you</strong> from true seeing and being - it is simply exposed for being an illusion which they are, like the words 'this place is dark' written on the wall revealed by bright light in the room simply reveals the illusion for what it is. See how baseless those words/thoughts are in the light of clear seeing?</p>
              <p>So it is not about sustaining a state of experience, <strong>it is seeing how this is your True Self, what you already are, and no illusion will be able to shake you out of that - for it is not a state or experience that requires maintenance, rather it is the undeniable Presence of What You Are and all thoughts and illusions that comes up still only come up in that Undeniability of Immediate Presence and are immediately seen as illusions.</strong></p>
              <p>Through Realization, your so called 'understanding' (though it is not a conceptual understanding) of Awareness will shift from being 'experience' or 'state' based to clearly seeing how Awareness is the undeniable ground of Being and Knowing in which all phenomena comes and goes, and yet Awareness ever remains unmoved.</p>
              <p>Can you escape the present moment? No you can't. Can you escape You? No, of course not! Every attempt to avoid Presence is still experienced in unavoidable and undeniable Presence.</p>
              <p>So the difference between experience and realization is this - in realization, Awareness is vividly and clearly experienced, <strong>but more than that, it is a clear insight into that fact of your Being that burns away all doubts and questions until only the Light of Awareness remains and is clearly seen to always be so. And in that unshakeble certainty of Being you clearly see you do not need to maintain anything - you simply Are That.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It is not an experience, but the realization, the understanding (but it is not a mental understanding but a feeling/being-realization), that makes you unshakeable in the face of doubts by exposing them as the illusion they are. Without the realization, doubts will be ‘believed’.</strong></p>
              <p>Lastly, never think that this realization that I am writing sounds 'difficult to obtain' as I can assure you it is Not. It is simply an <em>ever-present</em> and immediate fact of your being shining in plain view waiting to be discovered and realized. It is not a state that you need to gradually develop over time through some kind of technique - rather, it is always already timelessly present right here and now. You simply need to know what and how to investigate (e.g. self inquiry) and you are on your way to true insight and freedom.</p>

              <p>The sense of presence is so strong yesterday that I had difficulty sleeping until I relax my focus on it, and even then, I kept waking up and finding myself in utter clarity. I just realised I slept only 5 hours but it feels like I slept 9 hours.</p>
              <p>Funny I just found a conversation from 2006:</p>
              <p>(9:33 PM) Thusness: i am trying to prevent u from undergoing such suffering.  <br>(9:33 PM) AEN: of insomnia? <br>(9:33 PM) AEN: lol <br>(9:33 PM) Thusness:  :)<br>(9:33 PM) AEN: sorry hang <br>(9:33 PM) AEN: but how would i suffer from insomnia <br>(9:33 PM) AEN: i sleep very well and deeply <br>(9:33 PM) AEN: lol <br>(9:33 PM) Thusness: later stage lah <br>(9:33 PM) Thusness: not now.</p>

              <p>Posted in Kenneth Folk Dharma:<span id="textNode_32218740" class="threadText"><br><br>I hope this 
              wouldn't be too much off topic. Do you mean you have trouble sleeping? 
              Yesterday night, perhaps due to having just sat in meditation right 
              before sleep, the 2nd gear Witness is very strong and I had difficulty 
              sleeping (prior to having access to 2nd gear, I usually fall asleep in 
              one minute, but if I am in 2nd gear mode, that can take up to an hour). 
              It happens sometimes, I notice, usually if I have been 
              practicing/meditating just prior to sleep.<br><br>Any thought that being
               'followed' might have led to a dream state... is in the 2nd Gear mode 
              simply seen to be an illusion occuring in a bright, undeniable and 
              unavoidable background of Awareness. As such those 'dream thoughts' just
               pop in and out of Awareness without a thread of continuity. The 
              effortless sense of Presence is so strong that I had to relax my focus 
              on the Witness to fall asleep.<br><br>However, I still kept waking up 
              soon after I fall asleep, and when I wake up I am in a state of full 
              clarity almost immediately or immediately. After repeated attempts at 
              relaxing the focus I was able to sleep soundly until the next morning.<br><br>Sometimes
               the Witness mode persists in dreams, sometimes not.</span></p>

              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi,</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thusness told me weeks ago that Ken's ability to attain 
                              constant witnessing throughout day, dream, dreamless is due to the strength of 
                              his concentration/absorption. It is not a result of realization, but more like 
                              exercising until you build up your muscles. In KW's case, it took him 20 years of meditation practice to reach constant consciousness, as he puts it.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Realization is a different matter. If you realize I AM, 
                              you will realize that your consciousness is constant <em>by nature</em>. This, I 
                              have realized. But if you have this realization but you do not yet have meditative 
                              strength, you still get lost in/attached to thoughts. I still get lost in thoughts now and 
                              then. I do not experience constant consciousness throughout the three 
                              states. But if you develop meditative strength, you will simply abide in pure 
                              consciousness regardless of what appears. Thoughts lose their power to condition 
                              you, they just come and go within your bright awareness without the least 
                              identification with them - you are fully identified/absorbed as Pure Consciousness alone. At least in my understanding that is what will happen  (since I do not have access to constant consciousness yet in the KW sense). You may become so absorbed and intoxicated in Presence that nothing else matters (like Thusness said, for people like Ramana Maharshi, even if you cut off his limbs he might feel that it's ok) and the absorption in existence-consciousness/witness remains unbroken throughout all states. Talking and writing happens but you are not identified with the happenings, 
                              there is no doer.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Nevertheless, Thusness said that sustaining witnessing 
                              into dream and dreamless is *not necessary* and in fact a result of not having 
                              realized anatta. When you realize anatta, you do not attempt to do 
                              that.</span></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ken Wilber has written about his near death experience 
                              (December 26, 2006) and how his awareness remains undisturbed throughout the 
                              horrifying experience:  <a title="http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/214

                                <div><strong>An important point here however: having the ability to stay (even if persistently) in wide perceptual openness is not the Realization of I AM, it is simply an 'experience' or 'recognition' and I experienced that since early 2009. Nevertheless, even after Realization of I AM, it does not mean that you will live the rest of your life free of egoic contraction. Go for the realization, not the experience - and to go for the realization means to practice self-inquiry.  As Thusness told me the last time I met him, he doesn't like approaches that emphasize too much on the experience, like focusing to get the experience of the spaciousness of awareness, the mirror-like quality etc, all the various aspects. Why? Because that's like only accessing the fringe, but once you penetrate to the Core of the 
                                            matter via Self-Realization, then all the aspects are accessible to you, like ä¸€é’ˆè§�è¡€ 
                                            (striking the right note). Not only self-inquiry, but koan practice can also lead to 
                                            realization.</strong></div>

When he had heard that a great Buddhist teacher, Bodhidharma, had come to China, he sought an audience with him. When they met, Emperor Wu had asked how much karmic merit he had gained from his noble support of Buddhism. Bodhidharma replied, "None at all." The Emperor asked, "Then what is the truth of the teachings?" Bodhidharma replied, "Vast emptiness, nothing holy." So the emperor asked, "Then who are you standing in front of me?"

Nothing of that sort. There is no room for such second-hand thought in direct realization and intuition of your true essence.<br><br>Rather, you should practice self-inquiry (a non-conceptual exploration/inquiry into Who am I?) until you are able to Realize the "I AM" - and in that realization there is no words, only the actual full authentication of the innermost essence.<br><br>Completely certain, unmoved, and still.

              <div style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Has anyone here ever felt the presence of God, Being, Divine energy </strong>(whatever you might call it) for 
              any sustained amount of time? If so, for how long, 5 seconds, one 
              minute, an hour, days? What was it like? What do you think brought it 
              about?</div>

              <p>Yes, it is simply your ordinary, everyday awareness, aliveness, 
              Being, Existence... you simply overlooked it. It is not an altered state
               of consciousness.<br> <br> A more crucial thing than 'feeling Presence' is to realize that God, Being, Divine energy is who you truly are.<br> <br> When you truly investigate what you are... you'll come to see that the 
              fact of Being is simply an inescapable and undeniable fact of reality - 
              it is the ever-present Reality and our true identity - You Are... it is 
              not a state that comes and goes. And if you directly realize and 
              experience Who You Are for yourself... you'll have no doubts about it - 
              it is simply utterly certain and you 'know' that it has always been and 
              will always be so (not forever in time, but outside the stream of time).
               Everything is taking place in this inescapable reality, the timeless 
              and eternal Here and Now of Being.<br> <br> It is the ever-present ground of Being and Knowing in which all 
              experiences manifests... but is itself not something that comes and 
              goes.  How can you deny the irrefutable fact of Existence and Being 
              shining in plain view? Can you say at any moment that you are Not? Can 
              you stop Being at any moment? Can you not be in the present moment or 
              are you always Presence itself? You may think that you are dwelling in 
              the past or future, but really, even that thought is itself a 
              manifestation of Presence/Being/God. Even thoughts of apparent past and 
              future are happening in the Ever-Present/Presence. You can never escape 
              that... IT is always-shining like the sun and can never be obscured even
               by apparent passing clouds of thoughts.<br> <br> If this is not clear, then one will always imagine oneself to be some 
              separate individual or entity apart from God/Being/Divine, always 
              seeking to return or merge with the divine/god/etc. But truly, there has
               never been such a separation to begin with, at any time. Once this 
              separation/notion of separate self is seen through, the seeking ends or 
              rather you realize that you are what you seek.<br> <br> You have never left Being for even a moment in your life... just realize who you are.<br> <br> The Unreal never was (you never was a person separate from Reality), the Real never is not.</p>

                                                              Vegetarianism will help a lot and his meditative experience told him he

The knowing/realizing of who you are IS the BEING of who you are, and that is why Eckhart Tolle calls this 'feeling-realization' which I think could also be called 'being-realization' - both of the terms suggesting the direct-ness and non-conceptuality of this realization. This is not a form of subject-object knowledge: you do not know that you are as an object (that would imply a knower and a known), but the fact shines so obviously and vividly: YOU ARE! YOU are the Self-Shining, Self-Knowing Being-Awareness that Knows Itself by Itself. As I wrote previously, <em>In actual experience, once you touch that 'certainty of being' that I mentioned, there is no observer and observed distinction. There is just a non-dual sense of Existence, Being, Presence, Knowing, without a sense of 'me' being separated from 'that'. You Are That Knowing which is certain that You Are! The distinction between knower, knowing, and known dissolve into That. You Are That! </em>Direct, gapless, certain, still, non-conceptual. The moment you seek to 'know' or 're-confirm' it as a form of 'knowledge', you have already set up a distance/separation from IT. The only way you can realize this is to engage in the experiential investigation of self-inquiry (Who am I?) coupled with direct-ness of non-conceptual perception that gives rise to the realization and sense of certainty of who You are.<br> <br> Self-Inquiry or koans can lead to this realization. I had many 
                                                              recognitions and experience of Awareness prior to Self-Realization, but

              Yes but I call these flashes of brilliance the A&amp;P events and it is not directly linked to self-realization.<br> <br> As I wrote to my highly enlightened friend (Longchen/Simpo):<br> <br> <em class="bbc">Hi.. thanks for the sharing.<br> <strong class="bbc"><br> I agree that real Presence has nothing to do with a visual sense of

                                                               intensely. If that vivid luminosity is strong, even normal things like

                                                              you described.. so far in my experience it is only vividly experienced

                                                              with how in daily life, we usually fixate/get attached to a sense of a 
                                                              body. However there is the insight that Awareness is not in any way 
                                                              personal, or localized anywhere, and this insight helps us see and let 
                                                              go of the clinging to a locality residing inside the body. Rather than 
                                                              existing somewhere (like, in a body), even the body and the mind are 
                                                              equally seen as objects in the field of perception along with the stuff 
                                                              in the environment, all happening in a non-local field of Awareness 
                                                              rather than outside of Awareness.<br> <br> The non-dual part is still eluding me... even though I had short 
                                                              glimpses. Again, thanks for sharing. I am still in the process of 
                                                              'letting go'.</em></div>

              </div>
              <br> Yes, according to my friends there is indeed an energetic component to awakening. Both Thusness and Longchen described that an 'energy release' occurs as a lot of energy is fed into grasping onto conceptual thoughts or self. I think only time will make this relation become more apparent for me.</div>

              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 13px;">Just wrote to supertom, but you can also refer to my document (posted a link in that thread - <a style="color: #22229c;" href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/forums/spirituality-consciousness-awareness/49268-anyone-practicing-self-inquiry.html#post644117">Anyone practicing Self Inquiry?</a>) which contains much more discussions/clarifications on the practice of self-inquiry:<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 13px;">Ramana Maharshi's books are good guides... you have all the pointers you need in that book for self-inquiry practice. In actual fact, the question ‘Who am I’ is itself an adequate pointer to self-realization, and a most potent one. That is all you need. The pointer ‘Who am I?’ will allow the practitioner to investigate his own experience and touch the Self directly.<br><br>But just an additional 2 cents from me:<br><br>You don't learn self-inquiry... it's not a technique that you master until perfection like visualization or yoga - self-inquiry is simply a tool, a question 'Who am I', that allows you to trace the mind back to its Source - and at that point the question itself dissolves. You do not need to master the thought 'Who am I' (what's there to master about it? it's just asking yourself 'Who am I', it's that simple!), you don't need to master the question or technique because the question/technique itself is not the point (though an important tool), rather, just allow the question to lead you back to the Source, to trace the radiance back to its Source as Zen Master Chinul puts it. The true Source of the radiance (all awareness) is upstream from all objects, mind or body… trace all perceptions to its Source by asking ‘Who am I?’ The thought ‘Who am I’ is simply a pointer, like a pointer to the moon, you don’t grasp/look at the pointer, but let the pointer direct you to look at the moon.<br><br>Ramana Maharshi puts it very well when he said: "By the inquiry 'Who am I?'. The thought 'who am I?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-realization."<br><br>It is simply an inquiry, an investigation, into 'Who am I?' And this investigation takes you to the core of your Being... it bypasses the mind and its conceptualizations - any mind made conceptual answer will ring hollow and are to be negated/dropped. All speculations, concepts, ideas have no certainty to it - it is merely theories of the mind and always have room for doubts - but the Essence of your Being that lies prior to the mind and the conceptualization rings with utter certainty and undeniability - when you realize who you are, you no longer can deny or doubt your Existence.<br><br>Notice that even Right Now... you are undeniably present, your being cannot be negated and is an irrefutable fact of existence. Pause all thoughts, and in that gap between thoughts, you are still effortlessly present and aware - your Being is nothing inert, it is pure aliveness, presence, clarity, vitality and intelligence. You cannot say you are not - undeniably, You Are...<br><br>So what is This? What is this sense of existence and presence? Who am I? The question is simply a tool to turn the light around, so that Awareness withdraws its identification with thoughts and forms... to realize ItSelf, it's true identity. The question is not meant to be repeated or recited verbally like a mantra, rather it is simply a non-conceptual exploration, looking, investigation into the fact of your Being... your Existence... eventually all concepts and ideas and even the question 'Who am I' subside, and in that thoughtless gap You realize Who You Are... Self-Knowing, Self-Shining Presence-Awareness reveals itself as your true identity, and there is no more doubts about it - only utter thoughtless certainty, authentication, still and unmoving ground of being and knowing.<br></span></p>
