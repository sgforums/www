              <p><br>Hi Rainbow Jigsaw of Life,</p>
              <p>I think it is ok for AEN to share his views cos there may be people who may find confirmation/leads and then can go further... such discusssions may be fruitful. There is also the potential for confusion, dun know, depends on mindset of person. But potential for confusion always exists in all teachings.</p>
              <p>This kind of practice is most catered for people who have family, work etc... because it is pared down to the bare essentials of Buddhism... awareness. of course, i would always have to add that one shd have a emphasis on compassion/bodhichitta too...</p>
              <p>the whole thing about nature of mind and rigpa is quite straightforward n simple.  We shouldn't get lost in the forest of jargon n descriptions.  If the person actually sits then sooner or later the forest of complication doesn't seem complicated and it becomes easier to relate to.</p>
              <p>Best have a teacher!</p>
              <p>Maybe you can be more specific on where a person might not be able to handle...talking in general is difficult.</p>

              <p>I don't mean to say that AEN is wrong to post. I'm just sharing my views. Buddhism, if practised with the right perspectives, can definitely help make one a better person. I was just raising my view that perhaps more articles or angles can be shared to help those with families and children, as I somehow feel that many of the articles are more appropriate for those in purely religious orders. :)</p>

              <p>Yes I understand :) What you said is valid and important. However the practice of Awareness actually is for everyone, including those with families and children.</p>
              <p>Everyone has Buddha-nature, everyone has pristine awareness as their essence. Whether a lay person or a monk, our Buddha-Nature is not in any way lesser or more. It is always there waiting to be discovered.</p>
              <p>We don't have to develope our Buddha-Nature (it can't be). It can't be attained through contrivance. In fact it cannot be attained any more than you can attain your eye or your feet. It is your birthright. It is already your true essence. We just simply recognise it.</p>
              <p>The recognition and abidance in Presence-Awareness does not require contrivance, it is not something only monks who sit in meditation all day can experience. It is right here, right now. It is what is looking at these words now. Just ask "Who am I?" "Who is aware?"</p>
              <p>Does it take effort to see? Or are you always already seeing with awareness, AS presence-awareness? Isn't this obvious? Do you need to meditate in caves for years before you can see, or are you already the all-perceiving awareness right here and now? Yet most of us are so constantly identified with mental stories that we overlook something so simple.</p>
              <p>So simple that the practice is also a non-practice, yet it does not mean 'do nothing' - you must remain undistracted in recognition of Presence-Awareness.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br> Just sit and be aware. The key then is to just 
                          be aware with no
                                                  effort to be aware - no doing, just be natural 
                          awareness as it is.
                                                  If you find yourself trying to be natural 
                          awareness as it is, then
                                                  that is contrived and you have engaged the mind.
                           Simply LET GO,
                                                  relax, and be aware of what is, but of nothing 
                          in particular. In
                                                  letting go and naturally being aware of what is 
                          you will find that
                                                  natural still point. Allow the mind to ease off 
                          and open up. This
                                                  can be practiced at all time during the day. 
                          Just be naturally
                                                  aware, openly at ease, and spontaneously 
                          engaging - whether sitting
                                                  or otherwise.</p>
              <p><br> This is true vipassana. Uncontrived. To see the 
                          natural state of
                                                  reality as it is.<br> We should allow ourselves to notice mind 
                          throughout this period of
                                                  sitting, as with other particulars that arise; 
                          as mind is part of
                                                  reality, and not to be rejected, as rejection is
                           an act of mind,
                                                  not awareness. Rejection is based on the false 
                          premises of mind. In
                                                  so doing we will notice when we find ourselves 
                          having fallen into
                                                  doing in which we 'try' to be open and relaxed, 
                          when this happens
                                                  we are no longer in an uncontrived state of 
                          natural abiding. The
                                                  whole process requires concentration; that is, 
                          being brightly aware
                                                  of what is. Concentration in this sense simply 
                          means being
                                                  naturally aware and not being distracted by 
                          having our attention
                                                  divided by activities of mind. As concentration 
                          wanes, awareness
                                                  may become dull and one my space out, or more 
                          often, one's thoughts
                                                  will re-assert themselves and we will go off on a
                           tangent of
                                                  thought. When we notice this we allow the stream
                           of thought to drop
                                                  by letting go again of the activities of mind, 
                          and just rest
                                                  brightly aware of what is.<br> <br> So, it really is simple, just sit and be aware.<br> <br> A further point. Do not concentrate on sensory 
                          stimuli in
                                                  particular, as that is contrived, it is effort 
                          of mind to do
                                                  something. See this subtle distinction. 
                          Awareness is brightly aware
                                                  as its natural state, there is not effort - no 
                          doing. Just be aware
                                                  of what is - environment and awareness itself - 
                          no artificial
                                                  distinction between external and internal - just
                           the continuum of
                                                  awareness. This, however, does not mean we are 
                          practicing awareness
                                                  of awareness, that again is a contrived 
                          condition, a use of mind to
                                                  focus on awareness. In such a case we would be 
                          privileging one
                                                  object of awareness over another, and that is a 
                          use of mind.
                                                  Rather, we are just being aware, just sitting. 
                          Discrimination in
                                                  terms of intention, demarcation, effort, 
                          judgment are all
                                                  discursive faculties of mind. Awareness operates
                           entirely through
                                                  direct knowing or clearly apprehending the 
                          nature of what is - it
                                                  simply sees it for itself. No recourse to the 
                          inferential faculties
                                                  of mind.</p>
              <p><br> So, Shikantaza or Dzogchen practice is simple on
                           the surface, but
                                                  there is much subtly and depth to it. Just 
                          sitting does not give it
                                                  explanatory justice.<br> A final point on the body. Since the body is 
                          peripheral to
                                                  awareness, it does not matter if the eyes are 
                          open or closed.
                                                  Traditionally, they are open. There are merits 
                          and problems with
                                                  both options. My recommendation is conclude this
                           question by what
                                                  feels natural to you. We do not wish to maintain
                           unnatural,
                                                  contrived states of body and mind in our 
                          practice. Awareness is the
                                                  practice... drop all else.<br> <br> In kind regards,<br> <br> Adam. :-)</p>

              <p>Was reading 'Buddhism Is Not What You Think' by Steve Hagen and found a passage which I feel is relevant to the topic title.</p>
              <p>-------------</p>
              <p>Shunryu Suzuki wrote in his first book, <em>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind,</em></p>
              <p><em>I have discovered that it is necessary, absolutely necessary, to believe in nothing. That is, we have to believe in something which has no form and no color - something which exists before all forms and colors appear. This is a very important point.</em></p>
              <p>Or, as the ninth-century Chinese Zen teacher Huang Po put it, "The foolish reject what they <em>see</em>, not what they think; the wise reject what they think, not what they <em>see</em>."</p>
              <p>Instead of putting faith in what we believe, think, explain, justify, or otherwise construct in our minds, we can learn to put our trust and confidence in immediate, direct experience, before all forms and colors appear. Religion, in its most essential expression, can help us do this.</p>
              <p>This is faith in its purest form: trust in actual experience before we make anything of it - before beliefs, thoughts, signs, explanations, justifications, and other constructions of our minds take form.</p>
              <p>This is the great sanity, the great compassion, the great wisdom that religion holds for us. This sanity, compassion, and wisdom all come out of simply learning to trust that Truth is right at hand. There's no go-between. You don't get it from a teacher, from an institution, or from a belief system of any sort. You don't get it from a book, either. Inded, you can't.</p>
              <p>In fact, you don't get it from anything. You don't need to get it. You already have it. You're inseparable from it. You only need to <em>just see</em>.</p>
              <p>Whether we're religious or not, in holding to beliefs and identifying with them, in shutting down and closing ourselves off from others, in this and so many other ways we create the most urgent and penetrating problems for ourselves.</p>
              <p>We're all human. We all have the desire to awaken, though we may not all be so aware. And we can all be moved by the human condition.</p>
              <p>But without taking hold of any thought or thing, just realize what's <em>seen</em> directly, before you make anything of it. This is to see Truth. It has nothing to do with belief.</p>

              <p>I don't mean to say that AEN is wrong to post. I'm just sharing my views. Buddhism, if practised with the right perspectives, can definitely help make one a better person. I was just raising my view that perhaps more articles or angles can be shared to help those with families and children, as I somehow feel that many of the articles are more appropriate for those in purely religious orders. :)</p>

              <p>Hope you get my point. I don't mean any ill-intent. :)</p>

              <p>It's probably not appropriate for me to say too much here, as my words could get misunderstood on a public forum. But I just wanted to say, and say it to all readers with well meaning: never neglect one's personal relationships at the expense of being <strong>overly</strong>-spiritual or <strong>overly</strong>-religious, unless that's the path one wishes to go. Keeping a balance is not as easy as one thinks, when one's too deep in it, as the balancing line no longer exists... :)</p>
              <p>It's good sometimes to get feedback from others who don't share the exact same beliefs, to know how balanced one is.</p>

              <p>Some notes on mind and identification:</p>
              <p>If there is any fears, suffering, doubts, worries, discontent,
                                  etc... or simply an incessant stream of thinking beyond your
                                  control... it means there is still some kind of misidentification -
                                  i.e. identifying yourself with the mind, body, who you think you
                                  are, your stories. The habit of false identification to 'pull us
                                  back to samsara' is hard to avoid and has a momentum on its own
                                  unless we take our stand as presence-awareness. The apparent 'loss
                                  of presence' is not an actual loss of presence (presence is always
                                  there and can never be lost), but rather the habit of mind to
                                  fixate and misidentify with the conceptual mind and stories, thus
                                  losing vivid sight of non-conceptual naked awareness.</p>
              <p>But actually you are not your mind, and just to realise this
                                  there is immense liberation. It is because when you exclusively
                                  identify with your mind and its stories.. when one identifies
                                  purely with the conceptual.. one invests belief in the thoughts and
                                  one will be compelled to react to and chase after every single
                                  thought that arise, whether they are happy or sad stories,
                                  identifying with all thoughts in a personal manner.</p>
              <p>But if we go beyond pure conceptual view and simply directly
                                  SEE... we see that really these mind movements are only impersonal
                                  happenings spontaneously arising and perceived in consciousness.
                                  When we go beyond purely identifying with the conceptual mind/false
                                  self, beyond the notion of individuality and all its stories, there
                                  is no basis for the fears, suffering, etc. You see that the notion
                                  of being an individual self is purely conceptual and never was real
                                  or present to begin with. You see that what you are this
                                  non-conceptual reality without limitations. The belief in a
                                  conceptual identity is dropped, along with all the suffering,
                                  fears, unhappiness, etc. The key lies in discovering one's identity
                                  as the timeless non-conceptual presence-awareness.</p>
              <p>If we truly see a thought as just an impersonal transient
                                  arising in awareness rather than identifying with it or getting
                                  lost in the conceptual content, then they can be left as they are,
                                  seen for what it is, but not being reacted to. Awareness is like a
                                  non-stick pan, the thoughts that appear are not being identified
                                  with, and so they lose the power to 'chain up' into further
                                  stories. In other words, they just dissolve on its own accord.
                                  Being rooted in the non-conceptual clarity, conceptual thoughts and
                                  stories that appear are not being taken with absolute seriousness.
                                  One will find oneself increasingly simply resting in non-conceptual
                                  naked perception of Awareness. One will know a much vaster realm of
                                  knowing, intelligence, clarity, bliss, joy, peace.</p>
              <p>All suffering have their origins in a root sense of being an
                                  individual person, a 'me' that owns or is its mind, stories, its
                                  body, its history, etc. Investigate who you are, remove the core
                                  false assumptions we have of our being. You are not the mind, the
                                  mind are transient waves appearing in non-conceptual, oceanic
                                  awareness. Rather than fully fixated on thoughts... release your
                                  fixation and identifications by recognizing the non-conceptual
                                  wide-open space of awareness in which thought appears in. Rather
                                  than being identified with one of the waves separate from all
                                  else... have your stand as your true identity,
                                  infinite-being-awareness, beyond the realm of conceptual, and be
                                  free. (and you are still free to use your mind as a tool without
                                  being binded by it)</p>
              <p>In a way it is like lucid dreaming: you can still dream/think,
                                  yet you won't fear because of the dream image of a tiger as you
                                  know the dream self and the dream tiger are not absolutely real but
                                  are just illusory projections manifesting in one's consciousness.
                                  Rather than being lost in one's stories, if you realise we are not
                                  the dream self and dream content but the Awareness in which all
                                  that appears, we can be lucid and aware in the thinking and
                                  playfully 'manipulate' the objects of the 'dream' without suffering
                                  and being absolutely lost in the stories.</p>

              <p>Earlier on there was a moment when all conceptions paused and perception was vivid and clear and blissful... and then a concept arose, 'awareness is the source of all beauty', but immediately this concept was seen and dropped because 'beauty' is a dualistic concept as opposed to 'ugly'. If I am attached to an an experience as 'beautiful', then there will be some other experiences seen as 'ugly/distasteful', etc.</p>
              <p>Awareness is not the source of beauty and ugliness. These are totally concepts and it is amazing how the mind with all its labels and stories hypnotizes one into believing these as truth, or as Steve Hagen puts it, 'override perception with conception'. Awareness only IS. Truth IS. Nothing else can be said (Truth is not This or That, it only IS). It is objectless. We only touch Truth by direct, naked, perception.</p>
              <p>Just found something in 'Buddhism Is Not What You Think' by Steve Hagen 
                          that I like alot and relevant to what I just described.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A buddha, an awakened person, is someone who <em>just sees</em> - that is, someone who does not confuse conception with perception.</p>
              <p>Pure perception is an objectless Awareness. It's prior to all our mental formations, our packaging of experience into things, thoughts, and feelings - and into "I" and "that."</p>
              <p>What most distinguishes a buddha from an ordinary person has to do with this matter of <em>just seeing. </em>There is no difference between the perception of a buddha and the rest of us. The difference lies in how a buddha deals with concepts that naturally arise. A buddha doesn't confuse thinking with <em>seeing, </em>and neither does a buddha let a thought or concept override perception.</p>
              <p>When we're caught up in what we think, we can't be clear about what we <em>see, </em>though this is rarely obvious to us. Instead of <em>just seeing, </em>most of us most of the time search for a better idea, a more useful concept, a clearer explanation that will at last crack open the world for us.</p>
              <p>But the world doesn't need cracking open. It's open already. Neither does it need (nor can it possibly have) any explanation, as if it were a puzzle or a formula or an equation.</p>
              <p>Reality is actually very familiar to all of us. It's only because we're so easily and continuously caught up in our thoughts and conceptual habits that we miss it.</p>

              <p>Agreed. In fact Awareness is precisely what allows middle way.</p>
              <p>If a person has a family but meditates 20 hours a day, that proves his lack of awareness of his relative condition than presence of awareness.</p>
              <p>The practice isn't about sitting all day. If one has this understanding, then one has the wrong understanding of practice. The practice is about sitting, standing, walking, chopping wood, carrying water, all in the presence of awareness. The path (practice), the ground (Mind) are indistinguishable.</p>
              <p>A true practitioner can go to a marketplace and there is nothing at all that distinguishes him by appearance between him and other ordinary people. You just cannot tell! Yet in him there is no suffering, no attachment, full of clarity. If one has even a tiny bit of clinging to a 'holy appearance' left in him, he is still clinging to delusion, still clinging to ego. What's left when all trace of delusions, of a separate self, is removed? Chop wood, carry water, moving your hands and feets, blinking your eyes, Ordinary Mind is Tao/Buddha.</p>
              <p>The world that a Buddha perceives and lives in and the world a sentient being perceives and lives in is the same ordinary world, except that a sentient being is lost in its dualistic thoughts and concepts about it (about the world as consisting of discrete, persisting entities separated from the Whole and from each other and from us), while a Buddha clearly distinguishes between (does not confuse one with another) conception and pure perception of reality as it is.</p>
              <p>Zen Master Tozan describes an enlightened person in this way:<em> He stands in the midst of the filth of the world, "his head covered with

Practicing in this way the seeds of the poison tree of dualistic vision never even get a chance to sprout, much less to take root and grow.</p>
              <p><strong>So the practitioner lives his or her life in an ordinary way, without needing any rules other than his own awareness, but always remaining in the state of primordial unity by integrating his state with whatever arises as part of his experience, and with absolutely nothing to be seen outwardly to show that he is practicing. This is what is meant by self-liberation, this is what is meant by the name Zogqen, which means 'Great Perfection', and this is what is meant by non-dual contemplation, or simply contemplation. </strong></p>

              <p>Some notes on mind and identification:</p>
              <p>If there is any fears, suffering, doubts, worries, discontent, etc... or simply an incessant stream of thinking beyond your control... it means there is still some kind of misidentification - i.e. identifying yourself with the mind, body, who you think you are, your stories. The habit of false identification to 'pull us back to samsara' is hard to avoid and has a momentum on its own unless we take our stand as presence-awareness. The apparent 'loss of presence' is not an actual loss of presence (presence is always there and can never be lost), but rather the habit of mind to fixate and misidentify with the conceptual mind and stories, thus losing vivid sight of non-conceptual naked awareness.</p>
              <p><strong>But actually you are not your mind, and just to realise this there is immense liberation</strong>. It is because when you exclusively identify with your mind and its stories.. when one identifies purely with the conceptual.. one invests belief in the thoughts and one will be compelled to react to and chase after every single thought that arise, whether they are happy or sad stories, identifying with all thoughts in a personal manner.</p>
              <p>But if we go beyond pure conceptual view and simply directly SEE... we see that really these mind movements are only impersonal happenings spontaneously arising and perceived in consciousness. When we go beyond purely identifying with the conceptual mind/false self, beyond the notion of individuality and all its stories, there is no basis for the fears, suffering, etc. You see that the notion of being an individual self is purely conceptual and never was real or present to begin with. You see that what you are this non-conceptual reality without limitations. The belief in a conceptual identity is dropped, along with all the suffering, fears, unhappiness, etc. The key lies in discovering one's identity as the timeless non-conceptual presence-awareness.</p>
              <p>If we truly see a thought as just an impersonal transient arising in awareness rather than identifying with it or getting lost in the conceptual content, then they can be left as they are, seen for what it is, but not being reacted to. Awareness is like a non-stick pan, the thoughts that appear are not being identified with, and so they lose the power to 'chain up' into further stories. In other words, they just dissolve on its own accord. Being rooted in the non-conceptual clarity, conceptual thoughts and stories that appear are not being taken with absolute seriousness. One will find oneself increasingly simply resting in non-conceptual naked perception of Awareness. One will know a much vaster realm of knowing, intelligence, clarity, bliss, joy, peace.</p>
              <p>All suffering have their origins in a root sense of being an individual person, a 'me' that owns or is its mind, stories, its body, its history, etc. Investigate who you are, remove the core false assumptions we have of our being. You are not the mind, the mind are transient waves appearing in non-conceptual, oceanic awareness. Rather than fully fixated on thoughts... release your fixation and identifications by recognizing the non-conceptual wide-open space of awareness in which thought appears in. Rather than being identified with one of the waves separate from all else... have your stand as your true identity, infinite-being-awareness, beyond the realm of conceptual, and be free. (and you are still free to use your mind as a tool without being binded by it)</p>
              <p>In a way it is like lucid dreaming: you can still dream/think, yet you won't fear because of the dream image of a tiger as you know the dream self and the dream tiger are not absolutely real but are just illusory projections manifesting in one's consciousness. Rather than being lost in one's stories, if you realise we are not the dream self and dream content but the Awareness in which all that appears, we can be lucid and aware in the thinking and playfully 'manipulate' the objects of the 'dream' without suffering and being absolutely lost in the stories.</p>

              <p>Reading through Suzanne Segal's article again today, I think Suzanne Segal wrote a clear map in her book of her journey from I AM, then refining that experience through the impersonality aspect (this aspect wasn't that clear to me the last time I read her article so didn't make as much of an impression), then moving to the Non Dual stage. (though not yet at the Anatta stage of realisation) What's unique (well not exactly unique, as all of us *will* go through this to one degree or another) is her very strong (stronger than others I believe) experience of the Dark Night of the Soul to put it in Christian contemplative words or the Dukkha Nanas in Buddhist terminology. Also, she seems to be mistaken that her experience of impersonality is the same as the insight of Anatta in Buddhism, which clearly isn't, though there are similarities and can be mistaken as such.</p>
              <p>Thusness told me that both impersonality and non dual are described in her book.</p>
              <p>For example, her initial experience of the I AM/Witness as a result of an intense dissociative experience still has a thread of personality at first -</p>

In the gaping space that appeared, what I had previously called 'me' was forcefully pushed out of its usual location inside me into a new location that was approximately a foot behind and to the left of my head. 'I' was now behind my body looking out at the world without using the body's eyes."</strong></p>
              <p>Walking home from that bus ride, she felt like a "cloud of awareness" following the body. The cloud was a witness located behind and to the left of the body and completely separate from body, mind and emotions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

              <p>Later on, she realised Non Dual.</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Still, all the reassurance was yielding no joy, until an
              abrupt transition saw a change in knowledge from 'There is no
              personal self', to 'There is <em>no other'. </em>This occurred
              while Segal was driving to see some friends when</p>
              <p><strong>"I suddenly became aware that I was driving
              through myself. For years there had been no self at all, yet here
              on this road, everything was myself, and I was driving through me
              to arrive where I already was. In essence, I was going nowhere
              because I was everywhere already. The infinite emptiness I new
              myself to be was now apparent as the </strong><em><strong>infinite
              substance</strong></em><strong> of everything I saw."</strong></p>
              <p>So the emptiness she had known as a state of consciousness now
              became the vastness of all existence.</p>
              <p>Soon afterward, while spending a weekend at a Buddhist retreat
              center in northern California, a new awareness arose. It was a
              fluidity of perception in which entities were perceived as the
              vastness itself, and all was pervaded by calm. Also she now came
              to know that she was the substance of the vastness. She knew this
              not through the sense organs, but through the substance that 'she
              was'. She describes this as a finger drawing in the sand, where
              the substance of vastness is the finger, the drawing and the
              sand.</p>
              <p>And now she saw the fear for what it was. Previously she had
              assigned meaning to the fear, viewing it as an indication of the
              invalidity of the experience of no-self. Now she saw fear as fear
              without meaning. Fear was no different than form, emptiness,
              pain, enlightenment. Everything is made of the same substance as
              vastness. Seeing this, knowing this, the grip of fear broke and
              joy finally arose.</p>
              <p>...............<em><strong><br></strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>"As I drove through the wintry landscape on my way there, everything seemed more fluid. The mountains, trees, rocks, birds, sky were all losing their differences. As I gazed about, what I saw first was how they were one; then, as a second wave of perception, I saw the distinctions. But the perception of the substance they were all made of did not occur through the physical body. Rather, the vastness was perceiving itself out of itself at every point in itself. A lovely calm pervaded everything - no ecstasy, no bliss, just calm."</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>"This non-localized, infinite substance can be perceived not with the eyes or ears or nose, but by the substance itself, out of itself. When the substance of unity encounters itself, it knows itself through its own sense organ. Form is like a drawing in the sand of oneness, where the drawing, the sand, and the finger that draws it are all one."</strong></em></p>

              <p>Just 2 days ago... I was noticing my mind's attempts to re-confirm and abide in the Self that I intuitively felt shouldn't be necessary. I was also thinking could this be related to what Thusness said about dissolving the need to re-confirm, and I was thinking of asking Thusness.</p>
              <p>Without my asking him... the next day Thusness just told me (somehow he knew) that I'm in the midst of attempting to re-confirm the Self, and that I have to get over this phase as well. He also told me that I will cycle through the 4 phases of I AM again and again, without knowing it, so it is good he pointed out the phases for me. He also told me I should take it only as a guideline, it is not a bible, and that he told me as he thought it will be help for me to know exactly what I am experiencing, not to hinder my progress.</p>

              <p><em>When you are abiding as I AM, there is no 
              sense of time and
                                      space. There is only the all-pervading Self. It 
              is very obvious
                                      that Awareness doesn't move! It is totally 
              timeless. From this
                                      perspective, there is no death. Why? Because 
              Awareness is the
                                      ground reality, the Eternal Now, in which things
               come and go, pops
                                      in and out of this Ground, but this Eternal 
              Present, this
                                      Awareness, which is what you are, is unaffected,
               unmoved. As
                                      Awareness, you are unborn, undying. Ask yourself
               - things come and
                                      go, thoughts come and go, but have you ever 
              moved out of the
                                      Present Moment, and is the Present Moment even 
              affected in any way
                                      by the comings and goings? The answer is No!</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today just found something similar in Standing As Awareness: The Direct Path by Greg Goode (recommended book):</p>
              <p><strong>Experiment with being awareness</strong></p>
              <p>To get a taste of being awareness, here's something you can do at any time during the day or night. Take a moment and just be, without preconceived notions, even notions about awareness. Don't be a body or mind. Don't take yourself as anything at all. And just openly notice how images and appearances and even gestalts and points of view come and go. Check to see whether you have the experience that YOU come and go. Or do you as witnessing awareness remain perfectly and peacefully present and unmoving, clear and open?</p>

              <p>I notice that Presence, Beingness, Awareness is only truly 'in the foreground' if we stop *all* thoughts. This cannot be forced but is a natural result of letting go in meditation. You will never notice your true essence if you are caught up in conceptualizing, as What You Are can only be touched directly without intermediary and concepts. In a moment of complete silence and thoughtlessness, if you ask "Who am I?" "What is This?" your Buddha-Nature and True Self will shine forth you will realise the blank and void you thought was there is suffused with spacious presence, beingness, existence, aliveness, clarity and awareness. It is THAT which knows the absence and presence of thoughts. You will have no doubt that You Are, that palpable I AM-ness is the most (in fact, only) undoubtable and obvious fact of your 
                  being, and what you truly are is not who you thought you are, but something prior, more fundamental and closer than your own thought and breath.</p>

              <p>Something I wrote days ago:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;"><em></em></span></p>
              <p> ....Also... I notice that though Awareness is 
              always present, there
                                      can be degrees of luminosity - clarity to it.</p>
              <p>Actually Awareness is 100% fully present all 
              the times, but if
                                      we keep engaging in conceptual activities, then 
              awareness is not
                                      experienced as vivid as before.</p>
              <p>Why is that so?</p>
              <p>Because Awareness can only be experienced 
              directly, without
                                      intermediary, it must be directly touched. That 
              is why the
                                      importance of "<em>not being distracted by 
              having our attention
                                      divided by activities of mind"</em></p>
              <p>The further we drop... the brighter and more 
              intense the
                                      luminosity is experienced. Perception becomes 
              vivid and 'intense'
                                      (not that things becomes more intense, but even 
              ordinary things
                                      like eating and walking becomes vivid and clear 
              and wonderful).
                                      That is why Adam says be 'brightly' aware. 
              Sometimes I even get a
                                      mental image of my mind as brightly shining like
               a sun, even though
                                      the mental image is not the reality itself but 
              the closest
                                      conceptual representation of the formless 
              'thing' that the mind can
                                      find.</p>
              <p>It can be so intense that you will 
              spontaneously smile, there
                                      may even be tears, at the sheer wonder of it. 
              Friends may find you
                                      weird if you are walking with them. LOL</p>
              <p>So why did Mahakashyapa smile at the twirling
               flower?</p>
              <p>By the way... the letting go and the 
              luminosity re-inforces each
                                      other: the more you let go, the more luminous 
              perception is, and
                                      the more luminous perception is, the more 
              willing you are to let go
                                      of the mind activities. Because it is so 
              wonderful!</p>
              <p>Perhaps this is what Thusness meant when he 
              said years ago,</p>

              <div>Jax Peterson: What then is the Natural State, which is another name for Rigpa or 
                                              primordial Awareness? In the chair that you are actually sitting in, 
                                              notice the room.  If there is a window, look out the window...notice 
                                              what you see.  Just notice it.  Look at your hands... just notice them. 
                                               Look at the computer monitor... just notice without assessment or 
                                              evaluation.  Again now, look out the window...just look without 
                                              labelling what is perceived.  Move your head and slowly just look around
                                               the room that you are in.  Without thinking about anything, totally 
                                              topic free... just be in that moment of simply observing the room.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>That simple observingness is the Natural State of primordial 
                                              Awareness.  It is not more elaborate or more profound.  It just the 
                                              observing of what is there.  This observing, aware quality of 
                                              consciousness is Rigpa.  How easy!  When we just stay with that 
                                              effortless watching without agenda, that is Rigpa in its Natural State. 
                                               When engaged in our thinking and evaluating what is perceived, that is 
                                              the functioning of mind... the arising of the the make-believe world of 
                                              labels and opinions.  That is an unnecessary activity added to the basic
                                               condition of just being...just observing.  This thinking "about" what 
                                              is observed is samsara.  When we just are in naked observing we are in 
                                              Nirvana.  Since our observational awareness is functioning in this 
                                              moment... how can you say you can't grasp Rigpa or the Natural State?  
                                              This simpe observingness is not the result of practice, 
                                              intellectualizing or study.  You are already observing whatever you are 
                                              observing.  That is Rigpa or the Buddha Mind in its most Natural State. 
                                               When we say relax into Rigpa or Awareness, that is what is relaxed 
                                              into...just simple noticing-ness or perceivingness. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In this there is nothing to maintian as you are always <span style="text-decoration: underline;">observing,
                                               you can't help but observing.</span>  This observing quality of 
                                              consciousness is there by default... isn't it?  You are either observing
                                               thoughts, feelings, sensations or external perceptions.  But the 
                                              observingness never changes, only the experience.  There is absolutely 
                                              nothing to understand or grasp in this perceivingness.  It never knows 
                                              itself and has no understanding of anything... it just is observing like
                                               a big eyeball.  That is what you are:  just a big eye ball observing, 
                                              seeing, looking...so to speak.  This observing doesn't think or evaluate
                                               ...it just is pure being and pure being is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> observing.  If
                                               you really don't get this please let me know... we are so close!  We 
                                              have covered all the angles... nothing is left!</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Abandon the "thinking mind" and just be the observing... it is the 
                                              Absolute as it is.  The "thinkiing mind" is just an unnecessary add-on, 
                                              the genus and dimension of imaginary existence, which is what samsara is
                                               created from.  No thought... no samsara.  The space of room is just 
                                              there without any need to improve it nor need to try to maintain it.  
                                              The same with Awareness, our everyday, ordinary awareness...</div>

              <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><br>You say
               that you want "peace of mind." But you can never have that. The 
              thoughts, sensations, and feelings of the so-called mind are, by turns, 
              calming, exciting, ludicrous, resentful, sexual, sacred, acrimonious, 
              and loving. This is a natural part of your functioning. This is what the
               mind is: The arisings of all of those previously-mentioned things. So 
              when you meditate in an attempt to either stop your mind or to watch it 
              long enough to where it appears to be stopped, you will inevitably fail.
               But you most certainly can have peace. Just take note that you are 
              actually not your thoughts. </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">You are that eternally spacious and

              <p><em>Most of us who are intersted in awakening have been seeking a 
              long time. Yet although there may be many glimpses, true permanent 
              awakening has not come. Instead there may be confusion and even despair… </em></p>
              <p>&gt; ‘WHAT IF IT DOESN’T COME!!’</p>
              <p>Confusion means that we no longer think we know what the answer is - 
              we no longer have the hubris to think we know where to turn. Good. In 
              confusion and despair there is at last a real opportunity to let the 
              heart open wide to what really is.</p>
              <p>You know already that there is no one in there calling the shots. 
              When you look inside yourself, you see that there is no one in there, 
              right? What you see is a bunch of thoughts, which you call your ‘mind’. 
              No real existence. Just ephemeral things which appear and disappear, 
              like a bird across the sky. Thoughts are not really needed for anything 
              are they? There one moment, gone the next. We watch the bird as it soars
               across the wide sky, and scarcely notice the sky at all. Long after the
               bird is gone however, the sky remains. Untouched, pure, without end.</p>
              <p>Similarly with the thing you call ‘you’. Thoughts about ‘you’ come 
              and go. Confusion or desperation comes and goes. Happiness comes and 
              goes. But the central core in which these events occur remains. Nothing 
              sticks to it. At night in deep dreamless sleep all the joys and sorrows 
              go. In the morning such thoughts return, along with the idea of ‘you’. 
              But the core, the boundless space within which the world, ideas, 
              concepts, happiness, fear, awaking, appear… that alone remains. Pure, 
              untouched, constant.</p>
              <p>The trouble is that when we think of awakening we think that it is 
              the ego which awakens. Impossible of course, since the ego is just an 
              idea. And how can an idea awaken? It cannot. Awakening means simply that
               the eternal core in which all occurs, is permanently noticed. In a 
              sense it becomes more interesting than anything else. Or said more 
              simply, when a bird crosses the sky we notice the sky in which it 
              appears.</p>
              <p>How? Just realise that amongst confusion, desperation, fear, longing,
               joy, horrible job, or whatever appears, there is something that it 
              appears in. With a little practice this will become so easy that effort 
              is no longer required. You begin to see things as they really are - love
               without boundary. The very concept of an ‘I’ will fall away then, 
              because it will no longer be needed. And you will clearly see, and 
              permanently be, the boundless freedom you have always been but in 
              confusion, have temporarily forgotten.</p>
              <p>Freedom does not mean freedom from thoughts or problems. It simply 
              means freedom from being bound by them. It means permanently noticing 
              that you never were.</p>

              <p>Jason Swason:</p>
              <p>By turning the attention to the mind, immediately there are doubts.  
              More thoughts rush in to question the questions, confirm or contradict 
              other thoughts.  A maddening cycle...<br><br>Notice when thoughts are 
              paused there are no doubts; the certainty of (doubtless)Being is 
              obviously present; the unquestionable FACT of EXISTENCE. Notice that the
               Being is ALWAYS presently shining, effortlessly and spontaneously. Stay
               with that undeniable non-conceptual confidence. Your Being has always 
              been present for every single experience. That natural cognition in 
              which all experiences arise is not a person.<br><br>Be as you ARE and 
              not what you imagine yourself to be.</p>

              <p>Whatever comes and goes: emotions, thoughts, feelings, etc.... even subtle feelings of expansiveness, spaciousness, and so on... all these are not your Essential Self.</p>
              <p>Your Essential Self is not something which comes and goes, it is not even feelings of expansion or spaciousness.</p>
              <p>Rather it is the spaciousness in which all experiences (even that of spaciousness) arise and subside from. THAT does not come and go.</p>
              <p>If you ever felt frustrated that you lost something, e.g. an experience of spaciousness, etc... just know that whatever is lost cannot be Who You Are and therefore is not really important.</p>
              <p>Underneath all comings and goings is the complete still-ness which can never be lost.</p>

              <p><strong>Walking/Jogging/Running meditation</strong></p>
              <p>While jogging just now, I 'forgot' my mind and body. It feels like I'm the still presence in which the world moves through. Instead of being a body running on the road from here to there, it's seen that I am the space that encompasses the whole world and the whole world moves through me. I am not moving. The world is moving through me.</p>
              <p>It feels like you're running on the threadmill, you're not actually moving! Except that the scenery moves through you.</p>
              <p>You can practice seeing this next time when you walk or jog. This space of awareness is unmoving, whether or not the world is moving.</p>
