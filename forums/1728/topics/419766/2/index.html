              <p>talking about bees, reminds me...</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>I am reminded of another story that is a matter of public record.<br>When you recite the Buddha’s name, you should transfer the merit<br>to all living beings; you shouldn’t just recite for your own sake.<br>When you recite the name of a Buddha even once and dedicate the<br>merit and virtue from your recitation to all living beings, you<br>thereby increase the merit and virtue of the recitation, and you<br>make it penetrate without obstruction.<br>Once, Shakyamuni Buddha went to a certain country to collect<br>alms, accompanied by all of his disciples except Mahamaudgalyayana<br>only to find that no one there would give them offerings.<br>Neither the king, nor his government officials, nor the citizens<br>made offerings to the Buddha or his disciples. Later, however,<br>when Mahamaudgalyayana arrived in that country, there was a<br>complete change of heart. The king, the officials, and all the<br>citizens very respectfully gathered around to welcome Mahamaudgalyayana<br>and to bow to him. They beseeched him to let them know<br>what he needed so they could make offerings to him. The Buddha’s<br>disciples did not understand why the Buddha, one of such great<br>virtue, received no offerings from the people of this country, while<br>when the Buddha’s disciple arrived, the whole town turned out to<br>greet him and everyone made offerings to him. “What’s the<br>meaning of this?” the disciples asked the Buddha.</em></p>
              <p><em>The Buddha told his disciples: “The great officials and the<br>citizens made no offerings to me because in a past life I failed to set<br>up conditions with them and consequently we have no affinity with<br>one another. Once long, long ago, ages prior to this one, Mahamaudgalyayana<br>was a firewood gatherer. One day while picking up<br>firewood he bumped against a nest of bees, and they swarmed out<br>to attack him. Mahamaudgalyayana simply recited the Buddha’s<br>name and made a vow saying, ‘Namo Buddha. You bees, don’t<br>sting me! In the future when I have realized the Way, you will be<br>the first ones I take across to Buddhahood. Renounce your evil<br>thoughts and stop harming people.’ As a result of this vow, the bees<br>did not sting him. Eventually the queen bee became the king of this<br>country and the drones and workers became the officials and<br>citizens. When Mahamaudgalyayana, now a Bhikshu, came to this<br>city, the former bees whom he had to take across all bowed and<br>welcomed him. Such is the power of his former vow.”<br>Taking this situation to heart, we should always establish<br>wholesome affinities by being kind to everyone. We should vow to<br>lead all people and all creatures to Buddhahood. A vow is invisible,<br>but living beings have the equivalent of a radio receiver in their<br>minds, so they can tune in to it. A vow is not tangible or visible, but<br>beings will instinctively know if you are good to them. You should<br>resolve to rescue all living beings. Anyone who maintains this<br>frame of mind will have affinities wherever he goes.</em> -- late Master Hsuan Hua</p>
