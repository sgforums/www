              <p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
              <p>Sanskrit grammar offers two possibilities for breaking up the compound: either <em>TathÄ�</em> and <em>Ä�gata</em> or <em>TathÄ�</em> and <em>gata.</em><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tathagatha#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> <em>TathÄ�</em> means <em>thus</em> in Sanskrit and Pali, and Buddhist thought takes this to refer to what is called <em>reality as-it-is</em> (<em>YathÄ�-bhÅ«ta</em>). This reality is also referred to as <em>thusness</em> or <em>suchness</em> (<em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Tathata" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tathata">tathatÄ�</a></em>) indicating simply that it (reality) is what it is.</p>
              <p>A Buddha or <a title="Arhat" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat">Arhat</a> is defined as someone who 'knows and sees reality as-it-is' (<em>yathÄ� bhÅ«ta ñÄ�na dassana</em>). <em>Gata</em> is the past passive participle of the verbal root <em>gam</em> (going, traveling). <em>Ä€gata</em> adds the verbal prefix <em>Ä€</em> which gives the meaning “come, arrival, gone-unto”.</p>
              <p>Thus in this interpretation TathÄ�gata means literally either, “The one who has <em>gone</em> to suchness” or, "The one who has <em>arrived</em> at suchness".</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><em>The
              myriad of things and phenomena in this world are formed by aggregations
              of numerous causes and conditions comprising four elements: earth,
              water, fire and wind. As such, they do not have independent natures of
              their own. A tree, for example, is the result of a combination of
              nutrients, water, sunlight and air. Thus, they are in fact empty
              because when the conditions that created and sustained them are no
              longer present, these objects will return to emptiness. However, we
              don't see them in this light. We think they are real, absolute and
              permanent. But they are not. They are dependent upon other conditions.
              We need to truly comprehend and awaken to this fundamental truth of
              emptiness.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The phrase 'all form is non-form' is from the Diamond SÅ«tra. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
              said, "SubhÅ«ti, what do you think? Can we use our ordinary flesh-eyes
              to see the TathÄ�gata’s physical form and thus believe we are seeing the
              true TathÄ�gata ?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">SubhÅ«ti
              replied, "No, World-honoured One. We cannot look upon the unreal form
              of the TathÄ�gata’s manifestation and think we have perceived the
              non-arising and non-ceasing true body of the TathÄ�gata."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">How
              is that? The 16-foot physique of the TathÄ�gata is a bodily form
              produced by an aggregation of causes and conditions. When life ends,
              that body decays and eventually vanishes. It is not the truly pure
              Dharma-kÄ�ya of the TathÄ�gata because the Dharma-kÄ�ya has no form to be
              seen; it is empty and tranquil. How could flesh-eyes of sentient beings
              see the true form of the TathÄ�gata’s Dharma-kÄ�ya?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
              told SubhÅ«ti, "Not only is the TathÄ�gata’s bodily form a false form
              produced by the aggregation of causes and conditions, which does not
              have real substance, so is any kind of thing in the universe, in this
              world as well as beyond this world. All living and non-living things,
              shapes and colours are merely formed by aggregations of causes and
              conditions. They are impermanent and will change as causes and
              conditions disperse. They are as illusory as the flower in the mirror
              or the moon in the water!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"If
              looking at appearances of objects, sentient beings are able to lucidly
              awaken to its aggregation of causes and conditions, and understand
              impermanence, their arising and ceasing; and if at that very instant,
              distinguishing does not arise, then without discrimination, they can
              enter into deep stillness. In stillness, pure wisdom reveals itself.
              With supreme wisdom, they realise that all worldly form is created by
              causes and conditions. Its nature is empty; it is not reality. In this
              way, they will directly perceive the TathÄ�gata’s Dharma-kÄ�ya."</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">SubhÅ«ti
              was the Arahat who best understood emptiness. Thus, with regards to
              emptiness, he had profound realisation. We see this in a story:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Once,
              Buddha went to the heavenly palace of TrayastrimÅ›Ä�s to preach Dharma to
              his mother. He only returned to earth after having been gone for a few
              months. All of his disciples missed him. When he returned, they rushed
              to welcome him, each hoping to be the first to pay their respects to
              him. Being the most advanced in supernatural ability amongst the
              Buddha's female disciples, BhiksunÄ« Lián-huÄ�-sè (è“®èŠ±è‰²) used her
              supernatural powers and transformed herself into the image of
              Saint-king CakravartÄ«. Then, with great poise, she went to stand right
              up in front. She very happily paid her respects toBuddha and said,
              "Disciple Lián-huÄ�-sè is the first to pay respects to Buddha today. Oh,
              I’m overjoyed!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha replied with a smile, "Lián-huÄ�-sè, the first to see the TathÄ�gata wasn’t you. It was SubhÅ«ti!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">BhiksunÄ«
              Lián-huÄ�-sè was astonished! SubhÅ«ti had not joined in the queue to
              welcome the Buddha. How could he have been the first to meet the Buddha?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
              then said, "The bodily form of the TathÄ�gata is not seen by our
              perceptions. He who sees the Dharma, sees the TathÄ�gata." </span></p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="95%" align="center">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td colspan="2" valign="top">

              </tr>

              </table>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">As
              it turned out, when Buddha returned to earth, SubhÅ«ti had been in the
              meditation hall sitting in stillness, deeply observing the emptiness of
              all things and phenomena, clearly understanding the reality of inherent
              emptiness, and thus realising the formless Dharma-kÄ�ya of TathÄ�gata.
              Even though he had not been there in the queue, he had in fact truly
              seen the TathÄ�gata.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
              has three bodies (TrikÄ�ya). One is 'NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya'(åŒ–èº«), or the
              'Emanation Body'. According to the sentient beings' capacity for
              understanding, Buddha manifests the illusory forms of physical bodies
              in numerous worlds. Because of their heavy karmic hindrances, some
              disciples were only able to see the 16-foot golden body of the Buddha,
              but were unable to see the 32 physical characteristics and 80
              accompanying physical features of a great person (i.e.
              DvÄ�trimÅ›advara-laksana and Anuvyañjana).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Another
              body of Buddha is 'Sambhoga-kÄ�ya' (æŠ¥èº«), or the 'benefiting body', of
              which are two kinds: one is the 'body which benefits oneself', and the
              other is the 'body which benefits others'. The former is the Buddha's
              own attainment and awakening to his meritorious intrinsic pure
              Buddha-nature, in the state of Dharma joy. The latter is the appearance
              of enlightened, liberated Bodhisattvas to guide beginner-Bodhisattvas
              (i.e. sentient beings who emulate Bodhisattvas and practise the
              Bodhisattva Way) according to prevailing causalities, enabling these
              beginner-Bodhisattvas to benefit from the teachings of Greater Vehicle
              (MahÄ�yÄ�na) with Dharma joy. Both NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya and Sambhoga-kÄ�ya are
              physical forms which are visible. However, the perfect Sambhoga-kÄ�ya of
              Great Bodhisattvas is a form that is infinite and of awesome majesty.
              It is not something that ordinary sentient beings like us can see. What
              ordinary people see is the NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya form.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The
              third body of Buddha, named 'Dharma-kÄ�ya'(æ³•èº«), is the Truth Body of the
              TathÄ�gata, and also the reality of all phenomena. It permeates all of
              space and is omnipresent. An ancient sage said, "Green bamboos are
              entirely Dharma-kÄ�ya, luxuriant chrysanthemums are all PrajñÄ�; each
              grass, each tree, all in the ocean of Buddha-nature. Green bamboos are
              used for expressing the state of Dharma-kÄ�ya, but bamboos are by no
              means Dharma-kÄ�ya. Luxuriant chrysanthemums are used for displaying the
              function of PrajñÄ�, but chrysanthemums are by no means PrajñÄ�."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The
              myriad of things and phenomena in this world are formed by aggregations
              of numerous causes and conditions comprising four elements and five
              skandhas , arising by causality and ceasing by causality; their nature
              is inherently empty. And everything in the world is as such. They do
              not exist as individual entities. Hence, the nature of all things and
              phenomena is empty, tranquil and all pervasive. However, people are
              unaware of this and are grasping on to their belief that the numerous
              forms in the universe truly exist. But if you can truly comprehend this
              and awaken to the realisation that the nature of all forms is
              emptiness, then instantaneously you perceive the pure Dharma-kÄ�ya of
              TathÄ�gata.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>
