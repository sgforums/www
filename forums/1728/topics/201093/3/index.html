We consider Him as our teacher and we thus respect Him as such.  Buddhists bowing to a statue of the Buddha is simply our way of showing respect.  This is akin to saluting a country's flag, or standing up while a national anthem is being played.<br><br>The Buddha has said that the best way to respect him is to practice his Teachings.  So why not learn dharma and apply the wisdom of dharma in ur daily life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>When Buddha teached Karma he wanted us to understand tat <strong>nobody but we ourselves is in control of our fate</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Sorry for intruding.. I'm wondering.. Which part of Buddhism did you get to see that Kumanthongs are Spirits?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> And which part did you get to learn that Kumanthongs harboured anger?? Are you referring to Spirits?? Like Jin??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Omg!! Kumanthongs are not spirits.. Why did pple just choose to believe what others stated in Just webby?? Webby are also written by Humans right??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Buddhism is here to teach us to be good and follow be Kind.. But i believe not about reading blindly.. There are changes everyday.. Alot of Buddhas and Deities also not included in Buddha History.. Where do they come from? And when?? Nobody really knows.. From where can we know? From others knowledge?? I hoped that everyone will look at this with an open mind..<br><br>Always believe in what we can see.. Not just by what written by Humans.. I believe not ALL BUDDHIST follow the precepts.. If so..<br><br><strong>May i ask the moderators here.. How many are you staying COndos?? How many are having credit cards??<br><br>House and luxury are not welcome in Buddhism and Dharma.. Why?? Cos house is just a shelter.. Food is to keep us going.. Then how many of you actually follow??<br><br>Fo zai xing zhong you..  </strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>May i know, if anyone seen how a master really invite Kumanthongs in to statues?? Or is human just believing in DRAMAS only?? Keke no need to be so strain about such matters..<br><br>My Kumanthongs have been with me for many years already.. They have been listening to Buddha scriptures with me everyday.. If they were ghost.. They will be long gone... I guess LOGIC or COMMON SENSE is needed here..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey everyone,<br>Seems like the thread i started have caused some unhappiness in the forums.<br>To set things straight once and for all, I did really had the intention of getting a Kumantong for my business purpose and was just looking around for opinions as my knowledge is limited and thus need some advice. Although I come from a Traditional Buddhist family, I was not a staunch buddhist untill recent years so pardon my lack of knowledge. I read up a thread in SOA regarding the matter and wanted to check and be sure just in case. Thus I started a thread in Buddhism : Wisdom Bliss to get more opinions, that's all. I would like to thank all the helpful forumites here for their help and the advice that was dished out. I would also like to thank SOA and Zacken and apologise if it cause him any displeasure in any way as they were very sincere in helping me with my enquiries too. I posted in both threads to clarify the matter only.Nothing else and some of the topics in SOA do seem familar to those in Wisdom Bliss,so pardon my mistake if i mistook SOA for a buddhist forum. I also wanna apologise to anyone affected if it has caused any unhappiness and misunderstanding amoung any forumites as my main intention was to get opinion of the matter,nothing more.I hope this thread carries on in a mood of discussion and sharing and be free of distorted meanings and agendas, as it was not meant to be so in the first place. Just forgive this fool who means no harm.</div>
