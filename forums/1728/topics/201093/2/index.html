            <div class='col-md body'>Hello waliao,<br><br>Living in Singapore, I'm sure you've visited Chinese temples before. Quite a handful of temples often have Buddha/Bodhisattvas statues among their deities statues on the shrine. You may even see some of the names of Buddha/Bodhisattvas on the yellow talisman. But does it mean such practice is Buddhism?<br><br>I guess it's the same situation with the KMT in Thai Buddhism.<br><br>Buddhism is a very "generous" religion, while we accepting the existence of such spiritual entities in the various forklore traditions, it allows Buddhism to blend in to the culture quickly.<br><br>At least in the Chinese temples, we should be "happy" in one sense as Buddha/Bodhisattvas will always be regarded as one rank above the deities. My sentiments is that I guess it's the same with KMT in Thai Buddhism --- that Buddha is the highest power among all other deities and spirits that they have.
