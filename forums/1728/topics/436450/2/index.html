              <p>Dhammapada is Buddha's words.</p>
              <p>Taking refuge is mentioned in many, not one, sutta.</p>
              <p>The 4NT implicitly implies the necessity of the three refuges. Without Buddha, there is no Dharma sassana, and without Sangha, the Dharma cannot be disseminated. They are interconnected and intrinsically inseparable.</p>

              <p>Can you be sure the Dhammapada is the Buddha's words only and does not contained some words from its writers'?</p>
              <p>The 4NT did NOT imply the refuge.  It is your implication.</p>
              <p>The refuge is like a respite from the world of samsara,  The sarana is like a place where one goes to find peace, security and safety.  By all means take refuge but the title of this thread is 'learning Buddhism starts with taking refuge' - to which I disagree.  You are barking up the wrong tree.</p>

                                      some time, so as to scientifically ascertain whether it leads to

              <p>I have written about faith in another thread. Suffice to say, there are people who go by faith - plain trust or belief.  If trust came about without some basis, check or verification, then it is blind faith. So the faith you talked about is actually blind faith.  People don't like the word 'blind' and I explained that already.</p>

              <p>...the Buddhist tradition insists that when we go for refuge to the 
                              Buddha, we place ourselves under the guidance of one who is distinctly 
                              different from ourselves, one who has scaled heights that we have barely
                               begun to glimpse.</p>
              <p>But when we rely upon the recluse Gotama as our refuge, we do not 
                              apprehend him merely as a particular individual, a wise and sensible 
                              sage. We apprehend him rather as a Buddha. It is his Buddhahood -- his 
                              possession of the full range of excellent qualities that come with 
                              perfect enlightenment -- that makes the recluse Gotama a refuge. In any 
                              cosmic epoch, a Buddha is that being who first breaks through the dark 
                              mass of ignorance encompassing the world and rediscovers the lost path 
                              to Nibbana, the cessation of suffering. He is the pioneer, the 
                              trailblazer, who discovers the path and proclaims the path so that 
                              others, by following his tracks, may extinguish their ignorance, arrive 
                              at true wisdom, and break the fetters that tie them to the round of 
                              repeated birth and death.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> For the refuge in the Buddha to be genuine, it must be accompanied by a 
                              commitment to the Buddha as an incomparable teacher, as unexcelled and 
                              unsurpassed.</strong></span></span> Strictly speaking, the historical Buddha is not unique 
                              since there have been earlier Fully Enlightened Ones who have arisen in 
                              past epochs and there will be others who will arise in future epochs as 
                              well. But in any one world system it is impossible for a second Buddha 
                              to arise while the teaching of another Buddha is still extant, and thus 
                              in terms of human history we are justified in regarding the Buddha as a 
                              unique teacher, unequalled by any other spiritual teacher known to 
                              humanity. It is this readiness to recognize the Buddha as "the 
                              unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, the teacher of gods and 
                              humans" that is the hallmark of an authentic act of taking refuge in the
                               Buddha.</p>

              <p>It is important to take refuge in the Buddha as an 'incomparable teacher, unexcelled and unsurpassed' - simply because there are countless teachers, most who do not teach you liberation but to a path contrary to liberation.</p>
              <p>That is why we must decide to follow the Buddha and not take refuge in other teachers who teach contrary to liberation.</p>
              <p>Means if we want to gain liberation, we must commit ourselves to Buddha as our main unsurpassed teacher, and not say some Hindu, Christian, or some other teachers.</p>

              <p>Buddhism provides you a method to ascertain yourself, but you have to follow it. For example, you can't attain enlightenment through hardcore ascetism, you can only attain enlightenment through eightfold path. So you must accept it by faith at first, put it into practice and see the results yourself. Just like any other scientific method.</p>

              <p>Buddhism provides you a method to ascertain yourself, but you have to follow it. For example, you can't attain enlightenment through hardcore ascetism, you can only attain enlightenment through eightfold path. So you must accept it by faith at first, put it into practice and see the results yourself. Just like any other scientific method.</p>

              <p>I am amazed you talk about 'method'.  I have expressed the 4NTs as a problem-solving method - the method to solve the problem of suffering.  Now you say the 4NTs is a method and not experential realization of the Buddha?</p>

              <p>It is well and good to talk about guidance.  The Buddha is
              dead.  How is he to guide you?  There are members of the
              sangha who don't teach.  They just want to practice to attain
              enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Back to what I said earlier, refuge taking is like seeking a
              place of peace and security.  That's why it is personal. 
              I am also aware of the chant, the exhortation.  But don't get
              confused.  This refuge-taking is a 'religious' requirement,
              not the requirement to attain nirvana.</p>

              <p>By your logic too...</p>
              <p>The sutras may not have been accurately transmitted.</p>
              <p>Then how will you ascertain which is the bonafide Dharma to guide you?</p>
              <p>The only way to do it is to first suspend your doubt, practise and find out if the sutras are telling the true story.  It's a risk one has to take.</p>

              <p>4NTs are truths derived from experiential realization, and the 4th truth - the path to the end of suffering, contains the method, the method being the noble eight fold path.</p>
              <p>So the method is one part of the 4 noble truths. The method is born out of Buddha's experience.</p>

              <p>The Buddha is dead but his dharma is still around, so we must rely on his dharma, and likewise, we must commit ourselves to him and his teachings and the community of enlightened ones as our main guidance towards liberation.</p>
              <p>Even though buddha is dead, we still have to commit ourselves to him as our main teacher, and not some others like jesus, mohammad or what not.</p>
              <p>If we do not make such commitment and go around learning and practicing various kinds of religions, then I'm afraid we may steer far away from the path of enlightenment.</p>

              <p>How one wants to commit is again personal.  Refuge-taking may be one.  To me, it is a 'religious-practice' requirement and does not necessarily mean that the refuge-taking Buddhist is a committed one!  People just go thru the ceremony for some reason, just like baptism. </p>
