              <p>How one wants to commit is again personal.  Refuge-taking

              and does not necessarily mean that the refuge-taking Buddhist is a
              committed one!  People just go thru the ceremony for some

              <p>By going thru the rite, it is supposed to be a form of commitment.  Since the rite is not the main point, why insist that one must take refuge?</p>

              <p>There are several meanings to the word 'realize' - to make concrete, to accomplish, to make it seems real.  The issue is how he 'realised'.  That the Buddha came up with the 4NT is not in question whatever words are used to express that.  When you said 'experential' realization - you are saying he realised the 4NT by experience only.</p>

              <p>The 4NT did NOT imply the refuge.  It is your implication.</p>
              <p>The refuge is like a respite from the world of samsara,  The sarana is like a place where one goes to find peace, security and safety.  By all means take refuge but the title of this thread is 'learning Buddhism starts with taking refuge' - to which I disagree.  You are barking up the wrong tree.</p>

              <p>said before, i like Hui Neng's approach as not to mislead followers in taking refuge in Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, he totally changed the word to taking refuge in Awarenessè§‰, Proper æ­£and Purityå‡€ respectively.</p>

              <p>i also think Intellect is not equal to <em>wisdom</em>. wisdom need experience and morality. if not Intellect can also be use to commit crimes and hurt people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Wisdom is more than just understanding on an intellectual level. It is only realized
                      when it becomes part of compassionate support. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">You can only increase your wisdom if you are compassionate, and you increase your
                      compassion as you acquire wisdom. One could use the image of a bicycle to explain this
                      truth. In this image, the two wheels of the bicycle would represent wisdom and compassion.
                      The front wheel, which steers the bicycle, is wisdom, and the back wheel, which drives the
                      bicycle forward, is compassion. The bicycle only functions when both wheels are in order.
                      You could say that the back wheel can only move forward when the front wheel moves forward
                      as well. Or you could say that the bicycle can only move forward properly when both wheels
                      move forward. The pedaling has to be done by you, though. And the steering.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Cleverness is not going to solve the real problems of the world, like war, civil
                      strife, poverty and the high incidence of violence. Neither is it going to solve the
                      mental problems so rife in the modern world. Only wisdom and compassion can solve these
                      problems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Only wisdom and compassion can give cleverness the right direction. It can turn science
                      into true progress. It can turn economy into something serving the people and the
                      environment, and not just profit and greed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Without these qualities, science can become a nightmare. Nuclear power has been used to
                      create weapons of mass destruction. Technology has been used to destroy people’s
                      livelihoods. Even medicine is often used in a heartless way in service of profit, causing
                      unnecessary suffering to millions of poor people and sending them prematurely to their
                      deaths. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">We are witnessing what damage can be done by economic systems serving mainly greed and
                      profit, and how they increase rather than diminish suffering and destruction. Only
                      compassion can turn cleverness into wisdom, and inspire economic systems dedicated to
                      improving conditions for all, and to sustaining the environment for future generations. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Only compassion and wisdom can solve the mental problems so rife in the world today,
                      for they can tame greed, the source of so much exploitation, dissatisfaction and futility. </span></p>

              <p>This was
                          said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: "Even if a
                          monk, taking hold of my outer cloak, were to follow right behind me, placing
                          his feet in my footsteps, yet if he were to be greedy for sensual pleasures,
                          strong in his passions, malevolent in mind, corrupt in his resolves, his
                          mindfulness muddled, unalert, uncentered, his mind scattered, &amp; his
                          faculties uncontrolled, then he would be far from me, and I from him. Why is
                          that? Because he does not see the Dhamma. Not seeing the Dhamma, he does not
                          see me.</p>

              <p>There are several meanings to the word 'realize' - to make
                  concrete, to accomplish, to make it seems real.  The issue is
                  how he 'realised'.  That the Buddha came up with the 4NT is
                  not in question whatever words are used to express that.  When
                  you said 'experential' realization - you are saying he realised the
                  4NT by experience only.</p>

              <p>He realized 4NT solely through the path of meditative absorption (the jhanas), plus the vipassana awareness of one's direct experience. Means he was observing his own experience in a meditative setting.</p>

              <p>Direct realization can only be understood when there is a shift in perception. This requires the mind to realize Itself. </p>
              <p>Before one realizes this, it is impossible to relate the unconditioned to the conceptual conditioned mind.</p>
