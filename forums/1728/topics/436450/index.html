              </table>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Many people share 
                                  a common opinion that it suffices for a person to have a good heart and 
                                  therefore there is no need to take refuge in the Three Treasures (Buddha, 
                                  Dharma and Sangha). However, do they know the true extent of their goodness?<br> <br> Even if a person’s heart (mind) and his actions 
                                  are so virtuous that they are reborn in the realm of heavens, and for 
                                  that matter in the highest levels of the heavens which is the heaven of 
                                  “non-thinking and non-non-thinking” (Naivasamjnanasamjnayatana), 
                                  although there is no form (body), there is still mind-consciousness. If 
                                  in this mind-consciousness there is a seed of killing which was previously 
                                  planted in the mind-consciousness, that seed may still emerge and cause 
                                  the person to descend to hell. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Therefore, people 
                                  have to form an affinity with the Three Treasures: the Buddha, the Dharma 
                                  and the Sangha, and be illumined by the brightness of the Buddha so that 
                                  they can be liberated. Such an affinity is formed by taking refuge in 
                                  the Three Treasures and thereafter cultivate diligently.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The Buddha, Dharma and Sangha 
                                  are the rarest and most invaluable treasures in the world. They are different 
                                  from the worldly treasures, for they could not be bought nor can they 
                                  be exchanged with whatever worldly materials. However, people can resonate 
                                  with the Three Treasures through their faith and sincerity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The Three Treasures 
                                  of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha in Buddhism are further broken down into 
                                  different perspectives. The “Sustained Three Treasures” refer 
                                  to the Three Treasures that live on and sustain the Buddhism that exists 
                                  in this world so as to spread and pass on to the later generations. These 
                                  include the images of the Buddha which may be made of stone, clay, wood, 
                                  metal, or drawings, referred to as the Buddha Treasure; the Tripitaka, 
                                  the records of the teachings of the Buddha, are referred to as the Dharma 
                                  Treasure. Ordained monks and nuns (bhiksu and bhiksuni) who renounced 
                                  the world to cultivate and create conditions for others to practise the 
                                  Buddhist path, promote the teachings of the Buddha and benefit sentient 
                                  beings, and thereby continuing the wisdom-life of Buddha, are referred 
                                  to as the Sangha Treasure. These are the Sustained Three Treasures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The “Own-nature Three Treasures” refer to 
                                  three attributes that everybody has. Every human being has the same pure 
                                  awareness-nature as the Buddha. This is called the Treasure of Own-nature 
                                  Buddha. When unorthodox or wrong thinking does not arise in our mind, 
                                  and we hold right understanding and right views, then that is Treasure 
                                  of Own-nature Dharma. When we learn the teachings of the Buddha and put 
                                  them into practise thereby illumining our own pure brightness, that is 
                                  the Treasure of Own-nature Sangha. These are the Three Treasures of Own-nature 
                                  and are inspired only through the sincerity in taking refuge in the Three 
                                  Treasures and cultivating according to the teachings. People should not 
                                  set unrealistic goals and make casual remarks that they possess the Own-nature 
                                  Three Treasures, and thus there is no need to take refuge in the Three 
                                  Treasures. Such talk is sowing the seeds for hell.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The objective of taking refuge in the Three Treasures 
                                  is to learn from them. Therefore, people who aspire to learn from the 
                                  Buddha have to take refuge in the Three Treasures. As an illustration, 
                                  a person who is studying in a certain university cannot simply say that 
                                  he merely wants to pursue his studies and there is no need to bother with 
                                  the enrolment. But, to obtain a recognized university qualification requires 
                                  enrolment in the university, registration for examinations, diligence 
                                  in the studies before one can graduate with a degree from the university. 
                                  However, if a person is not enrolled in the university but he completed 
                                  the course books through self-study at home, he is not recognized as having 
                                  graduated from the university. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Hence, a Buddhist has to take refuge in the Three Treasures, 
                                  learn the teachings of the Buddha and put them into practice. Only then 
                                  may he be called an authentic practitioner of Buddhism. On the other hand, 
                                  there are many people who believe in the teachings of Buddhism but they 
                                  have not yet taken refuge in the Three Treasures. We cannot say that they 
                                  are not Buddhists. Instead, they are better described as would-be Buddhists 
                                  because they will take refuge in the Three Treasures in the future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">As Buddhists, after 
                                  we have taken refuge in the Three Treasures, we still need to constantly 
                                  take refuge in the “”Own-nature Three Treasures” too. 
                                  When our mind resonates with the Three Treasures, we will illumine our 
                                  wisdom and brightness. We will constantly be with Buddha. This is the 
                                  significance of taking refuge in the Three Treasures.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>

              <p>There are many things to do in life... many times we are often so busy.

              <p><strong>To find a Buddha all you have to do is see your nature. Your nature is 
              the Buddha. And the Buddha is the person who’s free: free of plans, free
               of cares. If you don’t see your nature and run around all day looking 
              somewhere else, you’ll never find a buddha. The truth is there’s nothing
               to find. But to reach such an understanding you need a teacher and you 
              need to struggle to make yourself understand. Life and death are

              of jewels and as many servants as there are grains of sand along the 
              Ganges, you see them when your eyes are open. But what about when your 
              eyes are shut? You should realize then that everything you see is like a

              teacher’s help. If, though, by the conjunction of conditions, someone 
              understands what the Buddha meant, that person doesn’t need a teacher. 
              Such a person has a natural awareness superior to anything taught. But

              <p>Taking refuge is a one-off ceremony.  They usually hold it on important Buddhist dates at least 3-4 times a year at temples such as Guang Ming Shan. </p>
              <p>The next one may be on the 9th month of the lunar calendar.  Not sure exactly when, but if you like I can find out and let you know.</p>

              <p>It is also very important for pure land practitioners to take refuge - sinweiy can fill me in here.</p>
              <p>Furthermore: pure land isn't a 'sure way' - no way is a 'sure way'. It all depends on the practitioner. Other than sincerely and frequently chanting the Buddha name, you also have to cultivate merits and wisdom.</p>

                              besides reciting the name of the Buddha?</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><strong>There are 
                              84,000 methods. Reciting the name of the Buddha is one of them.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Many practitioners 
                              of Buddhism feel that it suffices to cultivate by reciting the name of 
                              the Buddha and disregard the other methods. Although this is a very good 
                              method of cultivation, in the teachings of Buddhism there are many other 
                              methods or “Dharma-doors”. Speaking of reciting the name of 
                              the Buddha, in general, people recite Amitabha Buddha. Actually, this 
                              method is not limited to reciting Amitabha Buddha. We can recite the name 
                              of all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions and the three 
                              periods (8 directions of the compass, the zenith and nadir; the past, 
                              present and future), for example, Sakyamuni Buddha, Manjusri Bodhisattva, 
                              Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, and many others. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">If we seek to be reborn 
                              in the Western Pure Land, then we need to recite Amitabha Buddha frequently. 
                              However, there is no guarantee that a person who only recites Amitabha 
                              Buddha will definitely be reborn in the Western Pure Land. It is stated 
                              in the Amitabha Sutra, “It is not possible through conditions lacking 
                              in virtuous roots, blessings and merits to be born in that land (i.e. 
                              Western Pure Land).” This means that besides reciting the name of 
                              the Buddha, we must also cultivate our blessings and wisdom, and until 
                              the fulfilment of many, many conditions relating to our blessings and 
                              merits, is it possible to be reborn in the Western Pure Land. For example, 
                              cultivating the 3-steps-1-bow is also a method of cultivating blessings 
                              and lessening our sickness, sufferings and misfortunes. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The teachings of Buddhism 
                              are not limited to reciting the name of the Buddha. There are 84,000 methods 
                              or Dharma-doors through which we can enter, and all of them are equally 
                              reliable. The 3-steps-1-bow is one of them. </span></p>

              <p>The Jen Chen article is too long and there are holes.  I am curious of this question in the first paragraph "However, do they know the true extent of their goodness?"<br>A person who does good knows in his heart, there is NO need to know the true extent of his goodness.  What is true??</p>
              <p>Next, to learn the dhamma, one need not begin by taking Refuge.  This requirement was compare to pursuing a study in university and the need for enrolment.  One can pursue a study by just simply going ahead to study.  Enrolment is merely an administrative requirement.  I see where the flaw is.</p>
              <p>The attainment of nirvana does not require one to be a Buddhist.  Anyone who follows the NEP, strive diligently to rid of defilements and the 'three poisons' is on the way to liberation.</p>
              <p>Refuge-taking is an initiation rite just like joining a triad society.  One 'officially' becomes a Buddhist and vows to observe the precepts.  It is not a guarantee that one will attain nirvana.  Thus, I would use the same analogy of the university - enrolment does not guarantee graduation!</p>

              <p>My response was to the article's claim that one must take refuge first before learning the dhamma, not about being humble!  I know all these talks about being humble, etc. When you learn the dhamma, you are respecting the Buddha already!  No need to go perform rites!  Buddha himself was against rites and rituals.</p>

              <p>LOL bickering with words again..haiz..you know mr INS you are right in this point enrolment doesnt = graduation. Going to refuge ceremonies is just like a ritual to show others(and convince your self) or a symbol that we were try to make a commitment on this particular teaching,however anyone can meditate,keep as many precept as we want even if we dont take refuges.But with the commitment that we have gone through a refuge ceremony it give one less excuses to start our bad habits again and again, and with practice + resolutions it will make the practice deeper and stronger with time to come.</p>
              <p>Its good to make some resolutions initially and then try to stick to it,if we are honest to our selves and others it will keep us in touch with the vows we try to unhold.</p>
              <p>Side track abit,just like getting married and registered with the ROM or doing it the old style way just within the family.The former if you break your marriage vows you are answerable to the law and your wife-y and the family,the latter just your wife-y and family.If both sides are truly faithful and commited how they are married of course it doesnt matter at all becos the ending is the same.</p>
              <p>In reality this is common not the case with ups and does(things like 7 years itch adultery etc etc)  with all this commitment in place dont you think the married couple in the modern ceremony will seriously consider more than the latter if anyone of them try to be funny?</p>

              <p>hahaha, you don't like what I say and how I say, and you used Right Speech as an excuse?  Right speech means not telling lies!  But I understand what many have interpreted it as - saying nice words!</p>
