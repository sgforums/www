              <p>I would like to ask if it's possible for me to practice Buddhism while being a Catholic at the same time, even though there were some drastic diffference on both religion views on the idea of God.</p>

              <p>I know of Christians who also learn Dharma, practise Insight meditation and reaps result so I think it is possible.</p>
              <p>You should look into the Christian and Catholic contemplative and mystical literature.  (See: <a href="http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php">Christian Mysticism</a>). You will find much similarities in experience with the Eastern contemplative paths.</p>
              <p>Mysticism and contemplative path aims to realise the oneness with the divine, and beyond. As former Carmelite nun and a contemplative in the Catholic tradition, <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/bernadette-roberts-interview.html">Bernadette Roberts</a> says:</p>
              <p><em>"The realization of oneness with God does not mean that we are the historical Jesus or the incarnate Christ -- of whom there is only one -- rather, it means that at this point we see Christ as "that" mystery of our being which is truly one with God, one with the Father. Though we may equate this mystery with the unknown "true self," it basically goes beyond this. This specific revelation of Christ is not the revelation of God within (God as immanent), nor the realization of our oneness with God; rather, this revelation is over and beyond the unitive realization of oneness with God."</em></p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p>BTW the blog in which I posted Bernadette Roberts' article is run by me and our moderator Thusness. It is a good interview that spoke of her contemplative journey and how she chanced upon Buddhism and found an experiential account by Buddha that corresponded to her experience. (She is still a Catholic however)</p>
              <p>In Christian Mysticism, union and oneness with God <em>(It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me - Galatians 2:16-20)</em> is the first major achievement in the contemplative path. But what is special about Bernadette is that she also spoke of the "beyond union" as she experienced No-Self and that "the Christian revelation breaks through self to a revelation of our Resurrection in the Body of Christ and Ascension to our Heavenly estate beyond self".</p>
              <p>Also, in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/Extracts/sunyata.htm">Sunyata</a> by A.H.Almaas, a Islamic Sufi Contemplative

              <p><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br> If you have always assumed that
                      Christianity and Buddhism are as far apart philosophically as their
                      respective founders were geographically, you may be in for a bit of a
                      surprise. In this national bestseller, Zen monk and social activist
                      Thich Nhat Hanh draws parallels between these two traditions that have
                      them walking, hand in hand, down the same path to salvation. In
                      Christianity, he finds mindfulness in the Holy Spirit as an agent of
                      healing. In Buddhism, he finds unqualified love in the form of
                      compassion for all living things. And in both he finds an emphasis on
                      living practice and community spirit. 
                      The thread that binds the book is the same theme that draws many
                      Christians toward Buddhism: mindfulness. Through anecdotes, scripture
                      references, and teachings from both traditions, Nhat Hanh points out
                      that mindfulness is an integral part of all religious practice and
                      teaches us how to cultivate it in our own lives. Nhat Hanh has no
                      desire to downplay the venerable theological and ritual teachings that
                      distinguish Buddhism and Christianity, but he does cause one to
                      consider that beyond the letter of doctrine lies a unity of truth. <br><br> <strong>From Library Journal</strong><br> In this popular work
                      Hahn, a Vietnamese Zen monk, offers some parallels between Eastern and
                      Western spiritual practice in an accessible style that will please
                      general readers. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p>

              <p>Hi TS , be brave to continue whatever you wish to embark on</p>
              <p>Its in the Buddhist sutra that a Brahman practise Buddhism for him to be a better person</p>
              <p>Written in Flower Adornment Sutra</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is some Catholic practising meditation in Buddhist organisation , i wont want to name them</p>
              <p>Religious fanaticism should not be a cause for worry , because Buddhism is in harmony with other religion</p>
              <p>Go on . come and ask us question pertaining to Buddhism , we wont shut u out due to any "membership " issue :)</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>It is good that you like to practice buddhism.<br>But if one want to stay as catholic, it could means that his confidence on buddha's teaching is not that firm. So, when it comes to those part where christian and buddhism are totally different, you may not proceed further, and your progress will be hindered.</p>
              <p><br>Anyway you can do it step by step, take your time to explore more on buddhism, we will try to answer your doubts.</p>

              I read in the saturday ST that SGH CEO, although he is a christian, attended Ajahm brahm talks and meditate also.
              
              anyone no matter what religions they are, are free to practise and study buddhism and meditate.

              one thing abt Buddhism is that it is not dogmatic and doctrinal. You are entitled to think, analyse and even question the teachings, and if you think it is not suitable for you, you are free to choose other religions.
              
              that is why it is one of the fastest growing faith in the world, and in Singapore.
