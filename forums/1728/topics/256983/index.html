This explains why the early Buddha images resembled Greek statues.Â”<br><br>Project coordinator, Koh Mui Han of the Dhammaduta Youth said,Â”84,000 is a meaningful number in Buddhist belief and the lotus buds will be specially flown in from Thailand.Â”<br><br>Devotees are able to sponsor these flowers, with the knowledge that they are offering them to the Lord Buddha. Anyone interested in making this offering should contact any one of the fifty Buddhist organizations jointly organizing the Buddhist Culture and Arts Festival.<br><br>Information boards explaining the meanings of the symbols will be produced and put up near the foot motif. Mui Han added, Â”Buddhist culture is rich with symbols. The public will be able to learn the meanings and understand that Buddhists do not mindlessly pray to pictures and inanimate objectsÂ”.<br><br>Members from both organizations will be on hand to assemble the arrangement and help devotees place the lotus flowers. It is planned that the entire lotus arrangement will be complete by Saturday, 9 June for the public to view.<br><br>If you go<br><br>Buddhist Culture &amp; Arts Festival 2007<br>6 Â– 10 June 2007<br>Mines International Exhibition &amp; Convention Centre (MIECC)<br>Seri Kembangan, Selangor, Malaysia<br><br>For more details on the event, kindly contact BCAF Secretariat Ms Loh Yit Phing at 016 311 5030 or Ms Lee Hung Hui at 03 Â– 7804 9154.<br><br>Website: www.bovis.tv/bcaf<br>Email: www.buddhist_festival@yahoo.com<br><br>More About The Buddha Footprint<br><br>For the first centuries after His passing, the Buddha was represented by attributes and symbols. Early Buddhist artists represented the Buddha aniconically i.e. He was not shown in human form, but represented by symbols such as the umbrella, the bodhi tree under which he attained enlightenment, the wheel, a throne and a set of footprints<br><br>It is said that prior to His death the Buddha left an imprint of His foot on a stone near Kusinara, the site of His passing. This was a reminder to the devout of His physical existence. A larger than life size footprint at Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, has been respected by the Singhalese people for centuries. In many other Buddhist sites, footprint motifs can be found carved into rock.<br><br>From the scriptures, it has been ascertained that the Buddha did not encourage followers to be overly devoted to His physical form. Instead He encouraged them to truly understand His teachings and practice it, exhorting, Â“He who sees my teachings, sees MeÂ”.<br><br>Early Buddhists had such reverence for the great teacher that they avoided sculpting His likeness, even for purposes of veneration. However the first human representations began to appear due to the influence of Greek craftsmen in India.<br><br>Adoration of the footprint<br><br>The adoration of his feet, or Buddhapada became a prominent feature of Buddhist practice. These footprints often show Dharma-wheels on them, one of the 32 physical marks of a Buddha.<br><br>According to Buddhist belief, the body of a Buddha would have 32 distinguishing marks on it. The specific marks associated with the feet are:<br><br>1.   When the Buddha walks, He places His foot evenly on the  floor<br>2.   The soles of his feet are imprinted with wheels (symbols)<br>3.   He has projecting heels<br>4.   He has long fingers and toes<br>5.   He has soft and tender hands and feet<br>6.   He has webbed hands and feet<br>7.   He has arched feet<br><br>The Dhamma wheel<br><br>The Wheel symbol found on the footprints can be seen very often in Buddhist culture. The wheel has been depicted with varying numbers of spokes.<br><br>The Eight-Spoked Dharma Wheel or Dharmachakra symbolises the Buddha's turning of the Wheel of Truth or Law (dharma = truth/law, chakra = wheel) and is associated with the first sermon delivered at Sarnath, a town near modern day Varanasi.The wheel on the flag of India is the Asokan wheel, said to be used by the great Buddhist emperor, Asoka.<br><br>Historians contend that the representation of the Buddha in human form (as statues) was an art learnt from Greek craftsmen and artisans who followed Alexander the Great on his conquests of the East. It is seen that early representations of the Buddha bear Greek (or European) features. In many ways these sculptures incorporated the features of Hellenic gods, an unusual development as the Buddha had strongly declared that He was not a god.<br></div>

K. Sen (of FPMTÂ’s Losang Dragpa Centre in Malaysia) to take responsibility for funding, designing and building the development which is now planned for our current 40-acre site in Bodhgaya, Bihar State, India, to include:<br><br>&gt;&gt; a large open-air teaching arena for use by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and other Buddhist masters and events.<br><br>&gt;&gt; a residential complex and monastery incorporating accommodation for His Holiness the Dalai Lama.<br><br>&gt;&gt; a Buddhist temple with associated accommodation for 10,000 monks to host the annual Gelugpa Monlam (Great Prayer) Festival.<br><br>&gt;&gt; a statue of Maitreya Buddha to fulfill Lama Zopa RinpocheÂ’s original intention of accomplishing Lama Thubten YesheÂ’s wish of building a Maitreya statue in Bodhgaya . The aspect and size of the statue has not yet been determined, though it is expected the size will be smaller than the 500ft / 152m statue to be constructed in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh State, India.<br><br>Mr Peter Kedge, CEO for the Maitreya Project, has said that discussions are underway to determine how best to incorporate the development at Bodhgaya into the overall Maitreya Project plan. Mr. Sen is a highly experienced construction project manager and planning is expected to commence around April 2007.<br><br>Meanwhile, for the construction of the 500ft/152m Maitreya Buddha statue in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh State, India, work with the Uttar Pradesh government to fulfill the legal and administrative processes required in preparation for the hand-over of the 750 acre / 300 hectare site is still very much in progress.<br><br>We will keep you informed once we have more information to disseminate about developments in Bodhgaya and Kushinagar.<br><br><img src="http://www.axonsg.com/projects/maitreya1/maitreya.jpg"><br></div>
