              <p>Shocked?!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In actual fact, milk weakens the bones and accelerates osteoporosis. Milk makes the stomach more acidic. Mlk contains health-impairing antibiotics, growth hormones, and disease-causing bacteria. Milk stimulates cancer growth, causes childhood diabetes, heart diseases and more.</p>
              <p>Been noticing more and more Milk advertisements on the media, be it the TV, or advertisements at bus stops or anywhere else. And common people like us buy their claims that milk is good for health.</p>
              <p>Lets say; for instance, <strong>osteoporosis</strong>. Osteoporosis results from calcium loss, not insufficient calcium intake. and dairy products like milk promote calcium loss through urine because of their high protein content. Furthermore, the calcium lost from our bones due to excess protein ends up in our urine and produces very high levels of calcium in the kidney system and all too often crystallising into kidney stones. Which explains why milk causes kidney stones.</p>
              <p>Its also due to the lack of magnesium in cow’s milk. Magnesium together with Calcium and vitamin D, are necessary for the body to absorb calcium, without it, the body only absorbs 25% of the available daily calcium content, causing unabsorbed calcium to remain in the bloodstream and could contribute to not only <strong>kidney stones</strong> but also <strong>gallstones</strong>! Psst, the calcium also can form on the arterial wall, or in joins as arthritis or as <strong>cysts</strong> and <strong>spurs</strong>!</p>
              <p>Milk also causes early maturity, which might not be a good thing for young children, if they can’t cope with the differences and all.</p>
              <p>Worst still, it can also cause childhood diabetes. scary ain’t it? Researchers say that certain proteins in cow’s milk resemble molecules in the beta cells of the pancreas that secrete insulin. In some cases, the immune system makes antibodies to the milk protein. The antibodies might then mistakenly attack and destroy the beta calles which are actually the ones producing insulin, thus resulting in diabetes.</p>
              <p>There’s really too much to explain, so all in all, if you believe, reduce intakes of milk.</p>
              <p>Researchers say that Children no longer need milk after the age of 2!</p>

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><span class="subtitle">Commercial milk: Linked to chronic disease, overweight, diabetes, cancer, weakened bones</span>
              <p>Is drinking milk really safe? In a riveting article, "Worrying About Milk", (Discover Magazine, August, 2000), Dr. T. Colin Campbell, PhD, a prestigious nutritional biochemist at Cornell University, reveals how drinking milk can keep you chronically ill. He grew up on a dairy farm and prided himself on drinking a gallon or more of milk every day. Earlier in his scientific career, he just to think that dairy products were an essential part of a healthy daily diet for good teeth and strong bones. But not anymore.</p>
              <p>After years of scientific research, however, Dr. Campbell is now convinced that drinking commercial cow's milk and eating milk products is responsible for many medical problems. The bottom line for Dr. Campbell: "It's unnatural to drink milk."</p>
              <h2 class="subtitle">Summary of key points:</h2>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Lactose Intolerance.</strong> A majority of adults in Asia and Africa, along with many in southern Europe and Latin America, have trouble digesting lactose, the main sugar in milk. Only people of Northern European decent can predominantly tolerate lactose. </li>
              <li><strong>Decreased Lactase Production. </strong>Nature normally programs the young for weaning before they reach adulthood by turning down production in early childhood of lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose, which is needed to digest milk (from cows or humans). However, an apparent gene mutation inherited by people of northern European descent prevents the production of lactase from being turned down. Only these people may be able to adequately digest milk. </li>
              <li><strong>Milk From the Right Species. </strong>Human mother’s milk is best for human babies. Cow’s milk is best for cow babies (calves). What's good for baby calves isn't necessarily good for human babies or adults. Dr. Campbell asks: "Isn't it strange that we're the only species that suckles from another species?" </li>
              <li><strong>Unnatural Hormone Response. </strong>Dr. Campbell finds that cow's milk unnaturally stimulates growth hormones in the human body that increases the risk of various diseases and overweight. </li>
              <li><strong>Milk: Not For Strong Bones.</strong> Cow's milk does not do what has been claimed - building strong bones, since recent studies suggest that humans may need less calcium and better forms of calcium than milk to build strong bones. Other foods, including various vegetables and legumes, are a better source of calcium than cow's milk. </li>
              <li><strong>Milk Protein and Liver Cancer.</strong> In 1965, Dr. Campbell worked as coordinator of a US Aid project in the Phillipines, where poverty stricken children were dying mysteriously from liver cancer believed to be linked to malnutrition. To his surprise, Campbell discovered that the incidence of liver cancer was especially high among some of the best nourished kids, whose diets were supplemented with powdered milk provided through a US-subsidized program. He was completely baffled until he read about a 1968 research study conducted in India and published in the Archives of Pathology (Arch Pathol 1968 Feb;85(2):133-7), which linked milk protein to liver cancer in lab rats. "That was a signal event for me," Campbell says. </li>
              <li><strong>Milk Casein and Liver Cancer. </strong>During the next 30 years, Campbell conducted a series of experiments at Cornell University and Virginia Tech and found that rats given a brief initial exposure to aflatoxin, a carcinogen produced by mold growth, tended to develop liver cancer when fed casein, the main protein in milk. "We could turn on or turn off cancer growth," he says, by increasing or decreasing the amount of casein. </li>
              <li><strong>10% Milk Casein Promotes Tumors.</strong> Dr. Campbell initiated research of his own by feeding casein to rats in normal doses, with 15 to 20% of their diet (by weight) coming from casein. The typical American diet is roughly 17% protein, says Campbell, though the protein, of course, is not all casein. He found that the threshold amount of casein required for switching on tumor growth averaged around 10% of the diet.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2><span class="subtitle">Doctors Opposed to Milk</span></h2>
              <p>The Washington, DC-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (P.C.R.M.) is a non-profit advocacy organization, with over 100,000 members, that promotes preventive medicine, encourages higher standards for ethics and effectiveness in research, advocates broader access to medical services, and is opposed to milk consumption.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Milk: The Worst Calcium.</strong> "It would be hard to imagine a worse vehicle for delivering calcium to the human body," says Neal Barnard, head of P.C.R.M. </li>
              <li><strong>USDA: Conflict of Interest.</strong> P.C.R.M. says that US officials have turned a blind eye to the very real potential health risks of milk. In December 1999, they filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services claiming the agencies unfairly promote industry special interests through official dietary guidelines. PCRM argues that the U.S.D.A. has an inherent conflict of interest: a dual mission to help dairy farmers as well as to promote good nutrition. </li>
              <li><strong>Promoting the Dairy Interests while Ruining America’s Health. </strong>U.S.D.A. officials claim that current dietary guidelines focus on dairy products as the major source of calcium because they are based on a realistic assessment of food choices most Americans make. "There's nothing against vegetable sources of calcium," says Eileen Kennedy, deputy undersecretary of research, education and economics at the U.S.D.A., "but we have to fashion healthful eating around current habits." This thinking is circular. The reason many Americans follow a dairy-rich diet is that they trust the government and assume it is healthy. </li>
              <li><strong>Overcoming Lactose Intolerance For What?</strong> Dairy proponents insist that most people who think they are lactose intolerant can actually digest small amounts of milk by consuming milk slowly – in sips throughout the day, adding up to 1 -2 glasses of milk. Is the goal to promote the dairy interests and the consumption of milk – or to promote the best sources of calcium and other nutrients (which is clearly NOT milk).</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 class="subtitle">Cancer and Milk Consumption</h2>
              <p>Many people are not aware of the link between milk consumption and risk of cancer:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Milk Drinking and Breast/Prostate Cancer.</strong> Epidemiological research suggests a correlation between milk consumption and at least two kinds of cancer prevalent in Europe and North America: breast and prostate. </li>
              <li><strong>No Milk, No Breast Cancer. </strong>In Asia, where many people drink no milk at all, breast cancer tends to be rare. In rural China, for example, among women aged 35 to 64, Campbell found that breast cancer deaths averaged 8.7 per 100,000, as opposed to 44 per 100,000 in the US, about a 5-fold difference. </li>
              <li><strong>Higher Milk Consumption, Higher Breast Cancer. </strong>A comparative study published in 1989 showed that in Europe, two areas with higher milk consumption (Scandinavia and the Netherlands) also had higher breast cancer rates. </li>
              <li><strong>Higher Milk Consumption, Higher Prostate Cancer.</strong> Worldwide, men are far more likely to die of prostate cancer in countries where dairy consumption is high than in countries where it is low. A study published in 1977 revealed that 10 men die of prostate cancer in Western Europe for every one who dies in Asia. </li>
              <li><strong>Two Large Studies Link Dairy to Prostate Cancer.</strong> Two large US studies (2000) have linked dairy consumption to prostate cancer. In the Physician's Health Study, researchers tracked 20,885 male doctors over 10 years. Those who consumed at least 2½ servings of dairy food per day were 30% more likely to develop prostate cancer than doctors who consumed less than half a serving. (Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research April 3, 2000 in San Francisco, CA) </li>
              <li><strong>Dairy Increases Risk of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.</strong> A 1999 study of nearly 50,000 subjects (the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study) found that men who consumed a total of more than 2,000 milligrams of calcium per day raised their risk of metastatic prostate cancer more than 4-fold. </li>
              <li><strong>Push For High Dairy Intake is Worrisome.</strong> Edward Giovannucci, a Harvard professor and co-author of both of the above studies, believes that calcium itself, at high levels of consumption, promotes prostate cancer by depleting protective levels of vitamin D. Considering the push for high dairy intake in the U.S., he finds: "For prostate, the data are generally consistent and the high relative risk in the Health Professionals Study is quite worrisome." </li>
              <li><strong>The More Calcium, The More Fractures.</strong> Disparities between calcium intake and bone health can be seen worldwide. The more calcium (dairy) people consumed, the more susceptible they were to hip fractures. People that consumed the highest levels of dairy foods (North American and northern European nations) take in two or three times more calcium, yet break 2-3 times more bones than people with the lowest calcium (dairy) intake (Asians and Africans). </li>
              <li><strong>Harvard Milk Study: Milk Linked to Higher Fractures. </strong>The 12-year Harvard Nurses' Health Study involving 78,000 nurses found that nurses who drank the most milk (two or more glasses per day) had a slightly higher risk of arm fracture (5% increase) and significantly higher risk of hip fracture (45% increase). </li>
              <li><strong>Substances in Milk That Leach Calcium.</strong> Although some milk nutrients may promote bone growth, other substances in milk, such as abnormal proteins and toxic residues may actually leach calcium from bone.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 class="subtitle">Calcium Guidelines: Bogus or Not</h2>
              <p>Do people really need as much calcium as the U.S. dietary guidelines state? Currently, these recommended daily intakes are:</p>
              <p>*Children 4-8: 800mg *Kids 9-18: 1,300mg *Adults: 1,000mg</p>
              <p>Are these numbers based on sound science and apply to everyone? Most likely not. Much evidence argues against these recommended amounts.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>More Milk, More Fractures.</strong> The Harvard Nurses' Health Study (1997) reported that among 78,000 women followed for 12 years, those who got the most calcium from dairy products had approximately double the hip fracture rate, compared to women who got little or no calcium from dairy products. In other words, the more calcium in your diet, the higher your risk of breaking bones. </li>
              <li><strong>Young Girls: Dairy Not Linked to Increased Bone Density.</strong> Another study reports that among girls 12 to 18, calcium intake had no effect on bone density, although exercise did help build strong bones (Pediatrics, July 2000; 106: 40-44). </li>
              <li><strong>US Calcium Guidelines: Too High?</strong> The U.S. guidelines are high, even when measured against those of most other western countries. For example, the British recommended calcium intake for kids ranges from 350 mg to 1,000 mg (versus 800 mg to 1,300 mg in the US) and for adults is 700 mg (versus 1,000 mg in the US). The Institute of Medicine (in U.S.) recently suggested that teenagers and adults over age 50 increase their calcium intake to 1,300 and 1,200 mg, respectively, per day. The World Health Organization recommends 500 mg for children and 800 mg for adults. This is a substantial difference. </li>
              <li><strong>High Calcium: High Fracture Rate.</strong> In the US, one in two women and one in eight men over age 50 breaks a bone because of osteoporosis, despite the fact that calcium consumption is among the highest in the world. </li>
              <li><strong>Bone Studies: Misleading.</strong> Walter Willett, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and chairman of the Nutrition Department, finds: "There is no evidence that we have a calcium emergency as the dairy industry would have us believe. We have one of the highest calcium intakes in the world." He also points out: "The studies of bone mineral density can be highly misleading. What is clear is that an increase in calcium intake causes a onetime small increase in density (about 2%). However, this does not continue to accrue and disappears when stopping the extra calcium." From research, sustaining this slight increase does not protect against fractures. </li>
              <li><strong>5 Times Less Fracture with 50% Less Dairy. </strong>In general, the Chinese eat less than half the calcium (as dairy) recommended by the USDA and seem healthy. Among women over 50, the hip fracture rate appeared to be one fifth as high as in Western nations. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Critics of the governments push for increased milk consumption cite several examples of unfair practices, which may be adversely affecting the health of its citizens:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Unfair Push for Dairy by Government.</strong> Dairy producers get price supports and government purchase of surplus production. They plow some of their profits into promotional dariy groups that fund “so-called” research studies, educate health professionals about milk, and provide free materials to schools suggesting that milk is vital to good nutrition, despite the lack of adequate scientific data. </li>
              <li><strong>Racial Discrimination: Milk Pushed in Schools. </strong>In the National School Lunch Program, milk is the only beverage offered to children. A section of the Physicians Committee lawsuit alleges that milk's special status in the school lunch program amounts to racial discrimination. Studies suggest that 70 % of African Americans, 50% of Hispanics and 90% of Asians have trouble digesting lactose, while only 15% of Caucasians do. And we allow so many of our children to continue to drink milk which will cause them gastrointestinal distress symptoms? The program that serves free meals to needy children won't reimburse schools for non-dairy alternatives to milk unless the substitution is requested by a doctor.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 class="subtitle">Would Consumers Replace Milk With Sodas?</h2>
              <p>USDA deputy undersecretary, Eileen Kennedy, believes that consumer preferences - not dairy promoters - shape federal nutrition policies. Americans get about 75% of their calcium from dairy products. Kennedy suggests that even if the government removed dairy as a recommended food group, people would not eat other calcium-rich foods such as vegetables and legumes. She thinks that they would continue current trends, including no exercising and consuming more foods such as sodas and junk food that actually leach calcium from bones, so they'd be worse off than with less milk. In fact, consumption of milk has been slowly dropping off for decades, unfortunately being replaced with an even worse choice, soda drinks.</p>
              <p><strong>Comment: </strong>This article clearly shows the many dangers and diseases associated with consuming commercial milk and milk products. Commercial milk has many other problems including health-demoting practices such as the use of synthetic growth hormones, pasteurization, homogenization, GMO-feeds, and antibiotic use – all contributing to the general unhealthy condition of commercial cows. Numerous studies show that commercial milk frequently contains pathogenic organisms (still present after pasteurization). Unhealthy cows means unhealthy milk.</p>
              <p>However, not all milk is bad. Some companies do produce good quality milk from healthy cows. They allow their cows to range-feed on grass (not commercial soy/grain (GMO)-based feeds) and do not use synthetic hormones or antibiotics.</p>
              <h2 class="subtitle">Homemade Kefir</h2>
              <p>Although we do not recommend drinking commercial milk or the consumption of most commercial dairy products, we highly recommend the use of fermented dairy products, such as homemade kefir, using only high quality milk. This turns pasteurized milk (overnight) into a delicious, hearty, pudding-like texture, teaming with billions of live beneficial bacteria, something most Americans are drastically short on. This centuries old process of fermenting milk is associated with many long-lived cultures throughout the world. <a title="blocked::http://www.drheise.com/keifer.htm" href="http://www.drheise.com/keifer.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(See our Kefir Starter Kit.)</span></a></p>

              <div>Should you DRINK YOUR MILK????</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Drink your milk! How many times have mothers told children this? Millions? Billions? Milk is ingrained into our brains as the healthiest food on the planet. Indian's worship cows and cow's milk is considered next to nectar. Maneka Gandhi, at one time India's minister for the environment said that "Milk is like cow's blood" and I will never forget the uproar it raised. You can talk against meat, against processed food, against GM food,  everybody will listen. But just try saying one word against milk and you will raise the hackles of the world. But what is the truth? Try these factoids for size</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Milk Sugar is indigestible</strong></div>
              <div>The enzyme required to digest milk sugar, lactose, is called lactase. It dis-appears from the human intestine at the age of three! That's right. After 3, milk is virtually indigestible. No wonder kids above 3 don't like it  their taste buds automatically dislike milk because it is indigestible. And we ignore the warning signs, and disguise the milk with sugar, horlicks, bournvita, chocolate  to fool the body. And what happens? When milk comes into contact with the acidic gastric juice after it is swallowed,  it immediately forms thick, hard to digest curds that coat the stomach and intestines and hampers digestion. Estimates say that 50-50% of the world's adult population is lactose intolerant.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Milk protein is indigestible</strong></div>
              <div>The enzyme required to digest milk protein, casein, is called rennin. It too dis-appears from the human intestine at the age of three. Casein is used to make some of the strongest wood-working glues. Think what it can do to your insides..</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Milk is species-specific</strong></div>
              <div>Cow's milk is meant for calves. Goat's milk for goats. Human milk for babies. The various antiobodies in the milk protect the young ones from diseases specific to the species.  </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Cow's milk is meant to turn a small calf into a huge cow in a short span of a couple of years. A human baby does not put on so much weight in two years. But it will, if fed with cow's milk!</div>

              <div><strong>No animal drinks milk after it is weaned</strong></div>
              <div>Except Man!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Milk is no longer recommended</strong> for infants below the age of one even by the American Association of Pediatricians!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The Physican's Committee for Responsible medicine denounces the use of milk. They say (backed up by evidence) that it is the cause of many diseases</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>What about the <strong>cruelty to cows?</strong> They are made forcibly pregnant every year to make them give milk. They are kept awake and milked at night so you can get your milk in the morning. They are fed banned drugs (oxytocin) to increase milk production. They are usually kept cramped up in unhygienic conditions, so they fall ill and get infected. To prevent this, they are fe huge amounts of anti-biotics which find their way into the milk. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>And spare a thought for the <strong>poor calves,</strong> who are deprived of their mother's milk so you can have it?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>But what about<strong> calcium?</strong> Read the link <a title="blocked::http://www.afpafitness.com/MilkCal2.htm" href="http://www.afpafitness.com/MilkCal2.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Milk and calcium </span></a></div>
              <div><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></div>
              <div>In a nutshell, the calcium in cow's milk is coarse and not easily digestible. Further, a gastric medium is required to digest the cow's milk which is high in protein. This leads to over-secretion of acidic gastric juice,  leading to an acidic environment. The body then WITHDRAWS calcium from the bones to neutralise it. Excessive milk consumption can then actually cause calcium deficiency and osteoporosis!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Where to get the calcium from, then? Nuts, seeds, Green leafy vegetables have abundance of calcium. And sesame seeds (til seeds) are the richest source of calcium in the planet. And anyway, when you stop eating animal products, the body no longer needs to withdraw calcium from the bones to neutralise the acidic environment created by meat eating. Therefore your calcium needs fall and even a lower amount you eat is adequate.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Still not convinced? There's lots more information. </div>

              <div><strong>Milk substitutes</strong></div>
              <div>By the way, almond milk and coconut milk are excellent substitutes for cow's milk and much more healthy. How do you make it?  Take half cup of almonds and blanch them in boiling water for 30 seconds to be able to pop the skins off. Now take the almonds and grind them to a powder in a blender.  Add one cup of chilled water and blend until it gets a smooth milky consistency. Strain and bottle. Keeps in the refrigerator for upto a week. And it can be used anyway that milk can. Use grated coconut for similar results.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>What about yoghurt?</strong></div>
              <div>Yoghurt is milk partially digested by bacteria, so it is not as harmful as milk. However it is still not good for you. During the transition period (change from an average diet to a healthy diet) it should also be avoided. Later on, after a year or so, if you like, you can add small portions  not more than 2-3 spoonfuls to your salad ocassionally.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>What about cheese?</strong></div>
              <div>The same story. If you must, a small portion of cottage cheese can be had occasionally after the transition period, added to your salad. Do not cook the cheese, as in a pizza!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>What about buttermilk?</strong></div>
              <div>Again small quantities occasionally after the transition period.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Butter/Ghee</strong></div>
              <div>Is milk fat. So is not as bad as milk itself. Very Small quantities OK occassionally.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>And what about the ancients? They drank milk by the bucketful, if legends are to be believed. Perhaps they did, but it was fresh, raw, unboiled, unpasteurised milk, from their own cow which was well-treated like a member of the family, not drugged with anti-biotics, allowed to graze on the fields and not cooped up. The milk available after the calf had its fill was used. Under those circumstances, milk would probably be a better choice than it is today.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>To end, now for some old-fashioned rhetoric</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Q. If I don't drink milk, where am I going to get my calcium from?</strong></div>
              <div>A. Contrary to popular advertising beliefs, milk and dairy are not the best way to get calcium. Although milk is rich in calcium, it's also high in animal protein and prevents your body from actually absorbing the calcium. Roughly 25% of the calcium in milk and dairy is absorbed by the human body. On the other hand more than 50% of the calcium in vegetables is absorbed by the body. Below are some examples of superior calcium sources compared to a 3.5 ounce glass of whole milk:</div>
              <div>Milk: 119mg calcium per 3.5 ounces </div>
              <div>Sea Vegetables 800-1400mg calcium per 3.5 ounces </div>
              <div>Almonds 233mg. calcium per 3.5 ounces</div>
              <div>Black beans 135mg. calcium per 3.5 ounces</div>
              <div>Kale 134mg. calcium per 3.5 ounces </div>
              <div>Collard Greens 117mg. calcium per 3.5 ounces</div>
              <div>Garbanzo beans 150mg. calcium per 3.5 ounces </div>
              <div>Quinoa 141mg. calcium per 3.5 ounces</div>
              <div>Watercress 151mg. calcium per 3.5 ounces </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>One last thing...... and you may want to sit down for this one because it will go against everything you've ever been conditioned and programmed to think and believe your entire life. THE MILK FROM THE COW IS NOT FOOD FOR THE HUMAN BEING. Never was, never will be, it's that simple. The milk that comes from the HUMAN breast is for the baby HUMAN. The milk that comes from the GORILLA's breast is for the baby GORILLA. The milk that comes from the ELEPHANT is for the baby ELEPHANT. The milk that comes from the HORSE is for the baby HORSE. The milk that comes from the COW is for the......who? The answer is.......baby COW. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>All "normal" mammals stop producing the enzyme, lactase (used to digest lactose) and lose the ability to digest their baby food (HELLO - milk is baby food) once they have been weaned. The weaning process begins as your teeth start to come in. Do you have teeth in your mouth? If the answer is yes, it's time to get off the nipple. If you are lactose intolerant it's a good thing. Your intolerance to milk as an adult means that you've been properly weaned.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Ever wonder where the cow gets it's calcium from? How about a horse? I want you to visualize in your mind a beautiful horse, with it's massive body of muscles and strong bones and let's not forget about it's great teeth. I've got news for you, the horse does not run over to the barn in the middle of the night, wrestle the cow to the ground, flip it over and drink the cow's milk. So where does the horse get its calcium? The horse eats grasses, grains and vegetables - that's it.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"STOP listening to the advertisers!!! Cow's milk does NOT do a human body good"</div>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: teal; font-size: 12pt; ">We were raised to think of cow’s milk as a perfect food. The National Dairy Council advertises that “milk is natural” and If you don’t drink milk, the council will tell you that your bones will become brittle and your strength will fade due to a lack of calcium. Many Americans out of fear make dairy products a staple of their diets. Knowledge is a killer of fear. The more you know the less you fear. Drinking milk will not make you big and strong, nor will it prevent osteoporosis. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: teal; font-size: 12pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: teal; font-size: 12pt; ">Cows do not drink cow’s milk. Calves stop drinking cow’s milk between the ages of six to eight months. Humans are the only species that drink the milk of another animal. You will never see a kitten drink milk from a goat, or a doe drink milk from a bear. However, we have been conditioned to think that we must drink milk from cows. We are told that we must drink milk from cows. We are told that we must drink cow’s milk for the rest of our lives. No adult animal continues to drink milk after they are weaned. We, as humans, drink milk from an adult animal that do not drink their own milk after they reach 7 months of age. Would you drink milk from lactating women? To my surprise when I ask this question, many people frown in disgust. Human milk is made for human consumption for a specific period of time. It has the appropriate nutrients dedicated to building and maintaining our bodies. After 22-24 months, humans no longer need their mother’s milk. So why are we still drinking cow’s milk as adults? Not to mention giving it to our children. Cow’s milk is meant to turn a 200-puound calf in to a 2,000-pound cow. This reason alone is why America is the leading country in the world of obesity. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: teal; font-size: 12pt; ">The Biggest problem with cow’s milk is that the protein in the cow’s milk damages the human immune system. Amino acids, the units that make up proteins, are building blocks for all living cells. When amino acids in our food are properly broken down by the digestive system into protein, it does no harm to the immune system. Protein from milk, however, is absorbed into the blood fully indigested, provoking an immune response. Repeated exposure to these proteins disrupts normal immune functions and may eventually lead to diseases. </span></p>

              <p><br><a href="/users/267606">zero thought</a> is right on rich calcium vege. Actual don't need to do anything much,  just eat more vege, avoid high protein milk, and exercises. fyi, one spoon of sesame seed contain <strong>10 TIMES (1000mg)</strong> more good calcium than a glass of milk (100mg).</p>
              <p>in the pass Thousands of year, chinese also never knew of drinking milk or any milk products, it was only these few recent years that the West bring in these dairy stuff.</p>
              <p>not even eating fish can help, i heard Eskimo also have high rate of Osteoporosis. it was a suprise to know a tride who ate a lot of bean in their diet, do not have Osteoporosis.</p>

On one hand milk protein is much better than meat protein, Whey protein is a well regarded protein with all the essential amino acids , relatively well absorbed, is a favorite with the body building community. Also there are bovine growths factors and bovine immuno globuline and lactocferrins, which have anti microbial properties. The harder to digest casein is touted as a slow release protein to be ingested before sleep. Also total protein intake, as in carbohydrate, protein fat ratio and fibre intake is important as well.  </p></div>

              <p>There are proponents of raw milk, unpateurised, unhomogenized is more suitable for consumption. Calves, if fed with wholly pasteurised milk will die shortly after, as the enzymes for breaking down milk is not present and unhomogenized milk will separate to fats and liquids after a while making it easier to digest. The problem is unhygienic conditions which the cows are kept, making raw milk an unviable option.</p>

              <p>i thought of African women who tend to drink a lot of milk to increase they size. so i search the net some more.</p>
              <div>
              <h3><a class="yschttl spt" href="http://www.osteoporosis.org.za/risk.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #551a8b;">The National <strong>Osteoporosis</strong> Foundation of South <strong>Africa</strong></span></span></span></a> tend to say good stuff. <br><a href="http://www.osteoporosis.org.za/downloads/DAIRY.pdf">http://www.osteoporosis.org.za/downloads/DAIRY.pdf</a></h3>
              <p>but then i think the key is in <strong>magnesium and Vitamin D. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <p><a href="http://www.health-reports.com/Osteoporosis.html">http://www.health-reports.com/Osteoporosis.html</a></p>
              <p><strong>Stop excess consumption of milk and milk products. (Or take extra magnesium when you do so.)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For over 50 years milk has pitched as a wonder food whose calcium is the only protection we need against weak bones. Yet, Americans have one of the worlds high calcium intakes, but still suffer from one of the worlds highest rates of osteoporosis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>African women in the United States eat at least four times more calcium than African women in Africa, and have nine times more osteoporosis. Asian women in the United States eat at least 60% more calcium than Asian women in Asia, and have three times more osteoporosis. Calcium consumption in Hong Kong and Greece doubled in the last 30 years, and the rate of osteoporosis tripled in Hong Kong, and more than doubled in Greece.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3><em><strong>Increasing Magnesium Intake Is Vital </strong></em>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Low magnesium intake, high calcium intake resulting in an imbalance of magnesium and calcium in your body is the single most important cause of bone loss. This imbalance literally signals your body to pull calcium from the bones, as strange as that may seem. And it causes the calcium you get in your diet or take as a supplement to be unusable. It must have magnesium to get into your bones. And causes the calcium to be deposited in arteries, joints, as bone spurs or kidney stones.</p>
              <p>In addition lack of magnesium leads to stress, heart arthymia, poor circulation and more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              Rates of osteoporosis are lowest in cultures where the ratio of calcium to magnesium is between 2 parts calcium to 3 parts magnesium, down to as much as 3 parts calcium to 2 parts magnesium. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The ratio of calcium to magnesium in dairy products is 10:1, way too high</span>.
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>In nations with high rates of osteoporosis, the ratio of total calcium to magnesium intake is at least 2:1, usually over 3:1. For example…</em></p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">o The South African population has a healthy ratio of 2 parts calcium to 3 parts magnesium in the average diet, and has an osteoporosis rate of 7.</span></em></p>
              <p><em>o In the USA, the ratio is 4 parts calcium to 1 part magnesium and the osteoporosis rate is 144.</em></p>
              <p><em>o In dairy-loving Switzerland, the ratio is 5.5 calcium to 1 magnesium and the rate is 188.</em></p>
              <p>Lack of magnesium causes calcium to be pulled from the bones. This calcium is all too often deposited in soft tissue, where it can cause arthritis and arteriosclerosis. If you have been accumulating calcium in your body for a length of time you may need to take an absorbable magnesium supplement to balance the excess calcium with the magnesium deficiency. It will pull out the unwanted calcium from arteries and joints and help to put it back in your bones where it belongs.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I remember reading a book saying that milk, rice and honey are use as medicine(?!) by monks in ancient times, so it cannot be that bad. And most likely, they are not overfed or have animal protein rich diet either.</p>

              <p>Don't know, but drink milk, eat lots of veges, cut down on meat. Ever compare your stools when eating lots of meat without vegetables(fibre) and you eats lots of fruit and vegetables?</p>
              <p>Too much animal protein mayl lead to blood acidosis and toxemia!</p>

              <p>Weychin, the link is Invalid Document. but i found link about magnesium in vegetable (esp. spinach, nuts and seed ).</p>

              <p>anyway to link to Buddhism, i feel the animal that is been milk today are also not in their natural condition. they are put in a confined space, unhygenic enviroment, sick with gigantic cow udders, don't know fed with what, in fear and suffering, and subjected to Electrical shock when milking.  i think this affect the content of the milk.</p>

              <p>i mean i kind of don't mind if the animal is raise naturally and u milk them naturally with hands, and let the animal roam in care free enviroment. Natural is okay per se.</p>

              <p>secondly is this generally accepted by doctors and appear in the journals?</p>
              <p>take it with a pinch of salt, especially when it is taken from the internet. you cant believe anything that is written on the WWW.</p>

              <p>Yes, many journals have shown some of the points stated in the article. Doctors are poorly educated in the field of nutrition. Besides, there is a lot of lobbying taking place by dairy industries as such there is so much propaganda about why milk is good for you, but whether or not it is really good or just so that the money start flowing to those people's pockets is hard to say.<br><br>Dairy cows may also be abused without the public's knowledge, as shown in this recent Ohio dairy farm investigation. <br><a href="http://www.mercyforanimals.org/ohdairy/">http://www.mercyforanimals.org/ohdairy/</a><br>It makes you wonder what kind of milk they produce under these conditions.</p>
