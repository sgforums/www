              and often the practices are centered around working directly with the
              nature of the five elements. The five element practices that Nyala Pema
              Dudul revealed as <em>terma</em> was called "Sky-Encompassing Self-Liberation" (<em>Kha'-Khyab Rang-Drol</em> in Tibetan), and within that series of teachings there is a practice of alchemy called <em>"Chulen of the Three Dimensions</em>."  The picture below is of the cave where he revealed this <em>terma.</em><br><br> <img src="http://www.tealchemy.org/images/dot.gif" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="15"> <br>

              <img src="http://www.tealchemy.org/images/dot.gif" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="10"> <em>Chulen</em> literally means "taking the substance."  There are many types of chulen that have various applications.  <em>Tsi dang</em> contains eight ingredients which work together to strengthen and
              coordinate the function of the major organs. Its main effect is
              physical health and youthfulness. Another type of chulen is called <em> rotsa</em>,
              which is used specifically to strengthen and balance energy; so there
              are many different kinds of chulen traditions and medicines.<br><br> In
              the contemplation tradition of chulen, the pills are used in
              conjunction with meditations and yoga in order to recognize awareness
              as the pure nature of the elements. The practice is a gradual process
              where the practitioner weans himself from eating solid food, and
              attainment of the practice is the development of the ability to subsist
              on the pure essence of the elements themselves. At that point, the
              practitioner no longer has to eat anything. <br><br>The
              teaching instructs the practitioner on the preparation of medicinal
              pills, and the method of visualization, breathing and yogic techniques
              to reintegrate the practitioner's inner and outer experience of the
              elements back into its natural state. As Namkhai Norbu writes, "<em>Chu</em> is the essential substance of the elements: it maintains the physical
              body and, if our energy is uncoordinated, it co-ordinates it, if it is
              weak, it reinforces it. Therefore, <em>chudlen</em> is useful, above all, to harmonize energy and develop clarity...The Body of Light (<em>Jalu</em>) can manifest when the principles of <em>Dzogchen</em> are combined with <em>Chulen</em>."  The <em>terma</em> text itself mentions that when the great saint Yeshe Tsogyal asked Guru
              Padmasambhava for these teachings, he replied, "Listen. There are many
              methods to achieve total realization, but in particular, there is the <em>Chulen</em> of the Three Dimensions, which embodies infinite qualifications."  In <a href="http://pages.cthome.net/tibetanbuddhism/pemadudulbioto51702.htm">Drubje Pema Dudul's biography</a>, it is said that he practiced <em>Chulen</em> with a little solid food for the first three years, <em>Chulen</em> of medicinal pills for the next three years, and <em>Chulen</em> of absorbing the essence of the elements directly from space for the
              final three years of his retreat. At the conclusion of his nine year
              retreat he had attained full enlightenment as his teacher the <em>Mahasiddha Choying Rangdrol</em> had predicted.<br><br> <img src="http://www.tealchemy.org/images/dot.gif" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="15"> <br>

              students back to the area where he lived, and after giving them each
              his heart advice and practicing the Feast Offering with them, he had
              them follow him up a mountain, where he set up a small tent and asked
              them to sew the door shut. With the instructions that they should
              practice the Feast Offering together for a week before checking on him,
              they witnessed numerous rainbows appear over the mountain and the
              surrounding area. When they returned to the spot where his tent stood,
              they found it still sewn shut; opening it, they found his body had
              disappeared. His meditation belt and cloak were in a heap, within which
              they found all of his hair and twenty nails from his hands and feet.
              This picture is of the shrine built over the spot where he manifested
              the Rainbow Body.<br><br> <em>Drubje Pema Dudul's lineage continues through many masters, including <a href="http://www.dzogchencommunitywest.org/">Chogyal Namkhai Norbu</a>, <a href="http://wangdorrimpoche.home.mindspring.com/">Wangdor Rinpoche</a>, as well as <a href="http://pages.cthome.net/tibetanbuddhism/">Tulku Serdo Rinpoche, Khandro Sherab Lhamo, and Lama Pema Karma</a>.</em></p>
