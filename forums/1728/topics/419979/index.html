              <p>Latest on Pilgrimage</p>
              <p>Bhutan is the last Vajrayana country in the world. Here, we meet the
              pure energies of Guru Rinpoche, Yeshe Tsogyal, Tontang Gyalpo, Pema
              Lingpa, PeGyal Lingpa and more, and sit where the yidams, dakinis,
              protectors dwell. This precious heritage has been preserved and
              nourished, and the living traditions remain vibrant and palpable. In
              spite of political, social, economic and cultural issues, not for below
              the surface, the pure dharma percolates and bubbles forth.
              <br> <br>In this place, where synchronicity is commonplace, the sacred
              environment has the power to transform. Through the guidance of a
              unique Dzokchen master and a skilled Western Buddhist teacher, we will
              discover a renewed energy and dynamic that will inform the rest of our
              days, and create a seed in all future lives.
              <br> <br>Participants will receive (or re-receive) the Chöd Initiation, and
              various transmissions (lungs). During our time in Bhutan, aside from
              the full-day Rinchen Trengwa, we will learn and practice the PeGyal
              Lingpa Chod, Kusli Tsok Chod, short Chod Tsok, Laughter of the Dakinis,
              and especially the Chod Ngondro (translated and presented for the VERY
              FIRST time in the West), as well as various other daily practices,
              protector practice, and so on!
              <br> <br> Over schedule, subject to minor change, looks like this:
