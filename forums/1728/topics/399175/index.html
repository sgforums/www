              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: maroon;">Upasaka Stanley Lam considered the content of this poem as being very helpful to the growth of practitioners, and asked me to write a short explanation to expound the hidden significance. Thereupon I wrote the epilog as follows: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: maroon;">In life it is indeed inevitable to come across tragic accidents or frustrating situations. All sorts of hardship and suffering keep on accumulating, thereby forcing people to seek out paths to liberation. This is the background that led to peoples engaging in spiritual practices. In the face of setback and long-term depression, various sinister habits and propensities in peoples mind would readily reveal themselves in thoughts, emotions, speeches and actions. A practitioner may thus become aware of his or her infirmity, and treat it through antidotal, mediate or sublimate ways. Human relationship are infested with suspicions, jealousy and slanders. A practitioner at such a juncture should not fall into the swamp of entanglement; instead, simply continue to follow the guidance of Bodhicitta in actively participating in Dharma practices and services, and then after having passed the test of months and years, all such difficulties would just fade away. Consider the various difficulties and hardships as trials on the path, then the more dangerous and steep the pass, the better it would enhance the practitioners ability to endure, adjust and sustain. When hindrance, interference and drag arise, a practitioner would not argue or fight with others, but choose to go on a new path and thereby experience deeper the vast openness of the whole Dharmadhatu. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: maroon;">After long years of practicing as described above, all the poisons and dirt of attachment, calculation, habitual propensities, sinister thoughts, greed and hatred in the practitioners mind would have faded away, and only pure innocence permeates. In this pure innocence there is no longer any entanglement or haggling with people over matters, only relaxation and tranquillity naturally prevail. Furthermore, to all the hardships, suffering and hindrance that one has ever encountered one is forever grateful because they have helped ones Bodhicitta to sprout, grow, be tried, and mature. After Bodhicitta has outgrown self-centered antagonism in this way, it unfolds without boundary to all sentient beings in the limitless time and space of the whole Dharmadhatu, and saturate the limitless-oneness which encompasses the whole Dharmadhatu. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">To practice non-self one should respect others' wills. When the significance of causal laws are fully comprehended, one sees clearly that no one can take over the consequences of others' actions, and hence one would not make decisions for others. Each step in the course of one's life involves many causal conditions; only firm resolutions could lead and shape paths.</span></p>

In light of the great Bodhi mind, gatherings of sufferings should be the causal conditions for a Dharma practitioner to make even more strenuous efforts. Endless salvation is to guide beings from within transmigration to liberation from sufferings, but not to escape from the world for personal immunity.<br><br>Written in Chinese and translated on </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">January 13, 2005</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">El Cerrito</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">, </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">California</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: maroon;">Comment:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: maroon;">Practicing Dharma is not for self-interests; rather it is for all beings to attain Bodhi. Criticizing others at their every move, not realizing that this reflects deep grasping of one's own. Benefiting others has not yet become apparent, and yet their feelings of loathsomeness have already been rooted. Why not cultivate oneself first by constantly striving to achieve concord with Bodhi? Paths of enlightenment are originally open and widespread; in the absence of intentions all match naturally.</span></p>

All sorts of prejudices and preferences form an all-encompassing net to snare and torment one inside; thus one could not even imagine the peace and harmony outside such nets. Through long-term Dharma practices one would gradually experience a state of mind that is free from worries. With such an experience as a point of reference for comparison, one would then find it easier to escape from previous routines of self-confined torture. In order to attain ultimate liberation it is necessary for one to be completely devoted to a life of Dharma practices and services. Only in the absence of second thoughts could thorough escape from suffering be realized.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Buddhists often encountered many hindrances on the path to enlightenment because of their heavy karmas generated in the past. Especially those heavy clouds lingering in their minds that are beyond their ability to drive away, and beyond their strength to clear away through repentance. Nevertheless, if one could ardently aspire toward Great Bodhi, wishing to dedicate one's life toward Dharma practices so that all beings may attain enlightenment sooner, then it would be possible to purify past karmas quickly. Why is this so? When one who has developed Great Bodhi reflects over past karmas, such a person will no longer become trapped in distinctions and comparisons of good or bad, or right or wrong. Instead, all past karmas will be looked upon as experiences gained in the process of leading oneself toward enlightenment. Consequently, all past experiences will become bases for one's advancement on the path to enlightenment. Thus, past karmas are turned completely into stocks for Dharma practices, and thereby thoroughly purified.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The success or failure of this transformation process rests on whether one's Bodhicitta is genuine, remains steady and never wavers. May Dharma practitioners comprehend this teaching, and thereby soon leave behind the suffering of past karmas!</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: maroon;">While praying, reciting praises, or saluting to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do not become limited by one's own concept of "facing the other party" to feel distant from them. One should understand that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have already transcended the confine of a "self," and remain in the Oneness that encompasses all sentient beings. In order to achieve inspirational communion with such holy beings one simply needs to expand one's mind to the limitless state of being constantly mindful of all sentient beings. In daily life one's speech and activities should also be oriented toward ways that are beyond antagonism. When opposite attitude is adopted, there will be entanglements drawing all involved into the maze of endless suffering. It is not difficult to go beyond a "facing others" position. Simply refrain from haggling, criticizing and expecting, and devote all energy toward practicing the Dharma and propagating the Dharma as an equal-opportunity service to all beings.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Each one lives within individual situation and karmic conditions. When one aspires toward liberation from suffering one need to contrive a way out of the layers of binding that one is in. Buddhist theories and practices are principles and training on pursuit of ultimate liberation. Actual application of such teachings is up to individual comprehension and performance. Therefore, no matter how the relationships evolved previously there is no need to haggle over it. Instead the emphasis should be on learning how to escape from the current situation of being trapped.</span></p>

To be open-minded beyond life-and-death matters one needs to see through the vanity of grasping to the notion of a self. The key to Buddhist practices is to diminish grasping to self; a practitioner should be free from dualistic mentality among human relationships. The only way to thoroughly benefit sentient beings is to help them transcend their self-imposed limitations.</span></p>
