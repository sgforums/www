They even stray into areas such as the public perception of the dangers of nuclear power. An important aspect of the book is its attempt to enable readers to devenir sorciers - become sorcerers - by exposing a number of conjuring tricks used by certain latter-day proponents of the paranormal. After finishing this book, the reader should be able to <strong>demonstrate telekinetic metal-bending, </strong>push sharp objects through body parts, and read minds at a distance. (<strong>With the aid of the memory alloy Nitinol, </strong>a good mechanical workshop, and a confederate, respectively.)</blockquote></div>
