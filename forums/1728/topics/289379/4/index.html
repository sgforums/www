He is a Buddhist and I think his intent is to show to fellow Buddhists that we do not practice what we learn in Buddhism. Here's a quote from the TS clarifying his intent, found in page 2 of this thread.<br><br><blockquote>Lord buhdda is nothing but a normal person, his deeds and achievement are nothing measurable,<br><br>Lord buhdda is empty and originate from a human form, his achievements are nothing measurable because it is infinite, far too great to be measured and experience cannot be gauge, true?<br><br>Well, Lord buhdda is toopid and foolist, the right words for lord buhdda is stupid and foolish, its what the content that matter, i will give u a nicely covered book with hilarious content.<br><br>I said about his followers, yea?<br><br>Apparently, i am half impressed by some who here who indeed speaks of great wisdom whereas some who jsut preach the teaching of buhdda. I am personally in awe of the teaching of buhdda but in my recent stay here. I am very curious, i seen few religion threads, islam to christian, many are jsut an opposite of what their religion preaches.<br><br>I have a relative who practise buhdda teaching, meditate, go to temple, talk to his master, But i am pratically in shock that he is just someone who didnt have the right temper and attitude, wish you all can see what i am trying to say.<br><br>A chinese saying, real gold will withstand the heat. How much faith do you have in buhdda. Why is there such a strong reaction? Did the teaching buhdda indicate so? i beg to differ, why not go to read up some of the article An Enternal Now have put up.<br><br>I have found the answer i seek, to pick up buhddism for the sake of magic or pick up buhddism for sake of cultivating and alternatives. I been to quite afew forums and most are aggressive, Buhddism:wisdom bliss is a forum so far the friendliest of my walks of life, so i have decided to put a test to it.<br><br>Is those who practise buhdda teaching really practising buhddas teaching or are they in the pretext of it, initially, i have no faith in much religion except buhdda because his teaching speak the most sense but my question arrive to the point of his followers. How much impact can it have on the devotee.<br><br>My conclusion have finally urge me to pick buhddism as a religion even though its teaching do not have much influence on all but i can see it on some, which is a good thing.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am definitely okay with people challenge the buddhist faith and its doctrines but I really think that the title of this thread is rather insulting.<br><br>I think there is a difference in genuinely curious and outright humiliative and if the person has doubt in something, he/she shouldn't have start a thread with such a heading. It shows that he/she lack of patient and tolerance him/herself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a way, I agree with Yamizi. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I mean, if we are unhappy or dissagree with other fellow Buddhists's way of life, character, or practice, which I think the TS was trying to implied, then maybe we should improve on ourselves first. No need to put others down for not following the way which we think is "correct". We are all learning in stages. If we can see others faults ( which are just what we thought ), then we learn not to repeat such actions. No need to creat a fuss or even "unrest". Always start from correcting ourselves, before we can help others to correct. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Tsk.
