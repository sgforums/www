Unless you empty that junk, I'll ignore you from now on and simply delete your posts, because there is nothing to discuss other than your senseless and unconstructive trolling that has no value to the conversation at all and simply spoils the thread.<br><br>This is also to prevent HZ from creating any more unnecesary unwholesome karma that obstructs him from the path and forming any unnecessary karma that creates needless sufferings. And as Thusness said, "Giving in incessantly is not a sign of tolerance, rather, a sign of immaturity. There is always rooms for differing views but not the way he presented it. And that is what moderator is for."<br><br>Ok, any more nonsense from HZ, his post will definitely be removed.<br><br><blockquote>Once a man went to a Zen Master and asked him to teach what he doesn't know. Whenever the master begins to speak on a subject, he would immediately say, Oh! I know it already. The Master kept quite for a while. The man became impatient and pestered him. The Master asked him to fetch a cup filled with water and a jug full of water. He placed it before the man and started pouring water in the cup. The cup started overflowing. Seeing this, the exasperated man shouted at the Master saying, don't you see when the cup if full it can't take anymore? The Master gave a smile and said, that's your mind. Go. Empty it and come back. Only then it can take new thing.</blockquote></div>

Fixed pattern order means thinking that events must happened within a fixed perceivable pattern. Then our mind grasp on expectations and conform our experience with that expectation instead of experiencing it in its full dynamics, creating separation and boundaries. 'Order' and the truth of Dependent Origination is not mean to be like that.<br><br>Thusness: <span style="font-style: italic;">Chaos theory breaks determinism, breaks boundary, yet does not deny order... a higher order that is too complex to be determined. Initial cause does not result into a predetermined action. From a spiritual perspective,<br>the rigidity of Â‘IÂ’ as a fixed pattern order must be broken down for life to be experienced in its full dynamics as wondrous manifestation.</span><br><br>And yes, of course, a fixed pattern order is so self limiting, and 'world limiting'.

I am personally in awe of the teaching of buhdda but in my recent stay here. I am very curious, i seen few religion threads, islam to christian, many are jsut an opposite of what their religion preaches.<br><br>I have a relative who practise buhdda teaching, meditate, go to temple, talk to his master, <strong>But</strong> i am pratically in shock that he is just someone who didnt have the right temper and attitude, wish you all can see what i am trying to say.<br><br>A chinese saying, real gold will withstand the heat. How much faith do you have in buhdda. Why is there such a strong reaction? Did the teaching buhdda indicate so? i beg to differ, why not go to read up some of the article An Enternal Now have put up.<br><br>I have found the answer i seek, to pick up buhddism for the sake of magic or pick up buhddism for sake of cultivating and alternatives. I been to quite afew forums and most are aggressive, Buhddism:wisdom bliss is a forum so far the friendliest of my walks of life, so i have decided to put a test to it.<br><br>Is those who practise buhdda teaching really practising buhddas teaching or are they in the pretext of it, initially, i have no faith in much religion  except buhdda because his teaching speak the most sense but my question arrive to the point of his followers. How much impact can it have on the devotee.<br><br>My conclusion have finally urge me to pick buhddism as a religion even though its teaching do not have much influence on all but i can see it on some, which is a good thing.[/b]</blockquote>u cannot judge the teachings of buddhism when u see the practitioners ard u not abt to fully follow wat they learnt.<br><br>we are humans, all of us carry with us our past habits and even present life habits started since we're born.<br><br>and unless that particular practitioner was already having great wisdom, the usual case is that it will take yrs and yrs, maybe even several lifetimes(if conditions are he's still practicing buddhism for those lifetimes) for the habits to slowly eradicate.<br><br>it has nothing to do with the teachings. it is the human nature that u see. i hope u do not confuse one with the other. learning and not able to follow is not the fault/flaw of the teachings. it is dependant on the individual.<br><br>may i noe wat sort of answers you are looking for and which aspects(branch of school) of buddhism u would wish to pick up?<br><br>it would help if u tell us, then we can give u some suggestions if u dun mind.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>btw, i hope u will try to cease the actions of testing faith on individuals, regardless of religion. becoz it shows a certain disrespect on the religion as well as the individuals coming from u.<br><br>p/s : pardon me as i picked up buddhism using mandarin as a medium, so i cannot explain a lot of terms well in english</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, it is a teaching, not religion. i agree with most of the teachings and follow, not blindly, but becos it is my natural reaction. if you follow your heart and it goes in line with the teachings, then even if you are not a buddhist, it really doesnt matter.</div>
