            <div class='col-md body'>II believe some of the dharma brothers and sisters will have this experience.  You saw an insect in danger, but for some reason, you didn't rescue it.  You walked away, but feeling bad about it, you come back and then realised that poor insect died.  You feel bad.  There comes the question.  You felt bad because :<br>1)  You didn't do your part as a practising Buddhist, which is to liberate that insect from suffering.<br>2) You seriously felt for the insect, and regretted deeply for letting it go through the immense pain before it died.<br><br>which one are you?<br><br>Should we practise compassion towards sentient beings because it's our duty, or because we wanted to help them alleviate from suffering.<br><br>I came across a posting on a forum exposing the dirty trade of cat market (no prize for guessing the location), where cats were sold in cages and then slaughter for the dinner table.  The cats were from everywhere, even from people's home.  So as usually, it attracted alot of negative verbal attack by the rest of the forumners, then one forumner came in and said : " if you think slaughtering cats are cruel, whatever the pigs, lambs and cows you have consumed?, they too are going through the antagonising moment of facing the knife for human beings' dinner table.  Just because the pigs, lambs and cows are not pet, doesn't mean that they deserve any worse treatment than our pet dogs and cats."  His statement received alot of support.<br><br>Why are Buddhists still consuming meat where alternatives are widely available?</div>

So my take on consciousness is stated clearly there, biological functions aside.</blockquote>Yes but reacting to external stimulus does not mean having consciousness. There are many biological articles on google before that can tell you plants have no consciousness whatsoever, though they can act seemingly intelligently and react to external stimulus like sunlight and other environmental factors.<br><br><blockquote>As to eating corpse, it is no different when you eat pork, beef, etc. because they are all dead (carcass similar to corpse). Certain animals eat their preys live, and in the process kill their preys.  These animals do not being with killing in mind.

They are ignorant and are different from Humans who are intelligent creatures and can feel for others.<br><br>Secondly, it is true that when we eat pork, beef, etc, we do not directly kill those animals (though we must avoid eating live seafood, because you are directly ordering them to be killed).<br><br>That is why Buddha allowed practitioners to eat meat if the meat is not directly killed by him, order to be killed by him, or witnessed by him. In this way, one does not commit against the 1st Precept of No Killing. The karma is lighter, nevertheless we are still indirectly killing them and indirectly responsible for their deaths. There is still karma, though not as strong.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Buddha understands the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have accumulated from aeons of their many past lives.

It just means we do not kill the animals directly, and therefore the karma is not as strong.<br><br>So my point here is not whether you are conscious of eating meat. It is that all Buddhists should follow the Buddha's guidelines on the 'Pure Meat' -- that is, not directly involved in any sort of killing.<br><br>Indirect killing is still bad but not so bad in terms of karma, because the volition/karma involved in direct killing is much stronger. The intention involved in killing, demanding killing, and the seed planted when one witnesses killing, is much much stronger and the karmic fruition is also worse.<br><br><blockquote>Let's not bring in the other realms of being.

So, animal kills for food - not for money, possession, revenge, hatred, love, etc. If animal don't eat, it will die. If human don't eat - he will become ...... arahant or bodhisattvas?</blockquote>If you don't eat meat, you will have less negative karma, you can become more compassionate and practise the Bodhisattva way.<br><br>On the other hand, the 5 pure meat guideline is the minimum.

In the first place animals are too ignorant to understand the dharma, that's why Human birth is so precious.<br><br><blockquote>The same applies for human.</blockquote>Why are you comparing humans with animals? Don't insult us lah. Obviously, we are not ignorant like them. You tell an animal to follow 5 precepts, not to kill, not to steal, etc, they don't understand at all.<br><br>For us, if we are true Buddhists we MUST do our best to keep the precepts, practise and understand the dharma.<br><br>Also, I never said everyone must become vegetarian. I said one must at least follow the 5 precepts, as well as the 5 pure meat guidelines. That is the minimum.</div>

The main cause is ignorance (i.e identification to the notion of a separate self/ego), causing the mind to grasp, seek, and give rise to aversion. Obviously such a mind is never still.<br><br><blockquote>Therefore, your emotions of sadness and regret are futile and needless suffering onto you because the animals will die one day.</blockquote>The ordinary emotion of sadness is different from Compassion and Love. Compassion is something very noble -- it is feeling NOT for oneself, or one's ego, but for Others. It is inherently not a self-serving attachment, but encompasses all other beings. So don't confuse sadness and regret with Compassion. Compassion is selfless.<br><br>Next, compassion is not attachment to the other person, as if it is a 'romantic' relationship. A compassionate person may feel a little sad for others -- but one does not become identified and attached to that other particular person and developes strong passionate attachment such that strong negative emotions arise. As such, compassion is different from the mundane kind and superficial 'love' of ordinary people -- Compassion is Unconditioned love for all beings equally. Compassion does not discriminate and does not attach.<br><br><blockquote>Death happens to some creatures so that others may live and these that live will one day die also that others may live. So, death and life is transient.</blockquote>Yes. So?<br><br><blockquote>Everything is nothing and nothing is everything.</blockquote>This is very vague. Explain what you mean by that.<br><br><blockquote>By doing nothing, you did everything you can.</blockquote>Sorry for being direct, but that's bullsh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it, really. If someone is drowning in front of you, and you know how to swim, will you say that by doing nothing you did everything you can? If you do think so, you're just sick in the mind.<br><br><blockquote>Therefore, we do right not doing anything to cause needless suffering to ourselves. If you save that animals, you will only prolong their suffering and your own.<br>Its best to let nature take its course like Buddha has taught.</blockquote>If you see someone drowning into the sea, do you excuse yourself by not saving that drowning and saying 'let nature take its course, that person is supposed to drown'?<br><br>All the talk about nature and not nature is bullsh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it. It is nature that you save that person. In fact, it would be unnatural if you don't, yet have the ability to.<br><br><blockquote>Your concept of doing something to "save" those creatures has been influenced by the monotheist religions that preach a loving God and the value of life more than death.</blockquote>I'm afraid to say you show no understanding at all about what Buddha views the preciousness of life. Did Buddha ever said something like, Life is equal to death? On the other hand the Buddha always emphasize so much on the preciousness of the human life, because of this rare opportunity to practise the Dharma and attain Enlightenment.<br><br>The Buddha also taught so much about compassion and metta/loving kindness for all beings alike, and taught that we should help other sentient beings on what we can help. And then there is also the Bodhisattva path that teaches practitioners not to enter into Nirvana but to come back to Samsara life after life to help SAVE other Sentient Beings, guide them to enlightenment and liberation.<br><br>You said monotheist religions preaches a loving God and the value of life. But most Monotheist religions are the ones that engage in lots of religious violence throughout history. Also, I've never seen monotheist religions advocate animal rights, or appreciate an animal's value of life.<br><br>On the other hand, Buddhism is the one that is strongly advocating non-violence towards all beings whether humans or non-human, as well as vegetarianism especially in Mahayana Buddhism.<br><br>Also, Buddhism is the only religion that has no religious wars in history. All other religions, especially monotheist religions have many religious wars. Old testament and many scriptures contains lots of teachings about the wrath of God, and the violence that God inflicted upon people. I shall not dwell on this topic.<br><br>But basically, Monotheistic God and Compassion are two different things.<br><br><blockquote>These values have inflitrated our society and education so much that you have diviated from the original Dharma teachings. Life is not greater than death, Buddha teaches, life is death and death is life, all is nothing and nothing is all.</blockquote>You have taken a nihilistic misinterpretation of the words of Buddha.<br><br>Buddha never taught that there is no life after death. Life does not simply end at death. There is rebirth.<br><br>The Buddha taught a whole lot about love and compassion, and if you weren't aware about that, you probably didn't read the scriptures.<br><br>BTW, what religion are you from? Or free thinker?</div>
