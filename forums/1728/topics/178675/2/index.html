            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people, I'm very sorry about my ignorance regarding 108 Kata. Rahula25 kindly explained to me just now.. so pardon me if I caused any confusion. I have explained the significance of '108', but have not explained the meaning of 108 Kata. I believe the paperflower and bryan already know so this is to those who is confused by my post.<br><br>Kata means 'Gatha' in Pali, like Jayamangala Gatha etc. They are words of the Buddha, or discourses. Theravada Buddhists believe that Gatha from Buddha contains a profound meaning in it and also harbours great mystic powers. Therefore many monks meditate through these gathas and absorbs these gathas as a form of mantras... similar to the Mahayana practise of chanting Sanskrit mantras. Theravada Buddhists chant the gathas as mantras, whether for protection, spiritual harm, occult protection, protection from wild animals, etc.<br><br>In Thailand...many forest monks practising meditation in deep jungle...they using these katas to protect themsleves from all these harms n sickness. these katas are essence n by-product of highly accomplished Luang phor monks. The luang phor are compassionate and they teach these hidden katas to the devotees to benefit them.</div>
