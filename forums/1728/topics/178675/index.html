Such distresses consist of both the ideal and the real. For example, a person thinks of committing a robbery. It only becomes real when the crime is committed. If we wish to build a school then that is just an idea, it only becomes real when it is erected. Therefore, all matters consist of both the ideal and the real, thereby resulting in a total of 108 distresses. Every single day human beings live within these 108 worries. If people concentrate in reciting the name of the Buddha with a string of chanting-beads, and without being distracted by the 18 realms of senses (6 roots, 6 external sense fields and 6 sense-consciousness), these distresses will be transformed into enlightenment. This is the principle of the 108 beads. The practice of using chanting-beads continues to the present day.....</div>
