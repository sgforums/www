              <p>We have a saying in Tibetan: “gom pa mayin goms pa yin”. This means: “It
               is not about meditation, what it is about is to become familiar”. We 
              become familiar with the nature of ourselves, both wholesome and 
              unwholesome, and with the nature of reality. We become familiar with the
               stream of our consciousness and with its function, and we develop a 
              quality of heart and mind that is able to perceive unfamiliar 
              perceptions or situations without reacting with ignorance. And we become
               more and more familiar with the qualities of our true nature: 
              compassion, generosity, openness, equanimity, joy, and innate purity. 
              When we develop these qualities of heart and mind, our suffering is 
              reduced. This will bring ease and joy into our lives on the physical, 
              mental, and emotional levels.<br> <br> When we take time away from external influences to be quietly by 
              ourselves, we get to know ourselves in an intimate way. We become 
              familiar with ourselves. We become familiar with our stream of 
              consciousness and the way that our emotions are produced. We become 
              familiar with the way that we live our lives. We become familiar with 
              the process that happens in us when we become agitated, and with our 
              weaknesses and strengths. We become familiar with what it is to be 
              sitting with strength in the face of depression. We become familiar with
               our ego, our attachment to our physical body, our afflicted emotions, 
              and our fear of death. And we become familiar with our addiction to our 
              fear. Through becoming familiar with what causes us pain and suffering, 
              we will be able to see what is subtly exhausting and killing us 
              internally through jealousy, anger, fear, sadness, insecurity, 
              embarrassment, or loneliness. Through this process we can develop the 
              heart and mind to distinguish between what to renounce and what to 
              accept. And we become familiar with our innate healing wisdom and our 
              own potential of awakened nature. We become familiar with the Buddha 
              within.<br> <br> The Buddha said that you are your own best friend and your own worst 
              enemy. The practice of meditation can give us the strength to see the 
              qualities of a friend and of an enemy within ourselves. This can help us
               to observe the stream of our consciousness and its contribution to our 
              physical, mental, and emotional distraction and instability. Also, 
              meditation can help us to calm our minds. The practice of sitting still 
              is essential.<br> <br> In our lives, there is calmness and joy on the one hand, and arousal of 
              anger, depression, sadness, passion, and desire-attachment on the other.
               There is so much chaotic energy coming in and out of our mind and body.
               This is why we need to learn to coordinate the calmness or stability of
               mind that we cultivate in our meditation with the movement of our 
              energy. Sometimes we may think that meditation will take care of all our
               problems if we can generate enough calmness. Yet, this is not possible 
              unless we learn how to integrate this calm state of mind with the 
              chaotic movement of our energy. Just sitting by itself does not bring 
              ease and eternal joy, although it helps to settle this monkey mind that 
              constantly moves from here to there. The calming of our mind is not 
              realization in itself. Our actual realization is of liberation from the 
              cyclic continuum of suffering. This is only possible if we become 
              familiar with our afflictions and know how to integrate our calmness and
               our concentration with the chaotic movement of energy of these 
              afflictions.<br> <br> Our meditation has the power to familiarize us with the qualities of our
               true nature. Through our steady, dedicated practice we become 
              accustomed to its qualities, we become familiar with generosity, with 
              the mind of compassion and awakening, and with our pure nature. The 
              practice imprints itself onto mind and body in the form of qualities 
              such as patience, openness, and acceptance. A beautiful gift of 
              meditation practice is that it keeps us connected with the miracle of 
              each moment. It allows us to see the beauty in each thing and in every 
              moment, and how these small things affect us. It helps us to release our
               attachment to the projected idea of a result. It brings us closer to 
              the reality of life by allowing us to use both suffering and happiness 
              as part of our practice toward the realization of awakened heart and 
              mind.</p>
