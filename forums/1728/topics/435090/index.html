              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">A Bodhisatta is a being devoted to Enlightenment.</span></em></strong> <br><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span><span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">As a </span>'<span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">Compassionate Being</span>'<span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">, a Bodhisatta is destined to attain Buddhahood, and become a future Buddha, through the cultivation of his mind.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><span>In order to gain Supreme Enlightenment, he practices transcendental virtues(Parami) to perfection. The virtues are generosity, morality, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truthfulness, determination, loving-kindness, and even mindedness. He cultivates these Parami with compassion and wisdom, without being influenced by selfish motives or selfconceit. He works for the welfare and happiness of all beings, seeking to lessen the suffering of others throughout the series of his countless lives. In his journey to perfection, he is prepared to practice these virtues, sometimes even at the expense of his own life.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span><span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">In the Pali scriptures, the designation </span>'<span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">Bodhisatta</span>' <span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">is given to Prince Siddhartha before His Enlightenment and to His former lives. The Buddha Himself used this term when speaking of His life prior to Enlightenment. According to the Pali texts there is no mention of Buddha Bodhi being the only way to attain the final goal of Nibbanic bliss. It was very rare for a disciple during the Buddha</span>'<span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">s time to forgo the opportunity to attain sainthood and instead declare bodhisattahood as his aspiration. However, there are some records that some followers of the Buddha did aspire to become Bodhisattas to gain </span>'<span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">Buddhahood</span>'<span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>What is supreme enlightenment?  It connotes there are different levels of attainment. Someone mentioned something like PhD or to this effect.</p>
              <p>Indeed, to be a bodhisattva and ultimatley to become a Buddha is an aspiration (ambition), no different from 'grasping', no matter how altruistic the aim is.</p>

              <p>Mother Teresa was an outstanding <span style="text-decoration: underline;">human being</span> who dedicated her life to charity.  There are also many people who dedicated their lives for the good of mankind.  The Catholic Church had canonised Mother Teresa, making her a saint.  I wrote before that Buddhist bodhisattva is like Catholic saint, and I am heartened you are in syn with me.  I have no idea what Mother Teresa as a saint is doing!</p>
              <p>I have no issue with altruistic aims -  the betterment of human lives, to reduce or eliminate "life sucks". </p>
              <p>However, the issue is bodhisattva - a human who entered parinirvarna, come back (I don't what) and is able to reside in SE Asia, to save the rest of mankind, not for his selfish existence.  I can see a similarity - Jesus Christ was like that but not in exact manner.  It does not matter, the ultimate aim was a 'sacrifice' to save the world.  All these sound very noble.  The Christian path to salvation is to believe in Christ as the saviour.  The Buddhist path to liberation is to believe in bodhisattva!</p>

              <p>I said there is similarity but not exact manner.  The idea of 'selfless sacrifice' to 'save' the world whether from sins or from sufferings is similar.  So, it does not matter whether you call teacher, facilitator, helper or saviour.</p>

              <p>Yeah and I am saying that is merely surface understanding. You are not understanding the implication of the words.</p>
              <p>Firstly, Jesus wants to save others to go heaven. Buddhists want to guide people to liberate from sufferings and attain nirvana, which is not at all the same as mundane rebirth in heaven. 'Liberate all others' means liberate them into nirvana, therefore it is different from Christianity's salvation into heaven.</p>
              <p>Secondly, Christianity thinks belief in Jesus suffice. Buddhists do not believe in this, we do not believe in salvation through a person or through mere belief. A Buddha or bodhisattva can only guide, that's all. He cannot take away people's sins or grant enlightenment to others or control a person's rebirth by changing their karma or anything like that. He can only advice and teach.</p>

              <p>I know very well the Christian concept of salvation and the Buddhist concept of liberation.  Therefore, I know the difference between salvation and liberation.  While I used 'similarity' I qualified by saying they are not exact.  To me, both have goals and what Jesus did and what bodhisattvas do are directed towards its goal, regardless of whether one is thru belief and the other is thru guidance.</p>

I believe in your opinion, the same would also apply to the like of Jesus Christ and the Prophet Muhammad? Yes, we all start out and end our existence in this world with an outer appearance of a human being. But really, other than outer appearance, are we all ‘humans’ when we passed on from this world? Why do some get labeled as Saints, Arhats, Bodhisattva, Buddha and even Son of God? It is because during their live on earth they have raised themselves way beyond the scope, consciousness and capability of what one would normally associate what normal humans, where their words and their deeds would not just affect the lives of the people of their generation but also generations and generations after that. That’s why we do not called or look upon such personalities as mere human beings anymore after what they have done for the human race. The labels are also a sign of respect and veneration we have for them. <span> </span></span></span></p>
