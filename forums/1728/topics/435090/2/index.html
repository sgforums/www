              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #332200;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You seems to lay great emphasis that Mother Teresa and in one of your other post, that Prince Siddhartha are just Human Beings. I believe in your opinion, the same would also apply to the like of Jesus Christ and the Prophet Muhammad? Yes, we all start out and end our existence in this world with an outer appearance of a human being. But really, other than outer appearance, are we all ‘humans’ when we passed on from this world? Why do some get labeled as Saints, Arhats, Bodhisattva, Buddha and even Son of God? It is because during their live on earth they have raised themselves way beyond the scope, consciousness and capability of what one would normally associate what normal humans, where their words and their deeds would not just affect the lives of the people of their generation but also generations and generations after that. That’s why we do not called or look upon such personalities as mere human beings anymore after what they have done for the human race. The labels are also a sign of respect and veneration we have for them. <span> </span></span></span></p>
