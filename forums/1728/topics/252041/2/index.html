If you go deeper into the essence it is like what Longchen said.. the realisation must be no self, no doer. With self and doer realised for what is is and is gone, there is no need for a 'fa' to deal or overcome thoughts... then it becomes like what Diamond Sutra said, 'Yin Wu Shuo Zhu Er Sheng Qi Xin'. Just a recall of what Longchen said earlier on...<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by longchen:<br><strong><br><br>your will/sense of self can never stop any emotions or feelings from arising. The trying to stop IS the aversion itself. Can you see... you are trying to stop a thought or a feeling with another thought. This can never work. Just give up trying to do anything about it.<br><br>Remember... 'sense of self' is not the doer of any action. This is a realisation.<br><br>good luck...</strong></div></blockquote><strong>And then eventually all manifestations, including all thoughts, are just known to arising spontaneously <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And though thoughts lessens tremendously (especially unnecessary thoughts), when a need arises it arises spontaneously out of prajna wisdom... but none of these obstructs our own meditation. However this requires deep realisations and isn't just something we just talk about it.. talking isn't of much help but just to share so that one has some basic idea about it.<br><br>p.s it wld have been clearer for you if you attended the dharma talk just now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> it was great.. but anyway its just no yuan so you cant come today... so see you in future hehe</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just found some 'ancient' jems in our forum  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> These discussions were in year 2004.<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=100855" rel="nofollow">lame question on meditation</a><br><br>Longchen said:<br><br><blockquote>Hi,<br><br>Besides the Jhanas, have you experience pure empty Presence in a state of no thought? That is the true state of a Being. It is beyond the mind, beyond concepts.<br><br>This pure Presence is all pervading, yet void at the same time. In my experience, the Jhanas are different. Jhana's are like 'looking outward' in a meditation, pure Presence is 'looking inwards'. I can't describe it very well.<br><br>Pure presence can best be felt when a person is at the moment free from desires. Pure presence is like the ray that emits its properties into the mind. The properties of the pure presence form your personality.</blockquote><blockquote>Hi Sangha,<br><br>I am in no position to say whether Pure presence is nibbana. I can only write from my own experience and understanding.<br><br>This pure presence is called Rigpa in Tibetan Buddhism. I am not a Buddhist in this life, but I was a Tibetan Monk of Nyingma school several lifetimes ago. That is why I still have a lot of interest in Buddhism.<br><br>About Rigpa, when we experience it. It is formless and empty and at the same time infinite and all pervading. It is NOT BLISS. Bliss is a samadhi state but it is not the true nature yet, it is still a state in the mind. I have bliss experiences also, in fact i have then now quite often outside of meditation also.<br><br>Rigpa is a presence of 'yourself' that is connect to everything in the universe. That is probably why the Buddha say that there is 'no self'. All is connect to all in the Dharmakaya. Rigpa is a part of the Dharmakaya. When in the state, there is no separation into you or me... We are all one thing which cannot be described.<br><br>However, I must say that even now, while reading this, we are already the rigpa. We do not realise this is because we THINK we are just the mind/personality. The mind/personality is a REFLECTION from rigpa. It is not the true self. If you understand what I am write, you may get a sudden awakening/realisation. And if the realisation is deep enough, your viewpoint or way of seeing the world will change.<br><br>Just my 2 cents... </blockquote>Thusness replied:<br><br><blockquote>Hi LongChen,<br><br>Even the "inner" and "outer" are production of the analytical mind. Only the mind requires such division, concepts and thoughts. The Presence has no room for all these. It works through naturalness and directness. Too short to have time and too simple to have thought.<br><br>However even when one experiences this pure sense of existence, due to latent karmic tendencies, the mind will still attempt to create a formless-transparent-like entity ('I') experiencing "things". In reality there is no 'I'.<br><br>The 'Blueness' of the blue sky isn't 'I'.<br>Remain Silence and in Presence, all things are in their entirety.<br>No 'I' is required.<br>This itself is sufficient.<br><br>Happy Journey. </blockquote>Longchen asked:<br><br><blockquote>Hi Thusness,<br><br>Thank you for your profound explanation.<br><br>May I ask ... how do one remain in Presence all the time. Does it require the clearing of all karmic tendencies (samcaras/samskara).<br><br>I understand that the Presence is there all the time. Is it possible to be in presence even when engaged in say a conversation with another person?<br><br>Currently, switching to witness state is only possible when I am not engaged in any conversation.<br><br>Thanks</blockquote>Thusness replied:<br><br><blockquote>Reply with Quote<br>Hi Long Chen,<br><br><strong>Yes it is possible. But as much as I would not like to say, there is no what, where, when, why and how. Sounds senseless but it is true. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">These are what Naturalness is not.</span></strong><br><br>Nevertheless, the mind will be stubbornly attached to this current mode of knowing because to the mind, it is all there is. It seems to be a destined journey that a sincere seeker has to continue penetrate its own depth, <strong>till it completely exhaust itself and meet its own DEATH. The death of the 'I'.<br><br>The giving up and full understanding of the poverty of the entire thinking and analytical mechanism will allow the mind to rest itself upon nothing. Here karmic tendency arises and ceases as it is, no effort to struggle is made.<br>This is the time effortless knowing arise. A complete clarity of ISness manisfesting as pure Presence.<br><br>Seek deep into the depth of our own self, there is always this Will, Effort..etc. This Unwillingless to let go, to be.<br>Simply put, it is this that separates.<br><br>Lastly try not to find a sit in the body. The true nature fills all space. Creating a boundary for What that is neither within nor without will eventually prove futile. Presence finds itself in Otherness. The body has created the illusion of 'inward' and divides.</strong> We have engaged ourselves in too much analysis and lost our intuitiveness and directness. Since u have experienced the pure Presence, sense the 'I' that holds and let go immeidately.<br>Presense always IS.<br><br>Nice Chat</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was reminded of my earlier discussion with Thusness just now about the talk earlier on... anyway he likes it (he didnt come but I shared some of what I noted down) very much especially the Chinese verses which I will post below. Part of what I told him is about the part 'zhong jian yuan zhan kai lai'.. means that though it is said past thought is gone and future thought didn't arise, why say 'expand limitlessly'?<br><br>Here's what I shared with him on certain parts of the talk.<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">...the 'yuan zhan kai lai' he explains it with some explanatory text which i tink maybe from my master.. he says 'yuan zhan kai lai' is for fear of those who may get stuck in keeping/attaching to state of quiescence or stillness... and in that case there is still duality of subject and object, inner and outer...</span><br><br>comments: that means as my teacher explains... holding on a state of inner emptiness as opposed to the outer world, whereas in reality, both subject and object, inner and outer are one reality.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...whereas 'yuan zhan kai lai' means awareness is all pervading and is not limited to a state or having to use a fa... then he said in that state both mind and body drop off... and then he also say how emptiness is form form is emptiness...</span><br><br>When there is no more subject-object duality, mind-body drops off, awareness is completely not bounded by the body, and there is no states that are purer from another.. means both movement and quiescence are One Thusness.<br><br>Here are his verses... but I can't confirm the last line, though I think it should be right..<br><br><img src="http://xs115.xs.to/xs115/07186/dzmfverse.jpg"></blockquote>p.s.

Why effortless? Does it take effort to hear or see what is happening around you? Awareness is ever-present no matter what... and it takes place effortlessly and spontaneously. It takes no effort to hear the keyboard sound as I'm typing. It takes no effort to see the words that are appearing on the screen. Insight meditation or any form of "practising" naked awareness is pointing to this. As Thusness says, "clarity must be effortless and spontaneous...and that has to do with dissolving the sense of self."<br><br><blockquote>Enlightenment, True Nature, True Self, Wholeness, the Unconditioned Absolute - whatever words have been given to what is without words, unthinkable, unknowable, ungraspable - is not the effect of a cause. It is luminously present and timeless, overlooked by the roving intellect that is trying to grasp it, and obscured by the bodymind's constantly shifting moods, desires, and fears. Moment-to-moment meditation is clearly coming upon this roving and shifting, resisting and fearing mind and the urge to do something about it!... Meditation that is free and effortless, without goal, without expectation, is an expression of Pure Being that has nowhere to go, nothing to get.<br><br>There is no need for awareness to turn anywhere. It's here! Everything is here in awareness! When there is a waking up from fantasy, there is no one who dos it. Awareness and the sound of a plane are here with no one in the middle trying to "do" them or bring them together. They are here together! The only thing that keeps things (and people) apart is the "me"-circuit with its separative thinking. When that is quiet, divisions do not exist.<br><br>~ The Silent Question: Meditating in the Stillness of Not-Knowing by Toni Packer</blockquote>But then again is effort needed? In another sense, yes.. in terms of the 7 factors of enlightenment, it is called 'energy'.<br><br><a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe14.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe14.html</a> - Mindfulness in Plain English<br><br><blockquote>...Concentration and mindfulness are distinctly different functions. They each have their role to play in meditation, and the relationship between them is definite and delicate. Concentration is often called one-pointedness of mind. It consists of forcing the mind to remain on one static point. Please note the word FORCE....<br><br>...Concentration is pretty much a forced type of activity. It can be developed by force, by sheer unremitting willpower. And once developed, it retains some of that forced flavor. Mindfulness, on the other hand, is a delicate function leading to refined sensibilities. These two are partners in the job of meditation. Mindfulness is the sensitive one. He notices things. Concentration provides the power. He keeps the attention pinned down to one item. Ideally, mindfulness is in this relationship. Mindfulness picks the objects of attention, and notices when the attention has gone astray. Concentration does the actual work of holding the attention steady on that chosen object. If either of these partners is weak, your meditation goes astray....<br><br>...You can't develop mindfulness by force. Active teeth gritting willpower won't do you any good at all. As a matter of fact, it will hinder progress. Mindfulness cannot be cultivated by struggle. It grows by realizing, by letting go, by just settling down in the moment and letting yourself get comfortable with whatever you are experiencing. This does not mean that mindfulness happens all by itself. Far from it. Energy is required. Effort is required. But this effort is different from force. Mindfulness is cultivated by a gentle effort, by effortless effort. The meditator cultivates mindfulness by constantly reminding himself in a gentle way to maintain his awareness of whatever is happening right now. Persistence and a light touch are the secrets. Mindfulness is cultivated by constantly pulling oneself back to a state of awareness, gently, gently, gently...</blockquote>So I think you are putting too much 'FORCE' in concentrating on a static point and blocking out any 'extras'... so some balancing may be needed..</div>
