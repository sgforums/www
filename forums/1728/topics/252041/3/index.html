When you become absorbed in these jhanic factors then there is stability in that absorption. But it is not forced... there is no difficulty at all in maintaining the state of jhana because of the factors. My first impression of these experiences from my past experience is like I am being absorbed into a different state of consciousness... and in a way you can say so..</div>

Experience of non-duality results in bliss or jhanic states.  We may enter non-dual mainly through:<br><br>1. Concentration<br>Here object and subject fused into one through the sustain power of concentration.  One enters into a state of absorption and samadhi.  This is the way of Â‘effortingÂ’ that has an entry and exit point.  Self is temporary suspended by Â‘forget it through absorptionÂ’.<br><br>2. Wisdom<br>This is the experience of non-duality through realization and insight.  In this case, non-duality is experienced as our nature.  It is always so.  This is the effortless and spontaneous way.  There is no entry and exit at all.  All dualism are but ignorance of our non-dual nature.  Self is realized as an illusion.  There is no self apart from the manifestation.<br><br>In both cases, non-duality is all about the dissolution of Â‘self/SelfÂ’.  The sense of self is caused either by:<br><br>1. The illusionary view of an agent.  The view of Â‘IÂ’  or<br>2. Attachment to objectives and possession, that is, objective action.  The view of Â‘mineÂ’.<br><br>What is said is more on the second aspect but realisation that there is no agent is equally important. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
