                  having an admirable friend, he wasn’t saying something warm and reassuring
                  about the compassion of others. He was pointing out three uncomfortable
                  truths—about delusion and trust—that call for clear powers of judgment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>The first truth is that <em>you can’t really trust yourself to see
                  through your delusion on your own</em>. When you’re deluded, you don’t <em>know</em> you’re deluded. You need some trustworthy outside help to point it out to you.
                  This is why, when the Buddha advised the Kalamas to know for themselves, one of
                  the things he told them to know for themselves was how wise people would judge
                  their behavior. When he advised his son, Rahula, to examine his own actions as
                  he would his face in a mirror, he said that if Rahula saw that his actions had
                  caused any harm, he should talk it over with a knowledgeable friend on the path.
                  That way he could learn how to be open with others—and himself—about his
                  mistakes and at the same time tap into the knowledge that his friend had
                  gained. He wouldn’t have to keep reinventing the dharma wheel on his own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>So if you really want to become skillful in your thoughts, words, and
                  deeds, you need a trustworthy friend to point out your blind spots. And because
                  those spots are blindest around your unskillful habits, the primary duty of a
                  trustworthy friend is to point out your faults—for only when you see your
                  faults can you correct them; only when you correct them are you benefiting from
                  your friend’s compassion in pointing them out.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>Regard him as one who <br>         points out <br>         treasure, <br> the wise one who <br> seeing your faults <br>         rebukes you.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>In passing judgment on your faults, an admirable friend is like a
                  trainer. Once, when a horse trainer came to see the Buddha, the Buddha asked
                  him how he trained his horses. The trainer said that some horses responded to
                  gentle training, others to harsh training, others required both harsh and
                  gentle training; but if a horse didn’t respond to either type of training, he’d
                  kill the horse to maintain the reputation of his teachers’ lineage. Then the
                  trainer asked the Buddha how he trained his students, and the Buddha replied,
                  “In the same way.” Some students responded to gentle criticism, others to harsh
                  criticism, others to a mixture of the two, but if a student didn’t respond to
                  either type of criticism, he’d kill the student. This shocked the horse
                  trainer, until the Buddha explained what he meant by “killing”: He wouldn’t
                  train the student any further, which essentially killed the student’s
                  opportunity to grow in the practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>So the first prerequisite in maintaining an admirable friend is being
                  willing to take criticism, both gentle and harsh. This is why the Buddha told
                  his disciples not to teach for money, for the person paying is the one who
                  determines what’s taught, and people rarely pay for the criticism they need to
                  hear. But even if the teacher is teaching for free, you run into the Buddha’s
                  second uncomfortable truth: <em>You can’t open your heart to just anyone</em>.
                  Our powers of judgment really do have power, and because that power can cause
                  long-term help or harm, you have to take care in choosing your friend. Don’t
                  fall into the easy trap of being judgmental or nonjudgmental—judgmental in
                  trusting your knee-jerk likes or dislikes, nonjudgmental in trusting that every
                  dharma teacher would be equally beneficial as a guide. Instead, be judicious in
                  choosing the person whose judgments you’re going to take on as your own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>This, of course, sounds like a catch-22: You need a good teacher to help
                  develop your powers of judgment, but welldeveloped powers of judgment to
                  recognize who a good teacher might be. And even though there’s no foolproof way
                  out of the catch—after all, you can master a foolproof way and still be a fool—there
                  <em>is</em> a way if you’re willing to learn from experience. And fortunately the
                  Buddha gave advice about how to develop your powers of judgment, so that you
                  know what to look for along the way. In fact, his recommendations for how to
                  choose an admirable friend are a preliminary exercise in discernment: learning
                  how to develop judicious powers of judgment so that you, too, can become an
                  admirable friend, first to yourself and then to the people around you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>The first step in being judicious is understanding what it means to
                  judge in a helpful way. Think not of a justice sitting on her bench, passing a
                  verdict of guilt or innocence, but of a piano teacher listening to you play.
                  She’s not passing a final verdict on your potential as a pianist. Instead, she’s
                  judging a work in progress: listening to your intention for the performance,
                  listening to your execution of that intention, and then deciding whether it
                  works. If it doesn’t, she has to figure out if the problem is with the
                  intention or the execution, make helpful suggestions, and then let you try
                  again. She keeps this up until she’s satisfied with your performance. The
                  important principle is that she never directs her judgments at you as a person.
                  Instead she has to stay focused on your actions, to keep looking for better
                  ways to raise them to higher and higher standards.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>At the same time, you’re learning from her how to judge your own
                  playing: thinking more carefully about your intention, listening more carefully
                  to your execution, developing higher standards for what works, and learning to
                  think outside the box for ways to improve. Most important of all, you’re
                  learning to focus your judgment on your performance, and not on yourself. This
                  way—when there’s less <em>you</em> invested in your habits—you’re more willing to
                  recognize unskillful habits and to drop them in favor of more skillful ones.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>Of course, when you and your teacher are judging your improvement on a
                  particular piece, it’s part of a longer process of judging how well the
                  relationship is working. She has to judge, over time, if you’re benefiting from
                  her guidance, and so do you. But again, neither of you is judging the worth of
                  the other person. She’s simply deciding—based on your progress—whether it’s
                  worth her while to continue taking you on as a student. You’re judging the
                  extent to which her recommendations are actually helping you perform more
                  effectively. If either of you decides to terminate the relationship, it
                  shouldn’t be because she’s a bad teacher or you’re a bad student, but simply
                  that she’s not the teacher for you, or you’re not the student for her.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>In the same
                  way, when you’re evaluating a potential dharma teacher, remember that there’s
                  no Final Judgment in Buddhism. When looking for a teacher, you want someone who
                  will evaluate your actions as a work in progress, and you have to apply the
                  same standard to him or her. And you’re not trying to take on the superhuman
                  role of evaluating that person’s essential worth. You’re simply judging whether
                  his or her actions embody the kinds of skills you’d like to develop and the
                  types of mental qualities—which are also a kind of action—that you’d trust in a
                  trainer or guide. After all, the only way we know anything about other people
                  is through their actions, so that’s as far as our judgments can fairly extend.
                  At the same time, though, because we’re judging whether we want to internalize
                  another person’s standards, it’s not unfair to pass judgment on what they’re
                  doing. It’s for our own protection. And it’s for the sake of our protection
                  that the Buddha recommended looking for two qualities in a teacher: wisdom and
                  integrity. To gauge these qualities, though, takes time and sensitivity, which
                  is why the Buddha also advised that you be willing to spend time with the
                  person and try to be really observant of how that person acts. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>Once, when King Pasenadi came to see the Buddha, a group of naked
                  ascetics passed nearby. The king went over, got down on one knee, and offered
                  them homage. Then he returned to the Buddha and asked, “Are those ascetics
                  worthy of homage?” The Buddha replied that you could fairly answer that
                  question only after having spent time with them, and only if you were really
                  observant. The king praised the Buddha’s caution, and added, “Those men are
                  actually my spies. They’re on the way back from having scouted out the enemy,
                  and soon—after bathing and clothing themselves—they’ll be back enjoying
                  themselves with their wives.” So you can’t judge people just by first
                  impressions. The appearance of wisdom is easy to fake. In the past, people were
                  impressed by extreme austerities; at present, the ads for dharma books and
                  retreats show that we’re attracted to other surface criteria, but the principle
                  is the same.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>To save time and needless pain in the search, however, the Buddha noted
                  four early warning signs indicating that potential teachers don’t have the
                  wisdom or integrity to merit your trust. The warning signs for untrustworthy
                  wisdom are two. The first is when people show no gratitude for the help they’ve
                  received—and this applies especially to help from their parents and teachers.
                  People with no gratitude don’t appreciate goodness, don’t value the effort that
                  goes into being helpful, and so will probably not put out that effort
                  themselves. The second warning sign is that they don’t hold to the principle of
                  karma. They either deny that we have freedom of choice, or else teach that one
                  person can clear away another person’s bad karma from the past. People of this
                  sort are unlikely to put forth the effort to be genuinely skillful, and so are
                  untrustworthy guides.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>As for lack of integrity, there are also two warning signs. The first is
                  when people feel no shame in telling a deliberate lie. As the Buddha once said,
                  “There’s no evil that such a person might not do.” The second warning sign is
                  when they don’t conduct arguments in a fair and aboveboard manner:
                  misrepresenting their opponents, pouncing on the other side’s minor lapses, not
                  acknowledging the valid points the other side has made. People of this sort,
                  the Buddha said, aren’t even worth talking to, much less taking on as teachers.
                  As for people who don’t display these early warning signs, the Buddha gave
                  advice on how to gauge wisdom and integrity in their actions over time. One
                  question he’d have you ask yourself is whether a teacher’s actions betray any
                  of the greed, anger, or delusion that would inspire him to claim knowledge of
                  something he didn’t know, or to tell another person to do something that was
                  not in that person’s best interests. To test for a teacher’s wisdom, the Buddha
                  advised noticing how a potential teacher responds to questions about what’s
                  skillful and not, and how well he or she handles adversity. To test for
                  integrity, you look for virtue in day-to-day activities, and purity in the
                  teacher’s dealings with others. Does this person make excuses for breaking the
                  precepts, bringing them down to his level of behavior rather than lifting his
                  behavior to theirs? Does he take unfair advantage of other people? If so, you’d
                  better find another teacher.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>This, however, is where the Buddha’s third uncomfortable truth comes in:
                  <em>You can’t be a fair judge of another person’s integrity until you’ve
                  developed some of your own</em>. This is probably the most uncomfortable truth
                  of all, for it requires that you accept responsibility for your judgments. If
                  you want to test other people’s potential for good guidance, you have to pass a
                  few tests yourself. Again, it’s like listening to a pianist. The better you are
                  as a pianist, the better your ability to judge the other person’s playing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>Fortunately, the Buddha also gave guidance on how to develop integrity,
                  and it doesn’t require that you start out innately good. All it requires is a
                  measure of truthfulness and maturity: the realization that your actions make
                  all the difference in your life, so you have to take care in how you act; the
                  willingness to admit your mistakes, both to yourself and to others; and the
                  willingness to learn from your mistakes so you don’t keep repeating them. As
                  the Buddha taught Rahula, before you act in thought, word, or deed, look at the
                  results you expect from your action. If it’s going to harm you or anyone else,
                  don’t do it. If you don’t foresee any harm, go ahead and act. While you’re
                  acting, check to see if you’re causing any unforeseen harm. If you are, stop.
                  If not, continue until you’re done. After you’re done, look at the long-term
                  results of your action. If it caused any harm, talk it over with someone else
                  on the path, develop a sense of shame around the mistake, and resolve not to
                  repeat it. If it caused no harm, take joy in the fact and keep on training.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>As you train yourself in this way, you learn four important principles
                  about exercising judgment in a healthy way. First, you’re judging your actions,
                  not yourself. If you can learn to separate your sense of self from your
                  actions, you tend to be more willing to admit your mistakes to yourself, and
                  less defensive when other people point them out to you. This principle also
                  applies to the sense of shame the Buddha recommends you feel toward your
                  mistakes. It’s directed not at you, but at the action—the sort of shame felt by
                  a person of high self-esteem who’s realized she’s done something beneath her
                  and doesn’t want to do it again. Shame of this sort is not debilitating. It
                  simply helps you remember the lesson you’ve learned.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>This relates to the second important principle about healthy judgment,
                  that it requires mindfulness in the original meaning of the term: keeping
                  something in mind. Mindfulness of this sort is essential in developing your
                  judgment, for it helps you remember the lessons you’ve learned over time as to
                  what works and what doesn’t. Because we often try our best to forget our
                  mistakes, we have to train our mindfulness repeatedly to remember the lessons
                  we learned from those mistakes so that we don’t have to keep learning them over
                  and over again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>Sometimes you hear mindfulness defined as a nonjudging state of mind,
                  but that’s not how the Buddha understood it. He often compared mindfulness to a
                  gatekeeper in the way it helps you judge what should and shouldn’t be done: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>Just as the royal frontier fortress has a gatekeeper—wise, experienced,
                  intelligent—to keep out those he doesn’t know and to let in those he does, for
                  the protection of those within and to ward off those without; in the same way a
                  disciple of the noble ones is mindful, highly meticulous, remembering and able
                  to call to mind even things that were done and said long ago. With mindfulness
                  as his gatekeeper, the disciple of the noble ones abandons what is unskillful,
                  develops what is skillful, abandons what is blameworthy, develops what is
                  blameless, and looks after himself with purity. </span></em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '><br> —Anguttara Nikaya 7.63</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>So mindfulness actually plays an essential role in developing your
                  powers of judgment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>As you keep trying to apply the lessons you’ve learned, you discover the
                  third principle about healthy judgment: that the lessons you learn from your
                  mistakes, if you act on them, really do make a difference. The present moment
                  is not so arbitrarily new that lessons from yesterday are useless today. You may
                  keep finding new subtleties in how to apply past lessons, but the general
                  outlines of how suffering is caused and how it can be ended always remain the
                  same.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>The fourth principle is that you learn how to benefit from the judgments
                  of others. When you’ve chosen a person to confide in, you want to be open to
                  that person’s criticisms, but you also want to put his or her suggestions for
                  improvement to the test. As the Buddha told his aunt, Gotami, you can test
                  genuine dharma by seeing the results it gives when put it into action. If it
                  leads to such admirable qualities as being dispassionate, modest, content,
                  energetic, and unburdensome, it’s the genuine thing. The person who teaches you
                  this dharma has passed at least that test for being a genuine friend. And you’re
                  learning more and more how to judge for yourself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>Some people might object that it’s selfish to focus on finding friends
                  you can benefit from, and inhumane to keep testing people to see if they fit
                  the bill. But that’s missing the point. The benefits that come from this sort
                  of friendship don’t end with you; and in testing your friend, you’re also
                  testing yourself. As you assimilate the qualities of an admirable friend, you
                  become the sort of person who can offer admirable friendship to others. Again,
                  it’s like practicing under a good piano teacher. As you improve as a pianist,
                  you’re not the only one who can enjoy your playing. The better you get, the
                  more joy you bring to others. The better you understand the process of playing,
                  the more effectively you can teach anyone who sincerely wants to learn from
                  you. This is how teaching lineages of high caliber get established for the
                  benefit of the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>So when you look for an admirable friend, you’re tapping into a long
                  lineage of admirable friends, stretching back to the Buddha, and helping it to
                  extend into the future. Joining this lineage may require accepting some
                  uncomfortable truths, such as the need to learn from criticism and to take
                  responsibility for your actions. But if you’re up for the challenge, you learn
                  to take this human power of judgment—which, when untrained, can so easily cause
                  harm—and train it for the greater good.</span></p>
