            <div class='col-md body'>from my archive:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In the Wei Shi Consciousness-only School, each of our eight consciousnesses is also classified into Mutual-division (form)'xiang fen', Observing-division 'jian fen', Self-verifying-division 'zi zhen fen'(aka a confused Buddhanature) and Verifying Self-verifying-division (aka True Mind or Enlightened Buddha Nature). Manas Consciousness  attach to a self, due to the "observing-division" of the Alaya Consciousness  The Self-verifying-division and Verifying Self-verifying-division are mutually related. If the Self-verifying-division is an Object of Operation, the Verifying Self-verifying-division becomes the Operative. And vice versa. Existence actually does not hold a 'self', but due to a strong attachment of "self" in the deluded Manas Consciousness, it truly become a self and that of self-possessions/views. Alaya (8th) is the container of the lower 7, as all the karmic seeds of the lower 7 go back to the 8th. If we can realize that the root-self, instrumental world and karmic seeds are just projections of the Thus Come One, Tathagatagarbha, and that all phenomenon are like dream/delusions, and not self can attain, then all will return to Tathagatagarbha.</span><br><br>---<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good analogy.
