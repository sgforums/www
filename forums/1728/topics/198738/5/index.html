Remember a time when you were very angry. How did "I" appear then? It seems very solid - as if there is a real me that someone is insulting. That "I" feels real, as if it were independent, yet still somewhere inside our body and Mind. We get angry in order to defend that "I" that seems so real. If that solid, independent "I" exists as it appears to us, we should be able to find it, either among our body and Mind or separate from them. There is no other place such an "I" could be. Let's see. Are you your body?<br><br>Aud: Yes.<br><br>Ven: Which part of your body are you? Are you your arm? Your chest? Your little toe? your brain? It's clear that we aren't any of the parts of our body. Let's try again. Are you your Mind?<br><br>Aud: I must be.<br><br>Ven: Which Mind are you? Are you your visual consciousness? Your auditory consciousness? Your mental consciousness? Are you one particular characteristic? If you were your angry self, you would always be angry!<br><br>Aud: "I" am what goes from one life to the next.<br><br>Ven: But what goes from one life to the next is constantly changing. Can you point to one moment of your Mind that always has been and always will be you? Are you yesterday's Mind? Today's Mind? Tomorrow's Mind?<br><br>Aud: I'm all of them together.<br><br>Ven: But that's a collection of parts, none of which are "I". To say that is "I" is like saying a group of grasshoppers are a butterfly.<br><br>Maybe you're completely separate from your body and Mind. That is, can you take away your body and Mind and you ("I") still remain independently? If the "I" is separate from the body and Mind, my body and Mind could be here and I could be across the room. Is that possible?<br><br>The "I" or self doesn't exist independently of the body and Mind. It is not the body and it is not the Mind. Neither is it the body and Mind together. In other words, the solid "I" that we felt when we're angry doesn't exist at all. What we are negating is its independent or inherent existence. There a conventionally existent "I" that is angry and that "I" does not exists independently.<br><br>The "I" depends on causes and conditions the coming together of the sperm and egg of our parents, our consciousness from a precious life and so on. The "I" also depends on the parts, which compose it: our body and Mind. The "I" also depends on concept and label. That is, on the basis of our body and Mind being together, we conceive of a person and label it "I". We exist by being merely labeled on a suitable basis - our body and Mind.</span><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

They recollected that since time without beginning, they had strayed from their fundamental true mind by mistakenly taking the shadows of the differentiations of conditioned defilements to be real. Now on this day as they awakened, they were each like a lost infant who suddenly finds its beloved mother. They put their palms together to make obeisance to the Buddha.<br><strong>They wished to hear the Thus Come One enlighten them to the dual nature of body and mind, of what is false, of what is true, of what is empty and what is existent, and of what is subject to production and extinction and what transcends production and extinction.</strong><br>Then King Prasenajit rose and said to the Buddha, "In the past, when I had not yet received the teachings of the Buddha, I met Katyayana and Vairatiputra, both of whom said that this body ends at death, and that this is Nirvana.  Now, although I have met the Buddha, I still wonder about that. <strong>How can I go about realizing the mind at the level of no production and no extinction?</strong> Now all in this Great Assembly who still have outflows also wish to be instructed on this subject."<br>The Buddha said to the great king, "LetÂ’s talk about your body as it is right now. Now I ask you, will your physical body be like vajra, indestructible and living forever?  Or will it change and go bad?"<br>"World Honored One, this body of mine will keep changing until it eventually perishes."<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Buddha said, "Great king, you have not yet perished.  How do you know you will perish?"<br>"World Honored One, although my impermanent, changing, and decaying body has not yet become extinct, I observe it now, as every passing thought fades away.  Each new one fails to remain, but is gradually extinguished like fire turning wood to ashes. This ceaseless extinguishing convinces me that this body will eventually completely perish."<br>The Buddha said, "So it is."</span><br>"Great king, at your present age you are already old and declining.  How does your appearance and complexion compare to when you were a youth?"<br>"World Honored One, in the past when I was young my skin was moist and shining.

They recollected that since time without beginning, they had strayed from their fundamental true mind by mistakenly taking the shadows of the differentiations of conditioned defilements to be real. Now on this day as they awakened, they were each like a lost infant who suddenly finds its beloved mother. They put their palms together to make obeisance to the Buddha.<br>[b]They wished to hear the Thus Come One enlighten them to the dual nature of body and mind, of what is false, of what is true, of what is empty and what is existent, and of what is subject to production and extinction and what transcends production and extinction.</span></strong><br>Then King Prasenajit rose and said to the Buddha, "In the past, when I had not yet received the teachings of the Buddha, I met Katyayana and Vairatiputra, both of whom said that this body ends at death, and that this is Nirvana.  Now, although I have met the Buddha, I still wonder about that. <strong>How can I go about realizing the mind at the level of no production and no extinction?</strong> Now all in this Great Assembly who still have outflows also wish to be instructed on this subject."<br>The Buddha said to the great king, "LetÂ’s talk about your body as it is right now. Now I ask you, will your physical body be like vajra, indestructible and living forever?  Or will it change and go bad?"<br>"World Honored One, this body of mine will keep changing until it eventually perishes."<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Buddha said, "Great king, you have not yet perished.  How do you know you will perish?"<br>"World Honored One, although my impermanent, changing, and decaying body has not yet become extinct, I observe it now, as every passing thought fades away.  Each new one fails to remain, but is gradually extinguished like fire turning wood to ashes.
