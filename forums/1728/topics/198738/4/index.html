It is something that i will like to hear from others as well.<br><br>from my understanding, ..<br><br>everything is in a constant state of change. Our thoughts, emotions, body are manifestation of essense(presence). However, presence and the manifestions are not 2 thing. They are the same thing, just in different states.  The various states of consciousness are all different states of Presence.<br><br>The world that we perceive is an illusionary world(insubstantial) that is thought construct. Our 'sense of self' is also thought construct. The impression of a 'self' perceiving and interacting with the world and others is also a thought construct. However, this  does not mean that others do not exist. Perhaps we can say that all that we percieve are various manifestion of Presence... your true 'self' so to speak.<br><br>I do not really understand 'emptiness'... but my take is that it is refering to the lack of object and solidity of reality. When we talk about objects we are defining something that is contained and with boundaries. Like a cup is the shape of a cup. However, in reality, boundary is a concept of the mind that say that this 'shape' is a cup. This is conceptual, in actuality the thinking mind defined this shape as cup. IMO, this conceptuality is also a though construct.<br><br>just my opinion. nothing definitive  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Due to insulting Dalai Lama in the past, he got kicked out of Sera Monastery, and later formed the New Kadampa Tradition. _Wanderer_ has advised that we should be wary of NKT materials and books.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eternal Now,<br>Thank-you for the warning about the NKT.  I realised about the issues with this group earlier in the year and stopped attending their meditation classes as a result.  However, I have to say that although these issues may be sources of real concern, they did give me good, helpful meditation classes and advice for several years, and encourage me in the way of Buddhism.  I have not had any bad experiences of them and I think they are genuinely practising the Dharma (although I will not be involved with them again because of my respect for the Dalai Lama).<br><br>Everyone,<br>Coming back to my question - is the "mental continuum" also known as "subtle mind" or is this something else?  What is this "permanent thing" with the karmic imprints?</div>

It is something that i will like to hear from others as well.<br><br>from my understanding, ..<br><br>everything is in a constant state of change. Our thoughts, emotions, body are manifestation of essense(presence). However, presence and the manifestions are not 2 thing. They are the same thing, just in different states.  The various states of consciousness are all different states of Presence.<br><br>The world that we perceive is an illusionary world(insubstantial) that is thought construct. Our 'sense of self' is also thought construct. The impression of a 'self' perceiving and interacting with the world and others is also a thought construct. However, this  does not mean that others do not exist. Perhaps we can say that all that we percieve are various manifestion of Presence... your true 'self' so to speak.<br><br>I do not really understand 'emptiness'... but my take is that it is refering to the lack of object and solidity of reality. When we talk about objects we are defining something that is contained and with boundaries. Like a cup is the shape of a cup. However, in reality, boundary is a concept of the mind that say that this 'shape' is a cup. This is conceptual, in actuality the thinking mind defined this shape as cup. IMO, this conceptuality is also a though construct.<br><br>just my opinion. nothing definitive  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Hi longchen,<br><br>What you said is one aspect of emptiness -- the emptiness of self, you may want to explore into another aspect of emptiness, arising without a point of origination, without a point of centricity.  However without certain stability in the experience of no-self (anatta) in all entry and exit points (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, mind), this aspect of Emptiness can only be appreciated conceptually; it will not be understood intuitively. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Happy Journey. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
