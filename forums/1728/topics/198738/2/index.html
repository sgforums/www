            <div class='col-md body'>Page 142 &amp; 143, <span style="font-style: italic;">'Buddhism Plain &amp; Simple'</span>'<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Nagarjuna, the brilliant Buddhist philosopher of second-century India, wrote,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Those who do not understand the distinction between [the] two truths do not understand the profound truth embodied in the Buddha's message.</span><br><br>These two truths are relative truth and Absolute Truth.<br><br>Relative truths are the day-to-day things and thoughts we can easily discuss, teach, sell and conceptualise. These include simple facts - a foot is twelve inches, oranges contain vitamin C, Mount McKinley is in North America. But feet, inches, oranges, rocks, birds, feelings and thoughts, are themselves also relative truths. Each one depends on a vast multiplicity of other things, other concepts, other relative truths for its existence - an existence which is, of course, one hundred percent conceptual.<br><br>Relative truths are the concepts we use to get an easy handle on the world. They help us in our everyday lives with a huge variety of practical matters. But the more closely we look at them, the less Real they show themselves to be.<br><br>Nevertheless, relative truths aren't to be avoided. They're not necessarily evil, or harmful, or wrong. Indeed, they're essential. In order to get through the day, we need to know things - telephone numbers, store hours, potatoes, growing seasons, fractions, love, speed limits, how to fasten shoes. We run into trouble when we forget that all these things, thoughts, and feelings. When we refer to "this book,Â” that is a relative truth. And we've already seen that the more closely we examine what "the book" is, the more we can't pin it down, and the more the "truth" of it dissipates like a morning mist after sunrise.<br><br>Relative truths are why we fight wars, why we fear people who aren't like us, and why we debate the abortion question but comes no closer to a resolution of it.<br><br>Ultimate Truth, on the other hand, is direct perception. And what is directly perceived (as opposed to conceive) is that no separate, individualised things exist as such. There's nothing to be experienced but this seamless, thoroughgoing relativity and flux.<br><br>In other words, there are no particulars, but only <span style="font-style: italic;">thus</span>.<br></div><div class="quote_body">Ultimate Truth can't be conceptualised or imagined. You cannot hold Ultimate Truth in your mind at all. You can only <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> it. You just can't hold It as an idea.<br><br>Ultimate Truth appears the same to all who <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span>. It can't be countered or doubted or discounted because it is immediate, direct experience itself. It's not other-dependent. It has no "other." What's ultimately True can't be held in opposition to something else.<br><br>We can actually <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> this. We can (and, in fact, we do) <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> for ourselves, right now, Ultimate Truth, and Reality.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, I decided to share more. Continued from page 143:<br><br><blockquote>Ignorance is not the inability to <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span>, but the act of ignoring what is really going on in favour of what we imagine. The nature of ignorance is like this. Consider a concave line like the one on the next page.<br><br>At this point you probably think of the line on the next page as concave because that's how I identified it - and, perhaps, because of the way it's oriented on the page. But there's nothing inherently concave about it. It could just as easily be considered convex. Just turn the book upside down. Indeed, if you draw a single concave line, you've also drawn a convex one.<br><br>[image of a concave line]<br><br>Our state of ignorance is analogous to noting only the concave and not taking into account the convex. We forget - or ignore - the fact that whenever we come up with any concept at all, we simultaneously create one or more opposite concepts. Each relative truth engenders other opposite relative truths. And if we take the opposing concepts for reality, they will inevitably cause misery.<br><br>Consider this well-known Zen story.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A monk as Tung Shan, "When cold and heat come upon us, how can we avoid them?"<br><br>Shan said, "Why don't you go to where there is no cold or heat?"<br><br>The monk said, "Where is there no cold or heat?"<br><br>Shan said, "When cold, let cold kill you; when hot, let hot kill you."</span><br><br>If you draw the one, you've drawn the other. If you feel one, you feel the other, If you identify one, you've identified the other - and the world "out there" in relation to it.<br><br>Reality, of course, is neither concave nor convex, neither cold nor hot, neither self nor other. If we conceive cold apart from the rest of Reality - not only apart from heat, but apart from ourselves as well - we suffer from it.<br><br>We ignore Wholeness because we're so fixed on our object - the thing we've drawn, the thing we feel, the thing we've identified. But we ignore the fact that whatever our object is not is present as well. By splitting Reality into parts, and then focusing on the single part, we've tuned out the Whole. We've set ourselves up for confusion and despair.<br><br>---------<br>page 145<br><br>When buddhas look at the world, they don't <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> solidity. They don't <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> selves. They <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> only flux.<br><br>This is not to say that the awakened no longer see forms like the rest of us. They do. But they <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> forms - or, rather, "formness" - as illusory. They <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> that all things arise together. They <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> that the apparent existence of anything is dependant on all that it is not. And they <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> this dependence as nothing other than change and motion themselves.<br><br>The Buddha called this phenomena dependant arising. Dependant arising is the formula, "When this arise, that becomes." When the days lengthen, spring flowers bloom. When days shorten, autumn colours appear and leaves fall from the trees. Spring flowers are inseparable from lengthening days; autumn colours are inseparable from days of less and less light. Indeed, spring flowers <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> the longer days; fall colours <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> the shorter days. In reality, all phenomena work together as a seamless whole.<br><br>Dependent arising is not vague, mystical, remote, intellectual stuff. The Buddha-dharma is very practical and down-to-earth. Just pay very close attention to your actual experience, and you'll <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> it for yourself.<br>----<br>page 147:<br><br>Our chronic problem has to do with intention. Because we ignore the Whole, we're taken in by the parts. We're seduced by the objects of our consciousness - our concepts - and, with longing and loathing, greed and anger, our minds start to lean toward and away. This is duhkha.<br><br>There's a way out of this dilemma. It's simply to watch your own mind, and <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> when it's leaning.<br><br>Earlier we visualised a leaf falling from a tree. We "saw" it land within a pattern of leaves upon the ground. While it's a pattern we cannot replicate by a simple act of will, nature has no trouble producing random patterns at all. What controls the placement of leaves in an utterly random way, yielding a pattern that is so strikingly beautiful? The Whole, of course.<br><br>We can't know all the details of the Whole. For example, if we knew everything about the weather system on this planet, we would be able to accurately predict the weather over an extended period. But to do this we would have to know every little detail, right down to the positions and movements of each atom - and, of course, we can't do that. Natural systems, like our planet's weather, are and will always be under the control of the intentionless Whole.<br><br>but while we can't know the details of the Whole, the fact that we - each one of us - already <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> the Whole itself. There's nothing mysterious about Reality - <span style="font-style: italic;">thus</span> - at all. It is ever-present, clear, and obvious. Rather than trying to figure something out, trying to <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span>, or trying to reunite with the Whole, all we have to do is to notice whether our mind is leaning or not.<br><br>When you notice that your mind is caught up in longing and loathing - leaning toward or away from something - don't try to stop it from leaning. As we've seen, trying to make a leaning mind stop leaning is just another form of leaning. ("I really want to not have a leaning mind." ) Just be aware when your mind is leaning, and realise what leaning of mind actually is. With practice and attention to this moment. your mind will, of its own accord, lean less.<br><br>As a leaf lands in the yard, so your mind will straighten up in a most natural way, and accord with Mind Itself - that is, the Whole.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding Nirvana - page 46:<br><br><blockquote>Some people think the teaching of the awakened is nihilistic, as if it asserts a kind of nothingness. As if, somehow, nirvana is lapsing into a tranquil oblivion, a floating grayness, drifting in a shoreless sea. That is not nirvana.<br><br>Recall that everything we see, hear, feel, and think is constant flux and change. Nothing endures. We long for permanence and as a result we suffer, we find none. There seems to be only this coming and going, coming and going, this unending arising and ceasing.<br><br>We experience everything as motion. Indeed, physicists tell us that matter is literally nothing but motion. And no matter how we look at it, at any scale, our experience is always of motion, of change. This is true of everything in the physical world, including our bodies. Every cell - indeed, every atom of every cell - reveals nothing but ceaseless coming and going. Our bodies are re-made moment by moment, and in no two moments are they the same.<br><br>The same is true of our minds. The contents of our minds are in constant motion as well. Thoughts, feelings, judgements, and impulses arise, one after another, then bloom and fade away like flowers after their season.<br><br>Nirvana is <span style="font-style: italic;">seeing</span>, thoroughly and completely, that this is so.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When we say 'Empty', it does not mean that phenomenal world is empty and there is an opposite, an inherently existence essence that is not affected by the phenomenal world, some sort of 'Amness' that is inherently existent. Or Spirit. Or Mind. Even that is Empty by nature. That is why Thusness says, those who have certain experiences of 'Amness' have even greater difficulty to comprehend Emptiness because of a subtle attachment to their experience as truly inherently existent. We talk about 'Buddha Nature' as 'Luminosity and Emptiness inseperable'. So even Buddha Nature is empty by nature. ALL is Buddha Nature, all is Empty and Luminous.<br><br>This is what sets Buddhism different compared to other contemplative traditions.</div>
