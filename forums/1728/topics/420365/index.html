              <div class="post-body entry-content">If you are really intelligent, you will understand the meaning of this 
              title automatically and need nothing further. When I first read this 
              book, back in 1987, back in the days of the Harmonic Convergence and so 
              on, I had no clue what it meant, I was suspicious that it might be some 
              new age book. And when I first read about "self-liberation" I was 
              confused since I thought this was a book about Tibetan Buddhism. Well, I
               have learned a lot since then.<br> <br>

              <div style="text-align: left;">This book was the book 
              that broke the ice of the Dzogchen teachings in the Western World. Prior
               to the publication of this book, there were no accessible, easy to 
              understand, writings about Dzogchen for the general reader. Even though 
              this book is accessible, its contents are nonetheless profound and lay 
              out the context of the Dzogchen teachings in a clear manner. </div>
              <br> Chogyal Namkhai Norbu has done more to bring the teachings of the three 
              series of Dzogchen to the West than any master before him, or since. He 
              has tirelessly circled the globe times beyond count teaching Dzogchen in
               nearly every major capital of the world in Asia, Europe, North and 
              South America and Australia.<br> <br> He has labored over the years to clarify that the teaching of Dzogchen, 
              the great perfection, is an independent Buddhist vehicle, a 
              self-sufficient means to total liberation, one capable of taking a 
              complete beginner to the stage of the final liberation into the body of 
              light in a single lifetime.<br> <br> Masters such as Chogyal Namkhai Norbu are termed "second Vajrasattvas" 
              in the terminology of the teachings of the great perfection. We find 
              ourselves very fortunate indeed that Norbu Rinpoche chose to teach 
              Dzogchen to willing students.<br> <br> Beyond Norbu Rinpoche's Dharma teachings, his commitment to preserving 
              and fostering Tibetan culture is without parallel, having formed 
              A.S.I.A, which funds the building of schools, hospitals and so on in 
              Tibet and the Himalayas and Shang Shung Institute, which sponsors the 
              first school of Tibetan Medicine in a Western Country, among other 
              projects.<br> <br> As for Rinpoche's other activities, many people are largely unaware that
               Norbu Rinpoche has been busy with preparations of critical editions of 
              the most important primary texts of the Dzogchen tradition. These texts,
               when published, will undoubtedly set the foundation for much future 
              translation work.<br> <br> Those of us who are students of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu are fortunate 
              indeed to have been graced to be in the presence of this master. Another
               great, if largely unknown, master of the Dzogchen teachings, Kunzang 
              Dechen Lingpa, stated that Chogyal Namkhai Norbu was an "inconceivable" 
              master of the Dzogchen teachings.  Despite the presence in the West of 
              such luminaries as HH Dudjom Rinpoche, HH Dilgo Khyentse, and so on, in 
              my opinion there has never been a master quite like Chogyal Namkhai 
              Norbu in the West, and there is likely never to be another master quite 
              like him again for the foreseeable future.<br> <br> I recommend therefore, that those who have yet to meet him in person and
               receive the blessings of hearing him teach Dzogchen should do so right 
              away. As Norbu Rinpoche himself is fond of saying, "Everything is in 
              time, and time is passing..."<br> <br> May the life force of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu be firm, may his wishes be 
              accomplished without effort, may the dakinis and dharmapalas guard him 
              from every obstacle, may his teachings spread throughout the whole 
              world, ensuring the ripe harvest of happiness, dharma, prosperity and 
              good fortune for all sentient beings.<br> <br> Sarvamaá¹…galaá¹ƒ</div>
