              <h2><a name="Introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
              <p>Burma is one of the few countries in the world where <em>Theravada </em> Buddhism 
                  still survives in its original form. The <em>bhikkhus </em>(monks) of Burma 
                  make every effort to preserve the <em>Theravada </em>Buddhist teachings. Buddha 
                  Gotamaâ€™s Teachings deal mainly with the way the human mind works and 
                  the relationship between the mind and body. The nature of the human mind has 
                  not changed since the Buddha discovered the path leading to the understanding 
                  of the absolute truth about mind and matter. This ultimate reality and the 
                  practice leading to its realization are, and will always remain, the same, 
                  regardless of economic or social conditions, so people today who put into 
                  practice what the Buddha taught can discover this reality for themselves. 
                  If one aspires to the end of suffering as taught by the Buddha, it is essential 
                  not to add or subtract anything from his teachings, in order that they will 
                  remain as effective today as they were during the time of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>The foundation of the teachings is the Four Noble Truths:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> the truth that all conditioned phenomena (physical and mental) are unsatisfactory; </li>
              <li> the truth that there is a cause for this; </li>
              <li> the truth that there is an end to this unsatisfactoriness or suffering; 
                    and </li>
              <li> the truth that there is a path leading to the end of suffering. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>The path to the end of suffering is called the Eightfold Noble Path as it 
                  is divided into eight parts which are grouped under the threefold training 
                  of <em>sila </em>(morality), <em>samadhi </em>(control over the mind, concentration), 
                  and <em>panna </em>(insight, wisdom).</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, morality is conceived differently than in the Judeo-Christian 
                  tradition. There are actions which are called skilful, because they support 
                  an individual's progress towards <em>Nibbana, </em>and there are unskilful actions 
                  which have the contrary effect. All actions based on greed, aversion, and 
                  ignorance of the Law of <em>Kamma </em>are unskilful.</p>
              <p>The most unskilful actions are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> to kill a sentient being; </li>
              <li> to steal; </li>
              <li> to have unlawful sexual relations; </li>
              <li> to speak untruth; and </li>
              <li> to take intoxicants. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Generally the Buddhist lay person undertakes to abstain from these five 
                  courses of action by taking the five precepts.</p>
              <p>Once an action has been done there is no way to avoid its effect. The effects 
                  can be minimized through the awareness of impermanence, which is the object 
                  of insight meditation, or they can be counteracted to some extent through 
                  a powerful action of the opposite type.[1] There is, however, no one, not 
                  even the Buddha, who can give an "absolution from sin", as effects 
                  are determined by the Law of <em>Kamma, </em>which is applicable to all sentient 
                  beings.</p>
              <p>Ven. Webu Sayadaw emphasized the practice of meditation as the only way 
                  to bring the teachings of the Buddha to fulfilment. The study of the scriptures, 
                  though helpful, is not essential for the realization of <em>Nibbana, </em> the 
                  summum bonum of Buddhism. Ven. Webu Sayadaw was believed to be an <em>Arahat, </em>i.e., a person who has in practice understood the Four Noble Truths and 
                  attained the end of suffering.</p>
              <p>The technique of meditation taught by Ven. Webu Sayadaw is one of forty 
                  techniques mentioned in the scriptures for the development of samadhi or concentration. 
                  It is called <em>Anapana-sati </em>and requires one to be aware:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> that he is breathing in while he is breathing in; </li>
              <li> that he is breathing out while he is breathing out; and </li>
              <li> of the spot or area in the region of the nostrils where the stream of 
                    air touches while he is breathing in and out. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>In the <em>Visuddhimagga[2] </em>Ashin Buddhaghosa describes sixteen ways 
                  of approaching <em>Anapana </em>meditation, but Ven. Webu Sayadaw kept reminding 
                  his disciples that they did not need to know about all of these, all they 
                  really needed to know was the reality of in- and out-breathing.</p>
              <p>Though <em>Anapana </em>is basically a way of developing <em>samatha </em> (tranquillity 
                  of mind), <em>samadhi </em>(concentration of mind to one-pointedness) and <em>jhana </em>(absorption states), Ven. Webu Sayadaw said that when concentration is 
                  developed to a sufficient degree, the meditator automatically gains insight 
                  into the three characteristics of nature,<em> anicca, dukkha,</em> and <em>anatta, </em>if his mind is open to recognize them. <em>Anicca </em>means "impermanence" 
                  or "instability", "change", and is characteristic of all 
                  conditioned phenomena, be they physical or mental. <em>Dukkha </em>denotes the 
                  unsatisfactory nature of all these phenomena: nothing that is impermanent 
                  or changing can ever give lasting satisfaction. <em>Anatta </em>means non-self, 
                  non-soul, and applies to all phenomena conditioned and unconditioned.</p>
              <p>According to the Buddha, there is no permanent ego, soul or personal entity, 
                  but only physical and mental phenomena interrelating. In Buddhism the understanding 
                  of these three characteristics of <em>anicca, dukkha,</em> and <em>anatta </em>is 
                  called <em>panna </em>or wisdom and <em>panna </em>is the quality which enables 
                  a meditator to reach <em>Nibbana. </em></p>
              <p>It is significant that a monk of such high standing as Ven. Webu Sayadaw, 
                  rather than teach <em>Abhidhamma </em>philosophy which is intellectually fascinating 
                  and taxing, should spend his life teaching the basics of practical Buddhism 
                  to all who are inclined to listen. U Hte Hlain, the collector of some of the 
                  discourses contained in this book, writes:"Ven. Webu Sayadaw preached 
                  sometimes five, sometimes ten times a day. Seven main points were always included 
                  in his discourses. If Ven. Webu Sayadaw gave 10,000 discourses in his life, 
                  then these points were expounded by him 10,000 times. He always included them, 
                  even if he had to repeat them again and again. He always explained the teachings 
                  in simple terms, so that the ordinary person could understand. He tried to 
                  explain the Dhamma in such a way that the most difficult thing became easy."</p>
              <p>The seven Points are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> One can only expect the fulfilment of one's aspirations if one is perfect 
                    in morality. </li>
              <li> When practising generosity <em>(dana) </em>in the religion of the Buddha, 
                    the mental attitude and volition involved are very important. </li>
              <li> Believing in the law of cause and effect (i.e., the Law of <em>Kamma) </em>one should always act with a upright mind. </li>
              <li> One should not aspire to any happiness of either the human or celestial 
                    worlds which are impermanent but only to <em>Nibbana. </em> </li>
              <li> Because of the arising of the Buddha we have the opportunity to practise 
                    right conduct <em>(carana) </em>and wisdom <em>(panna) </em>fully and therefore 
                    benefit greatly. </li>
              <li> from the moment we are born to the moment we die, there is the in-breath 
                    and the out-breath. This is easy for everybody to understand. Every time 
                    we breathe in or out, the breath touches near the nostrils. Every time it 
                    touches we should be aware of it. </li>
              <li> While we are walking, working, doing anything, we should always be aware 
                    of the in- and out-breath. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>These seven points illustrate that in practical Buddhism faith does not 
                  play such a major role. Paramount importance is given to right action and 
                  the experience and understanding drawn from it. As we shall see in the discourses, 
                  Ven. Webu Sayadaw wants his audience to realize the teachings through their 
                  own experience, for themselves, rather than through hearing them, and he says 
                  that in this way, as they begin to see the teachings as a reality, people 
                  can pass beyond doubt.</p>
              <p>Ven. Webu Sayadaw was born on the sixth day of the waxing moon of Tabaung 
                  of the year 1257 (Burmese Era) (February 17, 1896) in Ingyinbin, a small village 
                  near Shwebo in upper Burma. He was ordained as a novice at the age of nine 
                  and was given the name Shin Kumara. All boys in Buddhist Burma become novices 
                  at their local monastery at some time in their teens or even earlier, but 
                  usually return home after a predetermined span of time. Shin Kumara, however, 
                  decided to stay at the monastery to receive a religious education. At the 
                  age of twenty, he was ordained as a full member of the <em>Sangha, </em>the 
                  Buddhist order of monks, receiving the <em>Upasampada </em>ordination, and was 
                  thereafter addressed as U Kumara.[3]</p>
              <p>U Kumara went to Mandalay to study at the famous Masoyein monastery, the 
                  leading monastic university of the time. In the seventh year after his full 
                  ordination, he abandoned the study of the <em>Pali </em>scriptures and left 
                  the monastery to put into practice what he had learned about meditation.</p>
              <p>Buddhist monks can choose between two activities: the study of the scriptures 
                  <em>(pariyatti), </em>or the practice of Buddhist meditation <em>(patipatti). </em> While scholarly monks tend to live in centres of learning in order to 
                  be able to pass on their knowledge to younger monks, meditating monks leave 
                  the busy atmosphere of the monasteries to retire to a solitary life in the 
                  jungle. They often live in caves or simply under trees and come into contact 
                  with people only on the occasion of their morning alms-rounds.</p>
              <p>After leaving the Masoyein monastery in Mandalay at the age of twenty-seven, 
                  U Kumara spent four years in solitude. Then he went to his native village 
                  of Ingyinbin for a brief visit. His former teacher at the village monastery 
                  requested U Kumara to teach him the technique of meditation he had adopted 
                  and U Kamara did so. "This is a shortcut to <em>Nibbana," </em> he 
                  said, "anyone can use it. It stands up to investigation and is in accordance 
                  with the teachings of the Buddha as conserved in the scriptures. It is the 
                  straight path to <em>Nibbana." </em></p>
              <p>There is a set of thirteen practices called the <em>dhutanga[4] </em>that 
                  are often taken up by monks living in solitude. They are designed to combat 
                  laziness and indulgence. One is never to lie down, not even to sleep. Monks 
                  taking up this particular practice spend the nights sitting and meditating 
                  or walking and meditating to rid themselves of sleepiness. The thirteen <em>dhutanga </em>may be taken up individually or together.</p>
              <p>Ven. Webu Sayadaw is said to have followed this practice of never lying 
                  down all his life. He taught that effort was the key to success, not only 
                  in worldly undertakings, but also in meditation, and that sleeping was a waste 
                  of time. I was told by one of his disciples that on the occasion of his ordination 
                  under Ven. Webu Sayadaw, he had a mosquito net and a pillow, in addition to 
                  the monks requisites. Ven. Webu Sayadaw, pointing at them, asked him what 
                  they were. "A pillow and a mosquito net, sir." "Are these part 
                  of the monks requisites?"[5] "No, sir." And the newly ordained 
                  monk decided to give these "luxuries" back to his family.</p>
              <p>Ven. Webu Sayadaw undertook pilgrimages to the Buddhist sites of India and 
                  of Ceylon. He passed away on June 26, 1977, in the meditation centre at Ingyinbin, 
                  his native village.</p>

              <h3><a name="Setting"> The Setting </a></h3>
              <p>Most of these discourses were given before large audiences during Ven. Webu 
                  Sayadaw's travels in lower Burma. The person or persons answering Ven. Webu 
                  Sayadaw are lay-people sitting up front and close to him.</p>
              <p>Some of the discourses are translated from a collection of discourses collected 
                  and introduced by U Hte Hlain and published by the Ministry of Religious Affairs 
                  of Burma. Others have been transcribed from tape by the translator and then 
                  rendered in English.</p>
              <p>Because they were delivered extemporaneously the discourses are repetitive 
                  and were edited slightly so that they lend themselves better to reading. Care 
                  was taken, however, to edit only obvious repetitions and only when they had 
                  merely rhetorical value. The reader may still find the discourses repetitive, 
                  but with some patience and "mindfulness" he will discover in them 
                  many insights into practical Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Ven. Webu Sayadaw was not a scholar and his discourses are not meant for 
                  the intellectual who prefers the study of Buddhist philosophy to the practice. 
                  His refreshing simplicity, his patience, his lovely sense of humour, and his 
                  humility; all of which are revealed in the dialogues with his audience - illumine 
                  a side of Buddhism which cannot be perceived through reading treatises and 
                  texts. Moreover, the statements of the people in the audience offer us a glimpse 
                  of how Buddhism is practised in Burma today.</p>

              <p>To understand the discourses, the reader should be familiar with some basic 
                  teachings of Buddhism. The explanations given or the points selected for explanation 
                  do not attempt to give a complete picture of the teachings of the Buddha, 
                  but they should enable the reader to understand the discourses included in 
                  this collection.</p>
              <p>The <em>Theravada </em>Buddhist scriptures can be divided into "Three 
                  <em>(ti) </em>Baskets <em>(pitaka)" </em>and are therefore called the <em>Tipitaka </em>in <em>Pali, </em>the language in which they were originally written.</p>
              <p>The three baskets are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> <em>Vinaya-pitaka: </em>The books of monastic discipline. </li>
              <li> <em>Suttanta-pitaka: </em>The books of discourses of the Buddha and his 
                    major disciples. </li>
              <li> <em>Abhidhamma-pitaka: </em>the books of ultimate truths; an analysis of 
                    physical and mental phenomena into their ultimate components. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Scholarly training <em>(pariyatti) </em>in <em>Theravada </em>Buddhism consists 
                  of the study of these scriptures. Practical training <em>(patipatti), </em>with 
                  which these discourses mainly deal, is concerned with the practice of <em>sila </em>(morality), <em>samadhi </em> (concentration) and <em>panna </em>(insight) 
                  and culminates in the attaining of the four stages of Nibbana <em>(pativedha). </em></p>
              <p>The word <em>Dhamma </em>can have many different meanings, but in the context 
                  of these discourses it is always used as meaning the teachings of the Buddha.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/CY_BALL.GIF" alt="" width="17" height="16" align="top"> <strong>Sila:</strong> For the monks, the training in morality consists of the observance of 227 
                  rules. The collection of these rules is called the <em>Patimokkha </em>and is 
                  part of the <em>Vinaya. </em></p>
              <p>Lay-people have to observe five or eight rules of training: the Five <em>silas 
                  (panca-sila),</em> or the Eight <em>silas (Uposatha-sila). </em></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>Panca-sila: </em>
              <p>Â </p>
              <ol>
              <li> to abstain from killing any living being; </li>
              <li> to abstain from taking what is not given; </li>
              <li> to abstain from sexual misconduct; </li>
              <li> to abstain from telling untruths; </li>
              <li> to abstain from intoxicating drink, drugs. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Â </p>
              </li>
              <li><em>Uposatha-sila: </em>

              </ul>
              <p>The field of <em>sila </em>is, of course, much wider. These precepts are 
                      but the absolute basics of Right Conduct <em>(carana) </em>a Buddhist layperson 
                      is expected to observe. The purpose of <em>sila </em>or <em>carana </em>is 
                      to bring physical and verbal action under control.</p>
              </li>

              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/CY_BALL.GIF" alt="" width="17" height="16" align="top"> <strong>Samadhi: </strong></p>
              <p>Concentration of the mind and control over the mind. The Buddha taught forty 
                  techniques to achieve <em>samadhi, </em>of which <em>Anapana </em>is one. The 
                  Buddha taught that <em>sila</em> is a prerequisite for <em>samadhi. </em></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/CY_BALL.GIF" alt="" width="17" height="16" align="top"> <strong>Panna:</strong></p>
              <p><em>Panna, </em>the understanding through personal experience of the characteristics 
                  which the Buddha said were in the nature of all conditioned things, i.e., 
                  <em>anicca</em> (impermanence), <em>dukkha </em>(unsatisfactoriness), and <em>anatta </em>(absence of a permanent personal entity such as an ego, self or soul), 
                  is achieved through <em>Vipassana </em>meditation. In <em>Vipassana </em>meditation 
                  the mind is set to a perfect state of balance, and then the mind's attention 
                  is projected to the changing nature <em>(anicca), </em>or the unsatisfactory 
                  nature <em>(dukkha), </em>or the impersonal nature <em>(anatta) </em>of all physical 
                  and mental phenomena.</p>
              <p><em>Sila, samadhi,</em> and <em>panna </em>are called the three <em>sikkhas, </em>the threefold training. In addition to this threefold division, we often 
                  also find a twofold one: 1) <em>carana: </em>Right Conduct <em>(sila); </em>and 
                  2) <em>bhavana: </em>mental development <em>(samadhi </em>and <em>panna). </em>Another 
                  method of enumeration is 1) <em>dana </em>(Generosity, otherwise included in 
                  <em>sila); </em>2) <em>sila, </em>and 3) <em>bhavana.</em></p>
              <p>What is normally called a being, i.e., Devas, Brahmas, humans, animals, 
                  etc., is seen in Buddhism as nothing but a combination and continuous arising 
                  and dissolution of mental and physical phenomena. "Mind" in <em>Pali </em>is <em>nama </em>and "matter" <em>rupa. </em></p>
              <p>Mind and matter <em>(nama and rupa)</em> are both impermanent or unstable. 
                  "But in expounding the theory of <em>anicca</em>, the Buddha started 
                  with the behaviour that makes matter, and matter as known to Buddha is very 
                  much smaller than the atom that science of today has discovered. The Buddha 
                  made it known to his disciples that everything that exists, be it animate 
                  or inanimate, is composed of <em>kalapas</em> (very much smaller than atoms), 
                  each dying out simultaneously as it becomes. Each <em>kalapa</em> is a mass 
                  formed of the eight nature elements, namely, solidity, liquidity, heat, motion, 
                  colour, odour, taste, and nutriment. The first four are called material qualities 
                  which are predominant in a <em>kalapa</em>. The other four are merely subsidiaries 
                  which are dependent upon and born out of the former. A <em>kalapa</em> is 
                  the minutest particle in the physical plane; still beyond the range of science 
                  today.</p>
              <p>"It is only when the eight nature elements (which have merely the characteristic 
                  of behaviour) are together that the entity of a <em>kalapa</em> is formed. 
                  In other words, the co-existence for a moment of these eight nature elements 
                  of behaviour makes a mass, just for a moment, which in Buddhism is known as 
                  a <em>kalapa</em>.[6]" A being is also defined as the coming together 
                  of the Five Aggregates <em>(panca khandha).</em> In this case, one aggregate 
                  is rupa or matter, while <em>nama</em> or mind is divided into four aggregates: 
                  1) <em>vinnana</em>: consciousness; 2) <em>sanna</em>: perception; 3) <em>vedana</em>: 
                  sensation, feeling; 4) <em>sankhara</em>: force of past action. (It can be 
                  seen from this that the term <em>nama</em> is wider than the English term 
                  mind.)</p>
              <p><em>Sankhara</em> (or <em>kamma</em> in popular terminology) is the force 
                  left behind by actions in the past, the "past" meaning here billions 
                  and billions of lives in <em>samsara</em>, the cycle of births and deaths. 
                  <em>Sankhara</em> causes us to experience sense impressions. What we see, 
                  hear, taste, smell, feel or think; in other words the contact of one of the 
                  six organs of sense with an object, (mind being regarded as an organ of sense); 
                  arises mainly because of the force of past <em>sankhara</em> or <em>kamma</em>. 
                  What is not necessarily connected with our past <em>kamma</em> is how we deal 
                  with these sense impressions.</p>
              <p>There are three possible ways of reacting to a sensory contact or sense 
                  impression: <em>kusala</em> (skilful reaction); <em>akusala</em> (unskilful 
                  reaction) and <em>abyakata</em>(neutral reaction). Practically speaking, neutral 
                  reaction is possible only for an Arahat, i.e, for someone who experiences 
                  no wanting <em>(lobha)</em> or dislike <em>(dosa)</em> and whose mind is not 
                  clouded by any form of delusion <em>(moha)</em> about the Four Noble Truths 
                  as taught by the Buddha. Every intelligent being, however, is capable of <em>kusala</em> rather than <em>akusala</em> reactions. In order to be able to react skilfully, 
                  one has to have control not only over one's physical and verbal actions, but 
                  also over one's mind. Every physical and verbal action begins in the mind 
                  and the action that results in <em>sankhara</em> or <em>kamma</em> is the 
                  mental volition accompanying this physical and verbal action.</p>
              <p>Initially Anapana meditation is but a tool to concentrate the mind. At this 
                  stage no attention is given to sensations, thoughts, emotions, and similar 
                  mental phenomena. The attention of the mind is meant to stay with the simple 
                  awareness of the physical touch of air brushing over the skin below the nose, 
                  above the upper lip. In this case the Three Unwholesome Roots, i.e., <em>lobha</em> (greed), <em>dosa</em> (anger, aversion), and <em>moha</em> (delusion), are 
                  held in abeyance and what is left are the Three Wholesome Roots: <em>alobha</em> (non-greed), <em>adosa</em> (non-anger), and <em>amoha</em> (knowledge, understanding). 
                  This momentary concentration of the mind on physical phenomena results in 
                  a temporary mental purity which in Buddhism is called <em>samadhi</em>.</p>
              <p>To come to a lasting purity of mind, according to Buddhism, matter and mental 
                  aggregates have to be observed in the light of their constant change <em>(anicca),</em> their unsatisfactoriness <em>(dukkha),</em> and the absence of an "I," 
                  a lasting personality or soul <em>(anatta).</em> By experiencing these haracteristics, 
                  or indeed, any one characteristic, a person can attain freedom from all attachment, 
                  and thus reach the end of suffering.</p>

              <h3><a name="Four">THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS</a></h3>
              <p>The Four Noble Truths so often referred to in the discourses are the following:</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <ol>
              <li> The Truth of Suffering <em>(dukkha);</em> </li>
              <li> The Truth of the Origin of Suffering <em>(samudaya);</em> </li>
              <li> The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering <em>(nirodha);</em> </li>
              <li> The Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation of Suffering <em>(magga).</em> </li>
              </ol>
              <p>The term <em>dukkha</em> is traditionally translated as "suffering" 
                  (and is the same term we rendered as "unsatisfactoriness" above). 
                  The Noble Truth of Suffering states that all conditioned states are unsatisfactory 
                  or connected with suffering. The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering declares 
                  the origin of suffering as being Craving <em>(lobha).</em> The Noble Truth 
                  of the Cessation of Suffering teaches that suffering ceases as soon as all 
                  craving ceases, i.e., when there is no wanting left, even of the most subtle 
                  type. The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering gives 
                  us the Noble Eightfold Path which consists of eight limbs arranged in three 
                  groups: <em>sila, samadhi</em> and <em>panna.</em></p>

              <h3><a name="Planes">THE THIRTY-ONE PLANES OF EXISTENCE </a></h3>
              <p>The Buddha taught that the universe is composed of innumerable world systems 
                  and each world system in turn is composed of thirty-one planes of existence.</p>
              <p>These are</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <dl><dd> Four <em>arupa</em> planes of Brahmas (these planes, where mind but no 
                    matter exists, are attained through the highest absorption states, <em>jhana</em>). </dd><dd> Sixteen Fine-material planes of Brahmas (attained through absorption 
                    states). </dd><dd> Six Deva planes (attained through the practice of <em>sila</em> and of 
                    generosity). </dd><dd> The human plane (attained through the practice of <em>sila</em> and of 
                    generosity). </dd><dd> Four Lower planes: Animals, Ghosts, Demons, Hell (attained through bad 
                    deeds). </dd></dl>
              <p>The thirty-one planes of existence are divided into three spheres <em>(loka):</em> the <em>arupa-loka,</em> which consists of the four highest Brahma planes; 
                  the <em>rupa-loka,</em> which consists of the remaining sixteen Brahma planes; 
                  and <em>the kama-loka,</em> which is the sphere of sensual desires <em>(kama)</em> and includes the four lower planes, the human plane and the six Deva planes.</p>
              <p>Beings are reborn in the different planes according to the mental action 
                  or <em>kamma</em> created at the moment of death <em>(cuti).</em> A good, 
                  pure mental action gives rise to a being in the human or Deva planes. The 
                  practice of the absorption states <em>(jhana)</em> leads to rebirth in the 
                  Brahma planes. If, at the moment of death, the mind is impure, i.e., clouded 
                  by anger, greed, fear, worry and similar conditions, the force produced by 
                  this impure mind will result in rebirth in one of the four lower planes of 
                  existence.</p>
              <p>What the mind perceives at the moment of death is a result of actions done 
                  in the past, i.e., <em>kamma.</em> The way an individual deals with this perception 
                  depends on his skill, in other words, on the amount of control he has over 
                  his mind. A person who has not reached one of the four stages of Nibbana cannot 
                  be sure what type of mind object will arise at the moment of death. In Buddhism, 
                  therefore, the training of the mind is deemed of paramount importance: if 
                  a person has achieved control over the mind, he can keep the mind focused 
                  and calm even in a moment of fear and can thus approach death with confidence.</p>

              <h3><a name="Stages">THE FOUR STAGES OF NIBBANA</a></h3>
              <p>To attain the pure state of Nibbana, the end of all suffering in conditioned 
                  existence, an individual has to free himself of the ten fetters that tie him 
                  to conditioned existence. This process of liberation comes about in a sequence 
                  of four stages.</p>
              <p>The ten fetters are: 1) belief in the existence of a permanent ego, self 
                  or soul; 2) doubts about the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths; 
                  3) attachment to rites and rituals; 4) sensual desire; 5) anger and aversion; 
                  6) craving for fine material existence; 7) craving for non-material existence; 
                  8) pride; 9) agitation; and 10) incomplete understanding of the Four Noble 
                  Truths.</p>
              <p>The four stages are:</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <ol>
              <li> <em>Sotapatti</em> (stream-entry): An individual is freed of the first 
                    three of the ten fetters that tie beings to the round of birth and death: 
                    1) belief in the existence of a permanent ego [self or soul], 2) doubts 
                    about the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths, and 3) attachment 
                    to rites and rituals. </li>
              <li> <em>Sakadagami</em> (once-returner): An individual attenuates the fetters 
                    of 4) sensual desire and 5) anger. </li>
              <li><em>Anagami</em> (non-returner): An individual is freed completely from 
                    4) sensual desire and 5) anger and ill-will. </li>
              <li> <em>Arahat:</em> An individual is freed completely, once and forever, 
                    from 6) craving for fine-material existence, 7) craving for non-material 
                    existence, 8) pride, 9) agitation, and 10) incomplete understanding of the 
                    Four Noble Truths. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Each one of the four stages are attained through a Path Stage <em>(magga)</em> and a Fruition stage <em>(phala).</em> These are technical terms, but are 
                  popularly used in Burma as synonyms for Nibbana. Persons who have attained 
                  to one of these four stages are known as <em>Ariyas,</em> Noble Ones. These 
                  stages can only be attained through <em>Vipassana</em> (insight) meditation.</p>

              <h3><a name="Paramis">THE TEN PARAMIS </a></h3>
              <p>The ten <em>paramis</em> are a set of ten qualities in which an individual 
                  has to perfect himself in order to be able to attain Nibbana. A good act amounts 
                  to <em>parami</em> only if it is performed with the aspiration to attain Nibbana. 
                  Otherwise it is merely a meritorious deed which, though giving good results, 
                  does not directly support oneâ€™s efforts towards Nibbana.</p>
              <p>The ten paramis are :</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <ol>
              <li> Charity (dana) </li>
              <li> Morality (sila) </li>
              <li> Renunciation (nekkhamma) </li>
              <li> Understanding (panna) </li>
              <li> Effort (viriya) </li>
              <li> Patience (khanti) </li>
              <li> Truthfulness (sacca) </li>
              <li> Determination (adhitthana) </li>
              <li> Loving Kindness (metta) </li>
              <li> Equanimity (upekkha) </li>
              </ol>
              <p>With the help of the introduction, it should not be difficult to understand 
                  the discourses. Special care was taken not to use Pali terms except those 
                  that are used so often that it seemed wiser if the reader integrated them 
                  into his vocabulary; I mean terms such as <em>sila, samadhi,</em> etc. At 
                  the end of the book the reader will find an index of Pali words to refresh 
                  his memory. The Pali terms that are commonly used in Burma and generally not 
                  translated into the Burmese vernacular are given and explained in footnotes 
                  for the interested reader.</p>
              <p>I would like to add that there is no necessity for the reader to understand 
                  the philosophical underpinnings of Buddhism before reading these discourses; 
                  he should rather try to keep his mind open to the profound simplicity and 
                  sincerity that are the characteristics of the speaker and his words.</p>
              <p>Many of the explanations in this introduction are drawn from the booklet 
                  <em>Dhamma Texts by Sayagyi U Ba Khin</em> (Sayagyi U Ba Khin Memorial Trust,

              <h2>Discourse I</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"><strong>VEN. 
                WEBU SAYADAW:</strong><br> You have taken up moral conduct (sila). Now that you have undertaken to perfect 
                yourselves in the Perfection of Morality (sila-parami), fulfil it to the utmost. 
                Only if you fulfil sila to the utmost will all your aspirations be met. You 
                will be happy now and in the future.</p>
              <p>Only the teachings of the Buddha can give you real happiness -- in the present 
                  and in the remainder of samsara.[7] The teachings of the Buddha are enshrined 
                  in the Three Collections of the canon (Tipitaka).[8] The Tipitaka are very 
                  extensive. If we take the essence out of the Tipitaka we shall find the thirty-seven 
                  Factors of Awakening (Bodhipakkhiya-dhamma).[9] The essence of the thirty-seven 
                  Factors of Awakening is the eight constituents of the Noble Eight-fold Path 
                  (Maggangas). The essence of the Noble Eightfold Path[10] is the threefold 
                  training (sikkha): higher morality, higher mindfulness, and higher wisdom 
                  (adhisila, adhicitta,[11] and adhipanna). The essence of the threefold training 
                  is the unique Universal Law (Eko Dhammo).</p>
              <p>If your body and mind are under control, as they are now, there can be no 
                  roughness of physical or verbal action. This is adhisila or Perfect Morality.</p>
              <p>If adhisila becomes strong, the mind will become peaceful and tranquil and 
                  lose its harshness. This is called adhicitta.</p>
              <p>If adhicitta (samadhi) becomes strong and the mind stays one-pointed for 
                  a long period, then you will realize that in a split second matter arises 
                  and dissolves billions and billions of times. If mind (nama) knows matter 
                  (rupa), it knows that matter becomes and disintegrates billions and billions 
                  of times[12] in the wink of an eye. This knowledge of arising and disintegration 
                  is called adhipanna.</p>
              <p>Whenever we breathe in or out, the in-coming and the out-going air touches 
                  somewhere in or near the nostrils. The sensitive matter (kayapasada)[13] registers 
                  the touch of air. In this process, the entities touching are matter and the 
                  entity knowing the touch is mind. So do not go around asking others about 
                  mind and matter; observe your breathing and you will find out about them for 
                  yourselves.</p>
              <p>When the air comes in, it will touch. When the air goes out, it will touch. 
                  If you know this touch continuously, then wanting (lobha), dislike (dosa), 
                  and delusion (moha) do not have the opportunity to arise and the fires of 
                  greed, anger, and delusion will subside.</p>
              <p>You cannot know the touch of air before it actually occurs. After it has 
                  gone, you cannot know it any more. Only while the air moves in or out can 
                  you feel the sensation of touch. This we call the present moment.</p>
              <p>While we feel the touch of air, we know that there are only mind and matter. 
                  We know for ourselves that there is no "I," no other person, no 
                  man and woman, and we realize for ourselves that what the Buddha said is indeed 
                  true. We needn't ask others. While we know in-breath and out- breath, there 
                  is no I or atta.[14]</p>
              <p>When we know this, our view is pure; it is right view. We know in that moment 
                  that there is nothing but nama and rupa, mind and matter. We also know that 
                  mind and matter are two different entities. If we thus know to distinguish 
                  between nama and rupa, we have attained to the ability to distinguish between 
                  mind and matter (nama-rupa-pariccheda-nana).</p>
              <p>If we know the touch of air as and when it occurs, our mind is pure and 
                  we get the benefits thereof. Do not think that the benefits you get thus, 
                  even in a split second, are few. Do not think that those who meditate do not 
                  get any advantages from their practice. Now that you are born in a happy plane 
                  and encounter the teachings of a Buddha, you can obtain great benefits. Do 
                  not worry about eating and drinking, but make all the effort you can.</p>

                  Some live very long. Venerable Maha-Kassapa[19] and Venerable Maha-Kaccayana[20] 
                  lived to over one hundred years of age. Some live for eighty years. To be 
                  able to live that long we have to be full of respect for those who deserve 
                  respect and we have to be very humble. Do you pay respects to your father 
                  and mother? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We do, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do you pay respects to people who are older than you or

                  find one bundle of notes thinking, "I shall pretend not to see that one. 
                  After all, I have one already"? Would you let him have one or would you 
                  grab them all and run for it? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I would grab all I could get and run for it, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, yes, you fellows are not very pleasant. When it comes 
                  to money, you are unable to give to anyone. But then you say that you are 
                  respectful and humble just because you pay respects to the Buddha in the evenings. 
                  If you cherish thoughts such as, "Why is he better off than I am? Is 
                  his understanding greater than mine?", then your mind is still full of 
                  pride. If you pay respects to your parents, teachers, to those older, wiser 
                  or of higher standing, without pride, then you will live to more than one 
                  hundred years. If you show respects for such people, will you get only $1000? 
                  Will you get only money? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It will be more than just money. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes indeed! And though you know what really matters, you 
                  wouldn't even give $1000 to someone else, but rather run and get it for yourselves. 
                  When the Buddha, out of compassion, taught the Dhamma, did everybody understand 
                  it? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No sir, not everyone understood it. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Why is this so? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Some didn't listen to the Buddha, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Only if you take the teachings of the Buddha for yourselves 
                  can you attain samma-sam-bodhi (Buddhahood), pacceka-bodhi (Pacceka-Buddhahood), 
                  agga-savaka-bodhi (Chief-discipleship), maha-savaka-bodhi (Leading-discipleship), 
                  pakati-savaka-bodhi (Arahatship). If you want to attain one of these forms 
                  of awakening, you can. Through the teachings of the Buddha you can attain 
                  happiness now, a happiness that will stay with you also in the future.</p>
              <p>How long does it take for a paddy seed to sprout?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Only overnight, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It takes only a day for it to sprout. Now, if you keep 
                  the seed, a good quality seed of course, after sprouting and do not plant 
                  it, will it grow? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No sir, it won't. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Even though you have a good quality seed, if you do not 
                  plant it, it will not grow. It is just the same with the Teachings of the 
                  Buddha; only if you accept them will you understand them. If you learn how 
                  to live with the awareness of mind and matter arising, what do you achieve 
                  ? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> This awareness is called vijja, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If one lives without the teachings of the Buddha, what

                  re- spects to the Buddha. While doing so, he cannot keep his mind focused 
                  on the Dhamma, but he allows it to wander here and there. If this old man 
                  dies at that moment, where will he be reborn? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> He will go to the lower worlds, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Really? Think carefully before you answer. He is paying 
                  respects to the Buddha and he is meditating. So, where will he go if he dies 
                  at that moment? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> He will go to the lower worlds, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But why? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Because his mind is wandering all over, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes.

                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What is lobha? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Lobha is to want something, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Lobha includes any liking, being attracted by something, 
                  wanting. One who dies with any liking or wanting in his mind is said to be 
                  reborn as a ghost. But what is dosa?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Dosa is enmity, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, dosa is the cause for your fighting. Dosa arises 
                  because you do not get what you want and what you get you donâ€™t want. 
                  Dislike is dosa. If you die with dislike in your mind, you are reborn in hell. 
                  Moha is ignorance about benefits derived from being charitable, being moral 
                  and practising meditation. If you die with delusion in your mind, you will 
                  be reborn as an animal. Nobody, no god, no Deva or Brahma has created body 
                  and mind. They are subject to the law of nature, to arising and dissolution, 
                  just as the Buddha taught. If a person dies concentrating on the awareness 
                  of mind and matter and knowing about arising and dissolution of these, then, 
                  according to the teaching of the Buddha, he will be reborn as a man, Deva 
                  or Brahma. If someone is going where he wants to go, does he need to ask others 
                  for the way?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Does one have to ask others, "Do I live with knowledge

Therefore, work hard to bring the perfections 
                  (parami) you have accumulated in the whole of samsara to fruition. Be steadfast 
                  in you effort.</p>
              <p>Act as the wise people of the past did after receiving the teachings directly 
                  from the Buddha; they worked for Nibbana. Knowing that you too have been born 
                  in a favourable plane of existence, nothing can stop you from working up to 
                  the attainment of the eight stages of Nibbana.</p>
              <p>Practise with strong effort and with steadfastness and make sure that not 
                  even a little time is wasted. Advise and urge others to practise also. Strive 
                  with happiness in your heart and when you are successful, be truly happy.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"><strong> WEBU SAYADAW: </strong><br> There are duties towards the cetiyangana, the bodhiyangana, towards teachers, 
                parents, wife and children. If we fulfil these, we practise good conduct (carana) 
                and this is sila.</p>
              <p>While we are fulfilling our duties, is it not possible to practise mindfulness 
                  of breathing also? If we do not fulfil these duties, can we say that our sila 
                  is complete? If our sila is not perfect, can we expect to experience the happiness 
                  we aspire for? If we are not happy, if we canâ€™t get good concentration, 
                  and if our mind is not con- centrated, we canâ€™t attain insight wisdom 
                  (panna).</p>
              <p>(In accordance with the rules of Buddhist monkhood, twice a month, Ven. 
                  Webu Sayadaw assembled the monks in the ordination hall to recite the 227 
                  monksâ€™ rules (the Patimokkha) and to attend to other matters of the community. 
                  At the completion of this meeting, he used to give a discourse to the lay

                  the thought, "Today is the Uposatha day," and you undertook to keep 
                  the eight precepts. Have you been mindful continuously since then?</p>
              <p><strong>DISCIPLE: </strong>No, sir, we haven't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong>How much of this time have you spent being aware of in-

Every 
                  time the mind arises it takes some object, pleasant or unpleasant, liked or 
                  disliked. Is there a time when this constant, continuous stream of mental 
                  objects is cut or interrupted?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, the mind always takes an object.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, and these good and bad friends arise in your mind 
                  due to the skilful and unskilful deeds or kamma you have done in the past. 
                  Now, if a pleasant object which we call a good friend enters the stream of 
                  consciousness, what happens?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Liking or lobha arises, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If liking arises, is this good or bad?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is bad (akusala), sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But if a bad friend, an unpleasant mind-object arises, 
                  what happens then?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Dislike or dosa arises, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If we allow dosa or dislike to arise, are we skilful or 
                  unskilful? Is this action kusala or akusala?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is unskilful, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, if we accept the agreeable mind-objects, liking, craving, 
                  wanting and lust arise and we are creating unskilful acts which lead to the 
                  four lower planes of existence. But, if unpleasant thoughts or images arise 
                  and we take possession of them, then worry, grief, suffering, anger, and aversion 
                  arise and these mental states lead to the lower planes too. Now, when is the 
                  time at which no pleasant or unpleasant thought or image or sound or sight 
                  or taste or touch arises?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> There is no such time, sir. The mind always takes an object.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And all these objects arising in our minds are the results 
                  of the deeds we have done in the past, in samsara. If an object is pleasant 
                  or unpleasant, when it arises, what do you normally do?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We react unskilfully and create akusala-kamma for ourselves, 
                  sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If a pleasant object arises in the mind, liking, craving, 
                  wanting arise. This craving, this lobha, what is it like? Is it not like a 
                  fire? Lobha (craving) is like a fire. What about dosa, disliking, aversion, 
                  and hatred?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Dosa is also like a fire, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, whatever arises, we have to suffer the burning of 
                  fire, don't we?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But of course, if lobha and dosa have to arise, let them 
                  arise. If we are practising the teachings of the Buddha, can they affect us? 
                  While we are practising Anapana meditation, lobha and dosa don't get an opportunity 
                  to possess our minds.</p>
              <p>The teachings of the Buddha resemble the great lake Anottata.[2] If the 
                  fires of lobha or dosa or any other fires fall into this lake, they are extinguished 
                  and we don't have to suffer their scorching heat any longer.</p>
              <p>Only if we know each arising of the mind in the billions of times it arises 
                  in a split second, can we justly say that we have achieved adhipanna or real 
                  wisdom and insight.</p>
              <p>Mind and body arise billions of times in the wink of an eye, and with it 
                  your good and bad friends. If you are not watchful, these good and bad deeds 
                  of yours will again be accumulated in you billions of times. Now, who is responsible 
                  for the pleasant and unpleasant sensations that continuously arise in your 
                  body?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We are responsible for them ourselves, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> The debts you have accumulated in the incalculably long 
                  period of samsara are with you. If you don't apply the Buddha's teachings 
                  and practise them, you will accumulate the same debts again and again, billions 
                  of times in every split second. Are you able to count these debts?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, they are incalculable.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong>Therefore, you should apply this practice the Buddha taught. 
                  If you donâ€™t accept what arises and disintegrates of its own accord, 
                  then your accumulated debts will diminish and no new debts will accumulate. 
                  If you realize this arising and vanishing for yourselves, then you don't make 
                  new debts and you get rid of the old ones. Thus you attain to adhipanna.</p>
              <p>This technique of being aware of in-breath and out-breath can be practised 
                  anywhere. You can practise it while you are alone or in company, while you 
                  are sitting, walking, standing or lying down. Wherever you are, you can practise 
                  it. Now, do you have to spend money in order to practise Anapana?</p>

              <h2>Discourse III</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"><strong> WEBU SAYADAW: </strong><br> You have undertaken to keep sila. Having taken up the training in sila, practise 
                it to the utmost. Only if you really practise morality will the aspirations 
                you treasure in your heart be fulfilled completely.</p>
              <p>Once you are established in moral conduct, the skilful actions you undertake 
                  will result in the fulfilment of your noble aspirations. You believe in the 
                  benefits accruing to you from giving charity and you respect the receiver 
                  of your gift. So, straighten your mind and give to the Dhamma which has no 
                  peer. Prepare your donations yourselves and prepare them well, without employing 
                  others for the purpose.</p>
              <p>Giving your gift, you ought to aspire to awakening by saying: "I desire 
                  to attain Nibbana (Idam me punnam nibbanassa paccayo hotu). The noble ones 
                  who attained Nibbana according to their aspirations are so numerous that they 
                  cannot be counted in numbers.</p>
              <p>The reality one realizes and knows for oneself after penetrating the Four 
                  Noble Truths is called Bodhi. There are different types of Bodhi: samma-sam-bodhi 
                  (the supreme self-awakening of a teaching Buddha), pacceka-bodhi (the self-awakening 
                  of a non-teaching Buddha), and savaka-bodhi (the awakening of a disciple of 
                  a teaching Buddha). The savaka-bodhi is divided into three levels: agga-savaka-bodhi 
                  (attained by the two Chief-disciples), maha-savaka-bodhi (attained by the 
                  eighty Leading Disciples) and pakati-savaka-bodhi (attained by all other Arahats). 
                  All of us have to aspire to Nibbana, the highest blessing. Why can you bring 
                  your aspirations to Nibbana to fulfilment now? Because the time is right, 
                  your form of existence [1] is right, and because of the fact that all virtuous 
                  people who put forth effort can fulfil their aspirations.</p>
              <p>The right time is the time when a Buddha arises and the time during which 
                  his Teachings are available. All those who are born in the human plane or 
                  in a celestial plane are said to have the right birth. Now you have to fulfil 
                  your aspirations through your own effort.</p>
              <p>Look to it that you bring your work to a conclusion in the way so many before 
                  you have done. Once they reached their goal they were truly happy not only 
                  for a short time, or for one lifetime, but for all the remaining lives.[2]</p>
              <p>Now that you do have this aspiration for Nibbana, do not think that you 
                  canâ€™t attain to such happiness or, that you canâ€™t fulfil such a 
                  high aspiration. Establish energy and effort to such a degree that they are 
                  sufficiently strong for you to reach the goal. If you do so, you will beyond 
                  all doubt realize your aspiration at the right time.</p>
              <p>What will you know once you have done the work that has to be done? At the 
                  time of the Buddha, men, Devas and Brahmas went to him to pay their respects. 
                  But no human being, Deva or Brahma was satisfied just by being in the presence 
                  of the Buddha and by paying homage to him. So, the Buddha out of compassion 
                  wanted to teach them what he had discovered and understood for himself. This 
                  communicating of his knowledge we call preaching. When the Buddha preached, 
                  in one split second many men, Devas and Brahmas attained what they had been 
                  aspiring to.</p>
              <p>Knowing that this is the right time and the right form of existence, we 
                  should establish awareness as the wise people did before us and thus we can 
                  experience the fulfilment of our aspirations.</p>
              <p>What are the Teachings of the Buddha? The monks and the wise people have 
                  passed on the Teachings of the Buddha to you out of great compassion. Every 
                  time you were instructed, you understood some of it, according to your capability 
                  to understand. You know that the Teachings are enshrined in the Tipitaka, 
                  the Three Baskets. You know: "This is from the Suttanta-Pitaka. This 
                  is from the Vinaya-Pitaka. This is from the Abhidhamma-Pitaka. All of you 
                  know a lot about the Teachings.</p>
              <p>The holy scriptures are very extensive. Even though the wise read, study, 
                  and teach these scriptures without interruption, they are too extensive for 
                  one person to study and understand them completely. It is impossible for one 
                  person to master the whole of the scriptures because these contain all the 
                  Teachings of Buddha. They are complete, wanting in nothing. They represent 
                  what the Buddha has penetrated and understood for himself. The Teachings contained 
                  in the three Pitaka are the only way of escape from suffering, and the monks, 
                  having understood this for themselves, out of compassion point this out to 
                  you again and again. But can the wise people expound all of the sacred scriptures 
                  to you, so that not a single aspect is left out?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>DISCIPLE:</strong> No sir, this is impossible.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>SAYADAW:</strong> How long would it take to expound all the Teachings 
                  of the noble ones? How many days would you have to sit and talk in order to 
                  cover all the Teachings of the noble ones that are remembered?</p>
              <p>The purpose of all these Teachings is to show the path to the end of suffering. 
                  You know quite enough of the Teachings of Buddha. In all these manifold aspects 
                  of the Teachings you have to take up one and study it with perseverance. If 
                  you focus your mind on one single object as the wise of old did, does it not 
                  stay with that object?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It does, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, select one instruction for meditation out of the many 
                  different ones the Buddha gave, and work with it, being aware always. Work 
                  with as much effort and determination as the disciples of the Buddha did in 
                  the past. If you focus your mind on one object, it will give up its habit 
                  of wandering off to objects it desires. When you are thus capable of keeping 
                  your mind on one single object, can there still be greed which is the cause 
                  of unhappiness?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> When the mind is stable, there is no greed, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is there aversion? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Can there be delusion? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If there is no liking, disliking, and delusion, can there 
                  be fear, worry, and agitation? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If there is no fear, worry, and agitation, will you be

                  and practise with strong effort, will the viriya-iddhipada factor [3] hesitate 
                  to arise in you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It will not fail to come, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> As soon as you establish yourselves in effort, the viriya-iddhipada 
                  factor will arise. But we are good at talking about the Teachings. Let us 
                  instead put forth effort right away. The viriya-iddhipada factor will arise 
                  immediately. This is called akaliko, the immediate result that arises here 
                  and now. It doesnâ€™t arise because we think or know about it, but only 
                  because of practice. So then, focus your entire attention at the spot below 
                  the nose above the upper lip. Feel your in-breath and your out-breath and 
                  feel how it touches at the spot below the nose and above the upper lip.</p>
              <p>I think you had your mindâ€™s attention focused on the spot even before 
                  I finished giving the instructions?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I don't think all were able to do that, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Well, all understood what I said. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Some don't know yet how they have to practise, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh my dear ... you all have learned so much in the past. 
                  The monks taught you with great compassion time and time again and you have 
                  grasped their instructions intelligently. When I told you to concentrate on 
                  the spot with strong determination and not to let your mind wander, you said 
                  it did stay with the breath, didn't you?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Those who had focused their mind on the spot answered, 
                  "It does stay, sir," but there are young people in the audience 
                  who have never heard the Dhamma before.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Did I say anything you haven't heard before? All of you 
                  are great lay-disciples and have come so many times. All of you are capable 
                  of preaching the Dhamma yourselves.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Not all are, sir. Some don't know anything yet. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Can you others accept what he just told me? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, I'm not talking about those people over there, Iâ€™m 
                  talking about some people not known to me. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> In what I tell you there is nothing I have found out myself. 
                  I am only repeating to you what the Buddha preached. What the Buddha taught 
                  is without exception perfect, complete. What I preach is not complete. What 
                  the Buddha preached includes everything. His Teachings are wanting in nothing, 
                  but what I am able to convey may be lacking in many aspects. Would I be able 
                  to give you all the Teachings in their completeness?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No sir, you can't tell us everything. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Well, all of you understand what the Suttas are, what 
                  the Vinaya is, and what the Abhidhamma is. Because your teachers have instructed 
                  you out of great compassion, you also understand the short and the more extensive 
                  explanation of Samatha[4] and Vipassana. But whether you know all this or 
                  not, all of you breathe, big and small, men and women. One may know all about 
                  the Pali scriptures, but nothing about his own breath. Don't all of you breathe 
                  in and out?</p>

                  If you pay close attention, can you feel where the breath touches when you

              <p>If you were to put your finger on the small spot under the nose, could you

                  you can also feel it when the breath touches there when it enters and leaves 
                  the nostrils. If you can feel it for yourselves, do you still have to talk 
                  about it? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No sir, we don't have to. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you put your finger on the spot, do you feel the touch

                  touching the skin. Remain with the awareness of touch. Donâ€™t follow the 
                  stream of air inside or outside. And why? If you do that, you won't be able 
                  to feel the touch sensation. So, letâ€™s stay with the awareness of the 
                  spot without a break.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Do we have to be aware of the touch of air in both nostrils

                  will be split. Put your undivided attention on one spot. Does your mind stay 
                  at the spot? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Most of the time it does, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But not all the time? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Most of the time it stays, but at times the sound of coughing 
                  interrupts the continuity. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it your own coughing or is it someone else's? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Itâ€™s someone else coughing, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Does this disturb you because you put in too little effort 
                  or too much effort? Is the person who coughs to be blamed? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Well, sir, to be honest, I get a little bit angry. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Let's have a look at this. You have come to the Buddha 
                  to escape from suffering. Having received his Teachings you begin to practise. 
                  Then someone coughs and you are upset. But of course, if you meditate, as 
                  you are doing now, people will consider you to be a good person and they will 
                  praise you. But tell me; if this good person becomes angry just before he 
                  dies, where will he be reborn?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> He will fall into the four lower planes. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, you should not allow this to happen. You shouldn't 
                  be impatient and short tempered. You are practising in order to escape from 
                  suffering. Hearing this coughing you should be very happy. You should say 
                  "thank you". After all, the person who is coughing shows you that 
                  your effort isn't firm enough. If you want to escape from suffering you have 
                  to do better than this. With this type of effort, you won't make it.</p>
              <p>We should immediately put in more effort. If we work with more determination, 
                  will we still hear this coughing?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No sir, not with good effort. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if there are many people, all talking loudly, will 
                  we still hear them? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If our effort is not of the right type, we will, sir. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Should we become angry at them if we hear them? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Most times I do get angry, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You should not allow this to happen. You should not be 
                  short tempered. You should think of the people who disturb you as being your 
                  friends. "They are concerned with my welfare, I should thank them. I 
                  don't want everyone to know that my effort is so weak. I will meditate and 
                  improve myself and if they begin to talk still louder, I have to put in even 
                  more effort." If we improve ourselves until we are equal in effort to 
                  the wise who have practised before us, we will attain the goal to which we 
                  aspired.</p>
              <p>If you don't hear any sounds at all you become filled with pride, thinking 
                  that your effort is perfect. That is why we should be very happy if someone 
                  disturbs us. If we go to another place, there may be disturbances again. If 
                  we change from one place to another we just lose time. But if we establish 
                  our mindfulness firmly, do we still have to change place or complain to others?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it not proper to say "thank you" to those 
                  who disturb us? They help us to learn how to overcome our wishes and desires 
                  and we have to thank all who are our friends. If our effort becomes as strong 
                  as that of our teachers, we will not hear anything any more. We will be aware 
                  of one thing only: this small spot and the touch sensation. Once we have gained 
                  good awareness of this, we will apply our attention fully to this awareness.</p>
              <p>If we attain to the happiness to which we aspire through this practice, 
                  are the contents of the three Pitaka, the ten parami, the three-fold training, 
                  the aggregates, the sense bases, and the relative and the ultimate truths 
                  not all contained in this awareness?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, in the awareness of this touch sensation all 
                  the Buddha taught is contained. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You have been talking about the three Pitaka, about the 
                  Four Noble Truths, about mind and matter, and other technical terms. But do 
                  you actually know how to distinguish between mind and matter? Is the small 
                  spot under your nose mind or matter?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is matter, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And what is the awareness of the spot? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> That is mind, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if you are as clearly aware of this spot under your

The whole of 
                  the cycle of birth and death is full of ignorance, but now that you have received 
                  the Teachings of the Buddha, be aware. Skilful people gain awareness because 
                  they are able to accept the Teachings of the Buddha and direct their attention 
                  here only. As they gain awareness, knowledge comes to them. When you are aware 
                  in this way, what happens to ignorance?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is cut out and disappears, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Where can we find it, if we look out for it? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is gone, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Though ignorance has had so much power over you in the 
                  past of //samsara//, when you receive the Teachings of the Buddha and achieve 
                  understanding, you don't even know where your ignorance has gone. So, really, 
                  understanding has much more power than ignorance, and still you complain that 
                  ignorance has such a strong hold over your minds.</p>

                  about the Teachings of the Buddha and you can talk about them and you practise 
                  them. You meditate and keep up your awareness all the time. But tell me, what 
                  preparations do you have to make in order to meditate?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We have to take a cushion and a mat to lie down, sir.

You know that ignorance 
                  is your enemy. And though you know that, you start meditating only after preparing 
                  a bed for yourself. After meditating for some time you will become bored and 
                  sloth and torpor will creep in. What will you do then? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We will endure them. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if sloth and sleepiness are very strong, will you 
                  still resist? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, we will say to them, "Now only you come!"

                  I have had the bed ready for a long time." That's what you are going 
                  to think, aren't you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> When will you wake up again after going to sleep? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We will get up when it is day and time for breakfast,

                  dangers of ignorance will never be overcome. You don't praise understanding 
                  and wisdom, but ignorance. If you work like this, will you ever obtain the 
                  happiness to which you have aspired? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will you just pretend to work then? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If we just pretend, we wonâ€™t get anywhere, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, if you can't achieve your goal, what will you do?

                  and ignorance. Knowing what to do to achieve understanding, focus your attention 
                  on the spot and then keep it there. If you live with this awareness, do you 
                  still have to fear and be worried about the moment of death? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me, what happens if you die without this awareness?

                  am walking on the path that leads straight to the lower worlds. I am saying 
                  only empty words when I say that I don't want to go to hell and am still staying 
                  on the broad highway leading downwards. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Very good. You have understood. If you know for yourself 
                  whether you have got some understanding or not then you are on the right path. 
                  If you know when you don't understand, you have understood. But if you think 
                  you have understood, though you haven't understood a thing, then there is 
                  not the slightest hope for you to acquire any understanding.</p>
              <p>You see, he knows that he is lazy when he is lazy; he knows that he is useless, 
                  when he is useless. If you can see yourself in the correct light, then you 
                  will achieve understanding, because you are able to correct yourselves.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to go to the lower worlds. Well, with all the meditation 
                  I'm doing I'll be alright. After all it doesn't take that much." Do you 
                  still think in this way, assuming that you needn't work much anymore, when 
                  really you do?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, I don't take what is wrong to be right and what

                  of mind and matter you practise understanding. If you have no awareness, you 
                  are living in ignorance. If you die with your mind steeped in ignorance, you 
                  will go down, even if you are observing the Uposatha precepts. [5] Tell me, 
                  where would you be reborn if you happened to be at a pagoda [6] or under a 
                  Bodhi tree [7] when you die? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Wherever I am, if I can't concentrate my mind when I die,

                  I wander about here and there with smiles on my face. If I were to die, where 
                  would I be reborn? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We don't dare to say anything about monks, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You needn't say anything about monks, just take me as

                  of death, the result will be rebirth in hell. Therefore, establish your mindfulness 
                  so that you never forget this small spot. If I were to wish to be reborn in 
                  hell after having reached complete understanding due to this awareness, would 
                  there be a possibility of my going to hell? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Such a wish couldn't come true, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If we don't understand what should be understood, and

                  up this training of awareness of in-breath and out-breath, you will gradually 
                  develop towards the attainment of Nibbana to which you have aspired. So, place 
                  your attention at this small spot steadfastly so that it doesn't budge.</p>
              <p>Isn't it possible for you to fix your mind to this small spot while you

                  and practises awareness at the same time earns twice as much. From now on 
                  you will earn two hundred thousand. But, tell me, when we make our mind firm 
                  and tranquil, will our reward be only this much? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No sir, when the mind is clear it becomes stable, firm,

                  You have to cook at times though you are very tired. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, at times we just stare into the fire and nod 
                  from fatigue. Then the rice is burned sometimes, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Why does this happen? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Because our mind is not on the job, sir. Just yesterday 
                  I was thinking of some scene I had seen in a show and I burned the rice, sir. 
                  If my mind didn't wander, I would be able to do my work more quickly and I 
                  wouldn't burn the food. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What happens if you eat rice that isn't properly cooked? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Some people get an upset stomach, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you cook in a haphazard manner you are slow, you get 
                  tired easily and the food isn't good. The fire burns down and you have to 
                  kindle it anew. The water for the rice cools down and you have to bring it 
                  to the boil again. Nothing is improved by not being attentive. When we improve 
                  our awareness so many other things improve. I am only telling you what the 
                  Buddha taught, but of course I canâ€™t tell you all he taught. There are 
                  many more advantages resulting from this practice. The Buddha's Teachings 
                  are complete and without a flaw. It is impossible to teach every aspect of 
                  the Dhamma. But if you keep your attention focused on the spot and are aware 
                  from moment to moment then you will reach your goal. The Buddha did teach 
                  this, and the wise people of old did reach their goal by this practice, and 
                  yet, there are many things the Buddha realized that are not contained in this. 
                  But you can reach your goal if you keep knowing in- and out-breath at the 
                  spot. You will become really happy.</p>
              <p>I am talking only about this little spot. You know all the theories about 
                  meditation for tranquillity (Samatha) and insight meditation (Vipassana) and 
                  how they come about. Yes, there is Samatha and there is Vipassana, but the 
                  Buddha did say that you have to establish yourselves well in one practice:</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <dl><dd> If you practise one, you accomplish one. </dd><dd> If you practise one, you accomplish two. </dd><dd> If you practise one, you accomplish three. </dd></dl>
              <p>But these are mere words. We have to practise with effort equal to the effort 
                  of the wise people of old.</p>
              <p>When we teach the Dhamma we have to distinguish between Sutta, Abhidhamma, 
                  and Vinaya according to the established order, but only after having practised 
                  meditation to the same extent and with the same effort as the noble disciples 
                  of the Buddha will you really be able to explain the Teachings.</p>
              <p>Though I have explained the technique to you in the proper way, some of 
                  you may remain closed to it and without understanding. If I ask you about 
                  the house in which you are living, you will describe it to me accurately. 
                  If I were to think and ponder about your house, would I be able to visualize 
                  how it really is?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If I were to think and ponder all day and all night without 
                  even sleeping, would I find out about your house? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me then, how can I find out for myself what your 
                  house looks like? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If you come to my house yourself, you will immediately 
                  know all about it even if no one says a word to you. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, you too should proceed in such a way that you reach 
                  your goal. When you get there you will know, "Ah, this is it." Will 
                  you continue to put off practising? No, of course not. You can attain the 
                  Dhamma here and now.</p>
              <p>Understanding all this, practise, make effort. You told me just now that 
                  meditation doesn't tire you. You said that it didn't cost anything, it didn't 
                  disrupt your work, and that you were able to practise it while alone and while 
                  you are with your family. Can you still find excuses for not practising, or 
                  are you going to go on living in the same way as you have been, without even 
                  trying to find excuses?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Most of the time we just carry on as usual, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Those who take up this practice will receive the answers 
                  to their questions. So, keep your mind focused and your cooking will be done 
                  quickly, the rice is not going to be burned, and no wood is wasted. Your whole 
                  life will improve and the time will simply fly.</p>
              <p>There is right conduct and there is understanding. Both are important. Right 
                  conduct is the fulfillment of your manifold duties and your giving of the 
                  four requisites for the support and furthering of the Buddhaâ€™s Teachings. 
                  The control over your mind gives you understanding.</p>
              <p>There are these two elements of training and you have to train yourselves 
                  in both simultaneously. Is it not possible to be aware of the breath while 
                  you are preparing and giving the four requisites for the community of monks?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is possible, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Under which of the two disciplines does sweeping fall? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sweeping is part of right conduct. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Can't you keep your attention at the spot while you are 
                  sweeping? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We can, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Under which of the two trainings does serving your parents 
                  fall, to whom you are deeply indebted for the love, compassion and support 
                  they have given you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> That is right conduct, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What do you accomplish if you keep your attention focused 
                  at the spot while you are serving and helping your parents? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We develop our understanding, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So you can train yourselves both in right conduct and 
                  understanding at the same time. Sometimes you may say that you can't meditate, 
                  though you would like to, because you can't ignore your old father and mother. 
                  Does this happen to you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Young people often think in this way and put meditation 
                  off, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What about older people? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> They often say they canâ€™t meditate because they have 
                  to look after their children, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> To fulfil our duties is part of moral conduct. If you 
                  don't fulfil your duties your conduct is not perfect. At the same time that 
                  you fulfil your duties, admonishing your children, for example, you can train 
                  yourself in the awareness of the spot. Isnâ€™t this wonderful? Now you 
                  have the time to train yourselves in both moral conduct and understanding.</p>
              <p>Venerate and respect your benefactors-your parents, your teachers, and the 
                  community of monks-without ever resting. From now on work without ever resting, 
                  with firm effort, as the wise of old did before you. Your aspirations will 
                  be realised as were the aspirations of the wise disciples of the Buddha.</p>

              <h2>Discourse IV</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"><strong> WEBU SAYADAW: </strong><br> The contents of the three baskets of the sacred scriptures taught by the Buddha 
                are so vast that it is impossible to know all they contain. Only if you are 
                intelligent will you be able to understand clearly what the monks have been 
                teaching you out of great compassion. You have to pay attention only to this.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>DISCIPLE:</strong> Sir, we don't quite understand what you mean by: 
                  "You have to pay attention only to this." <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Let me try to explain in this way. If you build a house, 
                  you put a roof on it, don't you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, we cover our houses with roofs. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> When you put the roof on you make sure that it is water 
                  tight, don't you? If you cover your house well and it rains a little, will 
                  the roof leak? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, it wonâ€™t. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if it rains very hard, will the roof leak? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And when the sun burns down, will it still give you good 
                  shelter? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It will, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Why is this so? Because your roof is well built. Will 
                  you be able to know whether your roof is leaking or not after it rains? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, when it rains it is easy to find out. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You see, you think that the Teachings of the Buddha are 
                  vast and varied, but really they are just one single way of escape from suffering. 
                  Only if you take up one object of meditation given by the Buddha and pursue 
                  it with steadfast effort to the end can you justly claim that your roof is 
                  not leaking any more. If your roof is not rain-proof yet, you have to be aware 
                  of this. There must be many houses in your neighbourhood and they all have 
                  roofs. What are the materials used for roofing? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> There are corrugated iron roofs, there are tiled roofs, 
                  there are houses roofed with palm leaves or bamboo. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, of course. Now, if a palm-leaf roof is well built, 
                  is it reliable? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Oh yes, sir, it won't leak. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If a tin roof is well assembled, is it rain proof? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, it is. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What about a well-made tile roof? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No rain will come through, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What about bamboo roofs or roofs made out of planks? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If they are well done, they are watertight, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, if you take the roofing material you like best and 
                  build a good roof, will it give you shelter when it rains and when the sun 
                  shines? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If we build it well, it will not leak, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> We are building roofs because we don't want to get wet 
                  when it rains and we want to avoid the scorching sun. The Teachings of the 
                  Buddha are available now. Take up one of the techniques the Buddha taught, 
                  establish steadfast effort and practise. Only if you are steadfast does your 
                  practice resemble a roof, and greed, anger and ignorance cannot leak through. 
                  Only if the roof is not leaking can we say that we are sheltered. If the roof 
                  is still leaking rain, is this because it is good or because it is not so 
                  good? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Because it is not so good, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it leaking because the palm leaves are not a good roofing 
                  material? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, palm leaves are a good roofing material. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Or is it because corrugated iron, or tiles, or bamboo, 
                  or planks are not suitable as roofing materials? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, all these are quite OK. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Then why is the roof leaking? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Because it isnâ€™t well built, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But of course, the mistake is made now. Is it difficult 
                  to repair it? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If one is skilful, it is quite easy, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me then, if it leaks in a certain place, what do 
                  you have to do? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We have to patch up the leak, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is just the same in meditation. Now that you exert 
                  effort, there is no leak; you are safe. If greed, anger and ignorance still 
                  drip in, in spite of your practising the Teachings of Buddha, you have to 
                  be aware of the fact that your roof is not yet rain-proof. You have to know 
                  whether the roof you built for your own house is keeping the rain out or not.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, we have all the roofing materials, but the roof is 
                  still leaking. We would like to know the technique of building a good roof. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Don't build a thin, shaky roof; build a thick, strong 
                  roof. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> How are we to build a strong roof, sir? While we are sitting 
                  here like this, we still have to endure being drenched by the rain. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> The wise people of old practised the Teachings without 
                  allowing their efforts to diminish in any of the four postures,[1] and they 
                  kept up such a perfect continuity of awareness that there never was any gap. 
                  You too have to practise in this way. The disciples of the Buddha established 
                  awareness of the spot and then did not allow their minds to shift to another 
                  object. Now, can the rains of greed, anger and ignorance still affect those 
                  who are steadfast?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, they canâ€™t. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you establish the same quality of awareness whether 
                  sitting, standing or walking, will the rain still be able to penetrate your

                  breathe. Now, where does this breath touch when you breathe out? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Somewhere below the nose above the upper lip, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And when you breathe in? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> At the same spot, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you pay attention to this small spot and the touch 
                  of air as you breathe in and out, canâ€™t you be aware of it? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is possible, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> When you are thus aware, is there still wanting, aversion, 
                  ignorance, worry and anxiety? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You see, you can come out of suffering immediately. If 
                  you follow the Teachings of the Buddha, you instantly become happy. If you 
                  practise and revere the Dhamma, you remove the suffering of the present moment 
                  and also the suffering of the future. If you have confidence in the monks 
                  and teachers, this confidence will result in the removal of present and future 
                  suffering. The only way out of suffering is to follow the Teachings of the 
                  Buddha, and at this moment you are revering the Teachings by establishing 
                  awareness. Do you still have to go and ask others how the Dhamma, if practised, 
                  brings immediate relief from suffering?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We have experienced it ourselves, so we don't have to 
                  go and ask others any more. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you know for yourselves, is there still doubt and uncertainty? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, there isn't. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> By keeping your attention at the spot for a short time 
                  only you have understood this much. What will happen if you keep your mind 
                  focused for a long time? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Understanding will become deeper, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If your time were up and you were to die while your attention 
                  is focused on the spot, would there be cause for worry? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> There is no need to worry about one's destiny if one dies 
                  while the mind is under control. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This frees us from suffering in the round of rebirths 
                  and having discovered this for ourselves we need not ask others about it. 
                  If we establish strong and steadfast effort in accordance with our aspiration 
                  for awakening, is there still cause for doubt: "Shall I get it or shall 
                  I not?"</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, we have gone beyond doubt. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, then you have full confidence in what you are doing 
                  and due to your effort the viriya-iddhipada factor arises. Suppose people 
                  come and say to you, "You havenâ€™t got the right thing yet; how could 
                  you ever succeed?" Will doubt arise in you?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You know that though you are certain that you will be 
                  able to reach the goal with your practice, other people might tell you that 
                  you will not. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, knowing for oneself, one will not have doubts, whatever 
                  people may say. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What if not just a hundred people or a thousand people 
                  come to tell you that what you are doing is no good, but say the whole town? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Even if the whole town comes, no doubt will arise, sir.

                  because we realized this happiness for ourselves. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, you know how much effort you have established. But 
                  donâ€™t think that your effort is perfect yet. You are only at the beginning. 
                  There is still much room for improvement. While you sit, walk, stand and work 
                  it is always possible to be aware of the in-breath and the out-breath, isn't 
                  it?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you focus your attention on the spot, are you unhappy? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Does it cost you anything? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> The men, Devas and Brahmas who received the Teachings 
                  after the Buddhaâ€™s awakening practised continuously, and therefore their 
                  respective aspirations for awakening were fulfilled.</p>
              <p>What the Buddha taught is enshrined in the Tipitaka. If you keep your attention 
                  focused on the spot and on the in-breath and the out- breath, the whole of 
                  the Tipitaka is there. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We donâ€™t quite understand this, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh dear. Why shouldn't you understand this? Of course 
                  you understand. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> But we would like to be certain that we understand this 
                  in detail, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You have understood already. Have you checked whether 
                  all of it (the Buddha's Teaching) is contained in this awareness? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> But, sir, our awareness is not deep enough to check this. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But you can talk about the Buddha's discourses, the monks' 
                  rules and about Abhidhamma philosophy. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> When we discuss these, we just talk without really knowing. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Talking into the blue. Now, if you keep your attention 
                  at this spot, can you tell me whether the whole of the Teaching is present 
                  there? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We donâ€™t know, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Are you not telling me because you are tired? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, we aren't tired. We would like to answer. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If we want to make an end to suffering we have to observe 
                  the behaviour of mind and matter. Everyone says this. Matter is composed of 
                  eight basic elements.[2] There are fifty-three mental concomitants. [3] All 
                  of you can tell me this off the top of your head.</p>
              <p>You are intelligent. When others discuss the Teachings you correct them 
                  and tell them where they went wrong and where they left something out. You 
                  refute them and criticize them. You are debating like this, aren't you?</p>
              <p>We said just now that the thing that doesn't know is matter and the entity 
                  that knows is mind. These two entities must be evident to you. Under which 
                  of the two comes the spot below the nose; is it mind or matter?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I think that the spot is matter, sir. The kayapasada (sensitive 
                  matter) through which we feel touch sensation is rupa. But those who study 
                  Abhidhamma philosophy tell us that we are just concepts (pannatti) and that 
                  the spot too is but a concept, sir -- When we have debates with people who 
                  are proficient in the Abhidhammattha-sangaha[4] we become angry and agitated 
                  and get little merit.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you can't keep your attention on the spot, you will 
                  of course get involved in discussions. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> But, sir, if we don't answer, we have to admit defeat. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me, what do you have to do when you are hungry? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We have to eat rice, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What about monks, what do you have to give them to still 
                  their hunger? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We have to give them oblation rice,[5] sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Are the oblation rice they eat and the rice you eat two 
                  completely different things? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> They aren't different, sir. In order to show respect to 
                  the monks we call their rice oblation rice, but it is the same as the one 
                  we eat. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, whether we call it rice or oblation rice, it will 
                  satisfy our hunger. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, both fill the stomach. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now what about the nose, the spot? You can call it by 
                  its conventional name or you can talk about sensitive matter. It's just the 
                  same as with rice and oblation rice. Is it worth arguing about? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, there is no need for long discussions. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Having understood this, will you stop arguing, or will 
                  you carry on with your debates? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, we shall not debate, but those Abhidhamma students[6] 
                  will. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> In that case you just don't take part in the discussion 
                  of such issues. You have known all along that rice and oblation rice are the 
                  same, but we have to talk about it so that you understand. Now, what do we 
                  call the entity that is aware? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is called mind, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Only if you have gained such control over your mind that 
                  it doesnâ€™t jump from one object to another, are you able to distinguish 
                  clearly between mind (nama) and matter (rupa). <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, now we are able to distinguish between mind 
                  and matter. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is this knowledge of mind and matter you have gained called 
                  understanding (vijja) or ignorance (avijja)?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is understanding, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is there still ignorance present when you are able to 
                  distinguish clearly between mind and matter? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, avijja has run away. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> When you concentrate at the spot there is understanding, 
                  and ignorance has been banned. Now, if we continue to concentrate on the spot, 
                  will ignorance spring back up again? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, it wonâ€™t. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, you see, you have to establish understanding in this 
                  way. You have found it now; don't allow it to escape again. Can you again 
                  suddenly be overpowered by delusion if your understanding keeps growing moment 
                  by moment? Do good people still have to moan and complain, saying that it 
                  is difficult to get rid of avijja once they have been given the Teachings 
                  of the Buddha which are the tool to overcome and defeat ignorance?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, they shouldn't complain. All they need to do 
                  is to put forth effort. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, you realize that all the Buddha taught is contained 
                  in this meditation. If you put forth effort, establish yourselves in perfect 
                  effort, then you will reach full understanding. You told me that many types 
                  of material are suitable to build a good roof. Not only a tin roof or a palm 
                  leaf roof are safe; you can choose from many different materials. I think 
                  you have collected quite a variety of good roofing materials. Now you have 
                  to build a roof that really protects you against rain. Once you have built 
                  a good shelter, you won't get wet and you wonâ€™t have to suffer the heat 
                  of the sun anymore. If you build your shelter in the jungle, will it be good?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, it will. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you build your roof in a city? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It will be safe, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Does it make any difference whether you build your shelter

                  to suffer sun and rain ever again.</p>

              <h2>Discourse VI</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"><strong> WEBU SAYADAW: </strong><br> You have taken the precepts. Now that you have undertaken the practice of the 
                perfection of morality, fulfil it.</p>
              <p>What you realize when you penetrate the Four Noble Truths is called bodhi. 
                  You are born at a good time and in a good form of existence. Now then, emulate 
                  the wise disciples of the Buddha and put forth effort as strong as theirs, 
                  so that you may attain the awakening to which you aspired. Those who received 
                  the Teachings from the Buddha himself worked ceaselessly in all four postures[1] 
                  and thus attained enlightenment.</p>
              <p>The human beings, Devas and Brahmas who achieved their aspiration[2] on 
                  just one occasion cannot be counted in hundreds, thousands, hundred of thousands, 
                  or millions. Sometimes in one split second, an incalculably large number of 
                  beings achieved their aspirations. From the time the Buddha attained full 
                  awakening, beings have been able to attain Nibbana. But it is not only during 
                  the lifetime of the Buddha that beings can attain Nibbana; Nibbana can be 
                  attained as long as the teachings of the Buddha are available.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <h2>Discourse VIII</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"><strong> WEBU SAYADAW: </strong><br> Be perfect in the practice of sila. Only 
              if your practice is perfect will all your aspirations 
              of the present time and of the future be fulfilled 
              without exception. Because this is true, the 
              aspirations of the good people of the past who 
              practised and strove were fulfilled completely. You too 
              have to take up the practice of that sila that brought 
              about their happiness. Work hard and perfect yourselves 
              in it.</p>
              <p>Being perfect in sila, keep your mind straight and 
              practise generosity (dana) as it pleases you, giving 
              your possessions yourselves with sincerity to those who 
              are worthy. Approach and give your dana and your 
              respect to the peerless Buddha and his Teachings, 
              keeping in mind your aspiration for awakening, Nibbana. 
              This type of aspiration is called right aspiration. 
              What you realize when you penetrate the Four Noble 
              Truths is called bodhi.</p>
              <p>There are different types of bodhi: samma-sam-bodhi 
              (Buddhahood), pacceka-bodhi (Non-teaching Buddhahood), 
              savaka-bodhi (Arahatship). There are different types of 
              Arahatship: agga-savaka (chief discipleship), 
              maha-savaka (leading disciples), pakati-savaka (Disciple and 
              Arahat). You have always to keep in mind your 
              aspirations for Nibbana, the highest goal.</p>
              <p>Aspirations thus taken are well taken. After having 
              perfected yourself according to your aspiration, enter 
              Nibbana. The noble persons who have attained Nibbana 
              are innumerable. Why could they bring their various 
              aspirations for bodhi to fruition? Because they had 
              been born into the right form of existence at the right 
              time and because they exerted proper effort.</p>
              <p>When is the time that these aspirations can be 
              brought to fruition?</p>
              <p>From the moment the Buddha attained awakening, many 
              human beings, Devas and Brahmas came to the Buddha to 
              pay respects and to show their devotion. But no human 
              being, no Deva, and no Brahma was satisfied by merely 
              being in the presence of the Buddha and having the 
              opportunity to pay respects. The Buddha observed them 
              through his mindâ€™s eye and taught them the truth which 
              he had penetrated through his own super-knowledge, his 
              omniscience. As soon as they received the instructions 
              of the Buddha, they began to practise, to exert 
              themselves with unwavering energy in all the four 
              postures of the body. This effort, which is continuous 
              without break or pause and full of joy is called good 
              effort. When their effort was perfect and equal to the 
              effort of the wise men of old, they arrived at their 
              goal in due time and all the aspirations of their 
              hearts came to an end. Because they had achieved this 
              state they were exceedingly happy and blissful.</p>
              <p>What was the nature of their happiness, their bliss? 
              It was not happiness or bliss that lasted for only a 
              moment or a single lifetime; it was that happiness that 
              is so great that it is able to last for the remainder 
              of samsara. Even if you are born in the human plane for 
              only one life, you are able to rise above the 
              suffering of the cycle of birth and death.</p>
              <p>In this way happiness and bliss come to you. When one 
              has attained this happiness, when one has received the 
              sign of bliss, when one has reached the goal, there is 
              no jealously guarding of a secret. No, you will want 
              all human beings, Devas, and Brahmas to attain this 
              bliss and happiness. As you know for yourself how to 
              attain this happiness, the actions of body, speech, and 
              mind will always be in harmony with the cause of 
              attaining Nibbana. You will act with joy as your base.</p>
              <p>How could so many human beings, Devas, and Brahmas 
              attain such high states of bliss? Only because they 
              knew that they were going to bring the aspirations of 
              their heart to fruition.</p>
              <p>What are the things that support the Buddhaâ€™s 
              Teachings? They are the donation of shelter, robes, 
              alms food, and medicine for the monks. Having 
              understood this, they practised it. With these four 
              requisites the wise supported the Teachings of the 
              Buddha. While they supported the Teachings of the 
              Buddha by donating the four requisites, many human 
              beings, Devas, and Brahmas received the instructions of 
              the Buddha. They were endowed with the ability to 
              understand and follow the instructions and they 
              practised with a joyful mind without taking rest as the 
              wise of old. When they thus practised they attained 
              their goal without delay. In just one moment 
              innumerable human beings, Devas, and Brahmas fulfilled 
              the wish of their heart. The energetic people saw this 
              and supported the Teachings of the Buddha and 
              established them in a very short time. But they didnâ€™t 
              do only this; this didn't satisfy them yet. In order to 
              strengthen and make firm the Teachings they would also 
              meditate. So they were full of good volition and they 
              were accordingly endowed with unwavering effort and 
              faith. Since the time of the Buddha there have been 
              such noble people who supported and carried out the 
              Teachings of Buddha with supreme effort, and ever since 
              the days of the Buddha human beings, Devas, and Brahmas 
              have been attaining Nibbana. The number of those who 
              have reached the goal in just a short moment can't be 
              reckoned, let alone the number of all who have attained 
              Nibbana.</p>
              <p>Now the good time for all the various noble people 
              has come. This is so because the time when a Buddha and 
              his Teachings blossom is the good time. The existences 
              of human beings, Devas, and all the happy abodes are 
              good. Having been born into one of these, people 
              accepted the Teachings as you are doing now. They 
              practised with full effort and arrived at the goal.</p>
              <p>After his awakening the Buddha honoured Rajagaha 
              before any other country with his presence. The king of 
              this great city, Bimbisara, came to the Buddha and 
              because he received the Teachings and followed them, he 
              attained the goal. He was full of bliss. He wanted 
              others to attain the same bliss, and understanding the 
              reason, the cause for his happiness, he donated the 
              four requisites. He did this so that his mother, 
              father, grandmother and grandfather could fulfil their 
              aspirations completely. The Buddha, out of his great 
              compassion, dwelled in the king's delightful garden. 
              Humans, Devas, and Brahmas came to revere him there and 
              with great compassion he taught them what he had 
              realized himself. In just one short moment innumerable 
              humans, Devas, and Brahmas achieved their aspirations. 
              And after this it went on and on. The good time for all 
              the people with noble aspirations had come! The time at 
              which there is a Buddha or his Teaching is the good 
              time. Human life, life as a Deva or a Brahma, is a good 
              life. Good effort is called the effort that is 
              established after one has received the Teachings. And 
              what are the Buddha's Teachings? What is contained in 
              the Tipitaka and is preached and explained by noble 
              disciples out of loving kindness and compassion are the 
              Buddhaâ€™s Teachings. They are very extensive, profound 
              and difficult to understand. Though they are extensive, 
              profound, and difficult to understand, they really are 
              just one thing: the way of escape from suffering.</p>
              <p>They are expounded by the wise in short and in full 
              as time permits and everyone has knowledge of them 
              according to his capability. You all have some 
              understanding of the Tipitaka in accordance with your 
              capabilities. If you were to talk about what you know 
              it would never end.</p>
              <p>But you have to establish strong effort and focus 
              your mind on one object according to the Teachings of 
              the Buddha, as I said, and keep out all other objects. 
              When you fix your mind on one object exclusively with 
              strong and stable effort, then you will be established 
              in the Teachings. Isn't that so?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong> U BA KHIN:</strong> Yes sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> To establish your attention thus is effort 
              (viriya). When you fix your attention on one object and 
              no other object enters your mind and your attention is 
              stable, you reach viriya-iddhipada. Because the 
              Teachings are so extensive you may think it tiresome to 
              practise them. That is why I instruct you in this way 
              that you can reach the goal quickly.</p>
              <p>What happens to the causes of suffering-lobha, dosa, 
              and moha: (greed, aversion, and delusion)-when you 
              control your mind in this way?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> They are cut out and become quiet.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> People write and preach a lot about lobha, dosa, 
              and moha. Don't they? When they debate, they talk only 
              to win the debate, whoever they are talking to. But if 
              they establish awareness of breathing and make their 
              minds stable they acquire real merit. Why don't we try 
              to do this?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will there be worry, fear, and greed at that time?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> There won't be.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> No, there won't; there won't be any worry, fear, or

              happiness which are not related to the happiness 
              achieved through the Buddha's Teachings, but people 
              still call them happiness. What sort of happiness am I 
              talking about? I am talking about the happiness of 
              becoming a human being or Deva, of becoming a king, a 
              rich man, a Universal Monarch, a Deva king, a Sakka, or 
              a Brahma. Of course their enjoyment is also called 
              happiness ... But let me give an example. If you were 
              asked to bear the golden royal insignia and live in the 
              golden palace of a country that abounded with gold, 
              silver, gems, rice, water and paddy, that was plentiful 
              in everything, would you accept this offer or not?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Of course I would accept.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Of course you would accept. This country is so rich 
              that there is absolutely nothing missing. So you would 
              live wearing your crown in your golden palace smiling 
              all the time. So I think, smiling like that all the 
              time, you would enjoy yourself; you would be happy, 
              wouldn't you? Would this happiness keep worry, fear, 
              and wanting away?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, it wouldn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh, really?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It wouldn't, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> I mean at that moment, you see.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It wouldn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Why are they all smiling and happy then?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Somebody could try to usurp the kingdom. If 
              something happens in his territory he would have duties to 
              fulfil.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> There is nothing like that. This country is so good 
              that there is no danger or worry of that kind. It is a 
              very peaceful country. There is no problem at all; 
              everything is calm and quiet. It is that kind of 
              country. No troubles at all; you just have to live in 
              the golden palace wearing your crown. You simply live 
              there with your ministers, troops, concubines, and 
              wives. You live always with a smile on your face. Will 
              worry, fear, greed, and anxiety be kept at bay in these 
              circumstances? You are always smiling and happy. So, do 
              you think there is any worry?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> There will be, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Why?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Because there is the fear of death.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, there will still be the fear of death. But you 
              are smiling still. What is this smiling? What are 
              lobha, dosa, and moha?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> They won't be kept away.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Even smiles don't keep them away?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What do smiles mean?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> They indicate that the object of mind is lobha

But 
              you aren't happy yet. You are king, aren't you? Maybe 
              you aren't happy because you rule only one country? 
              I'll give you another one. So?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Even then I won't be any happier .<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Are you going to tell me that you don't want

              worry or fear. With the turning of the Jewel of the 
              Wheel you will become a Universal Monarch. Will you be

But when I asked whether

So, there is no peace now; there won't be 
              any after.

We all thought we were quite all right, but 
              not so. But now we've got the Teachings of the Buddha 
              and we can have as much of it as we want, can't we?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We can.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Endowed with the ability to accept the Teachings we 
              can take up one technique with steadfastness. Will the 
              happiness that derives from this practice become less 
              the more we use it, the more we practise?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It won't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will it ever be exhausted?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It won't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh, really? My word, this thing is good. Isn't it, 
              my dear disciples? And if we use it all the time, 
              continuously, will it then get used up, will it come to 
              an end?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It will neither diminish nor get used up.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Wait a minute. We shall keep our attention focused 
              while we are sitting like this, but while we are 
              standing, can we still practise this?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We can.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And when we are walking?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We can.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, we have to carry the burden of our body. It is 
              not the same as other worldly possessions. When you 
              work hard to acquire various jewels and gold and are 
              successful, you will store them away in a certain 
              place, I think. But having acquired our body and mind, 
              the five khandhas, is it possible to live with ease, 
              happily and without making great efforts?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It isn't possible.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> We have to shoulder our burden. We can't rest for a 
              short moment even, can we? And for whom do we have to 
              shoulder the burden of our bodies without ever taking 
              rest?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> For ourselves.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> For the five aggregates.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> For the five aggregates, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes we have to work, disciples. If I practise this

              practise this all the time?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is possible, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is very good.

Yes, disciple, 
              when we have the Teachings of the Buddha and practise 
              them continuously, when we are able to focus our mind 
              on the object, we won't get tired, will we?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We won't, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> We won't spend anything; our work won't be disrupted, 
              and others won't even notice. You receive the 
              Teachings in no time and then you say to yourself, "Now 
              I shall follow these Teachings." When you have this 
              volition and put forth effort then the viriya-iddhipada 
              factor will arise and you will arrive at the goal in no 
              time. If you take up the practice now, will your 
              progress be slow or fast, my disciples?</p>

              awareness of respiration; isnâ€™t this much possible?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is possible.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is this quick or slow?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is quick, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You see. If you establish effort, the viriya-iddhipada 
              factor arises. Can you say how quick this is?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Have you put your attention there and does it stay?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> As I decide to put it there, it stays, doesn't it?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It does.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So if it stays, you have reached happiness. Are you 
              able to speak as quickly as this happiness is able to 
              arise?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> I am not, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is easy to achieve happiness if you want it.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is the highest sort of kusala. Do you hear? 
              This is the highest, the highest. Only if you have 
              parami can you be born as a human and receive the 
              Buddha-Dhamma. This type of kusala cannot be put in 
              numbers. Do you understand? Then, the six qualities of 
              the Dhamma are there; the qualities of the Buddha, the 
              Dhamma, and the Sangha. When the Buddha taught this, 
              people understood. Among the six qualities of the 
              Dhamma, akaliko is one, isn't it? What does akaliko 
              mean?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Immediateness.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Immediateness means that as soon as you fix your 
              attention the results come. So, if you establish effort 
              with intelligence the results come so quickly that you 
              can't say "there" quicker than they come. Or you can't 
              even think that fast. Is it so? If you establish 
              awareness now, if you keep it here with your effort, 
              happiness arises in the very same moment. This is 
              immediate; who would have to question this any more?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Who would have to doubt his own experience?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, when happiness has arisen there is no looking 
              for it any more. The answer comes by itself, doesn't 
              it? It doesn't take any time. All of you are bright 
              people and you have understood the Teachings of the 
              wise and compassionate while still young, even before 
              the words of instruction were complete. Though you 
              understood, at times your mind will think as it 
              pleases, but let us practise. What happens in the mind 
              when we plan to practise to acquire kusala? "I'll 
              perform kusala later on, now I have to do this 
              quickly." Doesn't this happen to you?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It does.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it good to think and speak like this? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And then you make efforts and the viriya-iddhipada 
              factor has arisen. What is the right thing to do?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> The right thing to do is to practise.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. If you want to become happier and happier, you 
              have to put forth effort as soon as you have received 
              the instructions of the Buddha and have accepted them. 
              Then the viriya-iddhipada factor will arise. When you 
              make use of this factor that arises in a split second, 
              does it get consumed?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It doesn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Does it diminish?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It doesn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you decide that the happiness you have is quite 
              sufficient for now and the future and say, "I don't 
              want to progress," can you practise and not progress?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> One will progress.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you practise not just for a short time, but 
              longer, will you achieve only as much as you get out of 
              a short period of practice?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> One will get more.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is good, disciple. This is possible because we 
              are now in an auspicious era, because we are born into 
              the right form of existence and because you make right 
              efforts. The energetic get the true answer even without 
              asking others. Very good. Do you hear? Isn't this so?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is so.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, even if we live with this happiness all the 
              time, it wonâ€™t diminish; it won't be used up. And what 
              happens if one doesn't want to progress?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It isn't possible not to progress, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. If you aspire to this there must be many 
              different troubles. Is it possible to attain bodhi or 
              not?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is possible.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is possible now and in the future. So let us 
              say, "I don't want to progress," and then focus our 
              minds. Is this possible?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It isn't possible not to progress if we work.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do we achieve greater happiness the more we work?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We do, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> We can attain bodhi and we can also choose the time 
              and the place of birth. We can then choose a good 
              existence as we wish. When you attain the happiness you 
              desire, what else do you need.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Nothing else, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You don't need anything; you just have to choose. 
              Is choosing tiresome?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It isn't, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You can attain it at any time. There are four 
              stages to Nibbana. Is it possible only for certain 
              types of Ariyas (individuals who have attained one of 
              the four stages)? Do we have to choose the state of 
              Nibbana?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What about the place?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It isnâ€™t necessary.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. All by yourself, without any help?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It's possible.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And in a crowd? If you go outside the pagoda it 
              wonâ€™t be possible, I think. It is easy, isn't it? The 
              Buddha, the all-compassionate and omniscient, taught 
              many humans, Devas, and Brahmas the knowledge that he 
              had attained through penetrating the truth himself. 
              These beings, full of confidence after receiving the 
              Teachings, were able to fulfil their aspirations.</p>
              <p>As you establish awareness you should establish continuous 
              effort. There are many different types of 
              people. Some are good at reciting or reading or 
              preaching or explaining. I have no doubt about you, 
              disciples, with whoever you compete you will win.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, though others are victorious in their talk, 
              will they achieve anything if they don't practise?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, what's the difficulty? Talking is tiresome, 
              isn't it? All we have to do is to make efforts to bring 
              to fruition the aspirations we have made and work as 
              the wise ones of old. Understanding that we have to 
              take up this work our minds will be focused. You are 
              very busy. You may say, "We will practise later when we 
              are free." Does this thought come up still?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It does.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Sometimes the mind is like that. But I think you 
              don't actually say so?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We might, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You even speak your mind?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We do.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Well, if you want to say this, never mind. But for 
              the future can't you burn these impurities out? You 
              have the Teachings of the Buddha. When this happens to 
              you, [when you want to procrastinate,] get rid of your 
              doubts. Strive to find the answers without asking 
              others. If you focus right now, won't you get the 
              answers immediately? Isn't this possible?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, it is possible, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is possible to focus as you sit here.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes sir, it is.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it also possible to maintain the happiness you

              have to raise yourself up happily and complete your 
              work. Then, depending on what your aspirations are, you 
              simply take the bliss you desire. It is very easy. 
              Don't be modest. Don't allow yourselves to think, "This 
              is not possible for me," "This is not suitable for 
              us," "This is not proper for us," "This is not for

              them assiduously fulfilled their wishes, didn't

              What about today, lay disciple? The period is the same, 
              the occasion is the same, the plane of existence is the 
              same. If we simply establish our effort and accept the 
              Teachings, do we still have to choose certain times to 
              practise?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> There is no need for that.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Really?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> That is correct, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes! The time and the form of existence is right. 
              You can achieve your aspirations when you wish, can't 
              you?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> That is correct sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes! Do you understand? Before, they didn't 
              practise because they were busy. How is it with this 
              "I'll practise when I'm free"? Do we still have to set 
              times like this?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is not necessary to set aside certain times.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What happens if we practise only when we are free? 
              If we stop the practice, then we wonâ€™t attain what we 
              ought to attain. But now, we do our work and something 
              else as well: we also fulfil our aspirations. We get 
              two things done at the same time, don't we, lay 
              disciples? What is better: to get one thing done or to 
              get two things done at the same time?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is better to get two things done at the same 
              time, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You see? It's worth keeping yourself busy. But, 
              even though I say it's worth keeping yourself busy, 
              don't start enjoying being busy just for the sake of 
              being busy-if you want to realize the Teachings, I 
              mean. Don't just keep running around all the time. If 
              you establish viriya at the same time, the 
              viriya-iddhipada factor will arise. Make yourselves firm in 
              this. If you say that you want to do this work but go 
              on distracting yourselves here and there, your progress 
              will be slow. On the other hand, if you establish this 
              awareness and keep it up, working happily, then you 
              will make progress. what about this work that you can't 
              avoid having to do?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We will also make progress with that.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, lay disciples. Not only do you get results in 
              this noble work, you get much more besides. What I say 
              is what the Buddha taught. I'm not adding anything.</p>
              <p>Now, you are all people making great effort, aren't 
              you? I just wanted to warn you. What I just mentioned 
              [about being too busy] can happen at times.</p>
              <p>When you have holidays, you decide to come here and 
              meditate for a few days. Then you have to go back to 
              work and don't get time off anymore. You don't come 
              back. Does this happen sometimes?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, it does.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Then you abandon the meditation, I think, don't 
              you? Don't abandon it. Carry on with this awareness and 
              at the same time do your work. Then you get two things 
              in one go. You get two. If you postpone the work until 
              your hours of leisure, you only get one benefit. The 
              aspirations you are fulfilling are not ordinary ones, 
              are they? You can attain to the highest, noblest bliss.</p>
              <p>Now, what are these aspirations you are going to 
              fulfil? There are the different forms of bodhi. Bodhi 
              means the penetrative understanding of the Four Noble 
              Truths. If you establish effort, saying that you want 
              to get it, you can fulfil all your various aspirations 
              for bodhi right now. This is not ordinary.</p>
              <p>How are you going to fulfil your aspirations? Each 
              type of bodhi has to be fulfilled in its own way: 
              sammasambodhi as sammasambodhi, paccekabodhi as 
              paccekabodhi. We must understand it in this way if we 
              are to understand it correctly. It is like planting a 
              mature seed. When it rains, a plant springs up. Here, 
              the plant is nursed well, when you go back home, it has 
              deep roots and is strong.</p>
              <p>Is it possible to describe how good this period, this 
              time, is? It is so easy now, lay disciples! Tell me, is 
              this a period when one is oppressed by worries and has 
              to groan and moan?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it a period when we can only stare resignedly?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is a period when we can be happy and blissful 
              immediately, when we can never get enough of this joy. 
              You get even more than you wanted. You get even more 
              than you aspired to, don't you, disciple?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh yes. You never get tired, not in the present and 
              not in the remainder of samsara. What are the Teachings 
              of the Buddha? There is nothing in the Teachings that 
              causes stress and misery, is there? There isn't! It is 
              pure happiness!</p>
              <p>There is one thing, however: the mind may get 
              confused with many thoughts, and I donâ€™t think that 
              these thoughts are very pertinent. Now, if you 
              determine to establish this practice, then I don't 
              think that thoughts of doubt will remain at the back of 
              your mind. Can you not be successful in this way? The 
              mind will think what it wills. Let it! Follow the 
              Teachings. Do you understand? When you arrive at the 
              goal, you will probably find that it isn't what you 
              expected it to be. Doesn't this happen to people?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It has happened many times, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, it happens. Dear lay disciples, I am telling 
              you only a little. Those among you who work hard will 
              think, "This monk is reluctant to tell us everything. 
              He is probably very unwilling to part with his 
              knowledge." [Everybody laughs.] You will think, "This 
              is much greater than he said." When you strive for real 
              happiness and in this way arrive at the goal, then you 
              experience something that you cannot describe with all 
              the words there are. Once youâ€™ve decided, "I'll strive 
              so that I will know for myself," then don't 
              procrastinate. Don't delay. Do you hear? This is so elevated. 
              It is so good, lay disciples. Work hard. Do you 
              understand? You are all people of great effort, aren't 
              you?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Almost all of us, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. Good, good. Work hard, won't you? You see, 
              when you yourselves arrive at the goal-and for many of 
              you even before that time-you can give this happiness 
              to others. You will never feel reluctant to give.You 
              will want to give a great deal of it, a great deal.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> This is true, sir. In the course we are conducting 
              now there are three or four students who, after about 
              three days, cry with great sobs because they regret not 
              having come here earlier.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, it is like that.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> They think, "I should have come earlier!"<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, this happens! Work hard in order to attain the 
              highest. This place is very good.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is a place to which you gave your blessings, 
              venerable Sayadaw!<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is a nucleus. It is the first of many centres. 
              Do you hear me? May this happiness spread slowly out 
              from this place. Yes, yes, you must work hard, strive 
              diligently. Working means that you must meditate at 
              times, and then, at times, you will want to take rest. 
              Does this also happen here?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It doesn't, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It doesn't?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> If the students start to meditate at 12.30, they 
              come out of their meditation cells only at 5 P.M. At 
              the beginning, they do take breaks, but after two or 
              three days, they donâ€™t come out for breaks anymore.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, you see! It's like that! The highest bliss 
              cannot be described in words. But the mind is like a 
              magician. Even though you may be meditating here like 
              this, even though you may be meditating calmly, 
              negative thoughts may arise: "Oh, meditation is so 
              tiring! How can I achieve anything? I can't." Isn't it 
              like that?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is just as you say, sir. They do think that way.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. Your mind may be cheating you,but after having 
              established right effort, there is no cheating 
              yourself-or is that still possible?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, sir, it isn't.<br> </p>

              <h2>Discourse V</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"><strong> WEBU SAYADAW: </strong><br> You have taken sila. Having taken sila, practise it. Only if you fulfil the 
                perfection of morality completely can you be successful in attaining all the 
                various aspirations[1] for awakening without exception.</p>
              <p>Now that you have understood that you have been born at an auspicious time 
                  and into a good existence, take up the practice of the Teachings of the Buddha 
                  with all your strength and establish yourselves in them. The noble disciples 
                  of the teacher practised without slackening in their effort and were mindful 
                  in all the four postures of the body, without ever resting. They worked with 
                  steadfastness and they all attained the goal they desired. You too should 
                  take up this practice with this strong will to reach your goal.</p>
              <p>What is this practice without break or rest to be compared to? It is like 
                  the flight of an arrow. If we shoot an arrow with a bow, we take aim according 
                  to our desire. Now tell me, does the arrow at times slow down and then speed 
                  up again after we shoot it? Does it at times take rest and then again proceed 
                  toward the target?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>DISCIPLE:</strong> Sir, it flies fast and at a steady speed. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And when does it stop?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It stops only when it hits the target, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, only when it hits its aim, its target, does it stop. 
                  In just the same way did the direct disciples of the Buddha strive to attain 
                  the goal they had taken as their target. Moving at a steady pace without a 
                  break, without interruption, they finally attained that type of awakening 
                  (bodhi) they desired in their hearts.</p>
              <p>Of course, there are various types of awakening. All of them can be attained 
                  if you work without resting. If you work for samma-sam-bodhi (Buddhahood), 
                  you have to work continuously. If you work for pacceka-bodhi (Non-teaching 
                  Buddhahood), you have to keep up the continuity of practice. If you aim for 
                  savaka-bodhi (Arahatship), you have to practise steadily, just as an arrow 
                  flies steadily. If you practise with steadfastness you will be able to attain 
                  your goal.</p>
              <p>Though you practise without interruption, you will not get tired or exhausted. 
                  As you take up the Teachings of the Buddha, incomparable happiness will come 
                  to you.</p>
              <p>Some people think that the Buddha taught many different things. You all 
                  remember some parts of the holy scriptures as the monks out of great compassion 
                  taught them to you. At times you may think, "The Teachings of the Buddha 
                  are so vast and manifold. I can't follow and understand all this and therefore 
                  I canâ€™t attain my goal." Or some people say, "What is true 
                  for oneself one can only know oneself." Or others, "I can't work 
                  because I can't feel the breath yet." Now tell me what is your excuse?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Saying that we have to make a living to maintain our body, 
                  we postpone meditation from the morning to the evening and from the evening 
                  to the morning. In this way we keep delaying putting forth effort.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And what else do people tend to say?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Some say they canâ€™t meditate because of old age and 
                  some are afraid that it will make them ill.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What do those say who are young still?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> That they can't meditate because they have to study. While 
                  they are young and healthy they want to enjoy themselves. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if you are unwell and ill?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Then, sir, we worry. We call the doctor and think about 
                  medicine, but we still don't practise.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And when you have recovered?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We somehow manage to postpone meditation day by day and 
                  let time pass.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But you do actually want to attain happiness, don't you?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, if you really want it, why then postpone striving 
                  for it?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I donâ€™t want it really, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Does this apply to you only or to all of you here?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> There must be some in this audience who really aspire 
                  to attain happiness and others like me who are not so serious about it.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you put forth effort as you are doing now, you will 
                  of course get it. But thoughts and doubts may come up in your minds, "Will 
                  I have to suffer? Will this practice be trying?" You have already acquired 
                  some knowledge of the Buddhaâ€™s Teachings according to your individual 
                  capabilities. Thinking about these, however, will slow down your progress. 
                  So listen well to the Teachings now and practise. If you practise, you will 
                  arrive at your goal, and the reality of it may or may not correspond with 
                  your thoughts about it.</p>
              <p>Only when you know for yourselves will you also know that your thoughts 
                  and speculations about the goal were not correct. All of you know from Dhamma 
                  lectures(2) that if you follow the Teachings of the Buddha, you will get great 
                  happiness in the present and in the future. In fact, you are all preachers 
                  of the Dhamma yourselves. Donâ€™t you think that thinking and speculating 
                  will slow your progress down? If you think and analyse, will every thought 
                  be correct?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you establish your goal as I told you and keep thinking 
                  about your wanting to attain it, will this help?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, will you continue to think and ponder?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If we analyse and think all the time we shall go the wrong 
                  way, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Once we start thinking there will be very many thoughts. 
                  Will much of what we think be of use to us?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is difficult to think useful thoughts. Thoughts often 
                  become quite useless and misleading.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> The community of noble monks has expounded the Teachings 
                  which are real and true to you and still your thoughts are apt to mislead 
                  you. How is this possible?</p>
              <p>But tell me, where are you from? -- You are from Kemmendine. Your house 
                  must have a garden and a fence around it.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, this is correct.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> On which side of the compound is the gate?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I have one gate opening to the south and one opening to 
                  the north, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> How many stories does your house have?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is a single story house, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> On which side do you have your door?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> There are two doors, sir, one in the west wall and one 
                  in the south wall.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, now we know that you live in Kemmendine, that you 
                  have a fence around your garden with gates to the North and South. Your house 
                  is a one story building and has two doors facing South and West respectively. 
                  You see, because you told me, I know everything about your place. Now my knowledge 
                  and your knowledge about your house are about the same, aren't they?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> They cannot be, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But why? You know your village, your garden, and your 
                  house; you told me that you live in Kemmendine; and you described your garden 
                  and your house to me as you know them. Therefore I know your village, your 
                  garden, and your house. I know the reality about it, as you do. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> You don't know it in the same way I know it, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> My dear friend, why should what I know be different from 
                  what you know. Just ask me where you live and I shall reply that you live 
                  in Kemmendine. Furthermore, I know about your garden and house just as you 
                  do. What is there that you can tell me that I donâ€™t know already?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Even if I told you the house number and the street it 
                  is in, you wouldn't be able to find the house, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me then what you know more about this matter than 
                  I do.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I can't tell you more about it, sir, but I know more because 
                  I have actually been there.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> In that case I shall think about it and figure out where 
                  Kemmendine is.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> You can't find out by thinking about it, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> I shall think a lot and for a long time. Some of it is 
                  bound to be right. I will think about a house in Kemmendine with two gates, 
                  two doors, one story. Will some of my findings about your house be correct?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I don't think so, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it that difficult then? Well, I'll think in many different 
                  ways; some of it will turn out right. I shall ponder over this problem for 
                  about one year. Will I find the answer then?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If you just think about it, sir, you won't find it. But 
                  if you please come and look, you will really know for yourself.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now, what if I were to think about it really deeply for 
                  about forty or fifty years? Or - better, if I don't just think but also talk 
                  about it. Will I come to know it then?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Even if you think and talk about it, sir, you will never 
                  get there.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Then please tell me where Kemmendine is.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> From here you would have to walk towards the south-west.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, if I walk in a south-westerly direction, will I get 
                  there?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, you will, but you will still not find my house.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Well I'll begin now. I'll think very deeply and at the 
                  same time I'll recite (your instructions and descriptions). In this way I 
                  will come to know.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, I don't think so.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You tell me that you know all this about your house, but 
                  if I repeat what I know from you, then you tell me that I am talking into 
                  the blue. I cannot bear this.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, you simply repeat what you heard, but you don't actually 
                  know.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, all I say about this house is correct, but he claims 
                  that I still don't know it the way he does. I don't know whether this is true 
                  ... But now if I were to think about it deeply and recite my thoughts, would 
                  there still be a difference in understanding? Or if I were to recite all you 
                  said day and night, would it still not be possible for me to really know?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, you would still not know it in the same way you would 
                  if you went there yourself.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Before you told me about your house I didn't know anything 
                  about it, but now I know something.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, this is true, but if you came to see it you 
                  would know everything about it.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me, if I were to walk according to your directions, 
                  would I arrive at your house?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if I didn't know the house number?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> You would wander aimlessly, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if you go there?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I head straight for my house, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will you worry about how to get there and whether you 
                  are on the right road?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If you come with me, sir, you canâ€™t get lost, because 
                  I have been there before.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> The Buddha taught what he had realized for himself. Now, 
                  all of you have the quality of being able to accept good advice. The Buddha's 
                  Teachings are vast. There is the Suttanta, the Vinaya, and the Abhidhamma.[3] 
                  You need not study all these. Choose one object of meditation, one technique 
                  that suits you, and then work with firm determination. Once you have established 
                  yourselves in this way and you arrive at the goal, all of you will understand 
                  deeply and completely.</p>
              <p>But even now, before I finish speaking, you do get some understanding and 
                  this immediate understanding is called akaliko,[4] immediate understanding.</p>
              <p>Our teachers and parents, who instruct us out of great compassion and love, 
                  tell us: "Learn this and that ...", and when we go to bed at night 
                  they call us and say: "Why didn't you pay respect to the Buddha before 
                  going to bed? Come, pay respect." If we don't follow their instructions, 
                  they may even have to beat us. They have to do this even though they don't 
                  wish to do it. Through their help these resistances in us are overcome. But 
                  of course, we get immediate knowledge of the Buddha-Dhamma only if we are 
                  interested in it ourselves. When does it actually become akaliko, immediate?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Only when we really find the Dhamma, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And when will we really find the Dhamma?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> After having worked for it, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> At what particular time do we have to practise in order 
                  to be successful?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> The hour of the day or night is of no importance. If we 
                  practise and then reach the goal we shall gain immediate knowledge, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is very easy. You have received the Teachings of the 
                  Buddha. All you have to do is to make efforts in the same way the disciples 
                  of the Buddha did. It is easy. This is not my own knowledge. I too have learned 
                  the Teachings of the Buddha and I am passing them on to you. All of you are 
                  very intelligent and bright. What I am telling you, you know already. Why 
                  do you think the Buddha taught the Dhamma?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> He taught people to be continuously aware of mind and 
                  matter. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> He taught so that people who desire to attain the goal 
                  may be able to do so. He taught because he wished them to be able to travel 
                  on the path. But some of you may say that this is not a good time to practise. 
                  The mind is not settled with all this coming and going of people. "We 
                  shall meditate when the mind is tranquil," you may decide. And if the 
                  mind becomes tranquil after some time, what will happen?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> When the mind is calm, we will go to sleep, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh really, and this you call meditation?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, we are only perfect in talking about meditation.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And then, when you have a bad conscience about not having 
                  practised and decide to go to a meditation centre, what do you take along?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We take food with us, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me, after having taken the precepts, do you stuff 
                  yourselves?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir. The ladies offer food and we just eat. We start 
                  early and then we continue eating right up until twelve noon.[5]<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do you eat more than on ordinary days?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Oh yes, sir, much more.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me now, do you stop eating at noon?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Well, you see sir, some say that even then it is all right 
                  to continue eating. Once one stops, then one canâ€™t start again after 
                  twelve noon, but if I started before noon I can continue eating even after 
                  midday, Iâ€™ve heard.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What about you? Do you carry on eating?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I continue eating even while we are talking like this, 
                  sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And what do you do after you have finished eating?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Then my stomach is full, sir, so I lie down flat on my 
                  back.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And then?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Then I sleep, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And when do you wake up again?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> At about three or four P.M., sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do you meditate then, being fully awake and alert?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, then I ask for some juice and lemonade.[6]<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do you drink a lot or just a little?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I drink to the full, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Even if you drink a lot, some will be left over. Do you 
                  share that with others?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, I drink it all myself because I like to keep 
                  it for myself.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But, do you feel good if you drink too much?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, not very good.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me, do you meditate then?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Well, sir, as I don't feel very good I have to lie down.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And then what happens?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I sleep again, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And when do you get up?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> The following morning, sir, when the sun rises. I say 
                  to myself, "Well, look, the sun has risen," and I get up and have 
                  breakfast.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now tell me, if you don't attain Nibbana, do you think 
                  that it is because there is no such person as a fully awakened Buddha and 
                  that Nibbana doesn't exist?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, it's because I eat too much.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Well, you do make some efforts, but this greed is still 
                  a little strong, I think. Tell me, when you start to meditate and someone 
                  whispers near your ear, do you hear it or not?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If the concentration is not so good, we prick up our ears 
                  and listen to what is being whispered, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> When you hear this whispering, do you accept it and respect 
                  the people who are whispering?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, when the determination to meditate is strong, then 
                  I do get angry at the people who are whispering.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Meditators get angry?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If people come and whisper in the place where I'm meditating, 
                  I will of course get angry, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it skilful to get angry and think, "Do they have 
                  to whisper here? Where is this chap from anyway? Who is he?" Will a meditator 
                  who reacts in this way attain his goal quicker? If he becomes angry and then 
                  dies, where will he be reborn?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> He will be reborn in the lower worlds, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Even if he is observing the eight Uposatha precepts?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If he becomes angry, he will go to the lower worlds even 
                  then, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> How should we approach the problem of being disturbed 
                  by whispers while we are meditating? We should reflect in the following way: 
                  "I have come here to meditate. My fellow meditators are whispering and 
                  I hear them. If the others find out that I pay attention to whispers, I will 
                  feel ashamed because all will know then that I don't make sufficient effort. 
                  I shall make more effort." We should be grateful to the people who show 
                  us through their whispering that our effort isn't sufficient. If your effort 
                  is good, your concentration will be good and you wonâ€™t hear anything. 
                  Being grateful, you should hope that these people continue talking and you 
                  should continue to meditate. There is no need to go up to them and actually 
                  say, thank you. Simply continue to meditate and, as your awareness of the 
                  object of meditation becomes continuous, you don't hear disturbances any more. 
                  Would you hear people if they spoke quite loudly?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If they spoke loudly, I think I would hear them, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Again we have to be grateful. "They are telling me 
                  to improve my efforts." Being grateful to those people, I steady my mind 
                  and focus on the spot again. To meditate means to be so closely aware of the 
                  object that it never escapes our attention.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Please, sir, explain to us how to be so closely aware 
                  of the object.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You just have to keep your attention fully collected, 
                  concentrated on the spot. All of you have been breathing ever since the moment 
                  you were born. Can you feel where the air touches as you breathe in and out.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, for me the touch sensation is most evident under 
                  the right nostril.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Not in two places?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, only in one place.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, it touches at this small spot when you breathe in 
                  and when you breathe out. Tell me, does it enter with intervals or is it a 
                  continuous flow?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> There are intervals, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it the stream of air that is interrupted or the awareness 
                  of it? Is the touch of air continuous while you breathe in and out?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is uninterrupted, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Then you have to know this flow of air without interruption. 
                  Don't look elsewhere. Just know this touch of the breath. If you canâ€™t 
                  feel it, then try touching the spot of contact with your finger. When you 
                  know the sensation of touch, then take your finger away and stay with the 
                  awareness of touch-feeling at the spot. You have to become aware of the touch 
                  of air which is continuous as being continuous. If you are aware of this spot 
                  without a gap in the continuity of awareness, will you still hear whispers?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, I don't think so.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If the attention is firmly and steadfastly anchored at 
                  this spot, will you hear loud voices?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You know this spot below the nose above the upper lip 
                  so exclusively that you don't hear sounds any more. Is this spot matter (rupa) 
                  or mind (nama)?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is matter, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And the entity that knows that, is aware, what is it?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> That is mind, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, if you are aware of the spot without interruption, 
                  you are continuously aware of mind and matter, are you not?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, this is true, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you are aware of mind and matter in this way, you know 
                  that there is no self, there is no man, there is no woman, there are no human 
                  beings or Devas or Brahmas. This is what the Buddha taught. If we are aware 
                  of mind and matter, do we still think in terms of human beings, Devas and 
                  Brahmas?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, we don't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it easy to be thus aware?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, it is easy.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is knowing things as they are. Mind and matter arise 
                  without interruption. They arise and then disintegrate. How many times do 
                  they disintegrate in a flash of lightning?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I have heard that they disintegrate one hundred billion 
                  times in the wink of an eye, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me then, how can you count to one hundred billion 
                  in the wink of an eye?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I can't, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Suppose you were given one hundred billion gold coins 
                  and would have to count them, how long would it take you?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I think it would take about a month, sir. Even if I were 
                  to count greedily day and night, it would take about that long.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> The peerless Buddha penetrated all this with his own super-knowledge 
                  and then was able to teach it. But what can we know for ourselves? We can 
                  know mind and matter simultaneously. And what will we get from this awareness? 
                  We will be able to understand the characteristic of their behaviour. You needn't 
                  do anything special. Just practise as you are practising now. Keep your attention 
                  focused on the spot and as you gain the ability to keep your attention with 
                  the awareness of breathing and the spot, mind and matter will talk to you.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Do we have to think of anicca (impermanence) when one 
                  in-breath comes to an end, sir?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is good if you think of anicca as a breath comes to 
                  an end. If you know anicca in this way, will you be able to attain Nibbana?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Not yet, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So if you can't get Nibbana yet, keep concentrating on 
                  the spot and you will come to know.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> What do we have to know as being impermanent, sir?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You say that sugar is sweet, don't you? But if I have 
                  never before tasted sugar, how are you going to explain sweetness to me?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is much better than even palm sugar, sir, but we can't 
                  explain it so that you will really know.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But you have tasted it, so why can't you tell me about

                  salt while they do like sugar. But this won't help you very much, sir. You 
                  have to taste it, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So salt and sugar look similar. Now, if I eat some salt, 
                  calling it sugar, will I taste sugar? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, salt will remain salty.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> In that case I'll think that sugar is salty.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> This is just the same as us not knowing how to recognize

                  are many possibilities of mistaking something else for sugar. Only if you 
                  explain the taste of sugar properly can I understand.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We would like to advise you to eat some sugar, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will you have to sit next to me while I'm eating it and

                  necessary to do this for sugar to be sweet. As soon as you put sugar into 
                  your mouth, you will be able to taste its sweetness, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But let's say there is a jungle bhikkhu who wants to taste 
                  sugar. Will the sugar think: "This is a jungle bhikkhu. I shan't be fully 
                  sweet for him. I shall be only half as sweet for him as I am for people in 
                  towns"?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sugar isn't partial, sir; it is as sweet for one as for 
                  the other.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is just the same with the awareness of mind and matter. 
                  If you keep up this awareness you will taste the Dhamma immediately, just 
                  as you taste sweetness when you eat sugar. Is it possible that you still mistake 
                  salt for sugar? You go to the market so many times and you can easily distinguish 
                  between salt and sugar. You are not going to buy salt for sugar. The peerless 
                  Buddha penetrated the truth and really knew it. He can distinguish between 
                  what is liberation and what is suffering, and therefore he gave this liberation 
                  to human beings, Devas and Brahmas alike. He just asked them to "eat". 
                  Just eat, it is real. Will you remain here without eating, fearing that it 
                  could turn out not to be true liberation?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We haven't reached that point yet, sir. We are just listening 
                  to your words.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Eat as I told you. You will not go wrong. And why canâ€™t 
                  you go wrong? Because mind and matter are actually arising and disintegrating 
                  continuously.</p>
              <p>Why should you concentrate on the spot, though you don't know liberation 
                  yet? If you don't eat something, will you ever know what it tastes like? You 
                  know a lot about the Dhamma. You know about nama and rupa; you know what the 
                  Suttas are and you know about the Vinaya and the Abhidhamma. You know this 
                  is Samatha, this is Vipassana.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> But, sir, all this is mixed up in our head like a giant 
                  hodgepodge.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Let it be a mix up. Pay attention to this spot only, as 
                  I taught you. Later this mix up will be disentangled, everything will fall 
                  into place. If we go east we will get to a place in the east; if we go west 
                  we will arrive at a place in the west. The spot is like a vehicle. If you 
                  want to go to Mandalay, you have to board a train to Mandalay and stay on 
                  it. The spot is like the train; don't leave it. Keep your attention focused 
                  on it very closely. This is all I have to say. There is nothing to be said 
                  apart from this.</p>
              <p>Do you know the eight constituents of the Eightfold Noble Path? How do you 
                  think they apply to this practice of concentrating on the spot?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If one concentrates on the spot with right concentration 
                  then one attains the knowledge of right view, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Are the other elements of the Noble Eightfold Path pertinent 
                  to this practice?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, the eight constituents of the Noble Eightfold Path 
                  are:[7] 1) Right view; 2) Right thought; 3) Right speech; 4) Right action; 
                  5) Right livelihood; 6) Right effort; 7) Right mindfulness; 8) Right concentration. 
                  When our mind is fixed on the spot, we don't think unskilful thoughts in any 
                  way. Therefore right thought is there, sir. As we are not talking at all, 
                  we donâ€™t speak lies and therefore there is right speech. As awareness 
                  of breathing is a good action, right action is included in this practice. 
                  There is right livelihood too, as we are not trying to make a living by deceiving 
                  others, sir. We are putting our entire effort into keeping our attention at 
                  the spot, so there is right effort. Because we focus our attention on the 
                  breath without letting go, we have right attentiveness and, as the attention 
                  remains at the spot without wandering here and there, we have attained right 
                  concentration.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, do you think this is like a boat or a train?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, it is like a boat, a train or a cart or car 
                  that takes a person to his goal.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do not leave this vehicle, do you understand? Keep your 
                  attention firmly focused here, on the spot, and never leave this spot. In 
                  this way you will reach your goal.</p>
              <p>Sometimes you may become impatient travelling on the train to Mandalay and 
                  think, "I want to go to Mandalay, but is this train really going there 
                  or is it going to Rangoon?" If this happens, will you get off? Don't! 
                  Continue on your journey and you will see that you will eventually arrive 
                  in Mandalay.</p>
              <p>If you get fed up and bored, don't leave the train. When you are enjoying 
                  yourselves don't get down. When you are ill, stay on the train and stay also 
                  when you are strong and healthy. When you have plenty of company, stay. When 
                  you are all alone, don't leave. When people say unpleasant things to you, 
                  persist, and when they speak to you respectfully, don't get off your train. 
                  What would you do if people were to hit you because they donâ€™t like you?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, I think I would run away.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Just keep your attention on the spot. Even if robbers 
                  hit you, they can't strike down this awareness.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> True, sir, but I think this awareness would go if they 
                  struck me. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Not necessarily. Our Bodhisatta,[8] in one of his lives, 
                  became the king of monkeys.[9] One day he found a brahman who had fallen down 
                  a precipice in the jungle and was helpless and certainly going to die down 
                  there. This brahman was lamenting his fate and crying, "Oh poor me, I 
                  have fallen into a chasm a hundred yards deep. I shall certainly die down 
                  here. Oh poor me, oh, oh, oh... My relatives and friends, my wife and children, 
                  don't know about my misfortune. Nobody is here to help me. Oh, oh ...," 
                  and he cried.</p>
              <p>Now, noble beings are always concerned with the welfare of all beings, without 
                  exception. And as the Bodhisatta is such a noble being, he who was then the 
                  monkey king felt pity for the brahman in the same way he would have felt pity 
                  for his own children. And so he climbed down the precipice and went up to 
                  the brahman. "Do not fear, do not despair, I won't let you die. I shall 
                  take you back to the place you want to go," he said to the brahman to 
                  reassure him and to cheer him up. And he meant it too. But he wasn't ready 
                  yet to put him on his shoulders and carry him up the rocks, because he was 
                  afraid that he might fall and that the brahman might be hurt. He took a big 
                  rock of about the same weight as the brahman, put it on one shoulder and tried 
                  to carry it up the precipice, jumping from rock to rock. Only after having 
                  passed this test did he carefully take the brahman on his shoulders and climbed 
                  back up jumping from one boulder to the next.</p>
              <p>After this great effort, the monkey king was exhausted. He was happy while 
                  performing this good action, but he was still happier when he had accomplished 
                  it and had saved a life. He was confident that the brahman he had saved from 
                  certain death was trustworthy, and said, "After carrying you up, I am 
                  a little tired. Please keep watch for a while so that I can rest," and 
                  he placed his head in the brahman's lap thinking himself well protected from 
                  all the dangers of the jungle. But while the king of the monkeys slept, the 
                  brahman thought, "I shall go back home soon, but I have nothing to give 
                  to my wife and children. I shall kill this big monkey and give his flesh to 
                  them as a gift." He took the rock the Bodhisatta had carried up for the 
                  test-run and dealt the Bodhisatta's head a deadly blow. He didn't do this 
                  hesitatingly, feeling sorry for his saviour, but he hit him hard, so as to 
                  kill him with the first blow.</p>
              <p>When the Bodhisatta felt the pain of the blow, he quickly climbed the next 
                  tree and he asked himself who or what had attacked him. He then saw that there 
                  was no enemy around, but that the brahman himself had tried to kill him and 
                  he thought to himself: "Yes, there are people like this in the world 
                  too." As the Bodhisatta was thinking this, the brahman started lamenting 
                  again, exclaiming that he was lost in this big jungle and that he would perish 
                  after all. But the monkey king said to him, speaking from the tree, "Don't 
                  worry; don't be afraid. I have promised to take you back to your home and 
                  I shall not break this promise. I shall take you home. I can't carry you on 
                  my shoulder any more, but as you opened my skull, there is blood dripping 
                  to the ground continuously. Just follow the track of blood I shall make for 
                  you from up in the trees."</p>
              <p>This is how the Bodhisatta acted. He took all this on himself, because his 
                  goal was Omniscience, Buddhahood. He worked on all the ten paramis.</p>
              <p>Did the Bodhisatta turn away from accomplishing the good deed he had undertaken 
                  to complete because he was afraid that the man who had attempted to take his 
                  life might try again to kill him? Did he abandon him in the jungle?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, the Bodhisatta lead the brahman home with great 
                  loving kindness, in order to perfect his paramis.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You see, if one aspires to omniscient Buddhahood, he has 
                  to fulfil the perfections, the ten paramis in this way, without ever taking 
                  a break, without ever resting. Otherwise he can't attain Buddhahood. Do you 
                  understand? He never rests, he never becomes lax, he works on the ten perfections 
                  all the time.</p>
              <p>You told me only a moment ago that you couldn't keep up your awareness if 
                  robbers attacked you and tried to kill you?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I couldn't keep it up as yet, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But you are aspiring to awakening, aren't you?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, I am.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you want it you can achieve it. If you keep your attention 
                  focused as I taught you, you will get much out of it, even if people should 
                  hit you, pound you, and destroy you. Have you heard the story of Tissa Thera?[10]<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, I haven't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tissa Thera received the Teachings of the Buddha and appreciating 
                  their value he thought: "Now I can't continue living in this grand style," 
                  and he gave all his possessions to his younger brother. Then he became a monk 
                  and went to live and meditate in the jungle with his begging bowl and his 
                  set of three robes.</p>
              <p>Now his brother's wife thought: "It is very enjoyable to possess all 
                  the riches of my husband's older brother. If he remains a monk we shall have 
                  these riches for the rest of our life. But maybe he will not attain awakening, 
                  and then he will possibly return to lay-life. So, I had best have him killed." 
                  And she gave money to some robbers and said to them, "Go and kill Tissa 
                  Thera. I shall give you more money after you have completed the job."</p>
              <p>So, the robbers went to the forest where Tissa Thera lived and grabbed him. 
                  He said, "I don't possess anything, but if you want to take my bowl and 
                  my robes, please do so."</p>
              <p>"We only want to kill you" the robbers replied. "Your brother's 
                  wife gave us money to kill you and she will give us more still after we completed 
                  the job. That is why we have to kill you."</p>
              <p>Tissa Thera thought, "I am not emancipated from suffering yet," 
                  and he felt ashamed of himself. He said to the robbers, "Yes, yes, you 
                  have to kill me, but please give me until dawn and then only make an end to 
                  my life."</p>
              <p>The bandits replied, "Everyone is afraid of death, and if this monk 
                  escapes, we shall not get our money."</p>
              <p>"You don't trust me?" Tissa Thera asked. "Well, I shall make 
                  you trust me." And he took a rock and smashed both his legs. Then he 
                  said, "Now I can't run away any more, so, please don't kill me until 
                  dawn."</p>
              <p>Though the robbers were very rough people, due to the loving kindness of 
                  Tissa Thera, they felt compassion and decided to let him live until daybreak.</p>
              <p>Tissa Thera admonished himself: "Venerable Tissa, there is not much 
                  time left, dawn is close. Put forth effort!" He put forth strong effort 
                  in the practice of the Buddhaâ€™s Teachings and as he worked with a steady 
                  mind, dawn arrived. As the sun rose, he fulfilled his aspiration and attained 
                  happiness. "I have attained release from the cycle of birth and death!" 
                  he rejoiced. He then woke the robbers and said, "The day has dawned, 
                  rise and come!" And he was full of joy. Now, was Tissa Thera a real disciple 
                  of the Buddha, an Arahat?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes sir, he was.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Who has faster development do you think, someone who meditates

                  your legs.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We shall work hard in the way you taught us, sir. We are 
                  emulating Visakha[11] and Anathapindika,[12] sir. It says in the scriptures 
                  that they are enjoying a good life in the Deva planes now[13] and we would 
                  like to have that same type of enjoyment also, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> They are enjoying a good life after having attained a 
                  lot. But you have not attained to the same stage yet, have you? Are you really 
                  doing as they did? Anathapindika went to Rajagaha as a banker on business. 
                  Only when he reached there did he come to know that a Buddha had arisen in 
                  the world. He didn't go to Rajagaha to meditate or to pay respects to the 
                  Buddha. But when he was told about the Buddha, he went to him immediately, 
                  in the middle of the night. He had to leave the city walls to go to the place 
                  where the Buddha resided. When he stood before the Buddha, he attained what 
                  he had aspired for. If someone drops everything and hurries to the Buddha 
                  in the middle of the night, is the effort of that person great or small? Do 
                  you think he ever let go of the Buddha as the object of his mind while on 
                  the way to him?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, he didn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now, tell me about yourselves.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We lose the awareness of the object while we walk, or 
                  while we think and so on, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you want to become like Anathapindika, you have to 
                  strive as he strove.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> </p>

              <h2>Discourse VI</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"><strong> WEBU SAYADAW: </strong><br> You have taken the precepts. Now that you have undertaken the practice of the 
                perfection of morality, fulfil it.</p>
              <p>What you realize when you penetrate the Four Noble Truths is called bodhi. 
                  You are born at a good time and in a good form of existence. Now then, emulate 
                  the wise disciples of the Buddha and put forth effort as strong as theirs, 
                  so that you may attain the awakening to which you aspired. Those who received 
                  the Teachings from the Buddha himself worked ceaselessly in all four postures[1] 
                  and thus attained enlightenment.</p>
              <p>The human beings, Devas and Brahmas who achieved their aspiration[2] on 
                  just one occasion cannot be counted in hundreds, thousands, hundred of thousands, 
                  or millions. Sometimes in one split second, an incalculably large number of 
                  beings achieved their aspirations. From the time the Buddha attained full 
                  awakening, beings have been able to attain Nibbana. But it is not only during 
                  the lifetime of the Buddha that beings can attain Nibbana; Nibbana can be 
                  attained as long as the teachings of the Buddha are available.</p>
              <p>The attainment of Nibbana is not bliss just for a brief moment. It will 
                  have lasting effects for the rest of the round of birth and death (samsara). 
                  What the Buddha taught is the way out of suffering. You don't have to know 
                  a vast amount. If you practise one technique properly, with strong and steadfast 
                  effort, you will come to know for yourselves that you are people of great 
                  strength. You will not have to ask others about the Teachings, and you will 
                  not even have to tell others that you are practising.</p>
              <p>Once you have established effort, you will not only know what good teachers 
                  told you, but you will clearly know for yourselves how the viriya-iddhipada 
                  factor arises in a split second.</p>
              <p>You have the good quality of being able to follow the good advice of the 
                  Buddha as his disciples did in the past.</p>
              <p>When I increase effort, then the viriya-iddhipada factor will increase also. 
                  And then what will happen? I will think: "With just this much effort, 
                  the viriya-iddhipada factor has arisen to this extent. But my energy is not 
                  exhausted yet. There is still more. I shall increase my effort further." 
                  And the will to increase effort will arise. At this same instant, effort increases. 
                  As effort increases, the viriya-iddhipada factor becomes stronger. When these 
                  factors have thus risen to a very high standard, then all your aspirations 
                  can be fulfilled.</p>
              <p>Do not take rest. Do not take breaks or time off. Work continuously. If 
                  you develop continuously, you will become happier and happier. In this way 
                  the disciples of the Buddha became very happy, never getting enough of this 
                  happiness. Do you understand?</p>
              <p>If a king rules over a country, does he say complacently, "This one 
                  country is sufficient for me"?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>DISCIPLE:</strong> <br> No, sir, he doesn't remain satisfied. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if he rules a whole continent and has become emperor, 
                  is he satisfied then? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, he isn't. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If he isn't satisfied, what will he do? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> He will try to acquire more and more territory, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> When a man is emperor over a continent, he wants the whole 
                  world. When he gets the whole world, he wants to become a Universal Monarch.[3] 
                  Once he is a Universal Monarch will he say, "This is enough" and 
                  be satisfied? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, he will not be satisfied. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> All those who are perfect in their faith and have performed 
                  the highest form of generosity and demonstrated the greatest form of respect 
                  canâ€™t be satisfied. They will practise meditation and will gradually 
                  attain the stages of awakening (samapatti). Once they are able to enter into 
                  the states of Nibbana, only this happiness will count for them.</p>
              <p>Nibbana is the highest and noblest form of happiness there is. It is said 
                  that one can never experience enough of the highest and noblest form of happiness. 
                  And not only the direct disciples of the Buddha were able to achieve it; if 
                  you put forth continuous effort to the same extent that the wise of old did, 
                  you too will experience this highest happiness, even now. Then you will know, 
                  "I experienced a happiness that doesn't last only for a moment, or just 
                  for a lifetime, but for the remainder of the cycle of birth and death. And 
                  why did I attain this happiness? Because I was born into the right form of 
                  existence, because I was born at the right time, because I put forth strong 
                  effort."</p>
              <p>At any time when human beings, Devas and Brahmas accepted and practised 
                  the Teachings, they were successful. In this context, "At any time" 
                  means that whenever one undertakes this practice, he obtains understanding. 
                  The time span in which the Teachings of the Buddha are available is very important 
                  and special: if you want to attain Nibbana you can do so at any time; it is 
                  easy now.</p>
              <p>Donâ€™t say, "This is not my cup of tea. This isn't suitable for 
                  me. I wonâ€™t get anything out of this". You have noble aspirations 
                  and you can fulfil them now. So if you say to yourselves, "I shall take 
                  up the practice right now," don't you think you can get real understanding? 
                  You can get it practising in a group or by yourself. Seek for yourself. Take 
                  up one of the techniques the Buddha taught and practise it with one-pointedness 
                  and strong effort. Establish awareness of in-breath and out-breath and the 
                  spot where the air touches while you are breathing in and out.</p>
              <p>When you are thus aware of the spot, can there still be worry, anxiety, 
                  and fear? Can there still be greed, aversion, and delusion?[4] And, when you 
                  concentrate your mind in this way, you revere the Teachings, don't you?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You will understand that the degree to which you come 
                  out of suffering depends on how much effort you put in and on how strongly 
                  the viriya-iddhipada factor arises out of this effort. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We understand, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> There will be no more room for doubt because you have 
                  now practised the technique and experienced it for yourselves, and so you 
                  know it. You will think, "Even in such a short time am I able to come 
                  out of suffering immediately to such an extent, but my strength is not yet 
                  exhausted." And the will to exert still more effort arises, and you will 
                  become happy with a happiness of which you never tire.</p>
              <p>Now, tell me. There is such a thing as a Universal Monarch in the world, 
                  isn't there? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, there is. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> When the time is right for a Universal Monarch to arise, 
                  will no one notice this fact? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We don't know, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> About one hundred years before the Universal Monarch arises 
                  the good news goes around and a commotion arises. Then all are setting their 
                  hopes and yearnings on the Universal Monarch. They are happy and when he is 
                  born they rejoice.</p>
              <p>What are the circumstances necessary for a Universal Monarch to arise? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Only when the "Jewel of the Wheel"[5] arrives, 
                  sir, can someone become a Universal Monarch. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, before the Jewel of the Wheel arises he is called 
                  the embryo Universal Monarch, but even then his authority, wealth and power 
                  are considerable. Will he say, "Let the Jewel of the Wheel not arise; 
                  what I have got is quite enough for me!"? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, he won't. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And why not? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Because he wants to become still greater through the arisal 
                  of the Jewel of the Wheel. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, when will the Jewel of the Wheel come? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It will come at the right time, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> The Jewel of the Wheel arises due to the merit the embryo 
                  Universal Monarch has accumulated. But there are still duties for him, and 
                  having understood these duties and keeping them in mind, he has to fulfil 
                  them.</p>
              <p>Now say there is an embryo Universal Monarch. His merit is ripe, but he 
                  doesn't fulfil the duties that are the final cause for his becoming a Universal 
                  Monarch. Will the Jewel of the Wheel arise of its own accord? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, it will not arise by itself, I think. He will 
                  have to exercise himself further. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now let's say you were the embryo Universal Monarch waiting 
                  for the Jewel of the Wheel to arise so that you will reign over the whole 
                  world. You will still have to practise further. You have to keep sila. But 
                  would you say, "Well, I don't need the Jewel of the Wheel any more. I 
                  am quite satisfied with the riches and splendour I have attained."? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You will not give up at this point, because if you become 
                  a Universal Monarch you will be able to reign according to the Dhamma so that 
                  the whole world will be happy. Do you think the people of your provinces will 
                  say to you, "Oh embryo Universal Monarch, you have got enough power"? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, certainly not. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, what will the people say? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> "Work hard and fulfil your duties," they will 
                  say, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And why is this? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Because they want the Jewel of the Wheel to arise, sir. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, you see, because of the power of the Wheel of the 
                  Universal Monarch, all will experience many different types of happiness. 
                  But when one has become a Universal Monarch, will this give him results for 
                  the rest of the cycle of birth and death? How long can he be Universal Monarch? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Only as long as the Jewel of the Wheel is there, sir. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, even a Universal Monarch can be on his throne at 
                  best for one life span, but now the Buddha's Teachings are available. If all 
                  the good beings who have taken birth in a happy existence take up the practice 
                  of the Buddha's teachings, they can attain awakening as they aspired to in 
                  the past. But it is as with the embryo Universal Monarch: he doesn't become 
                  a Universal Monarch by just enjoying the royal splendour that he has already 
                  achieved; he will only become a universal ruler when he has fulfilled the 
                  duties and disciplines necessary to obtain the Jewel of the Wheel.</p>
              <p>Now, approximately when do you want to attain Nibbana?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Very soon, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What does that mean? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Now, immediately, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, you are going to attain it right now? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If it's possible, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Well, at the time you accept it, you will reach it. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> One can get it only when the ten perfections (paramis) 
                  are completed, fulfilled, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You still don't understand. We were talking about the 
                  embryo Universal Monarch just now. He attained that point because of his fulfilling 
                  the ten paramis. This fulfilment of the paramis means that he can become a 
                  Universal Monarch for certain. But when will he become a Universal Monarch? 
                  When he has fulfilled the practices and duties that cause the arising of the 
                  Jewel of the Wheel. So, if he undertakes these, the jewel will arise. Now, 
                  don't tell me you want Nibbana. If you practise now, you will realize it now. 
                  Will you take up practising? But then don't get up after some time and run 
                  away.</p>
              <p>If you want to become sovereign rulers, what do you have to do? You have 
                  to master all the arts that are required of an accomplished prince and princess. 
                  So what do you think you have to master as sons and daughters of the Buddha? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We have to master sila, samadhi, and panna, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What do you have to do to become a king? You have to study 
                  and practise the eighteen arts a king has to master. You have to learn about 
                  war-elephants, strategy, how to overcome enemies, and so forth. Once you have 
                  learned all this, what will you do when you encounter enemies? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We'll attack them, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> There are enemies who obstruct our progress towards Nibbana, 
                  and if we want to get there, we have to fight them. Will you fight them after 
                  having equipped yourselves with weapons? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You will have to sit for a long time. Once the battle 
                  starts, you have to fight for real. Once you have deployed your troops in 
                  the battlefield, you will have to go ahead. Only if you prevail will you become 
                  a king. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We shall fight, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Good, go ahead. Donâ€™t get up and run away, even if 
                  time seems long. If you fight well, you will become a sovereign king.</p>
              <p>During the time of the Buddha, people learned the Teachings from the Buddha 
                  himself. The Buddha simply taught how to defeat all forms of ignorance. Do 
                  you think that all those who listened to his words and then practised accordingly 
                  repulsed ignorance? They really refuted all forms of ignorance and therefore 
                  they were victorious. They attained supreme happiness. Establish yourselves 
                  in effort and all your aspirations will be realized. You are well equipped 
                  with weapons for the battle, aren't you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And you will fight, won't you? Your enemies do attack 
                  and they attack often and with full force. Are sloth, torpor, and laziness 
                  friends or enemies? What do you do when they come? I think it has been some 
                  time since you fought a battle? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Quite some time, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me about the weapons you will have to use, and how 
                  you have to fight. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We have to fight for one hour every day, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Only one hour a day? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We can't even always manage that much, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Look here! Is this because the weapons are soft or because 
                  the warriors are soft? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We are soft, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Are princes and princesses who want to become rulers soft 
                  too? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. They can't be because soft princes are defeated. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But these princes here, are they people with strength 
                  and fortitude or are they soft? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We are soft, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> As sons and daughters of the Buddha do you want to become 
                  sovereigns of Nibbana or do you want to remain princes and princesses? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We all want to become rulers, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> The weapon you have is good; so attack! But only if you 
                  hold the weapons properly will the enemy fear you. I think you don't hold 
                  the weapon properly. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We do attack, sir, but our way of attack is weak. Out 
                  of compassion give us a powerful weapon, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> I can only give you the weapon. This weapon will not do 
                  anything; only if you take this weapon and make use of it can you win. No 
                  weapon is weak, and you don't have just one. You have a whole store of weapons. 
                  If I were to enumerate them, it would become a long list. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, we fail because we have so many weapons. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> No, it's because you don't fight. You have to fight. Do 
                  you understand? Don't you want to become sovereign kings? Do you want to stay 
                  princes and princesses? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We try hard, sir, but we never succeed. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, yes, but the weapon is all right. You don't succeed 
                  because you don't fight. You are talking like most people. You meditate, you 
                  put forth effort, but in spite of that you sound as if there was no effort. 
                  There is so much energy in you, but you don't use it. You do have energy. 
                  If you put all your stock of energy to use, you will assuredly become real 
                  sons and daughters of the Buddha, become kings by attaining Nibbana. Sons 
                  and daughters of the Buddha have the ability to accept instructions, make 
                  effort and follow the Teachings of the Buddha. All who practise the Teachings, 
                  be they humans, Devas or Brahmas, can fulfil their different aspirations for 
                  Nibbana. Even if you keep up the awareness of in- breath and out-breath throughout 
                  only one day, you will understand much. You may say that you have been meditating 
                  for so many years, but have you really ever been able to keep your mind focused 
                  for a full day? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> By one day I mean a day and a night, twenty-four hours. 
                  Now, do this: practise the Teachings of the Buddha to the full for one day 
                  and one night. If you have done this once, you will all be able to appreciate 
                  the value of just one single day. Some of you may have been practising for 
                  twenty or thirty years and some even longer. But just examine yourselves. 
                  Have you really, having established yourselves in complete effort, fulfilled 
                  one single day in practice? Have you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, we haven't. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And why have you never devoted yourselves fully for one 
                  whole day? You do have the energy required, donâ€™t you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You don't use the energy you have in the right place. 
                  You waste it for no purpose. Are you still going to shows and entertainments? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir. We watch a pwe[6] all night until dawn, without 
                  sleeping. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> How many nights in a row do you do this? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> About two or three nights, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> How many shows have you seen in all? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I can't remember, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You see; there you have plenty of energy. Day and night. 
                  There your effort is strong. Now, how many times have you observed the Uposatha 
                  precepts?[7] <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Many times, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> I mean, how many days have you observed the eight Uposatha 
                  precepts day and night? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We have observed them ever since we were children, sir. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> How many days altogether? A day I call a day and a night, 
                  twenty-four hours. Do you get a full day of Uposatha observances, if you look 
                  at it like this? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, we don't. We observed them about half a day at 
                  a time, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Have you fulfilled them to the utmost during that half 
                  day? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We are unable to do that, sir. We started this morning, 
                  sir and shall keep it up until tomorrow. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You do have the will to work, but you don't usually use 
                  it for this noble purpose, but rather to watch pwes. If you die while watching 
                  a pwe, where will you go? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> To the lower world, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do you want that? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Even if you don't want it, it has great power over you, 
                  doesn't it? If you were to really observe the Uposatha day, with full effort 
                  for the whole day, could you not then fulfil your aspirations? If you keep 
                  up the practice on an Uposatha day, you will understand, you will come to 
                  know something.</p>
              <p>The real disciples of the Buddha take sila on Uposatha days, and then they 
                  immediately take the object and firmly keep their attention fixed on it. Now 
                  if your attention is so firmly fixed on an object, can sloth, torpor or laziness 
                  disturb you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, they can't. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If our attention is firmly established on in-breath and 
                  out-breath and the point of contact, do we still hear other people's conversation? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What if someone speaks very loudly? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It doesn't disturb us, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> There is no wanting, aversion or delusion. If our minds 
                  are thus purged of greed, aversion, and ignorance, will there still be loneliness, 
                  depression, and laziness? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do we still miss company? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do we still want to know what others are saying? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If someone comes and invites us out, are we excited? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> We shall not jealously guard what we have. Good people 
                  are not like that. We share it with those with whom we live. "May they 
                  also get what I have got." Now, what will happen if all of you establish 
                  strong effort from sunrise to sunset, without a break. This is a long time-span, 
                  from sunrise to sunset. But will you feel it to be long? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You will think"Today the time went so quickly! We 
                  observed Uposatha and the time just flew! And I really don't know why this 
                  day was so short." And after sunset you will again establish awareness 
                  of the object and then day will break and you still continue with the awareness 
                  of the spot below the nose, above the upper lip until it is light. Without 
                  interruption. And you will wonder, "How did this night pass so quickly; 
                  now it is day again!"</p>
              <p>This is how they used to practise on Uposatha days. When the direct disciples 
                  of the Buddha undertook to practise for a day, they practised for twenty-four 
                  hours. And when day came, they were still not satisfied and said, "In 
                  the long cycle of birth and death we have been doing all those other things 
                  for a long time, but not this." And they continued their work without 
                  wavering. Do you have days like this? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Our days contain some interruptions, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If someone keeps Uposatha, and his mind wanders here and 
                  there-just anybody, I don't mean you-so his mind flits around here and there. 
                  But he is at a pagoda or under a holy Bodhi-tree, and say he dies at that 
                  moment. What will happen to this worshipper? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> He will go to the lower worlds, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> How many lower planes are there? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> There are four lower planes, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What are they? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Hell, the animal world, the plane of the hungry ghosts,

                  But if you practise until it is light, you will have done half a day. What

                  there is nothing else to do. Very good. Will you stay here now that you have 
                  undertaken to keep the Uposatha days? Wonâ€™t you want to go away? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We shall do our best, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you say, "We shall do our best," will there 
                  be no disturbances coming in? Will no enemy attack? Only if you really mean 
                  it are the enemies afraid. If you are firm, they run. You know about Maha-Kassapa, 
                  don't you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, we have heard about him. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> He met the Buddha and then practised what the Buddha taught 
                  in order to escape from suffering. There are four bodily postures: sitting, 
                  standing, walking, and lying down. Which of these is prone to let in the enemy? 
                  Laziness and sloth come in while lying down, and they come to stay, don't 
                  they? If we indulge in laziness and sloth, shall we be able to develop in 
                  morality, concentration, and wisdom? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, we shan't. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Laziness and torpor are our enemies. Therefore Maha-Kassapa 
                  rejected these postures in which the enemy attacks and adopted the other three 
                  postures in which the enemy canâ€™t remain for long.</p>
              <p>There are thirteen ascetic practices and Maha-Kassapa practised all thirteen. 
                  Only those among the disciples of Buddha with the strongest determination 
                  practised the sitter's practice, that is, did not lie down for twenty-four 
                  hours a day. If one takes up the sitter's practice and makes the strong determination 
                  not to sleep, this sloth and laziness can't overpower him. Though these noble 
                  disciples of the Buddha neither lay down nor slept, they lived long and were 
                  very healthy.</p>
              <p>Do you fight wars? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, we do. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now, you are going to start your meditation. What preparations 
                  do you have to make? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We have to spread out our mat.[9] <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you spread out your mat before starting your meditation, 
                  soon someone will come along. Who do you think that will be? Do you think 
                  laziness and sleepiness will come your way? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If they come, sir, I shall lie down and sleep. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What will you say to them? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I won't say anything, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You will say, "Ha, now only you come; I got the mat 
                  ready a long time ago." And what are you going to do then? You are going 
                  to lie down flat on your back and sleep. If you do this, will you be able 
                  to fulfil your aspiration for Nibbana? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you practise without sleeping, you are establishing 
                  full effort and are always keeping your attention firmly fixed on the object, 
                  day and night. If you practise in this way, your morality, your concentration 
                  and control over the mind, and your insight and wisdom will become stronger 
                  and stronger. They will develop from moment to moment.</p>
              <p>If you watch a pwe all night, you will feel tired in the morning. But if 
                  you practise the Teachings of the Buddha all night, you will experience happiness 
                  and joy without end, and you will not feel sleepy. Do you understand? ... 
                  The Buddha taught this; it is not my teaching. If you follow the Teachings 
                  of the Buddha and donâ€™t rest until you understand it completely, you 
                  will really know.</p>
              <p>If people tell you, "This shade is cool," don't simply believe 
                  them, but try it out for yourselves. If you just repeat, "It is cool, 
                  it is cool ...," because others say so, you don't really know about its 
                  coolness; you merely talk about it. If someone just babbles along, he doesn't 
                  show appreciation. But if someone speaks from experience, then will he not 
                  be able to speak with deep appreciation and radiant happiness and love?</p>
              <p>So pay attention and practise. If you practise, you will reach your goal. 
                  Not just hundreds, not thousands, not tens of thousands, not hundreds of thousands; 
                  all who follow the Teachings will master them.</p>
              <p>When you start to meditate you still have to check: Is everything arranged? 
                  Is there a place to sleep at night, and one to rest during the day? Only when 
                  all this is in order, will you meditate. Isnâ€™t that so?</p>
              <p>If you act in this way, you nourish your enemy, you call him a friend; you 
                  love him. Once you recognize your enemy as such, do you still associate with 
                  him? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What do you do if he comes? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We check him and defend ourselves. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> How do you defend yourselves? Will you attack him? Will 
                  you mount a full attack? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We shall repulse him, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> How do you repulse him? Softly, so that he doesn't get 
                  hurt? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We shall ward him off immediately so that he can't even 
                  come back. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, carry on. Cut him off and throw him overboard so 
                  that he can't ever come back. Well then, what will you do when tiredness and 
                  laziness really arise? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I shall probably fall asleep, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What about others in the audience? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I don't know, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will you recognize the enemy and destroy him? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Just so, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Very good. I shall give you a simile. If a man sleeps 
                  a deep sleep and you wake him up, he will awake quickly. If you try to wake 
                  up someone who pretends to sleep, you will not be successful. Why is this 
                  so? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> The more one works on him the more he pretends to sleep. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. Now what about you; are you really fast asleep or 
                  do you pretend to sleep? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I don't know, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you are really asleep, you will simply get up when 
                  I wake you up. Will you get up? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, and after getting up, you will go back to sleep, 
                  I think. But I'm not sure about that. I only think so. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I shall work hard as you instruct me, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Put forth effort and you will become perfect. You have 
                  all you need.</p>
              <p>All of you have acquired the elements of insight and renunciation. Because 
                  of this, you now esteem the Teachings of the Buddha; you want to fulfil and 
                  practise them. If the accumulation of the perfection of renunciation is small, 
                  your ears will be blocked to the Teachings of the Buddha. For instance, if 
                  somebody tells you to come to this place, you don't want to come because you 
                  are bored by this. But now you are attracted by this teaching. All you need 
                  now is the same amount of effort that the noble disciples of the Buddha made.</p>
              <p>When you begin to practise you may worry, "If I sit just for one or 
                  two hours, I am aching and stiff. How can I possibly sit for a whole day and 
                  night? I think that's quite impossible." Don't you worry like this? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, I don't. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Though you may not worry now, it will come up. But don't 
                  worry in this way. The Buddha didn't teach suffering. He taught the way leading 
                  to happiness. You may not believe this because you think your own thoughts. 
                  But you have to work with full effort and without wavering. Now, when you 
                  meditate with full effort, the viriya-iddhipada factor will arise. You will 
                  understand this. But when you sit, all of you feel some discomfort, donâ€™t 
                  you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, we do. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Even if you are aching and stiff, there is a place where 
                  there is no pain. There is sleepiness, and there is also a place where there 
                  is no sleepiness. What do you do when you are drowsy? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I go to sleep, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do you ever get enough sleep? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, I do. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But you sleep every day, and now you want to sleep again? 
                  So you haven't actually had enough yet. If you sleep every day, you will never 
                  get enough sleep. So when you feel sleepy, make an effort to reach the place 
                  where there is no sleepiness and then you will need no more sleep. Get up 
                  and walk up and down. Keep your attention at the spot where the air touches 
                  when you breathe in and out. If you keep it fixed on this spot with full effort, 
                  at some time you will find the place of no sleep. There is no "I shan't 
                  find it," there is only a "I haven't got there yet." You will 
                  get it.</p>
              <p>If you sleep and postpone meditation until you are rested, you will wake 
                  up when it is light and there will be no time left to meditate. I am just 
                  telling you what the Buddha taught. There is nothing I know. Everything the 
                  Buddha taught is true.</p>
              <p>All of you have to make a living, work, toil, and shoulder burdens, don't 
                  you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So let us be simple. You breathe, don't you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, we do. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, simply be aware of the in-breath, the out-breath and 
                  the point below the nose where the air touches. It goes in and out without 
                  interruption, doesn't it?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, that's right. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Only when your attention wanders away is the continuity 
                  broken. And then, don't allow your attention to follow the breath. Your attention 
                  should always remain with this small spot. When you keep your attention there 
                  at the spot, your respiration will become soft and subtle. Once it has become 
                  subtle, you donâ€™t have to make it rough again. The Buddha taught that 
                  we have to make the rough and harsh subtle and fine. The Buddha didn't say 
                  that we should make the subtle rough. When you feel the spot, touching it 
                  with your finger, your attention will not wander to other objects. Can't you 
                  fix your attention firmly on the spot with the breathing? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I can, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will greed, aversion and delusion still arise when your 
                  attention is focused on the spot? When you are well concentrated, even for 
                  a short moment, your mind is cleansed of greed, aversion, and delusion for 
                  that short moment. Can't you keep your attention fixed on the spot for a longer 
                  time-span? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, I can. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, make a strong effort and keep your attention here. 
                  If you keep it there, is there any drowsiness or laziness disturbing you? 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> They don't come up, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But what will happen if you reduce your effort? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Laziness will come in, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Sloth and laziness will come and your concentration will 
                  become weak. This is because youâ€™re at the beginning; later it will improve. 
                  And then you should view this laziness as a friend, not as an enemy, and you 
                  will get used to it. Though it comes you will not get lazy any more. When 
                  we feel sleepy, we say, "This is good. Now I want to find the place where 
                  one doesn't feel sleepy quickly. Then there will be an end to sleeping." 
                  Work, fix your attention firmly on the spot as I just instructed you, and 
                  when your limbs ache, know: "The only way out of this is to get to a 
                  place where there is no pain." Now, if the discomfort becomes very intense, 
                  is it too difficult then? It is not difficult. Don't worry about all this. 
                  Simply keep your attention on the spot. Put it back on the spot. Don't allow 
                  it to go away! If it runs away, you will never get to the place I just told 
                  you about.</p>
              <p>Though we can't avoid being offered food and having to eat it, don't you 
                  think that we can keep our attention at the spot and eat? Do you think you 
                  will make comments like, "Too much salt. Too little salt," about 
                  the food that your wife, daughter, granddaughter brought from home? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> I wouldn't make that sort of comment, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, if they offered you food that was far too salty, would 
                  you become angry? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, I wouldn't. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do you think you would even notice that the food had too 
                  much salt? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Why? Because you are aware of something far better, so 
                  you don't notice their food. If you get upset and angry about food, even though 
                  you are observing the eight precepts, and you die at that moment of anger, 
                  where will you go? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> To the lower worlds, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you work with proper effort, not just superficially, 
                  will you even know whether the food tastes good or bad? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Keep your mind steadfastly focused on the spot. Your daily 
                  work needn't suffer. It doesn't cost you anything. Others won't know about 
                  it. Will you practise the Sitter's Practice[10] tonight? Keep your attention 
                  on the spot and you will find it very easy. If you feel drowsy, or if you 
                  are aching, say: "Good it has come early," and then concentrate 
                  still harder on the spot.</p>
              <p>If you reach the goal before drowsiness and discomfort come up, so much 
                  the better. If these disturbances don't manifest themselves, don't stop working, 
                  thinking, "If they don't even come up now, there is no need to work to 
                  get to a place where they don't exist." Just keep working.</p>
              <p>Will you undertake the Sitter's Practice? Or will you, when sleepiness and 
                  tiredness set in, change to another (of the four) postures and reduce your 
                  effort? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We shan't reduce our effort, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> All of you, or just a few among you? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> All of us, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, if you keep each other company, so much the better. 
                  Now, then, undertake to carry out the Sitter's Practice!</p>
              <p>I'll say it in Pali, you repeat after me: Seyyam patikkhippami, nesajjikangam 
                  samadiyami.[11]<br> (I shall abstain from lying down. I undertake the sitter's practice.)</p>
              <p>You may think, "It wasn't right that we just gave in to sleepiness 
                  in the past." Well, now you have undertaken the Sitter's Practice, and 
                  I think it is for the first time isn't it? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, the first time. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is the weapon. With this weapon you can fight your 
                  battle. With this weapon you will be victorious. If you fight with a pillow 
                  as a weapon, you cannot win.</p>
              <p>I shall tell you a story you probably already know. At the time of the Buddha, 
                  there was a rich lady who owned a big estate. When she became old, she distributed 
                  the inheritance among her children. But the children, after receiving the 
                  money, didn't care for their mother any more. She was not treated well in 
                  the houses of her sons and daughters and she was in distress.</p>
              <p>When she was about eighty or ninety years old, the neighbours had her ordained 
                  as a nun (bhikkhuni),[12] as they couldn't bear to see her poverty and suffering. 
                  When the nuns of her nunnery were invited for alms food to a house one day, 
                  they all went. Only Sona Theri,[13] our old woman, had to stay back because 
                  she was too old to go along.</p>
              <p>Before they left the nunnery they said to Sona Theri, "You are very 
                  old, you can't come with us. But fill the water pots for drinking water, and 
                  those for washing hands and feet, so that everything is ready when we return, 
                  and also prepare some hot water.</p>
              <p>But this nun was very old. To carry the water she had to use a small pot, 
                  and as she was working away, she got very tired. But she didn't rest. She 
                  forced herself to do what she had been ordered to do. Because she overworked 
                  herself, she fell down between the water pots, and couldn't lift herself up 
                  any more. She wasn't pretending; she was exhausted from carrying water.</p>
              <p>She ha</p>

              <h2>Discourse VII</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"><strong> WEBU SAYADAW: </strong><br> You have taken the moral precepts; now practise them. Only when your practice 
                of morality (sila) is perfect can you fulfil your aspirations for awakening. 
                Having perfected yourselves in sila, you have to perform various other meritorious 
                practices, and these can take you to the pinnacle and the fulfilment of your 
                aspirations.</p>
              <p>The Teachings of the Buddha, are enshrined in the Tipitaka. These Teachings 
                  were not given by the Buddha just to be preached and studied. You are good 
                  people; you have to practise the Teachings with unwavering effort from the 
                  time you obtain them in order to escape from this suffering.</p>
              <p>Do not get confused about the Teachings. We don't have to know many techniques, 
                  only one; but that we should know clearly. If we establish one technique with 
                  strong effort and get rid of all doubts, then, without asking anyone else, 
                  we shall find the answers, I think.</p>
              <p>Choose one technique and practise it steadfastly. If you focus your mind 
                  at the small spot where the air touches when you breathe in and out, then 
                  there will be no wanting, no aversion or delusion, and as these three are 
                  absent, you are immediately out of suffering. So, for a short moment your 
                  mind is pure. Now, if your last mind moment[1] came up at this time and you 
                  died, would there be anything to be worried about or to be afraid of?</p>
              <p>The benefits accruing to you from this practice don't last for just a short 
                  moment or one lifetime. This short moment of purity will bring benefits for 
                  the remainder of the cycle of birth and death. And why can you accomplish 
                  this? Because the time is right, your form of existence is right, and you 
                  are putting forth right effort.</p>
              <p>The disciples of the Buddha took the practice from the Teacher and worked 
                  with unwavering perseverance. Therefore, they achieved the awakening they 
                  had aspired for.</p>
              <p>How did they work? In the same way as a man who wants to light a fire with 
                  a fire stick, as in the olden days. They rubbed two pieces of wood together, 
                  and heat was produced. Eventually the wood started to glow, and then they 
                  could light a fire. So, if a man wants to start a fire in this way and rubs 
                  two pieces of wood together, does he count: "One rub, two rubs, three 
                  rubs ..."?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>DISCIPLE:</strong> No, sir, that wouldn't work very well. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> How would he have to do it then? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> He would have to rub continuously until he got a flame. 
                  <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, when they wanted to start a fire in those days, this 
                  was the only way to do it. They had to rub with strong determination and without 
                  taking breaks. Now, if one were to rub two pieces of wood together in this 
                  way, how long would it take for the fire to start? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> When it gets hot enough, the fire will start, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will that take long?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Not very long, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> No, if this man works with determination, it doesn't take 
                  long. It is just the same with this practice here. You want fire. You know 
                  that if you rub these two pieces of wood together you can have it. Now, if 
                  you count, "One rub, two rubs ..." it will become a little hot. 
                  And then you take rest for a while. Will you start a fire?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> OK, so you start again, once, twice, three times ... and 
                  again heat is produced. Then you lay back again and take a bit of rest. Will 
                  you start a fire?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if you continue in this way for a whole month?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We wonâ€™t get fire.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if you continue for a whole year?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It will just get warm, sir, but there will be no fire.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now, what if you were to work like this for one hundred 
                  years?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It will just become warm, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> In that case, there is no fire in these two pieces of 
                  wood?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> There is fire, sir, but the effort and perseverance are 
                  not sufficient.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is just the same with our work. You have to work as 
                  the fire maker does, without taking rest. Soon it will become hot and then, 
                  before long, a fire will start.</p>
              <p>Only then will you be able to use the fire in the way you want. You should 
                  all make the effort to fulfil your aspiration for awakening. You have received 
                  the Teachings of the Buddha. Now you have to work so that your efforts are 
                  equal to the efforts of those wise men of old who attained their goal. The 
                  Teachings of the Buddha are the only path out of suffering, and you can practise 
                  them only when a Buddha has arisen, and as long as his Teachings are available. 
                  When no Teachings of a Buddha are available, you cannot fulfil your aspiration 
                  for Nibbana. When a Buddha arises in the world, right conduct (carana) and 
                  understanding (vijja) which lead out of suffering are expounded. If you use 
                  the opportunity and put them into practice, you will become perfect. Right 
                  conduct can also be practised when there are no Teachings of a Buddha, but 
                  insight or understanding is not available.</p>
              <p>What exactly does right conduct mean? Now that the Teachings of a Buddha 
                  are available, all of you untiringly give the four requisites of food, robes, 
                  shelter, and medicine to the monks. When you give, you offer the best you 
                  can afford. But still you are not satisfied yet; you want to do more and more. 
                  This is good conduct (carana).</p>
              <p>To practise the Teachings of the Buddha to the point of being able to escape 
                  from all suffering we have to be aware of one single object continuously, 
                  without break or interruption. If we are thus aware, we are practising understanding 
                  (vijja). Practising both together and being perfect in effort, the wise men 
                  of old attained to the awakening to which they aspired.</p>
              <p>You may think, "Well, we make offerings to the Teachings by giving 
                  food, clothing, shelter, and medicine to the monks. To realize the Teachings 
                  for ourselves we would have to practise insight. We shall do that if we have 
                  some free time after preparing our offerings." Now if you work like this, 
                  are you practising right conduct or insight?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is right conduct, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> When you have fulfilled your duties and keep your mind 
                  steadfastly focused on one single object, what are you practising then?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Wisdom, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, what happened to right conduct? When you keep your 
                  attention focused on the spot, are you still practising right conduct?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, then we are practising right conduct (carana) 
                  and understanding (vijja) at the same time.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, you can practise the two jointly. First you prepare 
                  food and then you meditate. Thus we have to perfect ourselves in both practices, 
                  in right conduct and understanding. But you practise right conduct first and 
                  only then do you practise understanding. Is it not possible to practise these 
                  emancipating Teachings of the Buddha simultaneously? Is it not possible to 
                  be aware of the in-breath and the out-breath even while preparing food or 
                  while building a monastery?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It's possible, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You see, this is the way the wise disciples of the Buddha 
                  used to practise. They had the ability to accept good advice and instructions. 
                  Do you think they might have thought, "Our parents, who are our highest 
                  possessions and to whom we owe an infinite debt of gratitude, are getting 
                  old. We have to serve them day and night, therefore we can't meditate"?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, some must have thought in this way.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is the fulfilment of oneâ€™s duties towards parents 
                  included in right conduct or in understanding?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is right conduct, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Isn't it possible to be aware of mind and matter while 
                  you look after your parents?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It's possible, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now that you know that the wise men of old practised right 
                  conduct and understanding simultaneously, do you still consider it impossible 
                  to practise understanding while serving your children and grandchildren? Can't 
                  you train your mind in the awareness of mind and matter at the same time that 
                  you are fulfilling all your duties? Wherever you are, whatever you do, you 
                  can practise right conduct and meditation at the same time. When your children 
                  are good, you can be aware of the in- and out-breath, and when they are naughty 
                  and you have to correct them, then too you can practise. Tell me, what element 
                  of the training is your correcting the children?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is right conduct, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, if you practise awareness while you scold them, what 
                  are you practising?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Understanding, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If we practise awareness while we do what we have to do, 
                  will we suffer? Does it cost us anything? Does it disturb our work?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir; if one works with awareness the work is completed 
                  more quickly.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you don't allow yourselves to be distracted, you will 
                  work faster and you will earn more money. Your aspiration to Nibbana too will 
                  be fulfilled more quickly. All the beings who practise in this way can fulfil 
                  their aspirations. There is not a single second in which it isnâ€™t possible 
                  to fulfil your aspiration. How about those human beings, Devas and Brahmas 
                  who donâ€™t practise the Teachings of the Buddha, though the time is good? 
                  Do they attain the fulfilment of their aspirations?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Those who don't make effort canâ€™t fulfil their aspirations, 
                  sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Why? Is it because they aren't reborn in the right plane 
                  of existence or because it isn't the right time?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, but without effort nothing can be accomplished.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Maybe they don't have sufficient paramis?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Maybe some can't grasp the Teachings because they haven't 
                  completed their perfections sufficiently in the past, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But if you don't put forth effort, can you still claim 
                  that you don't understand because of missing paramis?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Those who have accumulated perfections in the past attain 
                  the stages of Nibbana when they listen to the Teachings. But we, sir, because 
                  we have no perfections, we listen to the Dhamma again and again and we remain 
                  just the same.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> The wise men of old were just like thirsty people. They 
                  were thirsty, so they looked for water. And when they found it, what did they 
                  do? Did they look up at the sky and say, "Well, we don't want to drink 
                  this water yet"? No, they were people who were really thirsty. What about 
                  you? You have the Teachings of Buddha, do you drink them right away?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, we linger and wait.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> In that case it isn't true that you don't have any paramis. 
                  If you don't drink, your thirst will not be quenched. What will you do if 
                  you find yourselves sitting right next to the water pot?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Because we donâ€™t have a sufficient amount of parami, 
                  we just sit there, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What will you do if you walk into a lake full of water?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> When we walk down into the water we stretch out our neck 
                  and turn our face up towards the sky, sir. And if we should dive, sir, we 
                  shall keep our mouth firmly shut.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now, are you still telling me that you are thirsty, but 
                  that you don't have the necessary understanding to be able to drink?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, because we donâ€™t have the necessary conditioning,

Aren't you contradicting yourselves?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is as if we pretended not to want to drink, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me then; if you are thirsty and just bear it, are

                  water pot without drinking?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, we see this kind of suffering as happiness.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Did the Buddha teach that this thirst is happiness?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, he said it was suffering.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now, tell me, what do you think is true: What the Buddha

                  unhappiness for ourselves.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What is better, to listen to the Buddha or not to listen

                  but still we continue to create suffering for ourselves.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> In that case it seems as if you knew your own good, but 
                  that you are simply lazy.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Because our paramis are weak, we have to suffer from our 
                  own ignorance, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now, if there is water and you don't quench your thirst 
                  with it, is that because you have not perfected your paramis?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is because of the lack of perfections that the power 
                  of ignorance is so overwhelming, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Tell me, what is more powerful, understanding (vijja) 
                  or ignorance (avijja)?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, understanding is more powerful for human beings.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Then you know that the understanding the Buddha taught 
                  is powerful.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, we know that understanding is a good thing.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, just associate yourselves with understanding. Whether 
                  you think that the power of ignorance is strong or whatever... You have learned 
                  now to distinguish between mind and matter. While you are aware of mind and 
                  matter in the way the Buddha taught, is there still ignorance prevailing?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> While we are aware, sir, there is no ignorance.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now, let us concentrate at the spot below the nose above 
                  the upper lip with the awareness of mind and matter (nama and rupa), just 
                  as the Buddha taught. When we anchor our attention thus, can ignorance stay? 
                  If you look out for it, will you be able to find it?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It will be completely gone sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Are you still aware when it has gone?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, it has disappeared completely.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> In that case, is the power of understanding greater or 
                  that of ignorance?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> The power of ignorance is great, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh dear, how is it great? The poor thing just ran as fast 
                  as it could; you couldnâ€™t even see it any more.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> But it comes back again and again, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is so because you allow it back in. If you allow 
                  only understanding and knowledge in, ignorance can't come back. But if you 
                  allow it back, then slowly your understanding will break up and ignorance 
                  takes over once more. It is like the electric lights in here. What do you 
                  need to switch on the lights?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Switches, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What happens inside the switches so that we get light?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Electricity flows through them, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What happens if the flow is interrupted?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It will become dark, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What do you have to do to turn the darkness into light?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We have to feed electricity to the bulbs, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And where does the darkness go when the lights are lit?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It disappears, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is any of the darkness left behind?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> When understanding shines, is there any ignorance left?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> In that case, is the power of ignorance great?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, it isn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it difficult to do what we did just now?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Not very difficult, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Don't we see the reality when light suddenly comes?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We do, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will you still be able to go wrong?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is so easy! What did the wise disciples of the Buddha 
                  connect? If you want to switch on the light, you have to connect the wires 
                  inside the switch so that electricity flows. So, gently keep your attention 
                  on the spot; it will connect. Do you understand?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We would like to give this up, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Just concentrate your attention there. Gently. Do you 
                  become tired if you focus your mind in this way?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Does it cost you anything?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do you have to stop your work?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Isnâ€™t this wonderful? You can practise in all the 
                  four postures: sitting, standing, walking, and lying down. Can you keep your 
                  attention at the spot with the awareness of the in- and out-breath even while 
                  you are eating, drinking, and working?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Please, sir, teach us how to be aware of the breath while 
                  we are moving about and working.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You know about many different techniques, but you donâ€™t 
                  have to practise them all. Choose one and work with it. If you keep your mind 
                  steadfastly focused on one object, you will immediately be aware of what you 
                  have not been aware of before, just as you see light as soon as you turn on 
                  the switch. Can there still be wrong view and delusion in your mind while 
                  you are thus aware?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, but as we don't know where the light switches 
                  are, we have to remain sitting in the dark.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh dear, you've got so many switches! Whichever you turn 
                  on, the light will come.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, because there are so many switches, I don't know 
                  which one to turn on.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Any one will do; the results will be immediate.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> When I press that switch, sir, the light bulb immediately 
                  burns up. That's why I thought it was the wrong switch.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It doesn't burn up; it will light the bulb. Even if it 
                  shorts out one day; when you try again, it will certainly burn.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> But I don't know where to press the switch, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You know the switches; you have been taught so many techniques 
                  by the monks who have compassion for you. Now, do not try them all. Select 
                  one only.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, please teach us this one technique!<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Every technique the Buddha taught will work as a switch 
                  to turn on the light.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> We would like to learn a technique by which we can perfect 
                  our conduct and train ourselves in understanding while we work, walk or sit, 
                  sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Well then, tell me; do not all of you, big and small, 
                  breathe?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, we do.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, there is no one here then who doesn't know how to 
                  breathe. Can you say sometimes, "Sorry, I am very busy now. I don't have 
                  time to breathe"?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So then, it is very easy for you to breathe, isn't it? 
                  Now just try to find out where the air comes out when you breathe out.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It comes out of the nose, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is there any other place where it comes out?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, there is only one place.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, there is only one place. So, don't come and tell 
                  me that there are so many switches and that you don't know which one to press. 
                  You are all breathing, aren't you? Where does this air touch when you breathe 
                  out?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It touches at a point at the base of the nose, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What happens when the air enters? Where does it touch?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It touches again there, at the same spot, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, this is quite obvious to you: The air brushes over 
                  a small spot at the base of the nose as you breathe in and out. You are aware 
                  of this, aren't you?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Don't allow the mind to wander away to other objects. 
                  Can you feel the spot where the air touches just as if you were touching it 
                  with your finger? Put your attention there and keep it there. Don't follow 
                  the breath outside the nostrils. Keep your attention quietly and calmly at 
                  the spot, and you will be able to know how the air goes in and out. The flow 
                  of air is continuous, isn't it?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, it is.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You can be aware of it without the slightest interruption. 
                  If you keep your attention there, there is only the awareness of mental properties 
                  and physical properties (nama and rupa). Now under which of the two do the 
                  nostrils come; under mind or under matter?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, as far as I know, the nostrils are matter.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What is the entity that knows the touch sensation?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, that which knows is mind (nama).<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So you are aware of mind and matter at the same time. 
                  If you are aware of mind and matter, are there still some more other entities 
                  of which you arenâ€™t aware?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, there is nothing apart from mind and matter.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is being aware of mind and matter ignorance or knowledge?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is knowledge, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If one has no awareness of mind and matter, what do we 
                  call that?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> That we call ignorance, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Can ignorance still influence us while we are training 
                  ourselves in understanding.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, it can't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is there still cause for worry and fear about the present 
                  and the future?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, there isn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Even if you are aware for just one short moment, you benefit. 
                  How much will you receive if you can keep up this awareness for a longer period?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> The benefits must be many, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will there still be doubt in your mind about your own 
                  ability to attain the awakening to which you have aspired?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You can reach your goal even quicker than you thought. 
                  Of course you still have to fulfil your duties towards your teachers, parents 
                  and children. You have to support the Teachings of the Buddha. You have to 
                  make a living. If you don't fulfil all these duties, is your sila perfect?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It isn't, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If your moral conduct isnâ€™t perfect, can you attain

                  right conduct and meditation simultaneously?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It is never too difficult, sir, even if one is ill.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If your insight develops through your practice, do you 
                  still need to tell others that you have become happy through the Buddha-Dhamma?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> It isn't necessary to tell others, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if you don't talk about it, does it mean that you 
                  don't know about your own happiness?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Even if we don't tell everyone, we still know for ourselves,

                  how much you have got now, and when you reach the goal, then you will know. 
                  If you write on a piece of paper that salt is salty and someone reads this, 
                  he knows that salt is salty, doesn't he.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Of course, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if you just tell someone that salt is salty, will

                  wisdom constitute the path to the release from suffering?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir, we know.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you read that salt is salty and consider this knowledge 
                  to be quite sufficient, then that is where you stop. But if you want to make 
                  sure, you have to taste for yourselves. Is it sufficient to read that salt 
                  is salty and then have this confirmed by me?<br> D: Sir, you wouldn't lie. If you tell me it is salty, that is quite sufficient 
                  for me.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now you are going back on what you said earlier on. You 
                  know salt is salty from hearing and reading about it, but only if you really 
                  know for yourselves will you become happy. If you tell somebody that salt 
                  is salty and he blindly accepts what you say, then he won't even feel the 
                  desire to taste for himself. After all, he thinks he knows. With this notion 
                  in mind, he won't see the need to taste it. It is not easy to know for oneself 
                  that salt is salty. Salt does exist. Take it, taste it. Then you will know 
                  for yourselves and there will be no need to ask others.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Sir, yesterday I did taste a little bit of salt.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Really? Why only a little? Did the salt run out?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> No, sir, there is plenty of it.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Then take it! Don't just taste a little bit. Use as much 
                  as you need. Every single one of you has got some salt, havenâ€™t you?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Yes, sir. We haven't eaten our full yet, sir, but we are 
                  satisfied with tasting just a little.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> But, of course, you are not thinking of leaving it at 
                  that, are you?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Well sir, not actually, but as time goes by everything 
                  changes. We planned something last year and already a year has passed...<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now, this time, don't merely think. How many "Thinkers" 
                  were there at the time of the Buddha?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> They were as numerous as grains of sand on the beach, 
                  sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You still have to make effort and meditate. You still 
                  have to strive to understand the Teachings of the Buddha. You are planning 
                  to do that, aren't you? Will you only think about putting forth effort in 
                  this life also?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> If we only think about it, sir, we shall again be left 
                  behind in the cycle of birth and death.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Now then, there is no problem. "In the past we missed 
                  out because we were only thinking about making effort, but now we know that 
                  there is fire in the two pieces of wood. We shall rub them together." 
                  Thinking in this way, there will be effort and also the desire to fight the 
                  battle ... Have you got hold of the two pieces of wood? If I continue talking, 
                  you will think, "This monk is talking for a long time." I shall 
                  stop now. Only if you work can you make an end of it.</p>
              <p>If you have the desire to work, then meditate, work hard, apply yourselves 
                  with the same effort and determination as did the Noble Ones of old.</p>

              <h2>Discourse VIII</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"><strong> WEBU SAYADAW: </strong><br> Be perfect in the practice of sila. Only 
              if your practice is perfect will all your aspirations 
              of the present time and of the future be fulfilled 
              without exception. Because this is true, the 
              aspirations of the good people of the past who 
              practised and strove were fulfilled completely. You too 
              have to take up the practice of that sila that brought 
              about their happiness. Work hard and perfect yourselves 
              in it.</p>
              <p>Being perfect in sila, keep your mind straight and 
              practise generosity (dana) as it pleases you, giving 
              your possessions yourselves with sincerity to those who 
              are worthy. Approach and give your dana and your 
              respect to the peerless Buddha and his Teachings, 
              keeping in mind your aspiration for awakening, Nibbana. 
              This type of aspiration is called right aspiration. 
              What you realize when you penetrate the Four Noble 
              Truths is called bodhi.</p>
              <p>There are different types of bodhi: samma-sam-bodhi 
              (Buddhahood), pacceka-bodhi (Non-teaching Buddhahood), 
              savaka-bodhi (Arahatship). There are different types of 
              Arahatship: agga-savaka (chief discipleship), 
              maha-savaka (leading disciples), pakati-savaka (Disciple and 
              Arahat). You have always to keep in mind your 
              aspirations for Nibbana, the highest goal.</p>
              <p>Aspirations thus taken are well taken. After having 
              perfected yourself according to your aspiration, enter 
              Nibbana. The noble persons who have attained Nibbana 
              are innumerable. Why could they bring their various 
              aspirations for bodhi to fruition? Because they had 
              been born into the right form of existence at the right 
              time and because they exerted proper effort.</p>
              <p>When is the time that these aspirations can be 
              brought to fruition?</p>
              <p>From the moment the Buddha attained awakening, many 
              human beings, Devas and Brahmas came to the Buddha to 
              pay respects and to show their devotion. But no human 
              being, no Deva, and no Brahma was satisfied by merely 
              being in the presence of the Buddha and having the 
              opportunity to pay respects. The Buddha observed them 
              through his mindâ€™s eye and taught them the truth which 
              he had penetrated through his own super-knowledge, his 
              omniscience. As soon as they received the instructions 
              of the Buddha, they began to practise, to exert 
              themselves with unwavering energy in all the four 
              postures of the body. This effort, which is continuous 
              without break or pause and full of joy is called good 
              effort. When their effort was perfect and equal to the 
              effort of the wise men of old, they arrived at their 
              goal in due time and all the aspirations of their 
              hearts came to an end. Because they had achieved this 
              state they were exceedingly happy and blissful.</p>
              <p>What was the nature of their happiness, their bliss? 
              It was not happiness or bliss that lasted for only a 
              moment or a single lifetime; it was that happiness that 
              is so great that it is able to last for the remainder 
              of samsara. Even if you are born in the human plane for 
              only one life, you are able to rise above the 
              suffering of the cycle of birth and death.</p>
              <p>In this way happiness and bliss come to you. When one 
              has attained this happiness, when one has received the 
              sign of bliss, when one has reached the goal, there is 
              no jealously guarding of a secret. No, you will want 
              all human beings, Devas, and Brahmas to attain this 
              bliss and happiness. As you know for yourself how to 
              attain this happiness, the actions of body, speech, and 
              mind will always be in harmony with the cause of 
              attaining Nibbana. You will act with joy as your base.</p>
              <p>How could so many human beings, Devas, and Brahmas 
              attain such high states of bliss? Only because they 
              knew that they were going to bring the aspirations of 
              their heart to fruition.</p>
              <p>What are the things that support the Buddhaâ€™s 
              Teachings? They are the donation of shelter, robes, 
              alms food, and medicine for the monks. Having 
              understood this, they practised it. With these four 
              requisites the wise supported the Teachings of the 
              Buddha. While they supported the Teachings of the 
              Buddha by donating the four requisites, many human 
              beings, Devas, and Brahmas received the instructions of 
              the Buddha. They were endowed with the ability to 
              understand and follow the instructions and they 
              practised with a joyful mind without taking rest as the 
              wise of old. When they thus practised they attained 
              their goal without delay. In just one moment 
              innumerable human beings, Devas, and Brahmas fulfilled 
              the wish of their heart. The energetic people saw this 
              and supported the Teachings of the Buddha and 
              established them in a very short time. But they didnâ€™t 
              do only this; this didn't satisfy them yet. In order to 
              strengthen and make firm the Teachings they would also 
              meditate. So they were full of good volition and they 
              were accordingly endowed with unwavering effort and 
              faith. Since the time of the Buddha there have been 
              such noble people who supported and carried out the 
              Teachings of Buddha with supreme effort, and ever since 
              the days of the Buddha human beings, Devas, and Brahmas 
              have been attaining Nibbana. The number of those who 
              have reached the goal in just a short moment can't be 
              reckoned, let alone the number of all who have attained 
              Nibbana.</p>
              <p>Now the good time for all the various noble people 
              has come. This is so because the time when a Buddha and 
              his Teachings blossom is the good time. The existences 
              of human beings, Devas, and all the happy abodes are 
              good. Having been born into one of these, people 
              accepted the Teachings as you are doing now. They 
              practised with full effort and arrived at the goal.</p>
              <p>After his awakening the Buddha honoured Rajagaha 
              before any other country with his presence. The king of 
              this great city, Bimbisara, came to the Buddha and 
              because he received the Teachings and followed them, he 
              attained the goal. He was full of bliss. He wanted 
              others to attain the same bliss, and understanding the 
              reason, the cause for his happiness, he donated the 
              four requisites. He did this so that his mother, 
              father, grandmother and grandfather could fulfil their 
              aspirations completely. The Buddha, out of his great 
              compassion, dwelled in the king's delightful garden. 
              Humans, Devas, and Brahmas came to revere him there and 
              with great compassion he taught them what he had 
              realized himself. In just one short moment innumerable 
              humans, Devas, and Brahmas achieved their aspirations. 
              And after this it went on and on. The good time for all 
              the people with noble aspirations had come! The time at 
              which there is a Buddha or his Teaching is the good 
              time. Human life, life as a Deva or a Brahma, is a good 
              life. Good effort is called the effort that is 
              established after one has received the Teachings. And 
              what are the Buddha's Teachings? What is contained in 
              the Tipitaka and is preached and explained by noble 
              disciples out of loving kindness and compassion are the 
              Buddhaâ€™s Teachings. They are very extensive, profound 
              and difficult to understand. Though they are extensive, 
              profound, and difficult to understand, they really are 
              just one thing: the way of escape from suffering.</p>
              <p>They are expounded by the wise in short and in full 
              as time permits and everyone has knowledge of them 
              according to his capability. You all have some 
              understanding of the Tipitaka in accordance with your 
              capabilities. If you were to talk about what you know 
              it would never end.</p>
              <p>But you have to establish strong effort and focus 
              your mind on one object according to the Teachings of 
              the Buddha, as I said, and keep out all other objects. 
              When you fix your mind on one object exclusively with 
              strong and stable effort, then you will be established 
              in the Teachings. Isn't that so?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong> U BA KHIN:</strong> Yes sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> To establish your attention thus is effort 
              (viriya). When you fix your attention on one object and 
              no other object enters your mind and your attention is 
              stable, you reach viriya-iddhipada. Because the 
              Teachings are so extensive you may think it tiresome to 
              practise them. That is why I instruct you in this way 
              that you can reach the goal quickly.</p>
              <p>What happens to the causes of suffering-lobha, dosa, 
              and moha: (greed, aversion, and delusion)-when you 
              control your mind in this way?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> They are cut out and become quiet.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> People write and preach a lot about lobha, dosa, 
              and moha. Don't they? When they debate, they talk only 
              to win the debate, whoever they are talking to. But if 
              they establish awareness of breathing and make their 
              minds stable they acquire real merit. Why don't we try 
              to do this?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will there be worry, fear, and greed at that time?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> There won't be.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> No, there won't; there won't be any worry, fear, or 
              greed. If there is worry, fear, or greed, are you happy 
              or unhappy?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Unhappy, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And if there is no worry, fear, or greed?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Then one is happy.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If one establishes effort only for one split second 
              the viriya-iddhipada arises. It excludes worry, fear, 
              and greed and there is happiness. There are types of 
              happiness which are not related to the happiness 
              achieved through the Buddha's Teachings, but people 
              still call them happiness. What sort of happiness am I 
              talking about? I am talking about the happiness of 
              becoming a human being or Deva, of becoming a king, a 
              rich man, a Universal Monarch, a Deva king, a Sakka, or 
              a Brahma. Of course their enjoyment is also called 
              happiness ... But let me give an example. If you were 
              asked to bear the golden royal insignia and live in the 
              golden palace of a country that abounded with gold, 
              silver, gems, rice, water and paddy, that was plentiful 
              in everything, would you accept this offer or not?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Of course I would accept.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Of course you would accept. This country is so rich 
              that there is absolutely nothing missing. So you would 
              live wearing your crown in your golden palace smiling 
              all the time. So I think, smiling like that all the 
              time, you would enjoy yourself; you would be happy, 
              wouldn't you? Would this happiness keep worry, fear, 
              and wanting away?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, it wouldn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh, really?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It wouldn't, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> I mean at that moment, you see.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It wouldn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Why are they all smiling and happy then?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Somebody could try to usurp the kingdom. If 
              something happens in his territory he would have duties to 
              fulfil.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> There is nothing like that. This country is so good 
              that there is no danger or worry of that kind. It is a 
              very peaceful country. There is no problem at all; 
              everything is calm and quiet. It is that kind of 
              country. No troubles at all; you just have to live in 
              the golden palace wearing your crown. You simply live 
              there with your ministers, troops, concubines, and 
              wives. You live always with a smile on your face. Will 
              worry, fear, greed, and anxiety be kept at bay in these 
              circumstances? You are always smiling and happy. So, do 
              you think there is any worry?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> There will be, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Why?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>D:</strong> Because there is the fear of death.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, there will still be the fear of death. But you 
              are smiling still. What is this smiling? What are 
              lobha, dosa, and moha?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> They won't be kept away.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Even smiles don't keep them away?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What do smiles mean?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> They indicate that the object of mind is lobha

But 
              you aren't happy yet. You are king, aren't you? Maybe 
              you aren't happy because you rule only one country? 
              I'll give you another one. So?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Even then I won't be any happier .<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Are you going to tell me that you don't want

              Wheel of the Universal Monarch. Now, there won't be any 
              worry or fear. With the turning of the Jewel of the 
              Wheel you will become a Universal Monarch. Will you be

We all thought we were quite all right, but

              and we can have as much of it as we want, can't we?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We can.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Endowed with the ability to accept the Teachings we 
              can take up one technique with steadfastness. Will the 
              happiness that derives from this practice become less 
              the more we use it, the more we practise?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It won't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Will it ever be exhausted?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It won't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh, really? My word, this thing is good. Isn't it, 
              my dear disciples? And if we use it all the time, 
              continuously, will it then get used up, will it come to 
              an end?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It will neither diminish nor get used up.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Wait a minute. We shall keep our attention focused 
              while we are sitting like this, but while we are 
              standing, can we still practise this?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We can.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And when we are walking?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We can.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, we have to carry the burden of our body. It is 
              not the same as other worldly possessions. When you 
              work hard to acquire various jewels and gold and are 
              successful, you will store them away in a certain 
              place, I think. But having acquired our body and mind, 
              the five khandhas, is it possible to live with ease, 
              happily and without making great efforts?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It isn't possible.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> We have to shoulder our burden. We can't rest for a 
              short moment even, can we? And for whom do we have to 
              shoulder the burden of our bodies without ever taking 
              rest?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> For ourselves.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> For the five aggregates.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> For the five aggregates, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes we have to work, disciples. If I practise this

              practise this all the time?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is possible, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is very good.

Yes, disciple, 
              when we have the Teachings of the Buddha and practise 
              them continuously, when we are able to focus our mind 
              on the object, we won't get tired, will we?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We won't, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> We won't spend anything; our work won't be disrupted, 
              and others won't even notice. You receive the 
              Teachings in no time and then you say to yourself, "Now 
              I shall follow these Teachings." When you have this 
              volition and put forth effort then the viriya-iddhipada 
              factor will arise and you will arrive at the goal in no 
              time. If you take up the practice now, will your 
              progress be slow or fast, my disciples?</p>

Can you say how quick this is?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Have you put your attention there and does it stay?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> As I decide to put it there, it stays, doesn't it?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It does.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So if it stays, you have reached happiness. Are you 
              able to speak as quickly as this happiness is able to 
              arise?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> I am not, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is easy to achieve happiness if you want it.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is the highest sort of kusala. Do you hear? 
              This is the highest, the highest. Only if you have 
              parami can you be born as a human and receive the 
              Buddha-Dhamma. This type of kusala cannot be put in 
              numbers. Do you understand? Then, the six qualities of 
              the Dhamma are there; the qualities of the Buddha, the 
              Dhamma, and the Sangha. When the Buddha taught this, 
              people understood. Among the six qualities of the 
              Dhamma, akaliko is one, isn't it? What does akaliko 
              mean?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Immediateness.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Immediateness means that as soon as you fix your 
              attention the results come. So, if you establish effort 
              with intelligence the results come so quickly that you 
              can't say "there" quicker than they come. Or you can't 
              even think that fast. Is it so? If you establish 
              awareness now, if you keep it here with your effort, 
              happiness arises in the very same moment. This is 
              immediate; who would have to question this any more?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Who would have to doubt his own experience?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, when happiness has arisen there is no looking 
              for it any more. The answer comes by itself, doesn't 
              it? It doesn't take any time. All of you are bright 
              people and you have understood the Teachings of the 
              wise and compassionate while still young, even before 
              the words of instruction were complete. Though you 
              understood, at times your mind will think as it 
              pleases, but let us practise. What happens in the mind 
              when we plan to practise to acquire kusala? "I'll 
              perform kusala later on, now I have to do this 
              quickly." Doesn't this happen to you?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It does.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it good to think and speak like this? <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And then you make efforts and the viriya-iddhipada 
              factor has arisen. What is the right thing to do?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> The right thing to do is to practise.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. If you want to become happier and happier, you 
              have to put forth effort as soon as you have received 
              the instructions of the Buddha and have accepted them. 
              Then the viriya-iddhipada factor will arise. When you 
              make use of this factor that arises in a split second, 
              does it get consumed?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It doesn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Does it diminish?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It doesn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you decide that the happiness you have is quite 
              sufficient for now and the future and say, "I don't 
              want to progress," can you practise and not progress?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> One will progress.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> If you practise not just for a short time, but 
              longer, will you achieve only as much as you get out of 
              a short period of practice?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> One will get more.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is good, disciple. This is possible because we 
              are now in an auspicious era, because we are born into 
              the right form of existence and because you make right 
              efforts. The energetic get the true answer even without 
              asking others. Very good. Do you hear? Isn't this so?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is so.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, even if we live with this happiness all the 
              time, it wonâ€™t diminish; it won't be used up. And what 
              happens if one doesn't want to progress?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It isn't possible not to progress, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. If you aspire to this there must be many 
              different troubles. Is it possible to attain bodhi or 
              not?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is possible.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is possible now and in the future. So let us 
              say, "I don't want to progress," and then focus our 
              minds. Is this possible?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It isn't possible not to progress if we work.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Do we achieve greater happiness the more we work?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We do, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> We can attain bodhi and we can also choose the time 
              and the place of birth. We can then choose a good 
              existence as we wish. When you attain the happiness you 
              desire, what else do you need.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Nothing else, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You don't need anything; you just have to choose. 
              Is choosing tiresome?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It isn't, sir. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You can attain it at any time. There are four 
              stages to Nibbana. Is it possible only for certain 
              types of Ariyas (individuals who have attained one of 
              the four stages)? Do we have to choose the state of 
              Nibbana?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What about the place?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It isnâ€™t necessary.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. All by yourself, without any help?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It's possible.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> And in a crowd? If you go outside the pagoda it 
              wonâ€™t be possible, I think. It is easy, isn't it? The 
              Buddha, the all-compassionate and omniscient, taught 
              many humans, Devas, and Brahmas the knowledge that he 
              had attained through penetrating the truth himself. 
              These beings, full of confidence after receiving the 
              Teachings, were able to fulfil their aspirations.</p>
              <p>As you establish awareness you should establish continuous 
              effort. There are many different types of 
              people. Some are good at reciting or reading or 
              preaching or explaining. I have no doubt about you, 
              disciples, with whoever you compete you will win.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, though others are victorious in their talk, 
              will they achieve anything if they don't practise?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No. <br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> So, what's the difficulty? Talking is tiresome, 
              isn't it? All we have to do is to make efforts to bring 
              to fruition the aspirations we have made and work as 
              the wise ones of old. Understanding that we have to 
              take up this work our minds will be focused. You are 
              very busy. You may say, "We will practise later when we 
              are free." Does this thought come up still?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It does.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Sometimes the mind is like that. But I think you 
              don't actually say so?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We might, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You even speak your mind?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We do.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Well, if you want to say this, never mind. But for 
              the future can't you burn these impurities out? You 
              have the Teachings of the Buddha. When this happens to 
              you, [when you want to procrastinate,] get rid of your 
              doubts. Strive to find the answers without asking 
              others. If you focus right now, won't you get the 
              answers immediately? Isn't this possible?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, it is possible, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is possible to focus as you sit here.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes sir, it is.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it also possible to maintain the happiness you

The Buddha is incomparable. He 
              accumulated virtues without ever resting. He completed

              have to raise yourself up happily and complete your 
              work. Then, depending on what your aspirations are, you 
              simply take the bliss you desire. It is very easy. 
              Don't be modest. Don't allow yourselves to think, "This 
              is not possible for me," "This is not suitable for 
              us," "This is not proper for us," "This is not for

              same. If we simply establish our effort and accept the 
              Teachings, do we still have to choose certain times to 
              practise?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> There is no need for that.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Really?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> That is correct, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes! The time and the form of existence is right. 
              You can achieve your aspirations when you wish, can't 
              you?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> That is correct sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes! Do you understand? Before, they didn't 
              practise because they were busy. How is it with this 
              "I'll practise when I'm free"? Do we still have to set 
              times like this?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is not necessary to set aside certain times.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> What happens if we practise only when we are free? 
              If we stop the practice, then we wonâ€™t attain what we 
              ought to attain. But now, we do our work and something 
              else as well: we also fulfil our aspirations. We get 
              two things done at the same time, don't we, lay 
              disciples? What is better: to get one thing done or to 
              get two things done at the same time?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is better to get two things done at the same 
              time, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> You see? It's worth keeping yourself busy. But, 
              even though I say it's worth keeping yourself busy, 
              don't start enjoying being busy just for the sake of 
              being busy-if you want to realize the Teachings, I 
              mean. Don't just keep running around all the time. If 
              you establish viriya at the same time, the 
              viriya-iddhipada factor will arise. Make yourselves firm in 
              this. If you say that you want to do this work but go 
              on distracting yourselves here and there, your progress 
              will be slow. On the other hand, if you establish this 
              awareness and keep it up, working happily, then you 
              will make progress. what about this work that you can't 
              avoid having to do?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> We will also make progress with that.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, lay disciples. Not only do you get results in 
              this noble work, you get much more besides. What I say 
              is what the Buddha taught. I'm not adding anything.</p>
              <p>Now, you are all people making great effort, aren't 
              you? I just wanted to warn you. What I just mentioned 
              [about being too busy] can happen at times.</p>
              <p>When you have holidays, you decide to come here and 
              meditate for a few days. Then you have to go back to 
              work and don't get time off anymore. You don't come 
              back. Does this happen sometimes?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, it does.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Then you abandon the meditation, I think, don't 
              you? Don't abandon it. Carry on with this awareness and 
              at the same time do your work. Then you get two things 
              in one go. You get two. If you postpone the work until 
              your hours of leisure, you only get one benefit. The 
              aspirations you are fulfilling are not ordinary ones, 
              are they? You can attain to the highest, noblest bliss.</p>
              <p>Now, what are these aspirations you are going to 
              fulfil? There are the different forms of bodhi. Bodhi 
              means the penetrative understanding of the Four Noble 
              Truths. If you establish effort, saying that you want 
              to get it, you can fulfil all your various aspirations 
              for bodhi right now. This is not ordinary.</p>
              <p>How are you going to fulfil your aspirations? Each 
              type of bodhi has to be fulfilled in its own way: 
              sammasambodhi as sammasambodhi, paccekabodhi as 
              paccekabodhi. We must understand it in this way if we 
              are to understand it correctly. It is like planting a 
              mature seed. When it rains, a plant springs up. Here, 
              the plant is nursed well, when you go back home, it has 
              deep roots and is strong.</p>
              <p>Is it possible to describe how good this period, this 
              time, is? It is so easy now, lay disciples! Tell me, is 
              this a period when one is oppressed by worries and has 
              to groan and moan?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Is it a period when we can only stare resignedly?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is a period when we can be happy and blissful 
              immediately, when we can never get enough of this joy. 
              You get even more than you wanted. You get even more 
              than you aspired to, don't you, disciple?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Oh yes. You never get tired, not in the present and 
              not in the remainder of samsara. What are the Teachings 
              of the Buddha? There is nothing in the Teachings that 
              causes stress and misery, is there? There isn't! It is 
              pure happiness!</p>
              <p>There is one thing, however: the mind may get 
              confused with many thoughts, and I donâ€™t think that 
              these thoughts are very pertinent. Now, if you 
              determine to establish this practice, then I don't 
              think that thoughts of doubt will remain at the back of 
              your mind. Can you not be successful in this way? The 
              mind will think what it wills. Let it! Follow the 
              Teachings. Do you understand? When you arrive at the 
              goal, you will probably find that it isn't what you 
              expected it to be. Doesn't this happen to people?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It has happened many times, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, it happens. Dear lay disciples, I am telling 
              you only a little. Those among you who work hard will 
              think, "This monk is reluctant to tell us everything. 
              He is probably very unwilling to part with his 
              knowledge." [Everybody laughs.] You will think, "This 
              is much greater than he said." When you strive for real 
              happiness and in this way arrive at the goal, then you 
              experience something that you cannot describe with all 
              the words there are. Once youâ€™ve decided, "I'll strive 
              so that I will know for myself," then don't 
              procrastinate. Don't delay. Do you hear? This is so elevated. 
              It is so good, lay disciples. Work hard. Do you 
              understand? You are all people of great effort, aren't 
              you?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Almost all of us, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. Good, good. Work hard, won't you? You see, 
              when you yourselves arrive at the goal-and for many of 
              you even before that time-you can give this happiness 
              to others. You will never feel reluctant to give.You 
              will want to give a great deal of it, a great deal.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> This is true, sir. In the course we are conducting 
              now there are three or four students who, after about 
              three days, cry with great sobs because they regret not 
              having come here earlier.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, it is like that.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> They think, "I should have come earlier!"<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, this happens! Work hard in order to attain the 
              highest. This place is very good.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is a place to which you gave your blessings, 
              venerable Sayadaw!<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> This is a nucleus. It is the first of many centres. 
              Do you hear me? May this happiness spread slowly out 
              from this place. Yes, yes, you must work hard, strive 
              diligently. Working means that you must meditate at 
              times, and then, at times, you will want to take rest. 
              Does this also happen here?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It doesn't, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It doesn't?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> If the students start to meditate at 12.30, they 
              come out of their meditation cells only at 5 P.M. At 
              the beginning, they do take breaks, but after two or 
              three days, they donâ€™t come out for breaks anymore.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes, you see! It's like that! The highest bliss 
              cannot be described in words. But the mind is like a 
              magician. Even though you may be meditating here like 
              this, even though you may be meditating calmly, 
              negative thoughts may arise: "Oh, meditation is so 
              tiring! How can I achieve anything? I can't." Isn't it 
              like that?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> It is just as you say, sir. They do think that way.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Yes. Your mind may be cheating you,but after having 
              established right effort, there is no cheating 
              yourself-or is that still possible?<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> No, sir, it isn't.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> It is only during the period before you really know 
              that you can cheat yourself.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_BLU.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>U:</strong> Yes, sir.<br> <img src="http://www.ubakhin.com/images/gifs/BALL_RED.GIF" alt="" width="14" height="14" align="top"> <strong>S:</strong> Even so, you may be saying to yourself that you 
              meditate too long-so take rest now.</p>

              said.Actually you can find all this Dhamma in the body and
              mind.</p>

              <p>If one learn Dhamma from Buddha Scripture, there are three main
              levels of knowledge one can get.I would like to explain with examples.</p>
              <p>Book knowledge</p>
              <p>Let
              say that one has never eaten the honey before and don't know about
              taste of honey in his life.This means one don't know the taste and
              characters of Dhamma in body and mind.In the book says honey is
              sweet.Honey is obtained from Honey bee.After one who don't know the
              taste of honey read this book about honey , he gets the book knowledge
              about honey.But he has not tasted honey yet.For the same thing,after
              one who don't know the taste of Dhamma read the Dhamma book, he get
              sthe book knowledge about dhamma.This is called book knowledge.</p>
              <p>Mind knowledge</p>
              <p>Let transfer from book knowledge to mind knowledge.</p>
              <p>One
              who already read about honey wants to eat the honey and find and taste
              the honey.He feel very sweet.He realize that honey is sweet and what is
              written in honey book is true.For the same, one already read about
              Dhamma want to find, practice and meditate Dhamma in the body and
              mind.He feel and realize the taste of Dhamma from the body and mind and
              what is written in dhamma book is true.This is mind knowledge.</p>
              <p>Let continue from mind knowledge to enlightenment knowlege</p>
              <p>One
              who already tasted honey compare the other tastes he has eaten
              before.He realize the honey is better than any other tastes in his
              life.He don't like to eat the other tastes anymore.His mind is cling to
              honey.For the same, one who already tasted the Dhamma will compare the
              natrue of Nibbana and Dhamma with other Dhamma .He realize that which
              one is good and bad Dhamma, what is the root cause of Dhamma for
              suffering in the life. He finally eliminates the root cause of Dhamma
              for suffering in his life.His mind is clinged to taste ofÂ  Nibbana.This
              is called enlighenment knowledge.</p>
              <p>Don't stay with book knowledge and mind knowledge.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: xx-small;">The Seven Purifications of a Buddha.</span></p>
              <p>In this connection, we propose to insert in this chronicle an account of
              the seven purifications of a Buddha (visuddhi) for brief information.</p>
              <p><strong>(1) Purity of Morality, (Sila Visuddhi)</strong></p>
              <p>At the time the Bodhisatta halted on the banks of the River Anoma and put
              on the robes of a recluse, he began to observe the moral restraint from evil
              conduct (Samvara Sila)*. The Samvara Sila is the eight precepts with right
              livelihood as the eighth (Ajivatthamaka Sila): to wit, abstinence from taking
              life; abstinence from stealing, or robbing things not given in deed or in word
              by owner; abstinence from sexual misconduct (abstinence from improper sexual
              acts whether major or minor), abstinence from telling lies, abstinence from
              slanderous talks; abstinence from using harsh and abusive language; abstinence
              from frivolous, unbeneficial talks; abstinence from wrong livelihood. With the
              observance of this sila, the Bodhisatta also accomplished the observance of the
              purity of livelihood (Ajiva parisuddhi sila).</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>* Samvara Sila: The Practice of Sila varies in
              accordance with the mode of life adopted by the disciple, whether a bhikkhu or
              a lay person. Suttas in the Nikayas give extensive explanations of the practice
              of Sila, the type of moral training which necessarily precedes meditation. The
              Visuddhimagga explains the moral training in general under four heads: (1)
              Patimokkha-samvara, the Patimokkha restraint, (2) Indriya-samvara, restraint of
              the senses, (3) Ajivaparisuddhi, Purity of Livelihood, (4) Paccayasannissita,
              Purity in regard to the requisites. Patimokkha-samvara is meant for observance
              by the bhikkhu disciples of the Buddha; hence it is not mentioned in this
              account of the purity of the Bodhisatta's morality. </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Indriya Samvara Sila is the practice of securely guarding the six doors of
              the senses. Unlike the ordinary worldling the Buddha required no special effort
              to develop anew Indriya Samvara Sila since restraint of the senses (Indriya),
              was for him already an innate and accomplished fact.</p>
              <p>It was also not necessary for him to especially exert for observance of
              moral conduct in respect of requisites (Paccayasannissita Sila) to keep away
              the defilements which may arise because of the Four Requisites.</p>
              <p>Even at the time when he was about to renounce the world, he had already
              discarded temporarily a number of unwholesome defilements headed by greed and
              craving. The latent defilements are eradicated only by the Arahatta-magga.
              This, was the the Bodhisatta's purity of morality (Sila visuddhi).</p>
              <p><strong> (2) Purity of mind (Citta visuddhi) </strong></p>
              <p>The eight attainments of Jhana and the five mundane psychic powers,
              (abhinna), acquired during his stay with the Sect Leaders Alara and Udaka had
              turned unclean and dim as if stained with impurities (like unused large gold
              vessels) through neglect of practice and development throughout his six years'
              asceticism of dukkaracarriya. On the day he was to attain Buddhahood he partook
              of the Ghana milk-rice offered by lady Sujata and spent the daytime in the sala
              forest. While he was so staying there, he purified the eight attainments and
              the five abhinnas by developing them once again (like washing and cleaning the
              stained gold vessel). These eight attainments and five abhinnas constituted the
              Bodhisatta's purity of mind, (Citta visuddhi).</p>
              <p><strong>(3) Purity of views (Ditthi Visuddhi)</strong></p>
              <p>Thereafter, the noble Bodhisatta proceeded to the High ground of Maha Bodhi
              in the evening and remained seated on the Invincible Throne. He vanquished
              Devaputta Mara before sunset; in the first watch of the night, he developed the
              knowledge of past existences. As has been described above, he perceived well
              the phenomena of nama and rupa and, destroyed the twenty wrong
              beliefs-in-personality (sakkaya ditthi). This was the Bodhisatta's purity of
              views (Ditthi Visuddhi).</p>
              <p>(4) <strong>Purity of overcoming doubts (Kankhavitarana Visuddhi)</strong> Then in the
              middle watch of the night, he discerned sentient beings reaching different
              destinations according to their deeds by means of Yathakammupaga nana which had
              Dibbacakkhu nana as its basis. On seeing them, he realised distinctly the law
              of Kamma (deeds and their results) and because of this realisation, he became
              free of doubts. This was the Bodhisatta's purity of overcoming doubts
              (Kankhavitarana Visuddhi).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: xx-small;">The Seven Purifications of a Buddha,
              continued.</span></p>
              <p><strong>(5) Purity of knowledge and insight into the right and wrong paths
              (Maggamaggananadassana Visuddhi)**</strong></p>
              <p>In the last watch of the night, the Bodhisatta dwelt on the twelve factors
              of the Doctrine of Dependent Origination; and beginning with the contemplation
              of mind and body (Kalapa-sammasana) on the basis of seven contemplations such
              as contemplation of impermanence (anicca nupassana), of suffering (dukkha
              nupassana), of non-self (anatta nupassana), he realised Udayabbaya Nana which
              discerned the rising and falling of all mental and material phenomena, nama and
              rupa. At that time there arose in the Bodhisatta defilements of Vipassana,
              (Vipassanupakkilesa***) such as illumination, etc.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>** Maggamaggananadassana Visuddhi: Knowledge as
              to whether it is the right path leading to Nibbana or not is called
              Maggamaggananadassana Visuddhi. </span></p>
              <p><span>*** Vipassun'upakkilesa: defilements of vipassana </span></p>
              <p><span>A yogi practising Vipassana meditation, at a certain stage
              of advancement, contemplates again and again the rising and falling of all
              mental and physical phenomena and attains the initial stage of the knowledge of
              arising and falling (Udayyabbaya Nana). "At this stage, he generally
              beholds a supernormal light (obhasa), feels a thrill of zest (piti), calmness
              (passaddhi), determination (adhimokkha), great energy (paggaha), happiness
              (sukha), deep insight (nana), intensity of mindfulness (upatthana), equanimity
              (upekkha), and a mild desire for this state (nikanti)". (From Essential
              Themes of Buddhist Lectures given by Ashin Thittila. Department of Religious
              Affairs, Yangon, Myanma, 1992.) </span></p>
              <p><span>These states arising in a yogi at the stage of Udayabbaya
              Nana in ten phases are termed 'Vipassanupakkilesa, defilements of kilesa.
              Nanamoli, in The Path of Purification translates it as imperfections of Insight
              and enumerates them, ten in number, as follows: (1) Illumination, (2)
              knowledge, (3) rapturous happiness, (4) tranquility, (5) bliss (pleasure), (6)
              resolution, (7) exertion, (8) assurance, (9) equanimity and (10) attachment. </span></p>
              <p><span>"The yogi, arriving at this stage, is liable to these
              defilements and his mind may be seized by 'spiritual excitement' or 'agitation
              about higher states' (dhamma-uddhacca). 'For example, he may, on having an
              illumination, feel that this constitutes Path-experience and so inhibits his
              further progress through deceiving himself. When an illumination appears the
              meditator thinks: 'Never indeed has such illumination as this arisen in me
              before. Surely, I have reached the Path; I have reached the Fruition. Thus he
              takes which is not the Path for the Path, and that which is not the Fruition
              for the Fruition. Through this mistake, the progress of Vipassana is checked;
              leaving the original subject of meditation, he lingers, delighting in the
              illumination." (Buddhist Meditation in theory and practice by Vijiranana
              Maha Thera. --Buddhist Missionary Society, Malaysia. 1975.) </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The illumination of the Buddha unlike that of others, was not confined to
              one spot, one area, or one portion of a region. In fact, when the Bodhisatta's,
              by means of the very sharp, penetrating afore said Mahavajjra Vipassana Nana,
              contemplated the aggregates of phenomena (Dhamma) in the mind continuum of
              himself as well as that of the inestimable number of sentient beings, through
              out the three passages of time, in a summary manner, reducing them into twelve
              factors of Paticcasamuppada; and again dividing these twelve factors into two
              groups of nama and rupa when he contemplated them by means of Udayabbaya Nana,
              his energy was very strong, his mindfulness very steadfast; this mind very
              composed; and so his insightwisdom was very sharp; his faith very strong, his
              physical and mental happiness, and tranquillity were developing incessantly.
              The mental factors of equanimity (Tataramajjhatta cetasika) also called
              vipassanupekkha, which views with even-mindedness all conditioned states, was
              .also very strong. The mind continuum of the Bodhisatta, thus supported and
              assisted by happiness, (sukha) and tranquillity, (passaddhi) was suffused with
              five kinds of zest, namely, (1) joy that makes hairs stand on end (khuddaka
              piti)., (2) joy that occurs off and on like a flash of lightning (khanika
              piti), (3) joy flooding the body and then receding like waves breaking on the
              sea shore (Okkantika piti), (4) joy so strong as to transport one up into the
              air (Ubbega piti), (5) joy that pervades the whole body as soft cotton wool
              soaked in oil. His blood, heart and sense faculties such as eye, ear, nose
              etc., were also very lucid.</p>
              <p>Therefore, illumination appeared from the person of the Bodhisatta flooding
              the earth, the mass of air and the mass of water of the nether region and
              making them golden yellow; it then plunged into the boundless space below. In
              the upward direction also, up to the highest abode of beings, Bhavagga,
              everything was turned golden yellow by the illumination which continued to
              penetrate further into the upper boundless space. The illumination also
              brightened up across the whole of the ten thousand world-systems, and rapidly
              extended throughout the infinite world systems.</p>
              <p>(When such defilements of Vipassana appear, unclever meditators mistook
              them for the Path and the Fruition; they abandoned the original subject of
              meditation and dwelt taking delight in defiling elements). When, however, these
              defilements of Vipassana appeared in the mind continuum of the Bodhisatta, he
              reflected: "These are not the Path which will lead to Arahatta magga Nana
              and Sabbannuta Nana; they merely defile Vipassana. Only Udayabhaya Nana etc.,
              of my original meditation form the true path to Arahattamagga; Nana and
              Sabbannuta Nana." He did not allow his mind to hover over these
              defilements of vipassana and to become attached to them; he let it remain
              inclined to the object of Vipassana meditation.</p>
              <p>When thus the defiling elements of Vipassana appeared in the Bodhisatta's
              mind continuum as in the case of others, he did not allow subtle craving and
              greed known as nikanti that longed for those defiling elements to rise. He had
              the lucid, extraordinary knowledge, Nana, which discerned clearly that this
              group of defiling elements was not the proper Path to Enlightenment; it just
              led to the defilement of Vipassana. Only Udayabbaya Nana etc., form the right
              path leading to Enlightenment. This was the Bodhisatta's purity of the
              knowledge and insight into the right and wrong path, (Maggamaggananadassana
              Visuddhi).</p>
              <p><strong>6) Purity of Knowledge and Insight of the Path,
              Patipadananadassna visuddhi and <br> (7) Purity of Knowledge and Insight, (Nanadassana visuddhi)</strong>.</p>
              <p>The set of nine knowledges of Insight*, (Vipassana Nana), beginning with
              Udayabbaya Nana and ending with Anuloma Nana which arise in the mind continuum
              of the Bodhisatta is known as Purity of Knowledge and Insight of the Path. The
              Four Noble Paths, (Ariya Magga) are known as the Purity of Knowledge and
              Insight, Nanadasana Visuddhi.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>*. Nine Knowledges of Insight: According to
              Visuddhimagga, they are "(1) Knowledge of contemplation of Rise and Fall,
              Udayavayanupassana Nana which is free from imperfection and steady on its
              course, (2) Knowledge of contemplation of Dissolution, Bhanganupassana Nana;
              (3) Knowledge of appearance as terror, Bhayanupassana Nana; (4) Knowledge of
              contemplation of danger, Adinavanupassana Nana; (5) Knowledge of contemplation
              of dispassion, Nibbidanupassana Nana; (6) Knowledge of desire for deliverance,
              Muncitukamyata Nana; (7) Knowledge of contemplation of reflection,
              Patisankhanupassana Nana; (8) Knowledge of equanimity about formations,
              Sankharupekkha Nana and (9) Knowledge in Conformity with Truth, Anuloma Nana

              Nanamoli.) </span></p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p>(In this connection, it should especially be noted that:
              Sotapattimagga attained by the Buddha was the first Jhanamagga with the five
              factors of Initial application (vitakka), sustained application (vicara), joy
              (piti), happiness (sukha), and one-pointedness (ekaggata). Sakadagamimagga was
              the second Jhana Magga with the three factors of piti, sukha, and ekaggata.
              Anagami magga was the third Jhana magga with the two factors of sukha and
              ekaggata. Arahattamagga was the fourth Jhana magga with the two factors of
              upekkha and ekaggata. From the exposition of the Upakkilesa Sutta in the
              Uparipannasa Atthakatha.)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In this manner, the series of the seven Purities, described above,
              constitute the right and proper way to Nibbana. The Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas,
              and noble Disciples, of the past, present and future, realise Nibbana only
              through the series of these seven Purities; and to say the least, so do the
              noble individuals who attain the noble Path by developing at least tacapancaka
              meditation** or by hearing a Dhamma Discourse in verse delivered by a Buddha
              through a projection of his image whilst remaining at the monastery. They all
              attain the Noble Path, Ariya Magga only going through these seven Purities
              successively.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>**. Tacapancaka meditation: meditation on the
              first five features of the body with skin (taca) as the fifth, the other four
              being hair on the head (kesa), hair on the body (loma), nail (nakha) and teeth
              (danta). It is part of the mindfulness meditation of the body (kayagatasati
              Bhavana).</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>A question may be raised thus: If all the Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas and
              Disciples of the three passages of time realise Nibbana only through the series
              of the seven Purities, should not all these noble persons be alike in every
              respect? Why should there be such differences as: He was a Buddha, he was a
              Paccekabuddha, he was a Chief Disciple (Aggasavaka), he was a great Disciple,
              (Mahasavaka), he was an ordinary Disciple (pakatisavaka)?</p>
              <p>The answer is: Although Nibbana is realised by all the Buddhas,
              Paccekabuddhas and Noble Disciples only through the series of the seven
              Purities, they are originally different in wisdom (panna) in practice
              (patipada) in faith (saddha) and in inherent disposition (ajjhasaya dhatu).</p>
              <p>Therefore, the noble individual who realise Arahatta phala through
              knowledge acquired by hearing the Dhamma from others (Sutamaya Nana) after
              having developed the Paramis according to the strength of his saddha and panna,
              throughout a period one hundred thousand world cycles, or more, or less, are
              designated Pakatisavakas and Mahasavakas.</p>
              <p>The noble individuals who realise Arahatta phala through Sutamaya Nana after
              having developed the Paramis throughout a period of one Asankhyeyya and one
              hundred thousand world cycles, or slightly less, are designated Aggasavakas.</p>
              <p>The noble individuals who realise Arahatta phala through knowledge
              independently acquired (without being taught by others but by (Sayambhu Nana)
              after having developed the Paramis throughout a period of two asankhyeyya and
              one hundred thousand world cycles but are incapable of teaching others the
              Dhamma in order to enable them to attain Magga and Phala and Nibbana are
              designated Paccekabuddhas.</p>
              <p>The noble peerless individuals who after valiantly fulfilling their Paramis
              for (the minimum period of) four asankhyeyya and one hundred thousand world
              cycles and performing the five Great Sacrifices, which are not the concern of
              Pacceka Bodhisattas and Savaka Bodhisattas, attain Arahatta phala pinnacled by
              Sabbannuta Nana by means of Sayambhu Nana; superbly skilled in the use of words
              they give Dhamma discourse with Four Profundities namely, profundity of deep
              and subtle text (Pali), profundity of meaning, profundity of the teaching, and
              profundity of the penetrating wisdom; they do so in many ways to suit the
              inherent dispositions of sentient beings; they are able to convey all worthy
              beings (veneyyas) to the Path, Fruition and Nibbana and thus become their
              refuge; they are designated Perfectly Self-Enlightened Ones, Omniscient
              Buddhas, Lords of the three worlds. Since our noble Bodhisatta also is of such
              nature, he too is a Prefectly Self-Enlightened One, Lord of the three worlds
              and an Incomparable Buddha. (This is the answer.)</p>
