              <p>Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche:</p>
              <p><strong>Bardo</strong></p>
              <p><br>ALL SENTIENT BEINGS ARE IN A SITUATION called bardo. Bardo means<br>an intermediate state which is between two points of time. Right now<br>we are in the intermediate state between our birth and our death called the<br>bardo of this life. This bardo lasts from the moment we take birth until we<br>enter the circumstances that will cause our passing away. Two other<br>bardos are sometimes included within the bardo of this life. They are<br>called the bardo of meditation and the bardo of dreaming. We need to<br>train in the bardo of meditation during the daytime and the bardo of<br>dreaming during the night. Now, to train in the bardo of meditation, we<br>need to understand what is meant by buddha nature.</p>
              <p><br>Buddha nature is present in everyone, without any exception. It is the<br>very core of our being, the very nature of our mind. It is nature totally free<br>from all faults and fully endowed with all perfect qualities. What we need<br>to do now is simply to recognize our nature, and then sustain the<br>recognition of that. There is no need to create or manufacture a buddha<br>nature through meditation. It’s also essential to realize that every<br>experience manifests and vanishes within the expanse of our buddha<br>nature.</p>
              <p><br>The bardo of meditation takes place during the period of time we are<br>able to recognize our buddha nature, the dharmakaya nature of our mind.<br>Involvement in conceptual thinking is not called meditation. Meditation in<br>this context refers to the time when the thought has ceased and there is an<br>absence of conceptual thinking. To repeat that period over and over again,<br>from the cessation of thought to its re-occurrence, is called training in the<br>bardo of meditation. Unless we recognize this nature, we will continue in<br>samsaric existence, taking rebirth in one realm after the other. Sentient<br>beings take birth from one place to the next in samsaric existence precisely<br>because of not recognizing their nature. This lack of knowing their nature<br>is called ignorance.</p>
              <p><br>Essential meditation teachings are called pith instructions, and they are<br>both profound and direct. To illustrate this point I will tell about pith<br>instructions given by Paltrül Rinpoche. Once, Chokgyur Lingpa went to a<br>tent camp in the province of Golok to meet Paltrül Rinpoche, and stayed<br>with him a week. During that week Chokgyur Lingpa and his daughter<br>received transmission for the Bodhicharya Avatara and essential<br>meditation teachings.</p>
              <p><br>One evening Paltrül Rinpoche taught the daughter of Chokgyur<br>Lingpa, Könchok Paldrön, who was to become my grandmother. She<br>remembered his words very clearly, and later repeated them to me. She<br>imitated Paltrül Rinpoche’s thick Golok accent, and said, “Don’t entertain<br>thoughts about what has passed, don’t anticipate or plan what will happen<br>in the future. Leave your present wakefulness unaltered, utterly free and<br>open. Aside from that, there is nothing else whatsoever to do!” What he<br>meant was, don’t sit and think about what has happened in the past, and<br>don’t speculate on what will appear in the future, or even a few moments<br>from now. Leave your present wakefulness, which is the buddha nature of<br>self-existing wakefulness, totally unmodified. Do not try to correct or alter<br>anything. Leave it free, as it naturally is, free and wide-open like space.<br>There is nothing more to do besides that. These are the vajra words of<br>Paltrül Rinpoche, and they are truly meaningful.</p>
              <p><br>Present ordinary mind is that quality or capacity that is conscious in<br>everyone, from the Buddha Samantabhadra and Vajradhara all the way<br>down to the tiniest insect. All sentient beings are aware or conscious. That<br>which is aware or conscious is what we call mind, that which knows. It is<br>conscious, yet it also is empty, not made out of anything whatsoever.<br>These two qualities, being conscious and empty, are indivisible. The</p>
              <p>essence is empty; the nature is cognizant; they are impossible to separate,<br>just as wetness can’t be separated from water, nor heat from a flame.<br>Once this nature has been recognized, training in the bardo of meditation<br>can begin. At the moment of not recollecting anything from the past,<br>not being involved in contemplating the future and not being preoccupied<br>with something else in the present; let your present wakefulness gently<br>recognize itself. When you allow this, there is an immediate and vividly<br>awake moment. Do not try to modify or improve upon this moment of<br>present wakefulness. Leave it open and free as it is.</p>
              <p><br>As for the bardo of dreaming, dreams only occur after we have fallen<br>asleep, don’t they? Without sleep, there are no dreams. What we experience<br>while dreaming is experienced due to confusion. After we awaken,<br>from where did the dream come? Where has the dream experience gone?<br>We cannot find either of those places. It’s exactly the same with the<br>delusory daytime experiences of all the six classes of beings.<br>Examine where your dreams originate from, where they dwell, and<br>where they disappear to. Understand that although the dream does not<br>truly exist, we are still deluded by it. Now, consider the dream as an<br>example for our being conditioned by ignorance. The buddhas and<br>bodhisattvas are like people who have never fallen asleep and therefore are<br>not dreaming, while sentient beings, due to their ignorance, have fallen<br>asleep and are dreaming. Buddhas exist in the primordial state of<br>enlightenment, a state that is completely undeluded. This state moreover is<br>endowed with all qualities and free from all defects. Cut through your daytime<br>confusion, and the double delusion of dreaming atop deluded<br>samsaric existence ceases as well.</p>
              <p><br>After the bardo of this life comes the bardo of dying. The bardo of<br>dying begins the moment we catch an incurable disease that will cause our<br>death, until the moment we draw our last breath. The period lasting from<br>the inception of illness until our spirit leaves the body is called the bardo<br>of dying.</p>
              <p>It is said that the best possible achievement is to be liberated into the<br>expanse of dharmakaya during the bardo of dying. If we have recognized<br>our basic nature of self-existing wakefulness and grown accustomed to it<br>through repeated training; a supreme opportunity arises at the moment just<br>before physical death. If we are adept enough we can engage in<br>dharmakaya phowa, the mingling of self-existing awareness, the<br>dharmakaya nature of mind, with the openness of basic space. This is the<br>highest kind of phowa: in it there is no ejector and no thing to eject. You<br>remain in utterly pure samadhi; mind indivisible from basic space.<br>Dharmakaya is like space in that it is all-pervading and impartial. When<br>nondual awareness mingles with basic space, this all-pervasiveness and<br>space are inseparable. The foundation for dharmakaya phowa is the<br>realization of the self-existing wisdom that is present in each one of us. It<br>is our awareness that needs to be recognized. Mingle awareness with the<br>clear sky and rest in the phowa where nothing is moved, ejected or<br>transferred. This liberation into primordial purity is the foremost type of<br>phowa.</p>
              <p><br>If you have not recognized nondual awareness, or have not trained<br>sufficiently, and therefore can’t effect dharmakaya phowa, the bardo of<br>dying will progress further. The ‘outer breath’ of perceptible inhalation<br>and exhalation will cease, while the ‘inner breath’ of subtle energies still<br>continues to circulate. Between the ceasing of the outer and inner breaths<br>occur three experiences called appearance, increase and attainment. These<br>take place when the white element from your father, situated at the top of<br>the central channel at the crown your head, begins to move downwards,<br>inducing an experience of whiteness that is likened to moonlight. Next the<br>red element from your mother, situated below the navel, begins to move<br>upwards to the heart center, generating an experience of redness that is<br>like sunlight. The meeting of these two elements brings about an<br>experience of blackness followed by unconsciousness.</p>
              <p><br>Simultaneous with the unfolding of these three experiences, all the<br>different ‘80 innate thought states’ arising from the three poisons of desire,</p>
              <p>anger and delusion cease. There are 40 thought states that arise from<br>desire, 33 thought states that arise from anger and seven thought states that<br>arise from delusion. Every one of these ceases at the moment of blackness.<br>It is like the earth and sky merging: everything suddenly grows dark. The<br>conceptual frame of mind is temporarily suspended. If you are a<br>practitioner who is familiar with the awakened state of nonconceptual<br>awareness, you will not black out and fall unconscious at this point.<br>Instead, you will recognize the unceasing and unobstructed state of rigpa.<br>To reiterate, first there is the whiteness of appearance, second the redness<br>of increase and finally the blackness of attainment. These three are<br>followed by the state called the ground luminosity of full attainment,<br>which is the dharmakaya itself. People who are unfamiliar with the<br>awakened state of mind revealed by the cessation of conceptual thought<br>will at this point revert into a state of oblivion — the pure and undiluted<br>state of ignorance that is the very basis for further samsaric existence.<br>For most beings, this oblivious state of ignorance lasts until the ‘sun<br>rises on the third day’. However, an individual who has received instructions<br>from a spiritual teacher and has been introduced to the true nature<br>can recognize dharmakaya and attain enlightenment at this point, without<br>falling into unconsciousness.</p>
              <p><br>This recognition and awakening are often called the merging of the<br>luminosity of ground and path, or the merging of the luminosity of mother<br>and child. Through the power of genuine training in the bardo of<br>meditation this recognition occurs as naturally and instinctively as a child<br>jumping onto his mother’s lap: the mother and the child know one another,<br>so there is no doubt, no hesitation. This recognition occurs<br>instantaneously. A tantra declares: “In one moment, the difference is<br>made. In one moment, complete enlightenment is attained.” If this happens,<br>there is no reason to undergo any further bardo experiences.<br>Liberation is attained right then.</p>
              <p><br>For someone who fails to be liberated at the moment of death, according<br>to the Liberation Through Hearing in the Bardo known among Tibetans as Bardo Tödröl, the ensuing bardo states are said to generally<br>last 49 days, with a certain sequence of events occurring every seven days.<br>This is true for the average person who has engaged in a mixture of good<br>and evil deeds. For a person who has committed a great deal of evil during<br>his lifetime, the bardo can be very short; he or she may plunge immediately<br>into the lower realms. For very advanced practitioners the bardo is<br>also very short, because there is immediate liberation. But for the ordinary<br>person who is somewhere in between these two states, the intermediate<br>state is said to last an average of 49 days.5</p>
              <p><br>After the bardo of dying the bardo of dharmata begins. Ordinary<br>people feel they have woken up after being in an unconscious state for<br>three and a half days; to them it seems as though the sky unfolds again.<br>Various dissolution stages occur during the bardo of dharmata: mind<br>dissolving into space, space into luminosity, luminosity into unity, unity in<br>wisdom and, finally, wisdom dissolving into spontaneous presence. Here,<br>this unity refers to the form of the deities. First, colors, lights and sounds<br>will occur. Only four colors appear at this time, and this is called the<br>experience of the four wisdoms combined. The green light of all-accomplishing<br>wisdom is missing at this point, because the path has not yet been<br>perfected. ‘Luminosity dissolving into unity’ refers to the forms of the<br>deities. Different deities begin to appear, first in their peaceful and then in<br>their wrathful form. Some are as tiny as mustard seeds, while others are as<br>big as Mount Sumeru. The most important thing at this point is to<br>recognize that everything, whatever appears, is a manifestation of your<br>nature. The deities are your own manifestations: they do not come from<br>anywhere else. So, feel 100% confident that whatever is experienced is<br>nothing other than yourself. Another way of explaining this is that<br>whatever appears is emptiness, and that which experiences is also</p>
              <p>emptiness. Emptiness cannot harm emptiness, so there is no point<br>whatsoever in being afraid. With that kind of confidence, it is possible to<br>attain liberation at the sambhogakaya level.</p>
              <p><br>The light from the peaceful and wrathful deities is intense and overwhelming.<br>If you have received instructions regarding this stage, you can<br>recognize them with confidence as expressions of your own essential<br>nature. Otherwise, pale, soft lights representing the six realms will appear<br>in different colors. Those who are unfamiliar with such phenomena will be<br>naturally attracted to those more comfortable types of light, and this<br>attraction is what pulls the mind back into the six realms of existence. In<br>this way the fourth bardo, the bardo of becoming, begins.</p>
              <p><br>During the bardo of becoming, your power of perception is seven times<br>clearer than during the normal waking state in this life. You will remember<br>whatever you have done in the past and will be able to understand<br>whatever is taking place. You will possess six recollections: the ability to<br>remember the teacher, the teachings, the yidam deity for whom you have<br>received empowerment, and so on. When remembering the teachings you<br>received and practiced, it is most important to acknowledge that you have<br>died and are in the bardo state. Next, try to remember that everything that<br>takes place in the bardo is deluded experience. While various things are<br>perceived, they lack any self-nature, unlike in our present experience.<br>Now, if we put our hand into boiling water or into a flaming furnace it will<br>burn. Likewise, we can be crushed by the weight of huge stones. But in the<br>bardo, nothing that takes place is real. Everything is just an illusory<br>experience — so how can it harm you? This is very important to keep in<br>mind.</p>
              <p><br>At this point in the bardo, the force of your intention is unobstructed. It<br>is thus possible to take rebirth in one of the five natural nirmanakaya<br>realms, the five pure lands of the nirmanakaya buddhas. The easiest place<br>to be born is in Sukhavati, the Blissful Realm of Buddha Amitabha.<br>Buddha Amitabha made thirteen eminent vows in the past, and due to the<br>strength of these it is not necessary to have purified all disturbing</p>
              <p>emotions before being reborn in his pure realm. To enter the other<br>buddhafields, total purification is necessary, but this is not true for<br>Sukhavati. What is most important here is to be free from doubt. Engendering<br>one-pointed determination like an eagle soaring through the sky,<br>think without any hesitation, “I will now go directly to the pure land of<br>Amitabha!” If you can hold to this single thought in the bardo of becoming,<br>that alone is sufficient to go there. As long as you are not attached to<br>anything, nothing can tie you down or prevent you from reaching<br>Sukhavati. To be sure that you are free of attachments, before death, mentally<br>offer everything you own to Buddha Amitabha. Make a mandala<br>offering out of all your possessions and enjoyments, relatives and friends.<br>Anything to which you remain attached, even something as small as a<br>needle and thread; is enough to act as an anchor for your mind.<br>When the body is left behind, only the consciousness continues on —<br>all alone like a strand of hair plucked from a slab of butter. If the consciousness<br>is not bound by attachment to anything in this world, then<br>nothing can hold it back, though the existence of doubt can make some<br>difference. A consciousness that harbors doubt about rebirth in the pure<br>land of Amitabha can still be reborn there, but it will remain captive inside<br>a closed lotus bud for 500 years, until it has purified the obscuration of<br>doubt. If you can surrender all attachment to the things you have known in<br>this life and one-pointedly make the resolve, “I will go straight to<br>Amitabha’s pure land,” then it is 100% certain that you will arrive. There<br>is no hesitation or question whatsoever about this.</p>
              <p><br>In the bardo of becoming you will remember, “My stability in practice<br>was not sufficient for me to be liberated into dharmakaya at the moment of<br>passing away. It was also not quite sufficient to be liberated into<br>sambhogakaya during the bardo of dharmata. So now here I am in the<br>bardo of becoming.” Acknowledging this, make up your mind to be<br>completely free of attachment to anything. Otherwise, even the smallest<br>attachment to relatives or possessions will obsess and worry your spirit,</p>
              <p>like a dog chasing a scrap of meat. Only such attachments can really tie<br>your consciousness back to this world.</p>
              <p><br>If you do have to be reborn in this world, you will continue through the<br>bardo of becoming while seeking a new rebirth. When meeting the parents<br>who will give birth to you, imagine them as the yidam deity with consort.<br>Let your mind enter the womb in the form of the syllable HUNG, and make<br>the resolve to become a pure Dharma practitioner.</p>
              <p><br>The Vajrayana teachings provide many opportunities, many chances on<br>different levels. If we miss one opportunity, we get another chance, and if<br>we miss that there is still a chance to try again. As long as your samayas<br>are unbroken, there are many precious teachings in Vajrayana that will<br>help you cross the bardos.</p>
              <p><br>When you are fatally sick or when you face death, make up your mind<br>to combine the practice of recognizing mind essence with the resolve to go<br>straight to the pure land of Sukhavati. As the great master Karma<br>Chagmey said, “May I soar like a vulture in the sky directly to Sukhavati,<br>without looking back for a single moment!” Don’t look back! Remain<br>totally unattached to anything in this world. Don’t have any doubt: then<br>there is no question that you will go straight there.</p>
              <p><br>Always remember to begin with taking refuge and forming the<br>bodhichitta resolve to benefit all beings. For the main part of practice,<br>imagine yourself as the yidam deity. This is called the development stage.<br>Gently look into, “Who is it that visualizes? What is it that imagines all<br>this?” Not finding anything which visualizes or imagines is called the<br>completion stage. At the very same moment of looking into the thinker,<br>the fact that there is no thing to see is immediately seen. Anyone can see<br>that, if they know how to look. In the very first instant there is an absence<br>of thought. This state is not like a black-out, in that you are not<br>unconscious, but vividly awake. Yet this wakefulness doesn’t form<br>thoughts about anything. It’s like space; not the night sky, covered by<br>darkness, but like the sky lit by sunlight, where the sunlight and space are<br>indivisible. That is the naked ordinary mind present in everyone. It’s</p>
              <p>naked because at that moment there is no conceptualizing, no thought<br>activity. Ordinarily, every moment of consciousness is occupied with<br>conceptualizing and creating something. Therefore, leave your present<br>wakefulness totally unfabricated.</p>
              <p><br>Remember always to conclude your practice by dedicating the merit<br>and making pure aspirations. The pain may be very strong when we are<br>seriously ill; we might be in agony and feel miserable. Give up the<br>thought, “I’m suffering! How terrible it is for me!” Instead, think, “May I<br>take away all the pain and sickness of all sentient beings, and may their<br>stream of negative karmic ripening be interrupted! May it all be taken<br>upon myself! May I take upon myself all the sickness, difficulties and<br>obstacles which the great upholders of the Buddhadharma experience.<br>May their hindrances ripen upon me so that they all are free from any<br>difficulties whatsoever!” Such an attitude accumulates an immense<br>amount of merit and purifies immeasurable obscurations. It is difficult to<br>find anything that can create more merit than keeping this perspective. It is<br>much, much better than lying there moaning, “Why should this happen to<br>me! Why do I have to suffer?” That kind of self-pity is not of much use.<br>The wishes we make when we are close to drawing our last breath are<br>incredibly powerful. It is said that the resolve the mind forms at the verge<br>of death will definitely be fulfilled, whether it is pure or evil. Some people<br>die with the thought, “So and so did that to me! May I take revenge!”<br>Through the immense strength the mind displays during the last moments<br>before expiring, that person’s mind can be reborn as a powerful evil spirit<br>with the ability to harm others. On the other hand, if we make pure wishes<br>and aspirations, there is no question that they will be fulfilled. With the<br>finality of our human life acutely on our minds, the wishes we make and<br>resolves we form are immensely powerful. This is very important to<br>remember.</p>
              <p><br>At the moment of death, ‘time does not change, experiences change’.<br>Time here means that there is no real death that occurs, because our innate<br>nature is beyond time. It is only our experiences that change. All these experiences should be regarded as nothing but a paper tiger. When we<br>meet a real tiger, we will feel frightened, but if we see that it is merely an<br>imitation — a paper tiger — we are not frightened at all. We have no fear<br>that the paper tiger will eat us. In the same way, all the different<br>experiences that occur after death all seem real, yet they’re not. In the<br>bardo, flames cannot burn us, weapons cannot cut us; everything is<br>illusory and insubstantial. It is emptiness.</p>
              <p><br>At Tulku Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche’s monastery, called Bong Gompa,<br>north of Central Tibet, the bursar was about to pass away. My uncle,<br>Tersey Tulku was present. While the bursar was dying, he never stopped<br>talking. He said, “Well, well, now this element is dissolving, now that<br>element is dissolving, now consciousness is dissolving into space. Now<br>space is split open and all the different manifestations are appearing. The<br>vajra chains are fluttering around like crystal garlands and fresh flowers.<br>Dharmata is truly amazing!” He was laughing, and then he died. Of<br>course, he was someone who was quite stable in awareness.<br>The experiences that will appear at death and after are inconceivable,<br>and cannot exactly be described beforehand. One thing is certain, however:<br>whatever is experienced is a ‘mere appearance without any selfnature,’<br>merely felt to be, yet insubstantial. Everything is the play of emptiness.<br>Whatever is experienced is nothing other than a manifestation of<br>your innate nature — visible, but with no concrete substance.<br>Not recognizing that whatever appears in the bardo is your nature; you<br>can be terrified by the sounds, frightened by the rays and afraid of the<br>colors. These sounds, colors and lights are the natural manifestation of<br>buddha nature. They are, in fact, the Body, Speech and Mind of the<br>enlightened state: the colors are the Body, the sounds are the Speech, and<br>the light rays are the manifestation of Mind. They appear to everyone,<br>without exception, because everyone has buddha nature.</p>
              <p><br>Although these experiences appear to everyone, they can differ in the<br>length of time they are experienced. This probably corresponds to the<br>degree of stability in mind essence. Other than this difference in duration,</p>
              <p>the experiences are the same for everyone. The most important thing to<br>remember is not to feel sad or depressed about anything — there is no<br>point in that. Instead, have the attitude of a traveler who is returning home<br>while joyfully carrying the burden of the suffering of all sentient beings.</p>

              <p><strong><br> [b]From the Theravadin Perspective</strong><br> <br> From <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/lofiversion/index.php/t17918.html">http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/lofiversi...php/t17918.html</a>,<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Basically, 
              Ajahn Brahm (and the
                                      forest monks of Ajahn Chah) believe<br> there is an antarabhava, partly from the 
              numerous accounts in
                                      the<br> Suttas, and according to Ajahn his personal 
              experiences dealing
                                      with<br> the dying in Thailand (I have not inquired 
              further on this). Hoping
                                      he<br> has written on this and will be published.</span><br> <br> From <a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Pali/message/7751?viscount=100">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Pali/message/7751?viscount=100</a>,<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">&gt; 
              &gt;*Intermediate State
                                      between Existences*<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;In contrast to the orthodox stand, 
              there is significant
                                      Pali canonical<br> evidence strongly suggestive of an intermediate 
              state between one
                                      existence and<br> another, a view supported by Theravada 
              fundamentalists. Various
                                      suttas from the<br> Nikayas clearly talk about a state of existence 
              before actual
                                      rebirth as a<br> another sentient being. Let me quote some 
              examples from them.<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;In Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta (MN 3<img title="Cool" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool"> the Buddha
                                      states that for conception to<br> occur, one of the conditions is that the being 
              to be reborn
                                      (gandhabba) has to<br> be present at the moment of union between the 
              father and mother.
                                      Here, it is<br> implicitly stated that there is an intermediate 
              state of existence
                                      between death<br> in the previous existence and rebirth in the 
              next.<br> &gt; &gt;<br> &gt; &gt;There are various references to the 
              rebirths of
                                      bodhisattas as well as other<br> beings, which also imply as much. According to 
              Sampasadaniya Sutta
                                      (DN 2<img title="Cool" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool"> and<br> Sangiti Sutta (DN 33), some beings "enter the 
              mother's womb
                                      unknowing, stay<br> there unknowing and leave it unknowing", while 
              others "enter the
                                      mother's womb<br> knowing, stay there knowing, and leave it 
              unknowing". One who
                                      "enters the<br> mother's womb knowing, stays there knowing and 
              leaves it knowingï¿½
                                      is, according<br> to the commentary, a bodhisatta in its last 
              rebirth. This is
                                      confirmed by<br> several suttas that describe the bodhisatta's 
              moment of entry into
                                      the mother's<br> womb as "being mindful and fully awareï¿½.

              consider. In Metta

              [Channovada Sutta (MN 144);
                                      Channa Sutta<br> (SN 4:35:87); Catuttha-nibbana-patisamyutta

                                      also tells of "a<br> being [that] has laid down his body but has not
