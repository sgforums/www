                                      and I<br> didn’t have the money to travel. I followed a 
              sign that came in
                                      my<br> dreams. There was a bus blowing its horn 
              indicating its departure,
                                      and<br> until I got on the bus I was unaware of where I 
              was heading. I
                                      learnt<br> from the other people on that bus that they were
               going to Lhasa
                                      and<br> thence to Shigatse. A couple of days into the 
              journey I learnt
                                      that<br> they were also planning to go to Mount Kailash.</p>
              <p>“One day, while we had stopped our journey at
               Shigatse, I
                                      was<br> circumambulating Tashi Lhunpo Monastery when I 
              came across an
                                      elderly<br> man dressed in an Indian cloth doti. This 
              complete stranger gave
                                      me<br> 2000 gormo. He asked me to sit beside him, and 
              begun to tell me
                                      many<br> unusual stories. He told me that India was just 
              beyond this
                                      mountain,<br> and that I should be meeting with His Holiness 
              the Dalai Lama and
                                      many<br> other lamas. He kept urging me to head for India
               – and at the time
                                      it<br> didn’t feel at all strange, although when I 
              recall it now it
                                      seems<br> amazing to me.”</p>
              <p>There was much hardship. I had no mission of 
              my own and was
                                      just<br> following the pilgrims. I don’t remember very 
              clearly how long
                                      the<br> journey was, but I did fifteen koras round Mount
               Kailash and due to
                                      my<br> unusual actions and the words that I was 
              speaking, rumors were
                                      going<br> around that I was a dakini. People began to line
               up to see me,
                                      even<br> seeking blessings from me. It was very tiring 
              for me to deal with
                                      the<br> crowds, but a very kind monk from a nearby 
              monastery took good care
                                      of<br> me with food and drink. He even organized a 
              better system for
                                      the<br> people who came to see me for blessings, etc. 
              Many of those
                                      people<br> expressed their wish to go to India with me. One
               night, quite
                                      suddenly<br> and without any discussion, I made up my mind to
               leave for India
                                      and<br> so a man who was our guide led seventeen of us 
              from the bus along
                                      the<br> trail that leads to the border. He wasn’t very 
              experienced and it
                                      took<br> seventeen days to reach Kathmandu in Nepal. It 
              should have taken
                                      only<br> seven days. We were in no man’s land, and as 
              there were no real
                                      paths<br> or people to ask, it was impossible to tell 
              whether we were even
                                      out<br> of Tibet. We had to just follow the signs I got 
              in my dreams. When
                                      we<br> were confused about the way, I was instructed to
               go in the
                                      direction<br> where there appeared a circle of light. Maybe 
              this was the blessing
                                      of<br> the Dalai Lama or Palden Lhamo.</p>
              <p>“Sometimes we had to walk all day without any
               food or drink,
                                      and<br> sometimes we had to walk all through the night. 
              We were not
                                      prepared<br> for such a long journey.</p>
              <p>“When I arrived in Nepal, I fell seriously 
              ill with food
                                      poisoning and<br> could not continue with my companions towards 
              India. I had to stay
                                      at<br> the reception center in Kathmandu, vomiting 
              blood, which made
                                      the<br> staff suspicious that I had a contagious 
              disease. I was left to
                                      sleep<br> outside the building in a field. I was so weak 
              that I couldn't
                                      change<br> position. When I needed to move, they used long 
              sticks to push me
                                      back<br> and forth because they were afraid to touch me 
              with their hands. As
                                      my<br> condition worsened, the staff thought I wouldn’t
               survive, and so
                                      asked<br> me if I wanted to leave a last message for my 
              family and asked for
                                      the<br> address to deliver it.</p>
              <p>“So I made a request for monks from a 
              monastery to do prayers
                                      after I<br> died and to take my body for cremation to a peak
               which I later
                                      found<br> out is the holy Nagarjuna hill where Buddha had 
              spoken the
                                      sutra<br> called Langru Lungten.</p>
              <p>“I asked them to take my urine in a bottle 
              and give it to
                                      whomever<br> they met first at the Boudhanath Stupa entrance.
               By now I was<br> semi-conscious, but they were kind enough to do 
              this favor for me.
                                      The<br> person who took my urine met a man at the gate 
              who turned out to be
                                      a<br> Tibetan physician. He tested my urine and 
              diagnosed that I had
                                      been<br> poisoned with meat, prescribed some medicine and
               even sent me
                                      some<br> blessing pills. My health improved dramatically 
              and I had many
                                      good<br> dreams. When I recovered, I was sent to the 
              Dharamsala
                                      reception<br> center, together with some other newly-arrived 
              people.'</p>

              <h1>3 Year Retreat Of Venerable Lama Karma Samten Gyatso</h1>
              <div id="post-body-9522863" class="body">
              <p>When I was twenty-one, I had to decide 
              whether to continue with
                                      my studies or to practise. I chose to practise. 
              This is partly
                                      because I felt I already had a basic 
              understanding of dharma but
                                      mainly it was because I was concerned about 
              death, I had seen so
                                      much of it in my family. Soon after I took full 
              ordination, I
                                      entered the traditional three year, three month 
              and three day
                                      retreat. I did two retreats in succession. The 
              meditations
                                      practised during the retreat are as follows:</p>
              <p>        First is seven days
                                      of Dorje Phurba practice to remove obstacles and
               to<br>         provide protection. This
                                      practice is also done every evening and is<br>         continued until the end
                                      of the retreat.<br>         Then follows seven days
                                      of White Tara which is practised to insure long<br>         life and good health.
                                      This is also continued each morning until the 
              end<br>         of the retreat.<br>         Four sessions of Lotog
                                      Namzhi. These are the "Ordinary Preliminary<br>         Practices", the "Four
                                      Thoughts which Change the Mind".<br>         Four months of Ngön Dro,
                                      the "Extraordinary Preliminary Practices".<br>         These consist of 111 111
                                      prostrations, to purify the body; 111 111 Dorje<br>         Sempa mantras, to purify
                                      the speech; 111 111 mandala offerings, to<br>         purify the mind; and 111
                                      111 Guruyoga recitations, to invoke the<br>         blessing of the

              <p>On the completion of my second retreat, I 
              spent another three
                                      years in solitary retreat in a forest near the 
              retreat centre. All
                                      my instruction was from H.E. Beru Khyentse 
              Rinpoche and Venerable
                                      Kalu Rinpoche. I thought I would spend the rest 
              of my life in
                                      retreat but, in 1981, His Holiness the 16th 
              Gyalwa Karmapa and His
                                      Eminence Beru Khyentse Rinpoche requested me to 
              come to New Zealand
                                      and Australia</p>

              <div id="post-body-9522867" class="body">
              <p>Born in Nagchu, Central Tibet, a village at 
              an altitude of
                                      14,000 feet with year round ice and snow, he 
              lived with his nomadic
                                      family. At the age of ten he entered Orbak 
              Monastery, where he
                                      learned to read and write. He was ordained as a 
              novice monk at 13
                                      and memorized sutras ritual prayers and pujas , 
              and learned how to
                                      build mandalas and play ritual instruments. He 
              studied Tibetan
                                      grammar, poetry and astrology. In 1953, he 
              traveled to the capital
                                      of Lhasa and entered Sera, one of the three 
              great monastic
                                      universities in Tibet, and home to 7,200 monks. 
              It was the Junior
                                      Tutor of the Dalai Lama who fully ordained him 
              as a monk. His
                                      contemporaries at Sera were Lama Yeshe and Lama 
              Zopa, founders of
                                      Tse Chen Ling.</p>
              <p>In 1959, during the cultural revolution, 
              chinese troops shelled
                                      Sera. Geshe La's life hung on a thread for days.
               When he learned
                                      that the Dalai Lama had fled, he decided to 
              follow and escaped to
                                      India. He continued his studies at the Sanskrit 
              University in
                                      Benares (Varanasi), where he earned an M.A. with
               honors. Invited by
                                      the Queen of Sikkim to teach Tibetan at the 
              University of Sikkim,
                                      he ended up staying for 20 years before 
              returning to Sera Je
                                      monastery in South India to gain his Geshe 
              degree. At the top of
                                      his class, he became an expert in Dharma 
              (Buddha's teachings),
                                      astrology, Tibetan education, grammar and 
              poetry, as well as in
                                      philosophy. Before coming to San Francisco he 
              was resident teacher
                                      at the FPMT Center in Taipei, Taiwan.</p>

                                      comprise the morning session; practices we take

              study comes
                                      understanding; but this must be put to use. It 
              is therefore vital
                                      to put as much as one can of what one has 
              studied into practice."
                                      The Stages of the Path (lam.rim) is the 
              celebrated synthesis of the
                                      essential teachings of sutra, from guru devotion
               and renunciation
                                      up to supreme altruism and the view of the 
              Middle Way. Based on the
                                      classical Middling Lam.rim studied in

              <p>How to Make a Mandala Offering When Buddhist 
              practitioners make
                                      a mandala offering, they are offering the 
              universe to the Buddhas
                                      and Bodhisattvas. One can imagine this universe 
              as spectacular as
                                      one can, offering all that is precious to 
              oneself. Geshe Dakpa

              death; however they
                                      are practices to be cultivated throughout one's

              yet simple prayer
                                      is a powerful tool for our daily practice.<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.archive.org/details/Tse_Chen_Ling_Geshe_Dakpa_7_Limb_Prayer_20040708">http://www.archive.org/details/Tse_Chen_Ling_Geshe_Dakpa_7_Limb_Prayer_20040708</a></p>
              <p>Relying on the Spiritual Teacher<br> The basis of the achievement of any goal, 
              whether one seeks to
                                      become a pianist or a painter, is one's teacher.
               This is profoundly
                                      true in Tibetan Buddhism where it is taught that
               the Spiritual
                                      Teacher is the foundation of all of our 
              qualities and devotion to
                                      this teacher is the fuel for progression and 
              attainments upon the
                                      path. Geshe Dakpa, leads us through the 
              traditional Tibetan
                                      approach to finding, investigating, serving and 
              devoting oneself to
                                      a Spiritual Teacher.<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.archive.org/details/Tse_Chen_Ling_Geshe_Dakpa_Marin_Spiritual_Teacher_20040803">http://www.archive.org/details/Tse_Chen_Ling_Geshe_Dakpa_Marin_Spiritual_Teacher_20040803</a></p>
              <p>Preliminary Practices</p>
              <p>As Buddhist practitioners, we formalize our 
              daily according to
                                      the outline described in the Stages of the Path.
               The practice is
                                      divided into the preliminary practices; the 
              actual meditation
                                      session and the concluding practices. In this 
              series of lectures,
                                      Geshe-la teaches on the six preliminary 
              practices prior to
                                      beginning a meditation session. From cleaning

              Buddhist philosophy
                                      of emptiness; the lack of inherent existence of 
              self and phenomena.
                                      Conjoined with the understanding of dependent

              <p>Introduction to Kalachakra<br> Kalachakra Introduction Kalachakra means 
              Time-Wheel, as "Kala" is
                                      Sanskrit for Time and "Cakra" (or Chakra) is

                                      could also translate it as Time-Cycles. Much in 
              this tradition
                                      revolves around the concept of time and cycles: 
              from the cycles of
                                      the planets, to the cycles of our breath and the

                                      controlling the most subtle energies within

               kind of experience
                                      we have later. The Buddha taught that Karma is 
              the true creator of
                                      our world and ourselves so if we truly

              <p>Death, Intermediate State, and RebirthThree 
              Basic Bodies<br> Death, intermediate state and rebirth underpin 
              samsara, the
                                      condition of repeated rebirth impelled by 
              previous action and
                                      delusion. But they are also the three basic 
              bodies of Highest Yoga
                                      Tantra practice, forming the bases for

              of a Buddha. This
                                      transformation is brought about by means of 
              simulating in

              <p>Four Opponent Powers, Practice of Purifying 
              Negative
                                      Actions<br> To purify our negative karma we must practice 
              the four opponent
                                      powers: the power of regret, the power of 
              reliance, the power of
                                      remedy, and the power of resolve. Within these 
              four, one begins by
                                      reflecting on regret; the awareness that actions
               we have committed
                                      bring suffering to ourselves and others. We 
              further identify the
                                      reliance (or refuge) of one such as the Buddha, 
              who inspires us
                                      with his example; with the power of remedy we 
              commit ourselves to a
                                      practice which alleviates the results of the 
              actions we have done.

              <h1>Tibetan Longevity Practice</h1>
              <p>Tibetan Yoga became popular in US after
                                      Peter Kelder wrote the book<br> Ancient Secret Of The Fountain Of Youth in 1930,
               recording
                                      the<br> experiences of his friend who spent two years 
              with the Lamas in
                                      Tibet<br> and returned with his arthritis and eyesight 
              improved. According
                                      to<br> Kelder, Bradford's stay in the lamasery 
              transformed him from
                                      a<br> stooped, old gentleman with a cane to a tall and
               straight young man
                                      in<br> the prime of his life. Additionally, he reported
               that Bradford's
                                      hair<br> had grown back, without a trace of gray</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;amp;q=http://www.mkprojects.com/pf_TibetanRites.htm&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFLJaJmktRQsZY7tRxFY0M8neBHbw"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.mkprojects.com/pf_TibetanRites.htm</span></span></a></p>
              <p>What makes this form of exercise relevant 
              even today is
                                      that<br> practising it takes only 15 minutes and so more 
              professionals
                                      are<br> turning to the Tibetan rites.</p>
              <p>The Five Rites attract the universal energy 
              into our body,
                                      balancing<br> the seven chakras which promote the free flow of
               prana (chi
                                      energy),<br> revitalising the body and mind. They activate 
              endocrine glands
                                      and<br> regulate hormonal output.</p>
              <p>The first of the five rites requires you to 
              stand erect with
                                      arms<br> stretched out in line with your shoulders, palms
               facing downwards
                                      and<br> spin around clockwise, all the while taking deep
               breaths. The
                                      number<br> of turns is gradually increased every day.</p>
              <p>Comprising five yoga-like exercises and an 
              energising
                                      breathing<br> technique, these rites blend ancient practises 
              and modern
                                      needs<br> improves circulation, boosts the immune system 
              and improves
                                      the<br> absorption of nutrients and removal of wastes, 
              improves the<br> functioning of the digestive, respiratory, 
              nervous,
                                      cardiovascular,<br> endocrine and lymphatic systems.</p>
              <p>Your body gets stronger and more flexible. It
               keeps diabetes
                                      and<br> weight in check, improves sleep and relieves 
              backache, arthritis
                                      pain<br> and depression.</p>

              <h1>Fivefold Mahamudra by Lord Jigten Sumgon</h1>
              <div id="post-body-9522850" class="body">
              <p> After Phagmodrupa passed away Jigten Sumgon 
              went into
                                      retreat in a cave.<br> When he achieved enlightenment, he fully 
              understood the mode
                                      of<br> abiding of all phenomena. When he instructed his
               disciples, he
                                      told<br> them we have to practice the fivefold mahamudra.
               Jigten Sumgon
                                      taught<br> many systems of practice. But in essence they 
              all come back to
                                      the<br> fivefold mahamudra. Some were pith instructions 
              and some were
                                      more<br> extensive, but they all came back to the 
              fivefold mahamudra. We
                                      should<br> all be practicing the fivefold mahamudra. 
              Because the
                                      fivefold<br> mahamudra is the path to enlightenment, if you 
              do not practice
                                      the<br> fivefold mahamudra, your practice will not lead 
              to enlightenment.
                                      The<br> fivefold mahamudra comes down to the three 
              excellences: first<br> generating the enlightened attitude, performing 
              the practice,
                                      and<br> finally dedicating the merit.</p>
              <p>The first branch of fivefold mahamudra is 
              bodhicitta, which is
                                      the<br> essence of the cause.. The second is the yidam 
              deity, which is
                                      the<br> essence of practice. The third branch is guru 
              yoga, which is
                                      the<br> essence of qualities. The fourth branch is 
              mahamudra, which is
                                      the<br> essence of meaning. The fifth branch is 
              dedication, which is
                                      the<br> essence of method. If we look at sutra and 
              tantra, the generation
                                      of<br> bodhicitta and dedication fall into the sutra 
              vehicle. The
                                      creation<br> and completion stages of deity practice. are the
               essence of
                                      tantra,<br> method and wisdom. Creation stage refers to 
              Chakrasamvara
                                      yidam<br> practice and completion stage refers to 
              mahamudra practice. To
                                      meet<br> with success in the path you need the blessing 
              of guru yoga, so it
                                      is<br> like a helper for the four other methods.</p>
              <p>So why do we need all five of these? Of these
               five, mahamudra is
                                      the<br> root of the other branches. But if you just 
              meditate on
                                      mahamudra,<br> your practice has emptiness but lacks compassion
               and will not lead
                                      to<br> full enlightenment. If you have compassion 
              without emptiness you
                                      will<br> not gain enlightenment. Emptiness without 
              compassion will only lead
                                      to<br> the fruit of the lower vehicles. So you need to 
              develop both. We
                                      need<br> both method, the creation stage, and wisdom, the
               completion
                                      stage.<br> Completion stage purifies obscuration of mind 
              and creation
                                      stage<br> purifies the obscuration of appearances. So that
               is why both
                                      are<br> necessary. When we do creation stage, we need 
              completion stage,
                                      so<br> that we do not view the form of the deity as a 
              substantial reality.
                                      So<br> in this way each branch depends upon the others.</p>
              <p>Bodhicitta is the essence of the Mahayana. 
              Without it all the
                                      other<br> branches cannot lead to full enlightenment. When
               we do each
                                      practice<br> there are many places where we can get tripped 
              up. To avoid these
                                      we<br> need the blessing to follow the path, which 
              comes from guru yoga.
                                      If<br> you want to give rise to primordial wisdom, you 
              need to see the
                                      lama<br> in the form of the dharmakaya. If you don't 
              enlightenment will
                                      not<br> arise in you. All the previous Kagyu masters 
              have relied on
                                      devotion,<br> so if you lack it, you are off the path. When an
               ordinary being
                                      meets<br> their teacher they cannot see them as other than
               ordinary. As
                                      we<br> practice, we can see the teacher as Nirmanakaya.
               As we progress we
                                      can<br> see the teacher as Sambhogakaya. Finally we can 
              see the teacher
                                      as<br> dharmakaya. So we practice visualizing the lama 
              as the four
                                      kayas,<br> including Svabhavikaya. You can understand these
               as being<br> progressively profound and subtle, the outer, 
              inner, secret,
                                      and<br> essence practices. As you see the lama, you 
              receive the blessings
                                      from<br> the four kayas. Eventually you realize you do 
              not need to look
                                      outside<br> yourself any more.</p>
              <p>I will not go into too much more detail. 
              First we generate the
                                      mind of<br> enlightenment, do the creation and completion 
              stage practice, then
                                      the<br> guru yoga and finally the dedication. The 
              dedication is so that we
                                      do<br> not lose merit of practice through the faults of
               anger, wrong
                                      view,<br> doubt, or regret. We have to look into our 
              purpose for doing
                                      the<br> practice. Dedication is what makes the fruit 
              come forth.
                                      Practice<br> without dedication is like an arrow that has not
               been shot.
                                      Dedication<br> is divided into relative, and absolute, which 
              does not conceive of
                                      the<br> three spheres of dedicator, dedication, and 
              beings dedicated
                                      to.</p>
              <p>So now you see the need for these five stages
               of practice: First
                                      there<br> is bodhicitta. Without bodhicitta, practice does
               not lead to<br> enlightenment. Why? Because without it you fall 
              into the
                                      lower<br> vehicle, because you only think of your own 
              benefit. Secondly, we
                                      have<br> the yidam deity practice. Without it you cannot 
              overthrow
                                      ordinary<br> appearances. Then thirdly, you must have 
              devotion to the lama to
                                      give<br> rise to experience. So it is extremely 
              important. Fourth is
                                      mahamudra.<br> Without it you cannot cut off the root of 
              existence. The
                                      fifth,<br> dedication of merit, is necessary because 
              without it whatever
                                      merit<br> generated will not last. So now if you have all 
              five branches,
                                      all<br> stages of practice are included and you do not 
              need anything
                                      else.</p>
              <p>We have five afflictive emotions and this 
              practice transforms
                                      them.<br> Bodhicitta transforms hatred. Yidam practice is 
              the antidote
                                      to<br> arrogance, the grasping to a self. Meditating on
               the lama
                                      counteracts<br> jealousy. Mahamudra counteracts ignorance or 
              delusion. Tilopa
                                      said<br> that thousands of eons of darkness can be 
              vanquished with one lamp.
                                      So<br> similarly mahamudra counteracts delusion. 
              Finally dedication<br> counteracts desire and attachment. Desire is 
              attachment and
                                      clinging<br> and keeps us from giving. So giving counteracts 
              attachment.</p>
              <p>So we have five dharmas brought onto the path
               through the
                                      fivefold<br> mahamudra. These five fruits are relative 
              bodhicitta, which gives
                                      rise<br> to absolute bodhicitta which is mahamudra. Yidam
               practice exhausts
                                      the<br> appearances of ordinary body, speech and mind. 
              The guru yoga leads
                                      to<br> the true nature of mind itself. When you 
              meditate on your mind
                                      as<br> inseparable from the lama's you give rise to 
              unfabricated devotion
                                      and<br> realize the true lama, the nature of your mind. 
              Practicing
                                      the<br> mahamudra leads you to find the Buddha is not 
              outside yourself
                                      and<br> leads beyond hope and fear. Fifth, dedication 
              results in the<br> accomplishment of your aims without effort.</p>
              <p>Next comes how fivefold mahamudra overcomes 
              the five classes
                                      of<br> demons. Bodhicitta overcomes the male demons, 
              which are the result
                                      of<br> hatred. Yidam practice overcomes the spirits of 
              Mara, which are
                                      the<br> result of arrogance. Guru yoga overcomes samaya 
              breaking spirits,
                                      the<br> results of jealousy. Mahamudra overcomes the 
              naga spirits, who
                                      take<br> birth as a result of illusion. Dedication 
              overcomes female
                                      evil<br> spirits, who are the embodiment of desire.</p>
              <p>Practice overcomes birth in the five realms, 
              which is the result
                                      of<br> the five kleshas. Asuras and humans are grouped 
              as one, so there
                                      are<br> five realms instead of six. Mahamudra also 
              develops the five<br> primordial wisdoms. Each wisdom is the 
              purification of its<br> corresponding klesha. Bodhicitta leads to 
              mirrorlike wisdom.
                                      Yidam<br> practice leads to the wisdom of equanimity. Guru
               yoga leads to the
                                      all<br> accomplishing wisdom. Mahamudra leads to the 
              wisdom of the<br> dharmadhatu. Dedication leads to discriminating 
              wisdom.</p>
              <p>There is much more I can say and I can't say I
               fully understand
                                      the<br> text. Beginners should practice each stage in 
              succession. But at
                                      the<br> end we see they are all not separate from the 
              nature of mahamudra.
                                      So<br> why do we do them in succession? When bodhicitta
               is complete we
                                      call<br> it bodhicitta mahamudra. When in creation stage 
              we realize the
                                      unity<br> of emptiness and appearance, we call this 
              mahamudra of the deity.
                                      When<br> we realize our minds are inseparable from the 
              lamas and give rise
                                      to<br> unfabricated devotion, this is devotion 
              mahamudra. In mahamudra
                                      when<br> we see all phenomena in samsara and nirvana are 
              not dual, we
                                      realize<br> the mahamudra of the abiding nature. When we 
              dedicate without<br> dedicator, object dedicated, or beings dedicated
               to, we
                                      realize<br> mahamudra that is beyond the three spheres. 
              These are not just
                                      nice<br> words. If we practice we will realize this.</p>
              <p>When we practice, we should practice all five
               in a single
                                      session. In<br> every moment we should practice all five. So how
               do you do this?
                                      How<br> do you make sure you don't leave anything out? 
              If you do
                                      Chenrezig<br> practice, you begin with refuge and generation 
              of the
                                      enlightened<br> mind, which is bodhicitta practice. When you 
              visualize yourself
                                      as<br> Chenrezig, that is yidam practice. Visualizing 
              Amitabha on your
                                      crown<br> is the lama practice. Completion stage practice 
              is mahamudra. At
                                      the<br> end is dedication, which is dedication practice.
               When you eat,
                                      you<br> should meditate on compassion, which is 
              bodhicitta. See your body
                                      as<br> the abode of the deity, which is yidam. 
              Visualize your lama in
                                      your<br> throat which is guru yoga. See everything as a 
              dream, which
                                      is<br> mahamudra. And dedicate at the end of the meal, 
              which is
                                      dedication.</p>
              <p>In brief, the Drikung tradition of the 
              fivefold mahamudra is
                                      practiced<br> by all the Kagyu traditions. The Drukpa Kagyu 
              and Karma Kagyu<br> mahamudra texts accept fivefold mahamudra as 
              valid. All the
                                      great<br> Kagyu masters have come to enlightenment on this
               path. But
                                      the<br> individual must be diligent and work hard. If 
              not practiced
                                      the<br> qualities of the practice will not manifest.. 
              Buddha said I only;
                                      show<br> the path. Jigten Sumgon said I have extracted 
              butter from
                                      milk.<br> Whether you taste it is up to you.</p>

              <h1>Heart Advice of Achos Rinpoche</h1>
              <p>Here is the will of Precious Abbot Achos, who achieved the
                                      rainbow body when near to passing away.<br> <br> I reverently prostrate to the perfect gurus and 
              to all the
                                      victorious ones, and offer a few meaningful 
              words to you disciples
                                      who traverse great distances. From the pure 
              karma collected in the
                                      past and by pure prayer you have achieved the 
              freedoms and
                                      endowments of the perfect human rebirth and 
              reached the holy seat,
                                      the place of origin of the Buddha’s teaching.<br> <br> Guided by the holy virtuous friend, and so 
              forth, you have all the
                                      inner and outer conditions gathered in having 
              this precious
                                      opportunity. In order to repay the kindness of 
              His Holiness who
                                      embodies all the objects of refuge, it is 
              worthwhile to attend,
                                      listen to, and reflect upon these teachings. Do 
              not cling to this
                                      life, which has SMALL BENEFIT AND GREAT DANGER.<br> <br> Always make effort in the divine Dharma, which 
              definitely benefits
                                      the entire future. The Victorious Buddha 
              advised: “Engage the
                                      activities of the three doors for the sake of 
              others, thus one’s
                                      own success is achieved along the way.”1 There 
              is no difference
                                      between male and female as evil friends of 
              negative karma who make
                                      you lose this and all future lives therefore 
              throw them far away
                                      like a stone used for cleaning your bottom.<br> <br> The virtuous friend and virtuous companion is 
              the originator of
                                      qualities therefore correctly devote and 
              dedicate yourself. Pure
                                      morality and great wisdom are the main qualities
               therefore you
                                      should know them. The great and lesser vehicle 
              is just a way of
                                      thinking therefore do not separate from 
              bodhicitta. If you engage
                                      in too much meaningless talk it becomes a basis 
              for fighting
                                      therefore limit your speech.<br> <br> If you create turmoil within a group of the 
              sangha then hell is the
                                      place you will go therefore be careful not to 
              cause disunity among
                                      the sangha. If you become very partisan with 
              regard to doctrinal
                                      schools then you collect the negative karma of 
              abandoning the holy
                                      Dharma therefore train the mind in pure 
              appearance regarding all
                                      the Dharma.<br> <br> If you don’t both memorise the words and reflect
               on their meaning
                                      it is difficult to become self-disciplined by 
              just hearing the
                                      teachings therefore engage in both. In short, 
              harmonise the
                                      instructions of your own spiritual teachers and 
              the Buddha’s
                                      teachings; this is sufficient advice. Other than
               that, there is no
                                      need for further explanation it is better to let
               this old monk
                                      recite OM MANI PADME HUM. I am here requesting 
              and praying to the
                                      three Sublime Ones, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha for 
              you to have
                                      happiness in this and future lives. I offer this
               as a present to
                                      the assemblies who have a karmic connection with
               me.<br> <br> <br> This was bestowed as instruction to many 
              disciples who went to
                                      study the Dharma, by the possessor of learning, 
              the abbot Achos
                                      Rinpoche, the invisible hidden great yogi who, 
              when near to passing
                                      away into the sorrowless state, left in a 
              rainbow body. May all be
                                      virtuous and auspicious.</p>

              <h1>The Dark Red Amulet, Practice of Vajrakilaya</h1>
              <p>"The practice of Vajrakilaya blazes at the heart of the ancient
                                      Vajrayana traditions of Tibet. The wrathful 
              heruka Vajrakilaya is
                                      the yidam deity who embodies the enlightened 
              activity of all the
                                      buddhas, manifesting in an intensely wrathful 
              yet compassionate
                                      form in order to subjugate the delusion and 
              negativity that can
                                      arise as obstacles to the practice of Dharma. In
               fact, the practice
                                      of Vajrakilaya is famous in the Tibetan Buddhist
               world as the most
                                      powerful for removing obstacles, destroying the 
              forces hostile to
                                      compassion, and purifying the spiritual 
              pollution so prevalent in
                                      this age."--Sogyal Rinpoche<br> <br> The Dark Red Amulet presents the Vajrayana 
              practice of Vajrakilaya
                                      according to the oral transmission lineage of 
              the great
                                      seventeenth-century treasure-revealer Tsasum 
              Lingpa. Vajrakilaya
                                      embodies the enlightened activity of all the 
              buddhas that
                                      subjugates delusion and negativity in order to 
              clear obstacles to
                                      spiritual practice. The essential purpose of 
              Vajrakilaya practice
                                      is to "discover the absolute vajra nature that 
              will transform every
                                      duality hindrance into clear wisdom and 
              compassion."<br> <br> In this text, the renowned scholars and

               York<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.padmasambhava.org/">http://www.padmasambhava.org/</a><br> <br> When he was nearly eighteen, Tsasum Lingpa 
              dreamt that Guru
                                      Padmasambhava and Yeshe Tsogyal told him that he
               would have begun
                                      to reveal terma teachings at around age fifteen,
               or even thirteen,
                                      but due to many obstacles and hindrances he was 
              prevented from
                                      revealing them. They said, "Now you are 
              approaching age eighteen,
                                      and if you are unable to reveal terma teachings 
              within three years,
                                      all your missions of this life and future 
              lifetimes could be
                                      jeopardized! Therefore, you have to be prepared 
              and determined to
                                      carry on and change your life."<br> <br> Guru Padmasambhava and Yeshe Tsogyal gave him 
              many empowerments and
                                      teachings in this dream. They took him by the 
              hand and pointed to a
                                      large storehouse filled with countless jewels 
              and precious objects
                                      and said, "There are many treasures inside, 
              choose one!" A lady
                                      appeared (who was actually a dakini), and they 
              told him, "She will
                                      be your companion. You and she will undertake 
              many beneficial
                                      activities. Today you must select the terma keys
               you would like to
                                      take from among these treasures." He asked, "How
               can I choose?" and
                                      the lady told him, "Choose the keys!" Tsasum 
              Lingpa and the lady in
                                      the dream went into the storehouse, and he took a
               blue key made of
                                      sapphire. She told him to take another one, and 
              he took a red key
                                      made of ruby. The lady took a white key made of 
              silver.<br> <br> When they returned, Yeshe Tsogyal smiled and 
              looked at Guru Padma
                                      sambhava and said, "Our son chose the right 
              keys!" Then Tsasum
                                      Lingpa asked, "What are these keys? What is 
              their purpose?" They
                                      said, "The sapphire key is the key of all the 
              oceanlike tantra
                                      teachings, the ruby key is the key of the voice 
              of the Buddha's
                                      teaching, and the silver key is the key related 
              to the skillful
                                      means of visualization, the creation-stage 
              practice. These three
                                      keys symbolize the three kayas of the ultimate 
              nature. If you had
                                      chosen the yellow key, you would have become 
              very wealthy and
                                      powerful as a universal king, but you would have
               had many obstacles
                                      and distractions. If you had chosen the green 
              key, it would have
                                      benefited yourself, but not others.<br> <br> Therefore, the keys you have chosen are good. 
              Please keep them well
                                      protected." Then Guru Padmasambhava and Yeshe 
              Tsogyal gave Tsasum
                                      Lingpa three small rolls of paper in red, white,
               and blue colors,
                                      telling him, "Keep these symbols of the three 
              kayas close to
                                      you."<br> <br> Guru Padmasambhava handed a dorje and drilbu 
              (bell) to Tsasum
                                      Lingpa and said,"Keep these with you as well," 
              and so he kept them
                                      with a lot of respect and prayed. He had been 
              wearing multicolored
                                      thread on his ring finger, and he untied the 
              thread and wrapped it
                                      around the three rolled papers that he received 
              so that he could
                                      wear the three rolled papers on his ring finger.
               Then Guru
                                      Padmasambhava said, "Son, near the right side of
               the glacier
                                      mountain of Jowo Zegyal there is a mountain 
              called Ahmye Mutri,
                                      where you will see a rock that looks as though 
              it is jumping up in
                                      the sky. In that rocky place, you will find 
              special instructions
                                      about that ruby key that you took, which you 
              must reveal before the
                                      fifteenth day of this month. You must go there 
              very quickly—if you
                                      delay, you could miss that opportunity. Soon, 
              after one year, I
                                      will send you another message with another 
              invitation, but in the
                                      meantime, after you reveal this, you must travel
               far and wide,
                                      don't stay in one place." Tsasum Lingpa then 
              bowed with great
                                      respect to Guru Rinpoche.<br> <br> At that moment wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal 
              changed into an ordinary
                                      lady's form. She gave him other instructions and
               teachings, and
                                      then other ladies, some wrathful, some peaceful 
              and beautiful, gave
                                      him numerous instructions and took him to 
              wondrous places in this
                                      dream.<br> <br> And at the end Yeshe Tsogyal said, "Now you go 
              back and we will
                                      return to Udiyana, and soon we will meet again."
               In his dream
                                      Tsasum Lingpa asked,"If you don't accompany me, 
              then who will
                                      accompany me?" Yeshe Tsogyal told him, "Don't 
              worry, you will have
                                      soon an assistant. There is a place called 
              Tashu, and there is an
                                      emanation of the wisdom dakini from Tashu who 
              has all the
                                      characteristics of the Ratna family. This dakini
               will await your
                                      arrival at the place where you are going due to 
              your aspirations
                                      your bodhichitta commitment. Later we will also 
              come and help you."
                                      She and another dakini then flew up in the sky, 
              and then Tsasum
                                      Lingpa woke up. He looked around and saw that 
              the sun was already
                                      on the mountain's peak.</p>

              <h1>The Benefits Of Nyung Nay Practice, No lower realm rebirth</h1>
              <p>By keeping the 8 vows which are:<br> <br> l. No killing<br> 2. No stealing<br> 3. No sex<br> 4. No telling lies<br> 5. No drinking alcohol<br> 6. No singing or dancing, makeup or ornaments<br> 7. No evening meals<br> 8. No sitting in high seats<br> <br> for a period of 24 hours, along with The 
              Chenrezig Practise<br> and reciting The Mani Mantra, by doing these 
              things brings a
                                      real<br> benefit to the practioner and to the place where
               he or she
                                      practices.<br> By keeping the 8 vows thoroughly for 24 hours 
              purifies<br> the bad karma that will cause an individual to 
              fall into The
                                      Hell<br> Realm and by fasting one purifies the bad karma 
              to be reborn in
                                      The<br> Hungry Ghost Realm. By keeping silent one 
              purifies the bad karma
                                      to<br> be reborn in The Animal Realm.<br> <br> All suffering and misfortune comes front 
              negative powers, so
                                      The<br> Nyung Nay practice is to increase the positive 
              powers so that it
                                      can<br> bring happiness and harmony. It is one of the 
              most effective<br> practices to purify our defilements, and to 
              purify
                                      environmental<br> pollution.<br> <br> By doing group practice one creates a very 
              efficient method
                                      for<br> extending our lives, and stopping disease, 
              drought, and also war.
                                      The<br> Nyung Nay practice was founded by Bhikshuni 
              Phalmo who was a
                                      serious<br> leprosy patient. By doing this practice for a 
              period of twelve
                                      years<br> along with The Chenrezig practice, she became a 
              great Siddhi.
                                      By<br> reciting The Mani Mantra it purifies the six 
              seeds of the six
                                      realms<br> and it pacifies the suffering of all beings and 
              brings peace to
                                      the<br> world, so in this degenerate time it is the best
               practice for
                                      the<br> cause of World Peace. Finally, it brings 
              enlightenment,

              Chenrezig
                                      anytime.<br> <br> 'We start before sunrise on the first day, with 
              the first puja (we
                                      do three pujas the first two days, one puja on 
              the last day). If
                                      you don't know already, a puja is a collection 
              of prayers etc that
                                      are compiled into a text, or sadhana. Usually 
              the first day lama
                                      will do a lot of it in English and give 
              additional instruction and
                                      teachings especially if there is anyone who 
              hasn't done the
                                      practice before. Every time I do this retreat, I
               learn something
                                      new. The first time you do it, just go along for
               the ride and don't
                                      expect yourself to keep up. Pretty much every 
              thing you need to
                                      know about Tibetan Buddhist meditation and 
              rituals is in this
                                      retreat, so it's highly informative but can also
               be overwhelming in
                                      the beginning. You will get a chance to chant, 
              do prostrations, do
                                      various mudras, recite mantras and visualize 
              1000-armed Chenrezig
                                      (Avalokiteshvara). You'll get even more out of 
              this retreat once
                                      you have the long dharani memorized and the 
              visualization
                                      down.<br> <br> You can drink clear fluids all that first day. 
              We have a vegetarian
                                      meal before noon there are particular 
              ingredients that are not
                                      allowed and after that we are pau with food 
              until the end of the
                                      retreat. After the last puja of the day usually 
              over around 7pm,
                                      once you fall asleep, say goodbye to fluids and 
              talking as
                                      well.<br> <br> To get the most out of the retreat, if is 
              recommended that on your
                                      breaks you continue to meditate, read dharma 
              texts, work on
                                      memorizing mantras etc. You can do other 
              activities as long as they
                                      don't lead you to break one of the vows, but you
               won't be
                                      maximizing your gains if they aren't dharma 
              related. Napping is
                                      okay as well. I have a really hard time sleeping
               the last night, so
                                      I try to get some sleep in during the day.If you
               accidentally speak
                                      or dance or some such thing, go up to the shrine
               and purify
                                      yourself again with the saffron water. No one 
              expects you to be
                                      perfect. Intentional transgressions of vows, on 
              the other hand,
                                      can't be good.<br> <br> The last day we get up very early so that the 
              puja will be over
                                      around sunrise. At the end of it we drink hot 
              lemon water when the
                                      lama okays it. Then we do dedication prayers and
               other prayers and
                                      eat, usually a meal of rice soup. If you haven't
               had the 1000-armed
                                      Chenrezig empowerment, lama will usually do that
               ceremony after we
                                      eat. Then you get your "I survived Nyungne" 
              t-shirt (just
                                      kidding).'</p>

              <h1>Healing Chod Of Most Venerable Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche</h1>
              <p>During the retreat at Jangchubling Monastery in India in March
                                      2000,<br> Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche solely received the Chod
               tantra empowerment
                                      as<br> well as the dharma instrument from His Holiness 
              Drikung
                                      Kyabgon<br> Chetsang Rinpoche in His Holiness’s retreat 
              room. It was too
                                      pitch<br> dark to see anything when the lama led Rinchen 
              Dorjee Rinpoche the
                                      way<br> from Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche’s retreat room to 
              that of His
                                      Holiness<br> Chetsang Rinpoche. At the time of the perfect 
              completion of
                                      the<br> empowerment and transmission of teaching upon 
              Rinchen Dorjee
                                      Rinpoche<br> from His Holiness Chetsang Rinpoche in His 
              Holiness’s retreat
                                      room,<br> thunder growled in the sky above the retreat 
              room and His
                                      Holiness<br> immediately foretold that Rinchen Dorjee 
              Rinpoche’s dharma
                                      activities<br> would flourish and come to perfection in the 
              future, thus
                                      benefiting<br> more sentient beings. Later on when Rinchen 
              Dorjee Rinpoche was on
                                      way<br> back to the retreat room after receiving the 
              empowerment and<br> transmission of teaching from His Holiness 
              Chetsang Rinpoche, the
                                      dark<br> clouds disappeared and the sky became so clear 
              that the moon and
                                      stars<br> were particularly brilliant, which is a very 
              auspicious sign.
                                      Human<br> bones that are made for the dharma instruments 
              represent
                                      impermanence<br> to remind people that there is nothing but only 
              bones left after
                                      they<br> die, and therefore there is nothing worth being 
              attached to!
                                      The<br> dharma instrument (made of the tibia bone of a 
              young woman who
                                      had<br> died from an accident), which Rinchen Dorjee 
              Rinpoche uses
                                      during<br> conduction of the Chod rituals was the one that 
              His Holiness,
                                      Rinchen<br> Dorjee Rinpoche’s root Guru, he used for 
              performing Chod (photos 1,
                                      8,<br> 13). In 2006, His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon 
              Chetsang Rinpoche
                                      bestowed<br> upon Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche this Dharma 
              instrument, symbolizing
                                      that<br> Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche has directly received 
              the Chod of
                                      Drikung<br> Kagyu tradition. Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche ever 
              enlightened that
                                      there<br> will be more and more people attending the Chod 
              puja if the
                                      conduction<br> of Chod ritual could be completed perfectly to 
              transfer the<br> consciousness of the deceased.<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gloje.org/en/a-brief-biography">http://www.gloje.org/en/a-brief-biography</a><br> <br> For the years, Most Venerable Rinchen Dorjee

                                      disciples,<br> it has now become the biggest Drikung Kagyu 
              center in both size
                                      and<br> scope. His Holiness came to Taiwan in 2004 to 
              preside over
                                      the<br> center’s inauguration ceremony and personally 
              wrote a Long Life
                                      Prayer<br> for Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche at the request of 
              the disciples. In
                                      2006,<br> His Holiness explicitly pronounced: “Yen 
              (Rinchen Dorjee
                                      Rinpoche’s<br> family name) Rinpoche is the best disciple I’ve 
              ever had. His<br> achievement in practice comes in a natural way. 
              He has been
                                      learning<br> and practicing outstandingly.” During the great 
              pujas held in
                                      recent<br> years, Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche was allowed to

              <h1>A River that Cannot be Frozen by  Garchen Rinpoche</h1>
              <h3>On Meditation</h3>
              <p><em><strong><a href="http://www.khandro.net/lama_Garchen_Rinpoche.htm#the%20wish-%20fulfilling%20jewel">Ratnashri</a></strong></em> <strong><em>Tibetan
              Meditation Center</em>,</strong> Sept. 15, 2001 <br> <br> "A few years ago when I was in my monastery in Tibet, an American 
              visited
              me and asked for teaching. I had a difficult time talking to him because
               I knew
              no English and the American didn't understand Tibetan. So I composed 
              this prayer
              in Tibetan and gave it to him. He spent a week with me in the monastery.
               He
              didn't know how to eat Tibetan food like <em>tsampa</em> [<span style="font-size: x-small;">salt
              butter-tea
               and roast barley mix</span>] and I had to show him. I had a nice time
              with him. The teaching I gave him was later translated, but it has been a
               long
              time since I wrote it and I've forgotten what that teaching was all 
              about.<br> <br> Buddha Shakyamuni taught eighty-four thousand different teachings 
              according to
              the interests and abilities of his disciples. There are three types of
              disciples: those of greater, middling and lesser abilities, and Buddha 
              taught
              them accordingly. There are some teachings for the very intelligent that
              liberate in this lifetime. For the middling there are teachings that 
              will
              liberate in the next life or in some future life. And for those of 
              lesser
              ability, there are teachings that will prevent <a href="http://www.khandro.net/doctrine_rebirth.htm">rebirth
              in the lower realms</a>. </p>
              <p>There are immense benefits in practicing and hearing the dharma. You 
              don't
              have to feel discouraged because of lack of improvement in your 
              practice,
              because there are many layers of obscuration. Just as deep snow takes a
              long time to melt, those with thick obscurations will see improvement 
              slowly. So
              don't feel discouraged.<br> <br> The teaching of the Buddha is that the nature of mind contains the seed 
              of
              enlightenment. All sentient beings, even the smallest insect are equal 
              in that
              regard. But insects must endure more suffering as a result of their 
              negative
              karma. There are special means for saving beings like insects, through 
              mantra
              and blessing pills that will liberate them from their suffering.<br> <br> Even though the nature of mind carries the seed of enlightenment, we 
              have many
              sufferings. Enlightened beings like Shakyamuni Buddha are liberated from
              suffering. The qualities of buddhas are vast -- like space or the ocean.
               We are
              obscured, like a cloud[-y sky], and enlightened beings are un-obscured, 
              like
              space. There are few enlightened beings and many who are ordinary. 
              Enlightened
              beings [are those that] have realized the equality of samsara and 
              nirvana. They
              have realized the inseparability of appearance and emptiness. But 
              ordinary
              beings have not realized this.  Once they understand impermanence and 
              that
              the mind cannot be found, they will have no attachment to phenomena. 
              When they
              have no attachment, they will be freed from samsara.<br> <br> In reality, the basic mind of ordinary beings and buddhas are equal. It 
              is like
              water colored with different colors. Despite the colors, it is all 
              water.
              Similarly, the minds of ordinary beings and buddhas are the same. But 
              because we
              search all the time for happiness in this life and [seek] to avoid 
              suffering, we
              are bound by afflictive emotions. That is how ordinary beings and 
              buddhas are
              different.<br> <br> The deluded minds of ordinary beings see the unreal as real. It is like a
              jaundiced person who sees a white conch shell as yellow [<em>sic</em>.] 
              The
              deluded mind sees phenomena as existent, concrete, and permanent. Even 
              though
              there is no self in form, the deluded mind grasps at form as a self.<br> <br> There are different levels of people. Some have practiced the dharma in 
              previous
              lives. When they hear the teachings, they immediately have confidence in
               them,
              because their obscurations are few.  Others do not have such confidence,
              because their obscurations are thick. Some scientists are brilliant, but
               they
              cannot see the nature of mind. Only an enlightened being like Shakyamuni
               Buddha
              can really understood the nature of mind.<br> <br> There are many jewels in this world, but only the dharma is <a name="the%0A%20wish-%20fulfilling%20jewel">the
              Wish-fulfilling Jewel</a>: It can remove the root of suffering.  That is
              why the dharma is regarded as the incomparable jewel. The three refuges 
              are
              Buddha, dharma, and sangha. Buddhas were once like us, but through their
              practice, they have become a refuge to all beings and show the way to 
              attain
              enlightenment. The essence of all the methods for attaining 
              enlightenment is
              relative and ultimate bodhicitta. The refuge [that is] the Buddha are 
              the
              enlightened beings of the past, present, and future. Their teachings are
               the
              dharma. And those who hear and practice this teaching are the sangha. In
               order
              for the sangha to be enlightened, they have to understand the nature of 
              mind.
              The teacher represents all three refuges, because the teacher's mind is 
              Buddha,
              his teaching is Dharma, and his form is Sangha.</p>
              <p>Teachers have two kinds of teaching, the absolute and relative 
              teachings. The
              absolute teaching is very simple. It is just understanding the nature of
               mind.
              When mind is understood, so are all phenomena, because all phenomena 
              come from
              the mind. Then all phenomena are seen as impermanent and all suffering 
              and
              happiness are seen as coming from mind. When you look at mind you will 
              discover
              absolute truth for yourself. Those students who are ready to practice 
              the
              absolute teachings will definitely trust what the Buddha has taught. 
              They will
              trust the teaching that happiness and suffering comes from the mind and 
              all
              phenomena arise from mind.</p>
              <p>When they look at thought in meditation, it will disappear. By being 
              mindful of
              thoughts in this way, no further karma will arise for them. When no 
              karma
              arises, there will be no suffering.<br> <br> When you understand the genuine teaching of the Buddha it will remove 
              your
              suffering because from the teachings you understand the truths of 
              impermanence
              and suffering. With this understanding, a mother will see her own child 
              is
              impermanent and must eventually die. If the child suddenly dies, the 
              mother will
              be aware that this is just how things are. But if the mother thinks of 
              the child
              as permanently existing and the child dies, the mother will suffer 
              greatly. The
              reason we do not understand our own mind is because of so many layers 
              of 
              obscuration. When a child is born, attachment and obscurations are born 
              at the
              same time in the mind of the mother.<br> <br> You have to look at the nature of obscurations and eliminate them, 
              whether they
              are greed, anger, or ignorance. It is very important to know how 
              obscurations
              develop. If you don't know this, you can't dispel them. I spoke of the 
              analogy
              of the child and its mother. First the mother likes the child, which is 
              one
              layer, then the mother sees the child as beautiful, which is a second 
              layer,
              then as intelligent which is a third layer. It is like being bound by 
              a rope.
              If the child dies because of impermanence the mother will suffer 
              greatly. If you
              know how obscuration develops, you can immediately look at the nature of
               the
              obscuration when it appears. Our minds are like ice that is frozen by 
              the cold
              of the afflictive emotions. In order to melt it, we need sunlight, which
               is the
              cultivation of bodhicitta. Ordinarily, if your enemy harms you, you will
               feel
              anger. This is like cold freezing water into ice. In a situation like 
              this it is
              important to be mindful and to cultivate bodhicitta.<br> <br> If you can make the distinction between thoughts and mind, within that 
              moment
              you can be enlightened. If you see the nature of mind and remain in that
              awareness you are enlightened. But when thoughts appear and you fail to
              recognize their nature, you become ordinary. So ordinary beings and 
              enlightened
              beings are only separated by one moment. So first you must know the 
              nature of
              your own mind.<br> <br> If you have questions, you can ask them after the break.<br> <br> Q: <em>What is the difference between relative and absolute bodhicitta?</em><br> <br> A: Relative bodhicitta is based on the understanding of cause and effect
               and
              karma. Absolute bodhicitta is based on seeing the nature of afflictive 
              emotions.
              When you see their nature is emptiness, that is absolute bodhicitta. 
              Then you
              are beyond these concepts. Cause, effect and karma do not affect 
              absolute
              bodhicitta because absolute bodhicitta is beyond concept. But until you 
              have
              realized absolute bodhicitta, you must believe in cause, effect, and 
              karma.
              Until then you should practice virtuous actions. The unity of absolute 
              and
              relative bodhicitta will happen when you understand emptiness as the 
              nature of
              the mind. At this time you will develop great compassion for those who 
              have not
              seen it. So at that point relative and absolute<br> bodhicitta unite.<br> <br> Q: <em>I have meditated for eight years and once when working I lost my 
              mind and
              didn't know what to do for ten minutes ... </em>?<br> <br> A: You have to continue with your practice of meditation, you can't 
              start and
              stop.<br> <br> Q: <em>Please tell us a mantra to use for animals</em>.<br> <br> A: Recite <em>Om mani padme hum</em>. You can chant any mantra, but the 
              'mani' is
              the best and easiest way to practice. When you chant you should chant to
               dispel
              the sufferings of all sentient beings. If you wish to practice for those
               who
              have died in this attack [<span style="font-size: x-small;">of Sept. 11, 2001 when over  
              3,000
              died as a result of terrorist acts including plane crashes into the 
              Pentagon and
              the World Trade Center, and in a field outside Pittsburg</span>] 
              visualize
              Amitabha and dissolve all beings who have died into his form.  Then
              dissolve Amitabha's form into emptiness and rest there. That is a very 
              effective
              practice.<br> <br> When you practice absolute bodhicitta, you meditate on the nature of 
              your own
              mind. Milarepa has said that this nature is our ordinary mind. Tilopa 
              says when
              you look at the mind there is nothing to be seen. This may be a familiar
              teaching to you, but those new to the dharma may not have heard it. For
              beginners, when you meditate you should not chase after your thoughts, 
              just
              recognize them. Through practicing in this way, experience develops and 
              you get
              a glimpse of the nature of mind.<br> <br> If you have trust in your teacher, when you look at the nature of your 
              own mind
              you can also think of him or her, or remember the kindness of Milarepa. 
              Then
              [that] devotion and the practice of recognizing the mind can work 
              together.
              Especially in Kagyu, devotion is emphasized. Having devotion to the 
              guru, you
              will gain enlightenment in this life. There are two teachers, the outer 
              teacher
              and recognizing the mind. The combination of these two teachers is the 
              best
              teacher.</p>
              <p>The practice of recognizing the mind will weaken your afflictive 
              emotions,
              strengthen your compassion and [your] devotion to your teachers and lead
               you to
              see the nature of your own mind.<br> <br> Progress in your practice depends on devotion. With great devotion, 
              there will
              be great progress. If you see your teacher as enlightened, you will 
              receive the
              blessings of an enlightened being. If you see him or her as an ordinary 
              being,
              you will get the blessing of an ordinary being. If your teacher does a 
              negative
              action and you only see him or her as enlightened, you can only receive
              blessings.<br> <br> The mind of the teacher and the mind of enlightened beings are 
              connected, even
              if the teacher is not fully enlightened. It is like electricity and a 
              wire. When
              the connection is made, there is light. The teacher and the student are 
              also
              connected like that. So it is important to practice with devotion to the
              teacher. It is also important to make practice a habit. You should 
              practice at
              all times by working with emotions. You should graduate from observing 
              the
              smaller emotions when you are relaxed, to observing stronger emotions. 
              When you
              have succeeded in doing this, your ability to see the nature of mind 
              will be
              like a raging fire and emotion will be like grass which only feeds it. 
              Naropa
              said that once you are well trained, you will not grasp after 
              appearances. Good
              or bad things will happen but they will pass you by<br> <br> Obscuration has no form that you can see. Still, there are countless 
              layers of
              obscuration. All these layers are removed by confidence in the law of 
              cause and
              effect and by practice and devotion to the root guru. These will dispel
              obscurations no matter how strong. Obscurations will lessen and the 
              nature of
              the mind, which is like a clear diamond, will shine forth. Then there 
              need be no
              effort to see it. It will shine effortlessly. Reading the life story of 
              Milarepa
              will lessen your obscurations. So will the practice of Chenrezig, or 
              chanting
              the mantra of the guru. </p>
              <p>Until now our life has been like watching a movie which increases
               our
              obscurations.  Chenrezig's practice is like watching a movie which
              decreases them. When they are gone, there will be enlightenment.<br> <br> Until now we have not practiced mindfulness. That is the basis of our
              obscurations and how our perceptions have become deluded. Now is the 
              time to be
              mindful of our thoughts and how they arise so that our afflictive 
              emotions will
              lessen. In that way mindfulness is like a strong fire.<br> <br> Even though you have received this method, through past habitual 
              tendencies you
              cannot dispel your emotions. To do so you should put more effort into 
              your
              practice. But in the practice of absolute bodhicita you cannot make an 
              effort,
              except by strengthening your devotion. When looking at the mind, the 
              mind must
              remain natural. You cannot apply effort. But when practicing relative 
              bodhicita
              you can apply effort by generating compassion. From now on you must make
               a
              decision that the nature of your own mind is enlightenment. In order for
               this
              nature to appear you must apply effort in practicing relative 
              bodhicitta. It is
              like an antidote for your obscurations. It is like warmth which melts 
              the ice of
              your obscurations.<br> <br> The great Jigten Sumgon, who is like the Buddha, said the only way to 
              understand
              absolute bodhicitta is to practice relative bodhicita.  You start with 
              the
              person who you love the most and then expand that love to your friends, 
              those
              you you feel indifferent to, then to your enemies and finally all 
              sentient
              beings. If you practice relative bodhicitta it will liberate you from 
              the
              suffering of the bardo, because when you practice relative bodhicitta 
              all being
              become like your mother and there is no way you will gather afflictive 
              emotions.
              In that way you will not fear the bardo state. you will see all beings 
              in the
              bardo as your mother.<br> <br> If instead of practicing compassion you have anger, it will lead you to 
              hell.
              When you are angry you will never be happy. It will even influence your 
              dreams
              and you will have nightmares. If you have anger in the bardo you will 
              also have
              bad experiences. When I was young I was very short tempered and I had 
              horrible
              dreams. But my root teacher taught me compassion and I no longer have 
              bad
              dreams.<br> <br> If you practice detachment it will be easier to keep it in the 
              intermediate
              state. If you are mindful and do not follow your attachments now, when 
              you are
              in the bardo and see your future parents, you will not be attached to 
              them and
              not be reborn in this world. The mind is like a flowing stream. It will 
              not stay
              in a cup but will go where it will go. If you do not practice well your 
              mind
              will flow away. When the glass of your body is broken, it will go where 
              it will,
              just as water would land where it spills.<br> <br> I have said many things but there are two main points. First, you have 
              to see
              all beings as your beloved. This has an immense benefit, like a wish 
              fulfilling
              jewel. This is the practice of relative bodhicitta. The second point is 
              absolute
              bodhicitta. You have to be aware of the nature of mind, no matter how 
              many
              thoughts arise. You should not be distracted by thoughts, but be 
              mindful.<br> <br> All disasters are caused by mistaken thought. Mistaken thoughts cause 
              disasters
              when you are careless. Not only will there be attacks from the outside, 
              but from
              the inside too. The attacks from the inside are the afflictive emotions.
              Supporting the practice of recognizing the nature of mind is relative 
              bodhicitta,
              Of all emotions, anger is the worst. It will destroy yourself and 
              others. So you
              have to be careful. The result of anger is obvious in the recent 
              attacks. There
              will be endless destruction if you engage in anger. If you attack one, 
              they will
              attack two, and so forth. So you should be mindful of the result of 
              anger. Think
              that if anger arises again it is like committing suicide.<br> <br> The members who come here are very fortunate to have this center. You 
              have
              a wonderful teacher and you should learn from him. He [<a href="http://www.drikung.org/bio2.html">Khenchen
              Konchog Gyaltsen</a>] has been practicing from childhood. I am like 
              nothing. I
              am just myself. So you should feel happy about that. The spiritual 
              teacher is
              very important, like your eyes or heart. You should respect them like 
              your own
              eyes."<br> <br> ~ courtesy Bernie Simon who was there in Fredericksville, Maryland.</p>

              <h1>The 3 Excellent Teachings by Choeze Kuchen Rinpoche</h1>
              <p>First Excellence - Pure Motivation and Great Conviction<br> <br> Pure motivation and great conviction are very 
              important regardless
                                      of whether the activity performed is great or 
              negligible. Pure
                                      motivation is what results in great merit.<br> <br> Impure motivation is having jealousy, greed, 
              desire of benefitting
                                      oneself or one's family and other negative and 
              selfish thoughts
                                      before performing the deed. Pure motivation is 
              doing the virtuous
                                      deed without any prior negative and selfish 
              thoughts.<br> <br> How do we generate pure motivation? There are 3 
              ways, 1st is that
                                      of the shepherd, 2nd is that of the boatman and 
              3rd is that of the
                                      king.<br> <br> 1. The shepherd lets the herd go in front and 
              will count all the
                                      animals in the herd to ensure none of the 
              animals are missing. The
                                      motivation like that of the shepherd is to lead 
              all sentient beings
                                      to enlightenment before one attains 
              enlightenment.<br> 2. The boatman ensures all the travellers in his
               boat reach safely
                                      to the other shore together with him. The 
              motivation like that of
                                      the boatman is to attain enlightenment together 
              with all sentient
                                      beings at the same time.<br> 3. The king cultivates himself and takes 
              measures to put himself in
                                      a position to lead his country before actually 
              doing something for
                                      his country to make the country strong and make 
              his citizens
                                      contented. The motivation like that of the king 
              is to become
                                      enlightened first before leading others towards
                                      enlightenment.<br> <br> The best motivation is that of the shepherd. 
              Some may think, "If I
                                      lead others, then what about myself?" That is an
               unnecessary worry.
                                      If you have already lead others towards 
              enlightenment, it is
                                      impossible that you alone would stay in samsara 
              by yourself. Why we
                                      remain in samsara is due to our selfishness. 
              Buddhas and
                                      Bodhisattvas always do things for others and do 
              not care for
                                      themselves. Actually, if you have the motivation
               of the shepherd,
                                      you would probably gain enlightenment much 
              faster than if you had
                                      the other two motivations.<br> <br> As a vajrayana practitioner, we should have the 
              motivation of a
                                      shepherd. Before we perform any deeds, we should
               consider if our
                                      motivaion is pure or impure. At that instant, if
               you find that your
                                      motivation is impure, you should change it to be
               a pure one. You
                                      must constantly perform the checking yourself. 
              It is easy to check
                                      our mind as it belongs to us and nobody else. 
              The real practice is
                                      to check our mind frequently.<br> <br> Pure motivation is very important especially to 
              those who are in a
                                      profession where they directly help others, such
               as doctors and
                                      teachers. They must have pure motivation in 
              order to help much more
                                      people effectively and efficiently. Take for 
              example 2 doctors, one
                                      who has good qualifications but not genuinely 
              concerned about
                                      helping others and one who does not have good 
              qualifications but
                                      has the pure motivation to benefit others. When 
              trying to cure
                                      patients, the patients of the doctor with the 
              pure motivation would
                                      be the ones who see better results as the doctor
               would put in much
                                      more effort in curing and caring for the 
              patient. With pure
                                      motivation, one will benefit more people better 
              and at a faster
                                      speed. This is especially true for teachers and 
              doctors who are in
                                      a profession where they can help many directly.<br> <br> If you have impure motivation, on the outside 
              the deed you perform
                                      may look good, but the result will be negative 
              as the deed is
                                      unvirtuous due to impure motivation. If you 
              light just one small
                                      lamp with pure motivation, the merit would last 
              much longer than
                                      performing a great deed with impure motivation. 
              The best motivation
                                      to have is that of the shepherd man.<br> <br> Pure motivation can be applied to whatever 
              activity you perform,
                                      regardless if it is related to Dharma. Slowly we
               start this
                                      practice and with experience, the pure 
              motivation would come
                                      easily. We have to change our bad habits which 
              are due to
                                      ignorance. Through countless lifetimes, we have 
              accumulated much
                                      negative karma, we must have the patience to 
              slowly change
                                      ourselves. It will not be easy, but with time, 
              we can make the
                                      change.<br> <br> For lay people, especially businessmen, it is 
              very difficult to
                                      have pure motivation when working. They feel 
              that they have to tell
                                      lies or their business will not be so good. But 
              you can still try
                                      to do business with a good motivation. How to do
               so? For example,
                                      before starting on a deal, think that whatever 
              profit I get, I will
                                      donate 40% to charity and for the rest, I will 
              keep for myself and
                                      my family. If you do this, then it is ok. It may
               even make your
                                      business more successful as you had kind 
              intentions before starting
                                      out on the deals. Even if you can't give 40%, 
              even 5% is good, as
                                      long as you have thought of benefitting others, 
              and not just only
                                      yourself.<br> <br> We have to try to think for others, not just 
              ourselves. If you
                                      think for others, you will become very relaxed 
              in your mind. If you
                                      only think for yourself, gradually you will 
              develop stress and feel
                                      more pressure. So try to think of benefitting 
              others. Even though
                                      you can't benefit masses, if there is just only 
              one person in front
                                      of you who needs help and you have given 
              assistance with pure
                                      motivation, it would make you happy and your 
              mind relaxed.<br> <br> Wealth, good facilities, infrastructure and 
              material goods, these
                                      give us good health and comfort, but not true 
              permanent happiness.
                                      That is why you can observe that there are rich 
              people who are very
                                      stressed. Poor people may have to live in 
              discomfort, but they may
                                      not be unhappy if they are contented and do not 
              harbor selfish
                                      thoughts. Material wealth may cause one more 
              suffering due to the
                                      grasping and attachment one has for it.<br> <br> Past Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and great masters 
              took refuge in the
                                      Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, they did not take 
              refuge in material
                                      wealth! Material wealth only gives you temporary
               happiness. We all
                                      need material wealth to survive, but we should 
              not put in extra
                                      effort just to gain material wealth. Take for 
              example a diamond
                                      ring, we wipe it and make it shiny, we carry it 
              around with us,
                                      tell it that we love it very much and show it 
              off proudly to
                                      others, but the diamond ring cannot reciprocate 
              our love or do
                                      anything for us, it may even make us feel 
              uncomfortable having to
                                      wear it on our finger. So it only makes us look 
              stupid that we
                                      spend so much time and attention on an object 
              that cannot love or
                                      care. That is what attachment does to us.<br> <br> Motivation is important, like when parents 
              discipline their
                                      children, from the outside, it looks bad, but 
              actually the parents
                                      only want the best for their children. Their 
              motivation is pure. We
                                      should not only focus on appearances, it is the 
              motivation that
                                      counts. There is a story, a few centuries ago, 
              about the Jowo
                                      statue in Tibet which is very precious. A king 
              during Buddha's time
                                      requested that the statue be made and invited a 
              statue maker from
                                      the deva realms. The statue was invited from 
              India to China and
                                      then to Tibet. In Tibet there is a saying that 
              if you do not visit
                                      the Jowo statue, then your life has been a 
              waste. People put in
                                      great effort to go and visit the Jowo statue. 
              There was a man from
                                      the southern side of Tibet who was 
              simple-minded. He saw the shrine
                                      and thought that the offerings were food for 
              Jowo. He thought that
                                      the lamp was lit up to ensure that the butter 
              did not harden in the
                                      cold weather. As he was hungry, he took the 
              torma (food offering)
                                      and dipped it into the butter and ate it. When 
              he looked at Jowo's
                                      face, it was still smiling and he thought that 
              Jowo was so nice as
                                      he was happy to share his food. He then told 
              Jowo that he will now
                                      circumambulate him and put his shoes in front of
               Jowo and asked
                                      Jowo to help take care of them. When the 
              caretaker of the temple
                                      came, he was very upset as he saw that the 
              shrine was ruined and
                                      someone has disrespectfully put his shoes in 
              front of the Buddha
                                      statue. He wanted to throw the shoes out, but 
              the Jowo statue spoke
                                      and said, "Do not throw them away. Gonpo Ben has
               asked me to take
                                      care of them, it is my duty to do so." When 
              Gonpo Ben has finished
                                      his circumambulation, he thanked the Jowo statue
               and invited Jowo
                                      to his home. Jowo accepted the invitation. Gonpo
               Ben then went home
                                      to tell his wife that Jowo would be visiting 
              them. One day when his
                                      wife went to the river to get water, she saw 
              that the Jowo statue
                                      was inside the river. She ran back to tell Ben 
              who went to the
                                      river and dived in to fetch the statue. He 
              actually managed to get
                                      the statue out. When he reached a stone on the 
              road however, Jowo
                                      told him that he cannot enter a lay person's 
              house and disappeared
                                      inside the rock. Ben had very pure motivation 
              and therefore managed
                                      to see, talk to and even touch a real Buddha. 
              Even though his
                                      actions appeared disrespectful, it did not 
              matter as he had pure
                                      motivation.<br> <br> 2nd Excellence - The Perfect Way to Practice<br> <br> All types of Buddhist practice are included 
              within the Vajrayana
                                      way of practice, the creation and completion 
              stages. The generation
                                      stage practice is to do visualization. We 
              visualize our body as a
                                      form of wisdom body or that of a deity. We also 
              visualize
                                      Samantabhadra's form of offerings to Buddhas and
               Bodhisattvas of
                                      the 10 directions. If visualization is done with
               concentration, it
                                      brings the same benefit as doing Shamatha 
              (stabilization/
                                      concentration) meditation. It is very important 
              to visualize
                                      one-pointedly in the generation stage. For the 
              beginner, it is very
                                      very difficult, one needs time to gain 
              experience. We must practice
                                      more often. An obstacle is having an active mind
               during
                                      visualization, thinking about other things. This
               is an evil during
                                      visualization. We must have a stable mind during
               visualization and
                                      meditation, we should not think of the past or 
              future, but remain
                                      in the present. During meditation you should not
               feel heavy in the
                                      mind like when we are sleeping but feel very 
              light. There is a
                                      method to go to this state of mind. Many 
              practitioners practice for
                                      a long time without getting a sign of successful
               practice. Some of
                                      them then think that there is a problem with the
               practice or that
                                      there is a problem with their guru. But actually
               the problem is
                                      with themselves! If one has wandering thoughts 
              during
                                      visualization, one will not obtain any results 
              as one is not
                                      practising correctly and in the proper way.<br> <br> During visualization and meditation, worldly and
               conceptual
                                      thoughts that come are the real evil. They are 
              the biggest
                                      obstacle. We have to put in effort to resolve 
              this problem. We
                                      cannot forcefully stop the thoughts from coming 
              as it would make
                                      the situation worse. More thoughts would come, 
              and if you get
                                      angry, that is very bad. When thoughts come, 
              just do not follow
                                      them, release the thoughts naturally. Come to 
              the natural state of
                                      your mind. Do not think of the past or future, 
              stay in the present.
                                      Conceptual thoughts will then be released 
              naturally. We have to try
                                      this everyday, at times of trouble etc., try to 
              release the tension
                                      in our minds through this method. With 
              attachment, our mind becomes
                                      heavy. Be light in your mind without any 
              attachment. We cannot
                                      possibly stop our mind from thinking, simply do 
              not follow thoughts
                                      and just release. If we do this more often, it 
              will help us during
                                      the introduction to the true nature of 
              phenomena. When there is
                                      strong anger, hatred, desire or ignorance, 
              practise this method to
                                      release your mind from negativity and conceptual
               thoughts. When
                                      meditating, open your eyes and look at any 
              object in front of you,
                                      but do not grasp onto the object. Have no 
              conceptions. There is
                                      only this one method and there are no other 
              ways.<br> <br> Through this practice, one will obtain long 
              life. Breathing will
                                      slow down and become relaxed. Your life will go 
              at a slower speed.
                                      This is different from when one is angry, the 
              breath is fast and
                                      labored. Breathing will be long and smooth 
              during practice and this
                                      will cause your life to become long. This 
              practice can be done
                                      anywhere. Most imporantly, release all thoughts 
              and be without
                                      conceptions when yo visualize or meditate. This 
              will be the prefect
                                      way to practice.<br> <br> In a lifetime, we must recognize the true nature
               of our mind after
                                      receiving instructions from a great master. 
              There are a lot of
                                      conditions which must be met before we can do 
              this. The 4
                                      foundations (Ngondro) is important as a 
              precursor to all
                                      practices.<br> <br> 3rd Excellence - Perfect Dedication<br> <br> After practising, we accumulate merit and we 
              should dedicate this
                                      merit. This teaching explains how to do perfect 
              dedication. Without
                                      dedication, even if you have accumulated merits 
              for thousands of
                                      aeons, all of the merits may be destroyed by a 
              single negative
                                      thought. Merit is like a drop of water. If you 
              put it on a dry
                                      ground, it will evaporate in a short period of 
              time. If you do
                                      dedication, it will be like putting the drop of 
              water in an ocean,
                                      the drop of water will last as long as the ocean
               is still around.
                                      Only if we dedicate merit, can the merit last. 
              So dedication is
                                      very important. How should we do dedication? We 
              should dedicate all
                                      the past, present and future merits of 
              ourselves, all sentient
                                      beings, all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as well
               as the source of
                                      all good deeds, our Buddha nature. This is the 
              special method of
                                      Kyobpa Jigten Sumgon, the founder of the Drikung
               Kagyud lineage.
                                      Why should we dedicate future merit? We may 
              forget to dedicate
                                      merits in future when we have done good deeds, 
              so we dedicate merit
                                      now for those circumstances. Dedicating future 
              merits will also
                                      make it easier for us to accumulate merit in the
               future.<br> <br> Primordial merit is the merit of our natural 
              self or our Buddha
                                      nature. Our original mind or self is kind and 
              pure in nature. There
                                      are many people who are without religion but are
               naturally
                                      compassionate and kind. Why? Because their 
              nature itself is good
                                      and kind. Even for animals, you can see how good
               they are to their
                                      children, they also possess compassion. We 
              survive in this world
                                      through compassion, kindness and care given by 
              our mother. We can
                                      see that the real nature of sentient beings is 
              compassion. This
                                      strong and powerful compassion, is the seed of 
              all merits. We
                                      should dedicate this.<br> <br> For any deeds that we perform, whether it is 
              Dharma-related or not,
                                      we need these 3 excellences. Pure motivation, 
              perfect way to
                                      practice and perfect dedication. It applies to 
              every practice and
                                      is very much essential and necessary.</p>

              <h1>The 37 Practices of a Bodhisattva by Togme Zongpo</h1>
              <p>Namo Lokesvaraya<br> <br> You who see that experience has no coming or 
              going,<br> Yet pour your energy solely into helping beings,<br> My excellent teachers and Lord All Seeing,<br> I humbly and constantly honor with my body, 
              speech, and mind.<br> <br> The fully awake, the buddhas, source of joy and 
              well-being,<br> All come from integrating the noble Way.<br> Because integration depends on your knowing how 
              to practice,<br> I will explain the practice of all bodhisattvas.<br> <br> Right now, you have a good boat, fully equipped 
              and available hard
                                      to find.<br> To free others and you from the sea of samsara,<br> Day and night, fully alert and present,<br> Study, reflect, and meditate this is the 
              practice of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> Attraction to those close to you catches you in 
              its currents;<br> Aversion to those who oppose you burns inside;<br> Indifference that ignores what needs to be done 
              is a black
                                      hole.<br> Leave your homeland this is the practice of a 
              bodhisattva.<br> <br> Don't engage disturbances and reactive emotions 
              gradually fade
                                      away;<br> Don't engage distractions and spiritual practice
               naturally
                                      grows;<br> Keep awareness clear and vivid and confidence in
               the way
                                      arises.<br> Rely on silence this is the practice of a 
              bodhisattva.<br> <br> You will separate from long-time friends and 
              relatives;<br> You will leave behind the wealth you worked to 
              build up;<br> The guest, your consciousness, will move from 
              the inn, your
                                      body.<br> Forget the conventional concerns this is the 
              practice of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> With some friends, the three poisons keep 
              growing,<br> Study, reflection, and meditation weaken,<br> And loving kindness and compassion fall away.<br> Give up bad friends this is the practice of a 
              bodhisattva.<br> <br> With some teachers, your shortcomings fade away 
              and<br> Abilities grow like the waxing moon.<br> Hold such teachers dear to you,<br> Dearer than your own body this is the practice 
              of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> Locked up in the prison of their own patterning<br> Whom can ordinary gods protect?<br> Who can you count on for refuge?<br> Go for refuge in the Three Jewels this is the 
              practice of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> The suffering in the lower realms is really hard
               to endure.<br> The Sage says it is the result of destructive 
              actions.<br> For that reason, even if your life is at risk,<br> Don't engage in destructive actions this is the 
              practice of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> The happiness of the three worlds disappears in a
               moment,<br> Like a dewdrop on a blade of grass.<br> The highest level of freedom is one that never 
              changes.<br> Aim for this this is the practice of a 
              bodhisattva.<br> <br> For time without beginning, mothers have 
              lovingly cared for
                                      you.<br> If they are still suffering, how can you be 
              happy?<br> To free limitless sentient beings,<br> Give rise to awakening mind this is the practice
               of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> All suffering comes from wanting your own 
              happiness.<br> Complete awakening arises from the intention to 
              help others.<br> So, exchange completely your happiness<br> For the suffering of others this is the practice
               of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> Even if someone, driven by desperate want,<br> Steals, or makes someone else steal, everything 
              you own,<br> Dedicate to him your body, your wealth, and<br> All the good you've ever done or will do this is
               the practice of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> Even if you have done nothing wrong at all<br> And someone still tries to take your head off,<br> Spurred by compassion,<br> Take all his or her evil into you this is the 
              practice of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> Even if someone broadcasts to the whole universe<br> Slanderous and ugly rumors about you,<br> In return, with an open and caring heart,<br> Praise his or her abilities this is the practice
               of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> Even if someone humiliates you and denounces you<br> In front of a crowd of people,<br> Think of this person as your teacher<br> And humbly honor him this is the practice of a 
              bodhisattva.<br> <br> Even if a person you have cared for as your own 
              child<br> Treats you as his or her worst enemy,<br> Lavish him or her with loving attention<br> Like a mother caring for her ill child this is 
              the practice of a
                                      bodhisattva.<br> <br> Even if your peers or subordinates,<br> Put you down to make themselves look better,<br> Treat them respectfully as you would your 
              teacher:<br> Put them above you this is the practice of a

              hard to make remedies
                                      work.<br> A person in attention wields remedies like

              efforts<br> To awakening -- this is the practice of a

              commentaries,<br> I set out these thirty-seven practices of a 
              bodhisattva<br> For those who intend to train in this path.<br> <br> Because I have limited intelligence and little 
              education,<br> These verses are not the kind of poetry that 
              delights the
                                      learned.<br> But because I relied on the teachings of the 
              sutras and the
                                      revered<br> I am confident that The Practices of a 
              Bodhisattva is sound.<br> <br> However, because it's hard for a person with 
              limited intelligence
                                      like me<br> To fathom the depths of the great waves of the 
              activity of
                                      bodhisattvas,<br> I ask the revered to tolerate<br> Any mistakes contradictions, non sequiturs, and 
              such.<br> <br> From the goodness of this work, may all beings,<br> Through the supreme mind that is awake to what 
              is ultimately and
                                      apparently true,<br> Not rest in any limiting position existence or 
              peace:<br> May they be like Lord All Seeing.<br> <br> Tog-me, the monk, a teacher of scripture and 
              logic, composed this
                                      text in a cave<br> near the town of Ngülchu Rinchen for his own and
               others'
