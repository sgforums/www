              <h1>Transform Suffering &amp; Happiness,Dodrupchen JikméTenpeNyima</h1>
              <p>Homage<br> <br> I pay homage to Noble Avalokiteshvara, recalling
               his
                                      qualities:<br> Forever joyful at the happiness of others,<br> And plunged into sorrow whenever they suffer,<br> You have fully realized Great Compassion, with 
              all its
                                      qualities,<br> And abide, without a care for your own happiness
               or suffering<br> <br> Statement of Intent<br> <br> I am going to put down here a partial 
              instruction on how to use
                                      both happiness and suffering as the path to 
              enlightenment. This is
                                      indispensable for leading a spiritual life, a 
              most needed tool of
                                      the Noble Ones, and quite the most priceless 
              teaching in the
                                      world.<br> <br> There are two parts:<br> <br> —how to use suffering as the path,<br> —and how to use happiness as the path.<br> <br> Each one is approached firstly through relative 
              truth, and then
                                      through absolute truth.<br> <br> How to Use Suffering as the Path to 
              Enlightenment<br> <br> i. Through Relative Truth<br> <br> Whenever we are harmed by sentient beings or 
              anything else, if we
                                      make a habit out of perceiving only the 
              suffering, then when even
                                      the smallest problem comes up, it will cause 
              enormous anguish in
                                      our mind.<br> <br> This is because the nature of any perception or 
              idea, be it
                                      happiness or sorrow, is to grow stronger and 
              stronger the more we
                                      become accustomed to it. So as the strength of 
              this pattern
                                      gradually builds up, before long we’ll find that
               just about
                                      everything we perceive becomes a cause for 
              actually attracting
                                      unhappiness towards us, and happiness will never
               get a
                                      chance.<br> <br> If we do not realize that it all depends on the 
              way in which mind
                                      develops this habit, and instead we put the 
              blame on external
                                      objects and situations alone, the flames of 
              suffering, negative
                                      karma, aggression and so on will spread like 
              wildfire, without end.
                                      This is what is called: “all appearances arising
               as enemies.”<br> <br> We should arrive at a very precise understanding
               that the whole
                                      reason why sentient beings in this degenerate 
              age are plagued by so
                                      much suffering is because they have such feeble 
              powers of
                                      discernment.<br> <br> So not to be hurt by the obstacles created by 
              enemies, illness or
                                      harmful influences, does not mean to say that 
              things like sickness
                                      can be driven away, and that they will never 
              occur again. Rather,
                                      it simply means that they will not be able to 
              obstruct us from
                                      practising on the path.<br> <br> In order for this to happen, we need: first, to 
              get rid of the
                                      attitude of being entirely unwilling to face any
               suffering
                                      ourselves and, second, to cultivate the attitude
               of actually being
                                      joyful when suffering arises.<br> <br> Dropping the Attitude of Being Entirely 
              Unwilling to Suffer<br> <br> Think about all the depression, anxiety and 
              irritation we put
                                      ourselves through by always seeing suffering as 
              unfavourable,
                                      something to be avoided at all costs. Now, think
               about two things:
                                      how useless this is, and how much trouble it 
              causes. Go on
                                      reflecting on this repeatedly, until you are 
              absolutely
                                      convinced.<br> <br> Then say to yourself: “From now on, whatever I 
              have to suffer, I
                                      will never become anxious or irritated.” Go over
               this again and
                                      again in your mind, and summon all your courage 
              and
                                      determination.<br> <br> First, let’s look at how useless it is. If we 
              can do something to
                                      solve a problem, then there is no need to worry 
              or be unhappy about
                                      it; if we can’t, then it doesn’t help to worry 
              or be unhappy about
                                      it either.<br> <br> Then, the enormous trouble involved. As long as 
              we don’t get
                                      anxious and irritated, then our strength of mind
               will enable us to
                                      bear even the hardest of sufferings easily; 
              they’ll feel as flimsy
                                      and insubstantial as cotton wool. But while we 
              are dominated by
                                      anxiety, even the tiniest problem becomes 
              extremely difficult to
                                      cope with, because we have the additional burden
               of mental
                                      discomfort and unhappiness.<br> <br> Imagine, for example, trying to get rid of 
              desire and attachment
                                      for someone we find attractive while continuing 
              to dwell all the
                                      while on their attractive qualities. It would 
              all be in vain. In
                                      just the same way, if we concentrate only on the
               pain brought by
                                      suffering, we’ll never be able to develop 
              endurance or the ability
                                      to bear it. So, as in the instructions called 
              ‘Sealing the Doors of
                                      the Senses’, don’t latch onto all kinds of 
              mind-made concepts about
                                      your suffering. Learn instead to leave the mind 
              undisturbed in its
                                      own natural state, bring the mind home, rest 
              there, and let it find
                                      its own ground.<br> <br> Cultivating the Attitude of Being Joyful when 
              Suffering
                                      Arises<br> <br> Seeing suffering as an ally to help us on the 
              path, we must learn
                                      to develop a sense of joy when it arises. Yet 
              whenever suffering
                                      strikes, unless we have some kind of spiritual 
              practice to bring to
                                      it, one which matches the capacity of our mind, 
              no matter how many
                                      times we might say to ourselves: ‘Well, as long 
              as I’ve got roughly
                                      the right method, I’ll be able to use suffering 
              and obtain such and
                                      such a benefit’, it’s highly unlikely that we’ll
               succeed. We’ll be
                                      as far from our goal, the saying goes, as the 
              earth is from the
                                      sky.<br> <br> Therefore, use suffering as the basis for the 
              following
                                      practices:<br> <br> a. Using Suffering to Train in Renunciation<br> <br> Sometimes, then, use your suffering in order to 
              train your mind in
                                      renunciation.<br> <br> Say to yourself: “As long as I wander, powerless
               and without any
                                      freedom, in samsara, this kind of suffering is 
              not something unjust
                                      or unwarranted. It’s simply the very nature of 
              samsara.” At times,
                                      develop a deep sense of revulsion by thinking; 
              “If it’s already so
                                      hard for me to bear even the little suffering 
              and pain of the happy
                                      realms, then what about the suffering of the 
              lower realms? Samsara
                                      is indeed an ocean of suffering, fathomless and 
              without any end!”
                                      Then turn your mind towards liberation, and 
              enlightenment.<br> <br> b. Using Suffering to Train in Taking Refuge<br> <br> Say to yourself: “Life after life, again and 
              again we are
                                      continuously plagued by these kind of fears, and
               the one and only
                                      protection that can never fail us is the 
              precious guide, the
                                      Buddha, the precious path, the Dharma, and the 
              precious companions
                                      on the way, the Sangha: the Three Jewels. So it 
              is on them that I
                                      must rely, entirely. Whatever happens, I will 
              never renounce them.”
                                      Let this become a firm conviction, and train in 
              the practice of
                                      taking refuge.<br> <br> c. Using Suffering to Overcome Arrogance<br> <br> As I explained before, as long as we are in 
              samsara we are never
                                      independent or truly free or in control of our 
              lives. On the
                                      contrary, we are always dependent on and at the 
              mercy of suffering.
                                      So we must eliminate ‘the enemy that destroys 
              anything that is
                                      wholesome and good’, which is arrogance and 
              pride; and we must do
                                      away with the evil attitude of belittling others
               and considering
                                      them as inferior.<br> <br> d. Using Suffering to Purify Harmful Actions<br> <br> Remind yourself and realize: “All this suffering
               which I’m going
                                      through, and suffering which is greater still 
              all the boundless
                                      suffering that there is come from nothing but 
              harmful, negative
                                      actions.”<br> <br> Reflect, carefully and thoroughly, how:<br> karma is certain—cause and effect is infallible;<br> karma multiplies enormously;<br> you will never face the effects of something you
               have not
                                      done;<br> whatever you have done will never go to waste.<br> <br> Then say to yourself: “So, if I really don’t 
              want to suffer any
                                      more, then I must give up the cause of 
              suffering, which is
                                      negativity.” With the help of ‘The Four Powers’,
               make an effort to
                                      acknowledge and purify all the negative actions 
              you have
                                      accumulated in the past, and then firmly resolve
               to avoid doing
                                      them in the future.<br> <br> e. Using Suffering to Find Joy in Positive 
              Action<br> <br> Say to yourself: “If I really want to find 
              happiness, which is the
                                      opposite of suffering, then I have got to make 
              an effort to
                                      practise its cause, which is positive action.” 
              Think about this in
                                      detail, and from every angle, and dwell on the 
              implications. Then
                                      in every way possible, do whatever you can to 
              make your positive,
                                      beneficial actions increase.<br> <br> f. Using Suffering to Train in Compassion<br> <br> Say to yourself: “Just like me, others too are 
              tormented by similar
                                      suffering, or even much worse...” Train yourself
               by thinking: “If
                                      only they could be free from all this suffering!
               How wonderful it
                                      would be!” This will also help you to understand
               how to practise
                                      loving kindness, where the focus of the practice
               is those who have
                                      no happiness.<br> <br> g. Using Suffering to Cherish Others More Than 
              Yourself<br> <br> Train yourself to think: “The very reason why I 
              am not free from
                                      suffering such as this is that from time 
              immemorial I have cared
                                      only about myself. Now, from this moment 
              onwards, I will only
                                      cherish others, as this is the source of all 
              happiness and
                                      good.”<br> <br> It is extremely difficult to use suffering as 
              the path when it has
                                      already struck, and is staring us in the face. 
              That is why it is
                                      crucial to become familiar in advance with the 
              specific practices
                                      to be used when misfortune and difficulties 
              befall us. It is also
                                      particularly helpful, and will really count, if 
              we use the practice
                                      we know best, and of which we have a clear, 
              personal
                                      experience.<br> <br> With this, suffering and difficulties can become
               a help for our
                                      spiritual practice but that alone is not enough.
               We need to gain a
                                      sense of real joy and enthusiasm, inspired by a 
              thorough
                                      appreciation for our achievement, and then to 
              reinforce this, and
                                      make it stable and continuous.<br> <br> <br> So, with each of the practices outlined above, 
              say to yourself:
                                      “This suffering has been of tremendous 
              assistance; it will help me
                                      to achieve the many wonderful kinds of happiness
               and bliss which
                                      are experienced in the higher realms and in 
              liberation from samsara
                                      and which are extremely difficult to find. From 
              now on too, I know
                                      that whatever suffering lies in store for me 
              will have the same
                                      effect. So however tough, however difficult the 
              suffering may be,
                                      it will always bring me the greatest joy and 
              happiness, bitter and
                                      yet sweet, like those Indian cakes made of sugar
               mixed with
                                      cardamom and pepper.” Follow this line of 
              thought over and over,
                                      and very thoroughly, and get used to the happy 
              state of mind that
                                      it brings. By reflecting like this, our minds 
              will be so suffused
                                      with happiness that the suffering we feel 
              through the senses will
                                      become almost imperceptible and incapable of 
              disturbing our minds.
                                      This is the point at which sickness can be 
              overcome through
                                      forebearance. It’s worth noting that this is 
              also an indication as
                                      to whether difficulties brought about by 
              enemies, harmful spirits
                                      and so on can be overcome.<br> <br> As we have already seen, reversing the attitude 
              of not wanting to
                                      suffer is the whole basis for transforming 
              suffering into our
                                      spiritual path. This is because we simply won’t 
              be able to turn
                                      suffering into the path as long as anxiety and 
              irritation continue
                                      to eat away at our confidence and disturb our 
              mind.<br> <br> The more we arrive at actually transforming 
              suffering into the
                                      path, the more we will enhance and reinforce all
               our previous
                                      practice. This is because our courage and good 
              humour will grow all
                                      the more, once we can see from our own 
              experience how suffering
                                      causes our spiritual practice and qualities to 
              blossom.<br> <br> It is said that by training gradually with 
              smaller sufferings,
                                      ‘step by step, in easy stages’, then in the end 
              we’ll be able to
                                      handle big suffering and difficulties too. We 
              must go about it like
                                      this, because it is extremely difficult to have 
              an experience of
                                      something which is beyond our level or capacity.<br> <br> In the breaks between sessions, pray to the Lama
               and the Three
                                      Jewels that you may be able to take suffering 
              onto your path. When
                                      your mind has grown a little bit stronger, then 
              make offerings to
                                      the Three Jewels and to negative forces and 
              insist: “Please send me
                                      misfortune and obstacles, so I can work on 
              developing the strength
                                      of my practice!” At the same time, always, 
              always stay confident,
                                      cheerful and happy.<br> <br> When you first begin this training, it is vital 
              to distance
                                      yourself from ordinary social activities. 
              Otherwise, caught up in
                                      everyday preoccupations and busyness, you will 
              be influenced by all
                                      your misguided friends, asking questions like: 
              “How can you bear to
                                      put up with so much suffering...so much 
              humiliation...?”<br> <br> Besides, the endless worrying about enemies, 
              relatives and
                                      possessions will cloud our awareness, and upset 
              our minds beyond
                                      all our control, so that we inevitably go 
              astray, sliding into bad
                                      habits. Then, on top of this, we’ll be swept 
              away by all kinds of
                                      distracting objects and situations.<br> <br> But in the solitude of a retreat environment, 
              since none of these
                                      are present, your awareness is very lucid and 
              clear, and so it’s
                                      easy to make the mind do whatever you want it to
               do.<br> <br> It is for this very reason that when 
              practitioners of Chöd train in
                                      ‘trampling right on top of suffering’, at the 
              beginning they put
                                      off doing the practice using the harm caused by 
              human beings and
                                      amidst distraction, but instead make a point of 
              working with the
                                      apparitions of gods and demons in cemeteries and
               other desolate and
                                      powerful places.<br> <br> To sum up: Not only so that your mind will not 
              be affected by
                                      misfortune and suffering, but also to be able to
               draw happiness and
                                      peace of mind out of these things themselves, 
              what we need to do is
                                      this: Do not see inner problems like illness, or
               outer troubles
                                      like rivals, spirits or scandalous gossip, as 
              something undesirable
                                      and unpleasant, but instead simply get used to 
              seeing them as
                                      something pleasing and delightful.<br> <br> <br> To accomplish this, we need to stop looking at 
              harmful
                                      circumstances as problems and make every effort 
              to view them as
                                      beneficial. After all, whether a thing is 
              pleasant or unpleasant
                                      comes down to how it is perceived by the mind.<br> <br> Take an example: someone who continually dwells 
              on the futility of
                                      ordinary, mundane preoccupations will only get 
              more and more fed up
                                      as their wealth or circle increase. On the other
               hand, someone who
                                      sees worldly affairs as meaningful and 
              beneficial will seek, and
                                      even pray, to increase their power and 
              influence.<br> <br> With this kind of training then:<br> <br> —our mind and character will become more 
              peaceful and more
                                      gentle;<br> —we will become more open and more flexible;<br> —we will be easier to get along with;<br> —we will be courageous and confident;<br> —we will be freed from obstacles that hinder our
               Dharma
                                      practice;<br> —we will be able to turn any negative 
              circumstances to our
                                      advantage, meet with success, and bring glory 
              and
                                      auspiciousness;<br> —and our mind will always be content, in the 
              happiness born of
                                      inner peace.<br> <br> <br> To follow a spiritual path in this degenerate 
              age, we cannot be
                                      without armour of this kind. Because if we’re no
               longer tormented
                                      by the suffering of anxiety and irritation, not 
              only will other
                                      kinds of suffering fade away, like soldiers 
              who’ve lost their
                                      weapons, but even misfortunes like illness will,
               as a rule, vanish
                                      on their own.<br> <br> The saints of the past used to say:<br> <br> “If you are not unhappy or discontented about 
              anything, then your
                                      mind will not be disturbed. Since your mind is 
              not disturbed, the
                                      subtle wind energy (Tib. lung) will not be 
              disturbed. That means
                                      the other elements of the body will not be 
              disturbed either. As a
                                      result, your mind will not be disturbed, and so 
              it goes on, as the
                                      wheel of constant happiness turns.”<br> <br> Also:<br> <br> Horses and donkeys with sores on their backs<br> Are an easy prey for scavenging birds.<br> People who are prone to fear,<br> Are easy victims to negative spirits.<br> But not those whose character is stable and 
              strong.<br> <br> Thus it is that the wise, seeing that all 
              happiness and suffering
                                      depend upon the mind, will seek their happiness 
              and well-being
                                      within the mind. Since all the causes of 
              happiness are entirely
                                      within themselves, they will not be dependent on
               anything external,
                                      which means that nothing whatsoever, be it 
              sentient beings or
                                      anything else, can do them any harm. And even 
              when they die, this
                                      attitude will follow, so that they will always, 
              always be free and
                                      in control.<br> <br> This is just how the bodhisattvas attain their 
              meditative
                                      stabilization samadhi called ‘overwhelming over 
              all phenomena with
                                      bliss.’<br> <br> However, foolish people chase after external 
              objects and
                                      circumstances in the hope of finding happiness. 
              But whatever
                                      happiness they do find, great or small, it 
              always turns out like
                                      the saying:<br> <br> You’re not in control; it’s all in others’ 
              hands.<br> <br> As if your hair were caught up in a tree.<br> <br> What you’d hoped for never comes to be; things 
              never come together;
                                      or else you make misjudgments, and there is only
               one failure after
                                      another. Enemies and thieves have no trouble 
              harming you, and even
                                      the slightest false accusation will separate you
               from your
                                      happiness. However much a crow looks after a 
              baby cuckoo, it can
                                      never turn it into a baby crow. In the same way,
               if all your
                                      efforts are misguided and based on something 
              unreliable, they will
                                      bring nothing but fatigue for the gods, negative
               emotions for the
                                      spirits, and suffering for yourself.<br> <br> This ‘heart advice’ brings a hundred different 
              essential
                                      instructions together, into one crucial point. 
              There are many other
                                      pith instructions on accepting suffering and 
              hardships in order to
                                      practise the path, and on transforming illness 
              and destructive
                                      forces into the path, as taught for example in 
              the ‘Pacifying’
                                      tradition. But here, in a way that’s easy to 
              understand, I have
                                      given a general outline of how to accept 
              suffering, based on the
                                      writings of the Noble Shantideva, and his wise 
              and learned
                                      followers.<br> <br> ii. Through Absolute Truth<br> <br> By means of reasoning, such as ‘the refutation 
              of production from
                                      the four extremes,’[6] the mind is drawn towards
               emptiness, the
                                      natural condition of things, a supreme state of 
              peace, and there it
                                      rests. In this state, let alone harmful 
              circumstances or suffering,
                                      not even their names can be found.<br> <br> Even when you come out of this state, it’s not 
              like before, when
                                      suffering arose in your mind and you would react
               with dread and
                                      lack of confidence. Now you can overcome it by 
              viewing it as unreal
                                      and nothing but a label.<br> <br> I have not gone into detail here.<br> <br> 2. How To Use Happiness as the Path to 
              Enlightenment<br> <br> i. Through Relative Truth<br> <br> Whenever happiness and the various things that 
              cause happiness
                                      appear, if we slip under their power, then we 
              will grow
                                      increasingly conceited, smug and lazy, which 
              will block our
                                      spiritual path and progress.<br> <br> In fact it’s difficult not to be carried away by
               happiness, as
                                      Padampa Sangye pointed out:<br> <br> We human beings can cope with a lot of 
              suffering,<br> But very little happiness.<br> That’s why we need to open our eyes, in whatever
               ways we can, to
                                      the fact that happiness and the things that 
              cause happiness are all
                                      actually impermanent, and are by nature 
              suffering.<br> So try as best you can to arouse a deep sense of
               disillusionment,
                                      and to stop your mind indulging in its usual 
              apathy and negligence.
                                      Say to yourself:<br> <br> “Look: all the happiness and material wealth of 
              this world is
                                      trifling and insignificant, and brings with it 
              all kinds of
                                      problems and difficulties. Still, in a certain 
              sense, it does have
                                      its good side. Buddha said that someone whose 
              freedom is impaired
                                      by suffering will have great difficulty 
              attaining enlightenment,
                                      but for someone who is happy, it is easier to 
              attain.<br> <br> “What good fortune then to be able to practise 
              the Dharma in a
                                      state of happiness like this! So, from now on, 
              in whatever way I
                                      can, I must convert this happiness into Dharma, 
              and then from the
                                      Dharma, happiness and well-being will 
              continuously arise. That’s
                                      how I can train in making Dharma and happiness 
              support one another.
                                      Otherwise, I’ll always end up where I started 
              like trying to boil
                                      water in a wooden saucepan.”<br> <br> The main point to get here is that whatever 
              happiness, whatever
                                      well-being, comes our way, we must unite it with
               Dharma practice.
                                      This is the whole vision behind Nagarjuna’s 
              Garland of
                                      Jewels.<br> <br> Even though we may be happy, if we don’t 
              recognize it, we will
                                      never be able to make use of that happiness as 
              an opportunity for
                                      practising the Dharma. Instead we’ll be forever 
              hoping that some
                                      extra happiness will come our way, and we’ll 
              waste our lives on
                                      countless projects and actions. The antidote to 
              this is to apply
                                      the practice wherever it is appropriate, and, 
              above all, to savour
                                      the nectar of contentment.<br> <br> There are other ways of turning happiness into 
              the path, especially
                                      those based on recalling the kindness of the 
              Buddha, Dharma and
                                      Sangha, and on the instructions for training in 
              bodhichitta, but
                                      this will do for now. As with using suffering as
               the path, so with
                                      happiness too, you need to go to a solitary 
              retreat environment and
                                      combine this with practices of purification and 
              accumulating merit
                                      and wisdom.<br> <br> ii. The Absolute Dimension<br> <br> This is the same as for turning suffering into 
              the path.<br> <br> What this Training Brings<br> <br> If we cannot practise when we’re suffering 
              because of all the
                                      anxiety we go through, and we cannot practise 
              when we’re happy
                                      because of our attachment to happiness, then 
              that rules out any
                                      chance of our practising Dharma at all. That is 
              why there is
                                      nothing more crucial for a practitioner than 
              this training in
                                      turning happiness and suffering into the path.<br> <br> And if you do have this training, no matter 
              where you live, in a
                                      solitary place or in the middle of a city; 
              whatever the people
                                      around you are like, good or bad; whether you’re
               rich or poor,
                                      happy or distressed; whatever you have to listen
               to, praise or
                                      condemnation, good words or bad; you’ll never 
              feel the slightest
                                      fear that it could bring you down in any way. No
               wonder this
                                      training is called the ‘Lion-Like Yoga’.<br> <br> Whatever you do, your mind will be happy, 
              peaceful, spacious and
                                      relaxed. Your whole attitude will be pure, and 
              everything will turn
                                      out excellently. Your body might be living in 
              this impure world of
                                      ours, but your mind will experience the 
              splendour of an
                                      unimaginable bliss, like the bodhisattvas in 
              their pure
                                      realms.<br> <br> It’ll be just as the precious Kadampa masters 
              used to say:<br> Keep happiness under control;<br> Put an end to suffering.<br> With happiness under control<br> And suffering brought to an end:<br> When you’re all alone,<br> This training will be your true friend;<br> When you are sick,<br> It will be your nurse.<br> <br> Goldsmiths first remove the impurities from gold
               by melting it in
                                      fire, and then make it malleable by rinsing it 
              over and over again
                                      in water. It is just the same with the mind. If 
              by using happiness
                                      as the path, you become weary and disgusted with
               it, and by taking
                                      suffering as the path, you make your mind clear 
              and cheerful, then
                                      you will easily attain the extraordinary samadhi
               which makes mind
                                      and body capable of doing anything you wish.<br> <br> This instruction, I feel, is the most profound 
              of all, for it
                                      perfects discipline, the source of everything 
              positive and
                                      wholesome. This is because not being attached to
               happiness creates
                                      the basis of the extraordinary discipline of 
              renunciation, and not
                                      being afraid of suffering makes this discipline 
              completely
                                      pure.<br> <br> As they say:<br> <br> Generosity forms the basis for discipline;<br> And patience is what purifies it.<br> By training in this practice now, then when you 
              attain the higher
                                      stages of the path, this is what it will be 
              like:<br> You will realize that all phenomena are like an 
              illusion, and<br> To be born again is just like walking into a 
              lovely garden.<br> Whether you face prosperity or ruin,<br> You’ll have no fear of negative emotions or 
              suffering.<br> <br> Here are some illustrations from the life of the
               Buddha. Before he
                                      attained enlightenment, he abandoned the kingdom
               of a universal
                                      monarch as if it were straw and lived by the 
              river Narainjana
                                      without a care for the harshness of the 
              austerities he was
                                      practising. What he showed was that in order to 
              accomplish our own
                                      ultimate benefit, the nectar of realization, we 
              must have mastered
                                      the one taste of happiness and suffering.<br> <br> <br> <br> Then after he attained enlightenment, the chiefs
               of humans and
                                      gods, as far as the highest realms, showed him 
              the greatest
                                      reverence, placing his feet on the crown of 
              their heads, and
                                      offering to serve and honour him with all manner
               of delights.
                                      However, a brahmin called Bharadvaja abused him 
              and criticized him
                                      a hundred times; the impudent daughter of 
              another brahmin accused
                                      him of sexual misconduct; he lived off rotten 
              horse fodder for
                                      three months in the land of King Agnidatta, and 
              so on. But he
                                      remained without the slightest fluctuation in 
              his mind, neither
                                      elated nor downcast, like Mount Meru unshaken by
               the wind. He
                                      showed that in order to accomplish the benefit 
              of sentient beings,
                                      again we have to have mastered that equal taste 
              of happiness and
                                      suffering.<br> <br> Afterword<br> <br> A teaching like this should really be taught by 
              the Kadampa
                                      masters, whose very lives enacted their saying:<br> <br> “No complaints when there’s suffering,<br> Great renunciation when there’s happiness.”<br> <br> But if it’s someone like me who explains it, 
              then I’m sure that
                                      even my own tongue is going to get fed up and 
              cringe with
                                      embarrassment. Still, with the sole aim of 
              making one taste of all
                                      the worldly preoccupations my second nature, I, 
              the old beggar

              <h1>4 Dharmas of Gampopa,commentary by Dorje Chang Kalu Rinpoche</h1>
              <p>Our precious human birth affords opportunity and leisure for
                                      Dharma practice and gives us access to the vast 
              and profound
                                      tradition of the teachings of the Buddhadharma. 
              Among these, the
                                      Four Dharmas of Gampopa provide a concise survey
               of the entire
                                      Path, divided into four levels.<br> <br> The First Dharma: The Mind Turns Towards Dharma<br> <br> This first teaching involves a thorough 
              understanding of our
                                      situation in samsara and the different destinies
               within the cycle,
                                      the six states of rebirth: three lower ones —the
               hell realms, the
                                      hungry ghost realm, and the animal realm; and 
              three higher —the
                                      human, asura, and god realms. Through this 
              teaching, we learn the
                                      consequences of virtuous and unvirtuous actions,
               which tendencies
                                      lead to these various rebirths, and the 
              sufferings which the beings
                                      in these realms undergo. We come to understand 
              that although a
                                      particular karmic process may lead from higher 
              to lower or lower to
                                      higher rebirths, samsara itself provides no 
              means of escape, and if
                                      we rely on it, we can make no progress towards 
              Enlightenment. At
                                      the beginning of the Path, this understanding of
               samsara is
                                      necessary to turn the mind towards the Dharma, 
              and to do this we
                                      contemplate the Four Ordinary Preliminaries.<br> <br> The first of these concerns the unique value of 
              the human life we
                                      are now experiencing. Because of the blessing of
               the Three Jewels
                                      and their influence in previous lives, we have, 
              at some point,
                                      developed a virtuous tendency that has brought 
              about our present
                                      human birth, with all its opportunities, leisure
               and freedom to
                                      practice Dharma. Very few beings preserve this 
              virtuous tendency
                                      (by avoiding negative actions, thoughts, and 
              speech and encouraging
                                      positive ones), and very few achieve the 
              resultant state of a
                                      precious human birth. If we think of the stars 
              in the night sky as
                                      representing the multitude of beings in samsara,
               then a star in
                                      daytime represents the precious human birth —it 
              is something
                                      possible, but most unlikely. Human birth is an 
              extremely rare
                                      occurrence.<br> <br> The second of the Four Preliminaries concerns 
              impermanence. Now
                                      that we have the precious opportunity of human 
              birth we should make
                                      the best use of it and actually realize the full
               potential of being
                                      human. This can be accomplished through our 
              efforts to transcend
                                      completely the cycle of rebirth and achieve 
              Buddhahood. In addition
                                      we must understand that mortality and 
              impermanence are part of our
                                      existence, and that our human birth, obtained 
              with such difficulty,
                                      will pass away. In everything we experience, 
              there is
                                      moment-by-moment change and instability. Like a 
              candle flame blown
                                      by a strong wind, our human existence may be 
              extinguished at any
                                      moment; like a bubble on the surface of water, 
              it may suddenly
                                      burst; like morning dew on the grass, it soon 
              evaporates.<br> <br> Next, to realize the full potential of being 
              human, we must examine
                                      the concept of karma, the process of cause and 
              effect, especially
                                      the relationship between our actions and their 
              results. We need to
                                      recognize fully the unfailing connection between
               what we do now and
                                      what we experience later.<br> <br> The fourth contemplation that turns the mind 
              towards Dharma deals
                                      with the unsatisfactory and painful nature of 
              samsara. Without an
                                      appreciation of impermanence and our own 
              impending death, we are
                                      likely to be distracted by the pleasures of the 
              world and indulge
                                      ourselves in emotional conflict and confusion. 
              When that happens,
                                      we become exhausted by the life we lead and do 
              not get to what
                                      really matters. We neither really see what is 
              actually happening in
                                      our lives, nor make good use of our situation.<br> <br> Before we know it, our life is finished and it 
              is time to die. If
                                      we lack the foundation of a stable practice, we 
              go to death
                                      helplessly, in fear and anguish.<br> <br> By contemplating these preliminaries—the 
              potential of a precious
                                      human existence, impermanence and the 
              inevitability of death, the
                                      karmic process of cause and effect, and the 
              sufferings and
                                      limitations of samsara—we turn our minds to the 
              Dharma, and thus
                                      fulfill the first of the Four Teachings, or 
              Dharmas, of
                                      Gampopa.<br> <br> The Second Dharma: The Dharma Becomes The Path<br> <br> Once involved in the teachings, we come to the 
              second of the Four
                                      Dharmas: the teachings of the Dharma become our 
              way of life, our
                                      path. Our attitude towards what is superior to 
              us —the Three
                                      Jewels— begins to change, and so does our 
              attitude towards the
                                      beings in samsara who are equal or inferior to 
              us. The first
                                      attitude is expressed when we take Refuge, with 
              faith, devotion and
                                      respect, in the Buddha, the Dharma and the 
              Sangha. We realize that
                                      in Buddhahood one is omniscient and omnipresent,
               endowed with
                                      infinite capabilities. We see that the teachings
               of the Dharma,
                                      which proceed from this enlightened state, are 
              the Path that every
                                      being can follow to Enlightenment. We recognize 
              that the Sangha, or
                                      assembly of practitioners who realize and 
              transmit the teachings,
                                      are companions or guides who can show us the 
              Path. In the Vajrayana
                                      tradition, we add the Three Roots —Lama, Yidam 
              and Dharma
                                      Protector— to the Three Jewels as sources of 
              Refuge (for a tantric
                                      practitioner).<br> <br> When the Dharma becomes our Path, we develop a 
              second attitude,
                                      that of compassion. In contemplating the beings 
              who are in samsara
                                      with us, we consider that space is infinite, 
              pervading all
                                      directions, and that the realm of sentient 
              beings extends as far as
                                      space itself. At some point in the past, every 
              one of these
                                      numberless beings has been our mother or our 
              father. Through
                                      innumerable cycles of lifetimes we have 
              developed an extremely
                                      close karmic connection with each one of them. 
              When compassion
                                      develops we see that all life is the same, and 
              that every single
                                      being wishes to be happy: in every form of life a
               fundamental
                                      search for happiness goes on—but in a way that 
              contradicts and
                                      defeats the aim of this search. Few beings 
              understand that real
                                      happiness is the result of virtuous conduct. 
              Many are involved in
                                      actually destroying their chances for happiness 
              through confused
                                      and harmful actions and thoughts.<br> <br> When we see this we develop real affection and 
              compassion for other
                                      beings. This infinite compassion for all forms 
              of life is the
                                      second at- titude involved in making the 
              teaching our Path. Through
                                      faith and compassion the teaching that has 
              attracted us becomes an
                                      entire way of life.<br> <br> The Development of Compassion<br> <br> Although we realize the necessity of working not
               only for our own
                                      benefit but for the welfare of all beings, we 
              need to be honest
                                      about our own limitations and recognize that we 
              have little power
                                      or ability to be truly effective in helping 
              beings to free
                                      themselves. The way we become effective in this 
              is through
                                      achieving Buddhahood or, at least, by reaching 
              some level of
                                      Bodhisattva realization. At these higher levels 
              we gain the ability
                                      to manifest for the sake of guiding beings out 
              of their
                                      confusion.<br> <br> The attitude of altruism is called Relative 
              Bodhicitta; the desire
                                      to develop it is the foundation of Mahayana 
              practice and the vessel
                                      for all virtue.<br> <br> One method for developing Bodhicitta is called 
              Tong len, which
                                      literally means "sending and taking." The 
              attitude here is that
                                      each of us is only one being, while the number 
              of beings in the
                                      universe is infinite. Would it not be a worthy 
              goal if this one
                                      being could take on all the pain of every other 
              being in the
                                      universe and free each and every one of them 
              from suffering? We
                                      therefore resolve to take on ourselves all this 
              suffering, to take
                                      it away from all other beings, even their 
              incipient or potential
                                      suffering, and all of its causes. At the same 
              time we develop the
                                      attitude of sending all our virtue, happiness, 
              health, wealth and
                                      potential for long life to other beings. 
              Anything that we enjoy,
                                      anything noble or worthy, positive or happy in 
              our situation we
                                      send selflessly to every other being. Thus the 
              meditation is one of
                                      willingly taking on all that is negative 
              tendency to cling to what
                                      we want for ourselves and to ignore others.<br> <br> We develop a deep empathy with everything that 
              lives. The method of
                                      sending and taking is a most effective way of 
              developing the
                                      Bodhisattva's motivation.<br> <br> The kind of compassion we have described so far 
              is called
                                      "compassion with reference to sentient beings." A
               dualism lingers
                                      here, however, because we are still caught by 
              the threefold idea of
                                      (1) ourselves experiencing the compassion, (2) 
              other beings as the
                                      objects of compassion, and (3) the actual act of
               feeling compassion
                                      through understanding or perceiving the 
              suffering of others.<br> <br> This framework prepares our path in the 
              Mahayana. Once this kind of
                                      compassion has been established, we arrive at a 
              second
                                      understanding: The realization begins to grow 
              that the self which
                                      is feeling the compassion, the objects of the 
              compassion, and the
                                      compassion itself are all in a certain sense 
              illusory. We see that
                                      these three aspects belong to a conventional, 
              not ultimate,
                                      reality. They are nothing in themselves, but 
              simply illusions that
                                      create the appearance of a dualistic framework. 
              Perceiving these
                                      illusions and thereby understanding the true 
              emptiness of all
                                      phenomena and experience is what we call 
              "compassion with reference
                                      to all phenomena." This is the main path of 
              Mahayana
                                      practice.<br> <br> From this second kind of compassion a third 
              develops,
                                      "non-referential compassion." Here we entirely 
              transcend any
                                      concern with subject/object reference. It is the
               ultimate
                                      experience that results in Buddhahood. All these
               three levels of
                                      compassion are connected, so if we begin with 
              the basic level by
                                      developing loving-kindness and compassion 
              towards all 1iving
                                      beings, we lay a foundation which guarantees 
              that our path will
                                      lead directly to Enlightenment.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> The Third Dharma: The Path Dispels Confusion<br> <br> The third Dharma of Gampopa states that by 
              traveling the Path our
                                      confusion is dispelled. The principal theme of 
              the teaching here is
                                      the experience of emptiness —the realization of 
              the ultimate nature
                                      of mind. In meditation we realize that our mind 
              and all the
                                      experiences which it projects are fundamentally 
              unreal: they exist
                                      conventionally, but not in an ultimate sense. 
              This Realization of
                                      Emptiness is known as Ultimate Bodhicitta.<br> <br> An analogy can be drawn between the ocean and 
              the mind, which is
                                      essentially empty, without limiting 
              characteristics or ultimate
                                      reality. This empty mind, however, has its 
              projection, which is the
                                      whole phenomenal world. The form, sound, taste, 
              touch, smell, and
                                      inner thoughts, which constitute what we 
              experience correspond to
                                      waves on the surface of the ocean. Once we see, 
              through meditation,
                                      that the nature of mind is fundamentally empty, 
              we become
                                      automatically aware that the projections of mind
               are fundamentally
                                      empty too. These projections are like waves that
               arise from and
                                      subside into the ocean: at no point are they 
              ever separate from
                                      it.<br> <br> Although we may have some understanding that 
              mind is essentially
                                      empty, it may be difficult to relate this idea 
              to phenomenal
                                      existence. An example may help. At the present 
              moment we have a
                                      physical body, and during our waking existence 
              we are extremely
                                      attached to it. We take it to be real, a 
              self-existent entity. But
                                      during dreams, we inhabit a different kind of 
              body, and experience
                                      a different state of being. A complete 
              phenomenal existence is
                                      associated with this "dream body." We see, 
              smell, touch, hear,
                                      feel, think and communicate—we experience a 
              complete universe. But
                                      when we awaken it becomes obvious that the 
              universe of the dream
                                      has no ultimate reality. It certainly is not in 
              the outer world as
                                      we know it, nor in the room where we sleep, nor 
              inside our body; it
                                      cannot be found anywhere. When the dream is 
              over, its 'reality'
                                      simply disappears—it was only a projection of 
              mind. It is fairly
                                      easy to understand this in relation to the dream
               state. What we
                                      must also comprehend is that our experience in 
              the waking state is
                                      of the same general nature and occurs through 
              the same
                                      process.<br> <br> Realized Mahasiddhas, such as Tilopa and Naropa 
              of India, or Marpa
                                      and Milarepa of Tibet, were able to perform 
              miraculous changes in
                                      the phenomenal universe. They could do so 
              because they had realized
                                      the entire phenomenal world as essentially empty
               and a projection
                                      of mind. This allowed them to manifest miracles 
              and actually change
                                      the phenomenal world. Such transformation is not
               possible when our
                                      mind clings to what we experience as ultimately 
              real and
                                      immutable.<br> <br> The present phase of our existence ends in 
              death, when the karma
                                      which directs the course of this physical 
              existence is
                                      exhausted.<br> <br> At death there is a definite and final 
              separation of consciousness
                                      from the physical body, which is simply 
              discarded. What continues
                                      is the individual consciousness, the mind of the
               being entering
                                      into the bardo experience. During that 
              after-death state, we
                                      experience another kind of phenomenal universe. 
              Though lacking the
                                      basis of a physical organism, the mind is able 
              to see, hear, smell,
                                      taste, touch, think, and perceive in much the 
              same way as it does
                                      now. Though there is nothing more than a state 
              of consciousness,
                                      the mind continues to follow its habits and to 
              manifest in set
                                      patterns. Thus our habitual conviction that 
              experience is
                                      ultimately real continues after physical death, 
              and what happens
                                      there resembles what happens in the dream state 
              and waking
                                      consciousness.<br> <br> A story about a monk in Tibet illustrates this. 
              It happened not
                                      very long ago, in fact, during the lifetime of 
              my father. Near my
                                      home in Tibet there is a Nyingmapa monastery 
              called Dzogchen. A
                                      monk from this monastery decided that he did not
               want to stay there
                                      any more, but preferred to go into business. He 
              left and went to
                                      the north of that region to become a trader, 
              hoping to accumulate a
                                      fortune. He actually did become fairly 
              successful. Because of his
                                      former relationship with a monastery, he was 
              also considered
                                      something of a Dharma teacher, so he had a group
               of followers as
                                      well as the wealth amassed through his trading 
              ventures.<br> <br> One day he met a magician who was able to 
              exercise a certain mental
                                      control over people. The trader didn't realize 
              the power of this
                                      person, and the magician cast a spell that 
              caused the trader to
                                      experience a children: he acquired a large 
              estate and family to
                                      look after, and passed his whole life this way 
              and became old with
                                      white hair and few teeth. Then the illusion 
              disappeared: he was
                                      back where he had been, and perhaps only one or 
              two days had
                                      passed. During that time the magician had stolen
               everything he
                                      possessed, and the trader woke without a penny 
              in the world. He had
                                      only the memory of his long fantasy of a 
              lifetime's activities,
                                      distractions and projects.<br> <br> Just like the trader's fantasy, our own daily 
              experiences have an
                                      illusory quality. In the Mahayana sutras, it is 
              taught that
                                      everything the moon shining on the water's 
              surface: everything we
                                      experience has only conventional reality and is 
              ultimately
                                      unreal.<br> <br> We experience the third Dharma of Gampopa when, 
              first, we become
                                      convinced that we must dispel our confusion 
              through understanding
                                      and experiencing the essential emptiness of 
              mind, and, second, when
                                      this reveals the illusory nature of all 
              phenomena; then the Path
                                      dispels confusion.<br> <br> The Fourth Dharma: Confusion Arises as 
              Primordial Awareness<br> <br> The fourth Dharma of Gampopa is the 
              transformation of confusion
                                      into Primordial Awareness. This fundamental 
              transformation is
                                      effected on the level of Anuttarayogatantra, the
               highest of the
                                      four levels of Vajrayana teachings.<br> <br> This transformation is not difficult to explain 
              theoretically. In
                                      an ordinary state awareness is clouded and 
              confused; if we
                                      recognize the mind's nature, then we experience 
              Primordial
                                      Awareness. On a practical level, however, this 
              does not happen
                                      automatically: a certain kind of skillful means 
              is needed. To
                                      transform discursive into enlightened awareness,
               we use the wealth
                                      of techniques available in the Vajrayana, 
              especially the
                                      Development and Fulfillment stages of 
              meditation.<br> <br> In our present situation as unenlightened 
              beings, our three
                                      faculties of body, speech, and mind are obscured
               by basic
                                      ignorance. To transform that confusion into 
              awareness, we must
                                      become physically, verbally, and mentally aware,
               so in Vajrayana
                                      practice we utilize these very faculties of our 
              whole being to
                                      effect a complete transformation.<br> <br> Considering our physical body, we can see how we
               are attached to it
                                      as something permanent, pure and real. Yet this 
              physical body is
                                      temporary, composed of numerous impure and 
              decaying substances. It
                                      is conventionally, not ultimately, real.<br> <br> Our habitual and instinctive clinging to it 
              obstructs the arising
                                      of Primordial Awareness. We must come to realize
               that this body is
                                      simply something that appears and that it has no
               self-nature. Based
                                      on the projections of the mind, the body 
              represents the heart of
                                      the form aspect of consciousness. Until we 
              realize this, the
                                      transformation of confusion into Primordial 
              Awareness will not
                                      happen spontaneously In tantric practice, the 
              body is transformed
                                      by a meditation that leads us to identify with a
               pure or
                                      enlightened form, for example, Chenrezi, the 
              Bodhisattva of
                                      Compassion. Here we put aside the fixation on 
              our own body and
                                      instead identify with a pure form.<br> <br> In doing so, it is important also to realize 
              that the deity is pure
                                      appearance, and does not partake of 
              substantiality in any way. In
                                      meditation we become completely identified with 
              this form, which is
                                      empty, without solidity, without self-nature or 
              ultimate reality
                                      beyond its pure appearance. This experience is 
              called "The Union of
                                      Appearance and Emptiness."<br> <br> Such a transformation is based upon 
              understanding that all our
                                      experience is a subjective projection of mind, 
              and therefore our
                                      attitude towards things is decisive. Through 
              changing our attitude
                                      we change our experience, and when we meditate 
              in the way
                                      described, transformation is possible. This is 
              especially true when
                                      we focus on an enlightened form such as the 
              Bodhisattva of
                                      Compassion. The image of Chenrezi itself is a 
              real expression of
                                      the state of enlightened compassion. It is not a
               fabrication. There
                                      is actually an enlightened being called 
              Chenrezi, able to confer
                                      blessing and attainment. To experience this, 
              certain conditions
                                      must come together. An analogy would be taking a
               photograph of
                                      someone.<br> <br> We put film in the camera, we point it at 
              whomever we're
                                      photographing and take the picture; the image of
               the person is
                                      projected onto the film, and when it's 
              developed, we have a certain
                                      image of that person. Something similar happens 
              when we meditate on
                                      an enlightened form. There is an "external" 
              expression called
                                      Chenrezi. Through our efforts in meditation, we 
              come to identify
                                      with this pure form, to have faith in it, and to
               realize the
                                      intrinsic compassion and state of awareness 
              Chenrezi represents. In
                                      this way we can become a "copy" of the deity and
               receive the
                                      blessing of the Bodhisattva of Compassion. This 
              is the first aspect
                                      of the transformation of confusion into 
              Primordial Awareness based
                                      on meditation upon our body as an enlightened 
              form.<br> <br> The second aspect of transformation concerns our
               speech. Although
                                      it may be easy to consider speech as intangible,
               that it simply
                                      appears and disappears, we actually relate to it
               as to something
                                      real. It is because we become so attached to 
              what we say and hear
                                      that speech has such power. Mere words, which 
              have no ultimate
                                      reality, can determine our happiness and 
              suffering. We create
                                      pleasure and pain through our fundamental 
              clinging to sound and
                                      speech.<br> <br> In the Vajrayana context, we recite and meditate
               on mantra, which
                                      is enlightened sound, the speech of the deity, 
              the Union of Sound
                                      and Emptiness. It has no intrinsic reality, but 
              is simply the
                                      manifestation of pure sound, experienced 
              simultaneously with its
                                      Emptiness. Through mantra, we no longer cling to
               the reality of the
                                      speech and sound encountered in life, but 
              experience it as
                                      essentially empty. Then confusion of the speech 
              aspect of our being
                                      is transformed into enlightened awareness.<br> <br> At first, the Union of Sound and Emptiness is 
              simply an
                                      intellectual concept of what our meditation 
              should be. Through
                                      continued application, it becomes our actual 
              experience. Here, as
                                      elsewhere in the practice, attitude is 
              all-important, as this story
                                      about a teacher in Tibet illustrates. The 
              teacher had two
                                      disciples, who both undertook to perform a 
              hundred million
                                      recitations of the mantra of Chenrezi, OM MANI 
              PADME HUNG. In the
                                      presence of their Lama, they took a vow to do 
              so, and went off to
                                      complete the practice.<br> <br> One of the disciples was very diligent, though 
              his realization was
                                      perhaps not so profound. He set out to 
              accomplish the practice as
                                      quickly as possible and recited the mantra 
              incessantly, day and
                                      night. After long efforts, he completed his one 
              hundred million
                                      recitations, in three years. The other disciple 
              was extremely
                                      intelligent, but perhaps not as diligent, 
              because he certainly did
                                      not launch into the practice with the same 
              enthusiasm. But when his
                                      friend was approaching the completion of his 
              retreat, the second
                                      disciple, who still had not recited very many 
              mantras, went up on
                                      the top of a hill. He sat down there, and began 
              to meditate that
                                      all beings throughout the universe were 
              transformed into Chenrezi.
                                      He meditated that the sound of the mantra was 
              not only issuing from
                                      the mouth of each and every being, but that 
              every atom in the
                                      universe was vibrating with it, and for a few 
              days he recited the
                                      mantra in this state of samadhi.<br> <br> When the two disciples went to their Lama to 
              indicate they they'd
                                      finished the practice, he said, "Oh, you've both
               done excellently.
                                      You were very diligent, and you were very wise. 
              You both
                                      accomplished the one hundred million recitations
               of the
                                      mantra."<br> <br> Thus through changing our attitude and 
              developing our
                                      understanding, practice becomes far more 
              powerful.<br> <br> The six syllable mantra of Chenrezi, OM MANI 
              PADME HUNG, is an
                                      expression of Chenrezi's blessing and 
              enlightened power. The six
                                      syllables are associated with different aspects 
              of our experience:
                                      six basic emotional afflictions in the mind are 
              being transformed,
                                      six aspects of Primordial Awareness are being 
              realized. These sets
                                      of six belong to the mandala of the six 
              different Buddha families
                                      which become manifest in the enlightened mind. 
              The mantra of
                                      Chenrezi has power to effect transformations on 
              all these
                                      levels.<br> <br> Another way of interpreting the mantra is that 
              the syllable OM is
                                      the essence of enlightened form; MANI PADME, the
               four syllables in
                                      the middle, represent the speech of 
              Enlightenment; and the last
                                      syllable HUNG represents the mind of 
              Enlightenment. The body,
                                      speech, and mind of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas
               are inherent in
                                      the sound of this mantra. It purifies the 
              obscurations of body,
                                      speech, and mind, and brings all beings to the 
              state of
                                      Realization. When it is joined with our own 
              faith and efforts in
                                      meditation and recitation, the transformative 
              power of the mantra
                                      arises and develops. It is truly possible to 
              purify ourselves in
                                      this way.<br> <br> The mind aspect of the Chenrezi meditation 
              centers in the heart
                                      region where the mantra and seed-syllable HRIH 
              are located. Light
                                      is visualized as going out from these and making
               offerings to all
                                      the Buddhas, purifying the obscurations of all 
              beings, and
                                      establishing them in Enlightenment. The mind 
              aspect is also
                                      connected with formless meditation, simply 
              resting the mind in its
                                      own empty nature. After practicing this for some
               time, a change
                                      will occur: we will have the experience that 
              anything arising in
                                      the mind, any emotion or thought, arises from 
              and dissolves back
                                      into Emptiness. For that duration we are nowhere
               other than in
                                      Emptiness. In this state, we experience mind as 
              the Union of
                                      Awareness and Emptiness. This is Mahamudra.<br> <br> The threefold Chenrezi meditation thus utilizes 
              meditation
                                      techniques relating to body, speech, and mind. 
              At the end of a
                                      session of practice, the visualization dissolves
               into a formless
                                      state, and we simply rest the mind evenly in its
               own nature. At
                                      this time we can experience body, speech, and 
              mind as arising from
                                      basic, emptymind. We recognize this mind as the 
              fundamental aspect
                                      and body and speech to be secondary projections 
              based upon
                                      consciousness. This represents the gathering of 
              all aspects of our
                                      experience into this, we have realized the 
              fourth Dharma of
                                      Gampopa: confusion has arisen as primordial 
              awareness.</p>

              <h1>Machig Labdron :Chod destroys  fundamental attachment</h1>
              <p>Recognizing the body as the root of one's attachment to self,
                                      Machig Labdron formulated Chod to be a practice 
              that would destroy
                                      this fundamental attachment and simultaneously 
              develop compassion
                                      for all beings. The main part of a Chod practice
               can be outlined as
                                      follows:<br> <br> 1. Transfer one's consciousness into space and 
              identify it with the
                                      black Vajra Yogini.<br> 2. Through visualization, identify the body with
               the universe and
                                      then offer it completely to all beings who would
               want them,
                                      especially one's creditors, enemies, and evil 
              beings.<br> <br> To handle worldly or spiritual problems there 
              are many types of
                                      approaches. Some try to dissolve the problems, 
              some plan to escape
                                      from the problems, some attempt to stay at a 
              safe distance and
                                      tackle through theoretical discussions, and some
               would face the
                                      problems and work on them. When one is not ready
               to handle the
                                      problems, the first three types of approaches 
              are temporarily
                                      appropriate; nevertheless, the ultimate test of a
               solution lies
                                      with the head-on approach.<br> <br> Chod is obviously a head-on approach to the 
              spiritual problem of
                                      subconscious attachment. It also exemplifies the
               ultimate wisdom of
                                      facing the reality to realize its conditional 
              nature instead of
                                      being satisfied with merely conceptual 
              understanding. Chod is
                                      learning through enacting. One's attachment to 
              the body, fear of
                                      its destruction, greed for its well-being, and 
              displeasure for its
                                      suffering are all put to test in a Chod 
              practice. When all these
                                      subconscious mental entanglements are brought to
               light through the
                                      visualization of dismemberment, one is really 
              fighting with one's
                                      self. No one who cannot pass the test of such 
              visualizations would
                                      have a chance of achieving liberation under 
              real-life
                                      circumstances.<br> <br> Advanced Chodpas, practitioners of Chod do not 
              satisfy themselves
                                      with just the ritual practices. They often stay 
              in cemeteries,
                                      desolate places, and haunted houses in order to 
              face the fearful
                                      situations and experience the interference from 
              desperate or evil
                                      spirits. By developing compassion for all 
              beings, including those
                                      trying to scare or harm them, by sharpening 
              wisdom through
                                      realizing the non-substantial nature of fearful 
              phenomena and fear
                                      itself, and by deepening meditation stability 
              through tolerating
                                      fearful situations, Chodpas gradually achieve 
              transcendence over
                                      attachments, fear, greed, and anger. Through the
               hardship of direct
                                      confrontation they advance, step by step, on the
               path toward
                                      Enlightenment.<br> <br> The separation of the consciousness from the 
              body indicates the
                                      mistake of identifying with the body. It is the 
              aboard of this
                                      life; both this life and its aboard are 
              transient and cannot be
                                      grasped for good. The identification of the 
              consciousness with the
                                      black Vajra Yogini signifies the recognition of 
              the wisdom of
                                      non-self. On one hand, the black Vajra Yogini is
               a manifestation of
                                      the primordial wisdom of non-self; and on the 
              other hand, due to
                                      the non-self nature of both the consciousness 
              and the Yogini, they
                                      may be identified. Furthermore, the 
              identification with the black
                                      Vajra Yogini, as it is the case in all tantric 
              identification with
                                      a Yidam, is not grasping to a certain image but 
              involves salvation
                                      activities. In other words, it is a dynamic 
              approach to personality
                                      changes.<br> <br> On the surface Chod seems to be an offering of 
              only the body.
                                      Nevertheless, during the visualization the body 
              has been identified
                                      with the universe, and consequently the offering
               means the offering
                                      of all things desirable. Thus, Chod is not just 
              aiming at reduction
                                      of attachment to the body but also of all 
              attachments. In terms of
                                      the traditional tantric classification of four 
              levels, Chod could
                                      be characterized as a practice which frees one: 
              outwardly from
                                      attachments to the body; inwardly, to sensual 
              objects; secretly, to
                                      all desires and enjoyments; and most secretly, 
              to
                                      self-centeredness. A Chodpa would gradually 
              experience the
                                      transforming effects of Chod practices and 
              become aware of its ever
                                      deeper penetration into the subtle and elusive 
              core of one's
                                      attachments.<br> <br> 2. The Essential Ingredients of Chod<br> <br> Chod as a tantric practice consists of the 
              following essential
                                      ingredients:<br> <br> A. The Blessing of the Lineage<br> <br> In Tantric Buddhism lineage, meaning an unbroken
               line of proper
                                      transmissions of the teachings, is essential to 
              practice and
                                      realization. This is because what is transmitted
               is not just the
                                      words but something spiritual and special. 
              Through proper
                                      transmissions the blessings of all the 
              generations of teachers are
                                      bestowed on the disciples. Without such 
              blessings no one can even
                                      enter the invisible gate of Tantra. Tantric 
              practices without the
                                      blessing of lineage may be likened to 
              automobiles out of gas.<br> <br> In Tantric Buddhism lineage is always emphasized
               and the teachers
                                      are revered as the root of blessings. In 
              Sutra-yanas the importance
                                      of lineage is often overlooked by scholars who 
              lack interest in
                                      practice and ordinary Buddhist followers. This 
              is probably the main
                                      reason why in Tantric Buddhism blessings can 
              often be directly
                                      sensed by practitioners while in Sutra-yanas 
              such experiences are
                                      less frequently encountered.<br> <br> All tantric practices derive their special 
              effectiveness from the
                                      blessing that is transmitted through the 
              lineage. In the case of
                                      Chod, the blessing from Machig Labdron is the 
              source of such
                                      blessings. All other teachers that form the 
              various lineages of
                                      Chod are also indispensable to the continuation 
              of these lineages;
                                      without their accomplishments and devoted 
              services to the Dharma,
                                      the teachings would not be still available 
              today. Therefore, we
                                      should remember their grace and always hold them
               in
                                      reverence.<br> <br> To a practitioner who is fortunate enough to 
              have received the
                                      blessings of a lineage, the meaning of lineage 
              becomes his
                                      devotion, with all his heart and soul, to carry 
              on, to preserve and
                                      transmit the teachings for all generations (of 
              disciples, the real
                                      beneficiaries,) to come.<br> <br> B. The Wisdom of Recognition and Transformation<br> <br> Self-clinging is the fundamental hindrance to 
              Enlightenment and the
                                      fundamental cause of transmigration in samsara. 
              Although it is the
                                      main obstacle for a Buddhist practitioner to 
              eradicate, its subtle
                                      nature and elusive ways are beyond easy 
              comprehension. Even the
                                      very attempt to attack or reduce self-clinging 
              might very well be
                                      indeed an expression of egocentrism, if the 
              motive is limited to
                                      self-interest. Facing the dilemma of an 
              invisible enemy who is
                                      possibly lurking behind one's every move, it 
              amounts to an almost
                                      impossible task! Thanks to the wisdom insight of
               Machig Labdron,
                                      the root of self-clinging has been singled out 
              to be the body. Once
                                      this is made clear, and the body being a 
              concrete object, the
                                      remaining task is much simpler, though not 
              easier.<br> <br> According to the wisdom insight of Machig 
              Labdron, the real demons
                                      are everything that hinders the attainment of 
              liberation. Keeping
                                      this wisdom insight in mind, on one hand, all 
              judgments based on
                                      personal preferences and interests should be 
              given up, and on the
                                      other hand, all obstacles and adversaries could 
              be transformed by
                                      one's efforts into helping hands on the path 
              toward liberation. For
                                      example, a gain could be a hindrance to 
              liberation if one is
                                      attached to it, while an injury could be a help 
              to liberation if
                                      one uses it to practice tolerance, forgiveness 
              and
                                      compassion.<br> <br> Applying this wisdom insight to the root of 
              self-clinging, the
                                      body, Machig Labdron formulated the 
              visualization of Chod, and
                                      thereby transformed the root of hindrance into 
              the tool for
                                      attaining compassion and liberation.<br> <br> C. Impermanence and Complete Renunciation<br> <br> The body is the very foundation of our physical 
              existence. Even
                                      after it has been recognized to be the root of 
              self-clinging, it is
                                      still very difficult to see how to treat it to 
              bring about
                                      spiritual transcendence and liberation. 
              Destroying the body would
                                      certainly end the possibility of further 
              spiritual advancement in
                                      this life but not necessarily the self-clinging.
               The fact that
                                      beings are transmigrating from life to life 
              attests to this.
                                      Ascetic practices may temporarily check the grip
               of physical
                                      desires over spiritual clarity and purity, but 
              transcendence
                                      depending on physical abuse can hardly be 
              accepted as genuine
                                      liberation. The Buddha had clearly taught that 
              the right path is
                                      the middle one away from the extremes of 
              asceticism and
                                      hedonism.<br> <br> A fundamental and common approach of Buddhist 
              teachings is to
                                      remind everyone of the fact of Impermanence. All
               things are in
                                      constant changes, even though some changes are 
              not readily
                                      recognizable. The change from being alive to 
              dead could occur at
                                      any moment and could happen in just an instant. 
              Keeping
                                      impermanence in mind, one can clearly see that 
              all our attachments
                                      to the body are based primarily on wishful 
              thinking. To be ready
                                      for and able to transcend the events of life and
               death one needs to
                                      see in advance that all worldly possessions, 
              including the body,
                                      will be lost sooner or later. Hence, a 
              determination to renounce
                                      all worldly possessions is the first step toward
               spiritual
                                      awakening and liberation. Chod as a Buddhist 
              practice is also based
                                      on such awareness of impermanence and complete 
              renunciation. In
                                      fact, many Chodpas adopt not just the ritual 
              practice but also a
                                      way of life that exemplifies such awakening. 
              Many Chodpas are
                                      devout beggars or wondering yogis who stay only 
              in cemeteries or
                                      desolate places and do not stay in one place for
               more than seven
                                      consecutive days.<br> <br> The offering of the body through visualization 
              in a Chod ritual is
                                      an ingenious way to counter our usual attitude 
              toward the body;
                                      instead of possession, attachment, and tender, 
              loving care, the
                                      ritual offers new perspectives as to what could 
              happen to the body
                                      as a physical object and thereby reduces the 
              practitioners'
                                      fixation with the body, enlarge their 
              perspectives, and help them
                                      to appreciate the position of the body on the 
              cosmic scale. Chodpas
                                      would fully realize that the body is also 
              impermanent, become free
                                      from attachment to it, and ready to renounce it 
              when the time
                                      comes. When one is ready to renounce even the 
              body, the rest of the
                                      worldly possessions and affairs are no longer of
               vital concern,
                                      only then can one make steadfast advancement on 
              the quest for
                                      Enlightenment.<br> <br> D. Bodhicitta<br> <br> Machig Labdron emphasizes that the offering of 
              the body in Chod
                                      practice is an act of great compassion for all 
              beings, especially
                                      toward the practitioner's creditors and enemies.
               Great compassion
                                      knows no partiality, hence the distinction of 
              friends and foes, or
                                      relatives and strangers does not apply. Great 
              compassion transcends
                                      all attachments to the self, hence all one's 
              possessions, including
                                      the body, may be offered to benefit others. In 
              every act of
                                      visualized offering of the bodily parts, the 
              practitioner is
                                      converting an unquestioned attachment into an 
              awaken determination
                                      to sacrifice the self for the benefit of all. In
               short, this is the
                                      ultimate exercise in contemplating complete 
              self-sacrifice for
                                      achieving an altruistic goal.<br> <br> Chod is a practice that kills two birds with one
               stone. On one
                                      hand, the attachment to the body and self would 
              be reduced through
                                      the visualized activity of dismemberment; on the
               other hand, the
                                      visualized practice of satisfying all beings, 
              especially one's
                                      creditors and enemies, through the ultimate and 
              complete sacrifice
                                      of one's body would nurture one's great 
              compassion. When the
                                      attachment is weakened, the wisdom of non-self 
              would gradually
                                      reveal itself. Consequently, Chod develops 
              wisdom and compassion
                                      simultaneously in one practice; or to put it in 
              another way, Chod
                                      is a practice that nurtures the unification of 
              wisdom and
                                      compassion.<br> <br> In Buddhism Bodhicitta refers to the ultimate 
              unification of wisdom
                                      and compassion, the Enlightenment, and to the 
              aspiration of
                                      achieving it. Therefore, we may say that Chod 
              stems from the
                                      Bodhicitta of Machig Labdron, guides 
              practitioners who are with
                                      Bodhicitta through the enactment of Bodhicitta, 
              and would mature
                                      them for the attainment of Bodhicitta.<br> <br> Only when one is completely devoted to the 
              service of all sentient
                                      beings can one gain complete liberation from 
              self-centeredness.
                                      Just as a headlong plunge takes a diver off the 
              board, complete
                                      devotion to Dharma and complete attainment of 
              liberation happens
                                      simultaneously. Only when considerations 
              involving oneself is
                                      eradicated, will an act in the name of the 
              Dharma become indeed an
                                      act of Bodhicitta, of Enlightenment. Developing 
              Bodhicitta in place
                                      of self-centeredness is the effective and 
              indispensable approach to
                                      liberation from self, and Chod is the epitome of
               this
                                      approach.<br> <br> E. Meditation Stability and Visualization<br> <br> The visualization practice of Chod is not an act
               of imagination.
                                      Were it just imagining things in one's mind, 
              there is no guarantee
                                      that such practice would not drive one insane. 
              To practice Chod
                                      properly one should have some attainment of 
              meditation stability so
                                      that the visualizations are focused and not 
              mixed with delusive and
                                      scattered thoughts or mental images. Indeed, 
              Chod should be
                                      practiced as akin to meditation in action.<br> <br> To be free from attachments to the body, we have
               seen above that
                                      destroying or abusing it would not do. It is the
               great ingenuity of
                                      Machig Labdron to recognize that attachments 
              being mental
                                      tendencies can be properly corrected by mental 
              adjustments.
                                      Visualizations performed by practitioners with 
              meditation stability
                                      could have the same or even stronger effects as 
              real occurrences.
                                      Furthermore, visualizations can be repeated over
               and over again to
                                      gradually overcome propensities until their 
              extinction.<br> <br> Using visualization in Chod practices the body 
              remains intact and
                                      serves as a good foundation for the 
              practitioner's advancement on
                                      the path to Enlightenment, while the attachment 
              to the body and all
                                      attachments stemming from it are being chopped 
              down piece by
                                      piece.<br> <br> Visualizations performed in meditation stability
               is a valid way of
                                      communication with the consciousness of beings 
              who are without
                                      corporeal existence. Hence Chod visualizations 
              as performed by
                                      adepts are real encounters of the supernatural 
              kind. They could
                                      yield miraculous results such as healing of 
              certain ailments or
                                      mental disorders that are caused by ghosts or 
              evil spirits, and
                                      exorcism that restores peace to a haunted place.<br> <br> The five essential ingredients as stated and 
              explained above
                                      constitute the key to the formulation of Chod as
               a Buddhist tantric
                                      practice. A thorough understanding of the 
              significance of these
                                      essentials is both a prerequisite to and a fruit
               of successful Chod
                                      practices.<br> <br> 3. The Benefits of Chod Practice<br> <br> Enlightenment is of course the ultimate goal of 
              Chod practice.
                                      Machig Labdron revealed her vast spiritual 
              experiences by
                                      indicating signs of various stages of 
              realization in Chod. These
                                      teachings are still well preserved in Chod 
              traditions. Through the
                                      References listed at the end of this work 
              serious readers may find
                                      some of these teachings.<br> <br> In addition to the fruits of realization as 
              indicated above and the
                                      application of spiritual power to healing and 
              exorcism as mentioned
                                      earlier, there are other benefits that may be 
              derived from Chod
                                      practice. Chod practice can help booster the 
              courage and
                                      determination to devote one's whole being to 
              practice, beyond
                                      considerations of physical well-being and life, 
              thereby achieving
                                      complete renunciation and significant 
              realization. Chod practice
                                      could help total removal of subconscious 
              hindrances that are most
                                      difficult to become aware of because these would
               surface only when
                                      challenged by grave situations like 
              dismemberment.<br> <br> In a dream state I sensed the relaxing effect of
               Chod; those joints
                                      of my body that were tense became relaxed when a
               curved knife cut
                                      through them. The tension in our mind is 
              enhanced by our underlying
                                      concept of the body. By removing the mental 
              image of the body
                                      through Chod the tension is reduced. The natural
               state of one's
                                      body exists before the arising of concepts, and 
              hence, to return to
                                      it one needs to transcend the grip of 
              conceptuality.<br> <br> Many kinds of death are horrible to normal 
              thinking; through
                                      practicing Chod it is possible to go beyond 
              attachment to physical
                                      existence, and have enough spiritual experiences
               to understand that
                                      whatever the manner of death may be they are 
              just different ways to
                                      exit from the physical existence. Such a broad 
              perspective would
                                      enable one to remain serene in facing 
              unthinkable tragedies. Such
                                      an understanding would make it easier to 
              tolerate, forgive and
                                      forgo vengeance.</p>

              <h1>Hundred Verses of Advice of Padampa Sangye</h1>
              <p>The Hundred Verses of Advice of Padampa Sangye are utterly
                                      amazing for their clarity, depth, breadth and 
              brevity. The great
                                      pandit Shantarakshita, who was instrumental in 
              transplanting
                                      Buddhism from India to Tibet, promised that one 
              of his students
                                      would come one day to complete his work. 
              Kamalasila (Tib., Padampa
                                      Sangye) fulfilled this prophecy, making three 
              trips to Tibet during
                                      the eleventh century. This was the time when the
               great yogi
                                      Milarepa lived, and his autobiography describes a
               momentous dharma
                                      debate between the two teachers.<br> <br> The story behind the teaching presented here 
              begins when Padampa
                                      Sangye throws a stone magically bestowed upon 
              him by the Buddha,
                                      saying that he would teach wherever it landed. 
              The stone landed in
                                      the village of Tingri, in Tibet, and true to his
               word, Padampa
                                      Sangye founded his monastic seat there and 
              proclaimed The Hundred
                                      Verses of Advice to the villagers.<br> <br> Padampa Sangye known in India as Paramabuddha 
              was from southern
                                      India, and traveled widely in India, Tibet and 
              China, until his
                                      death around 1117 AD. It is widely believed that
               Padampa Sangye was
                                      an incarnation of the 8th century monk 
              Kamalashîla, one of the
                                      early teachers of the Dharma in Tibet.When the 
              Indian sage Padampa
                                      Sangye arrived in Tibet, he found the people in 
              the area of Tingri,
                                      which is on the Tibetan side of Mt. Everest, to 
              be especially
                                      amenable to his instruction. He therefore 
              settled in Tingri and
                                      established a monastery.<br> <br> Homage to the teacher!<br> Fortunate practitioners gathered here in Tingri,
               listen!<br> <br> Just as worn-out clothes can never again be made
               as new,<br> It's no use seeing a doctor once you're 
              terminally ill;<br> You'll have to go. We humans living on this 
              earth<br> Are like streams and rivers flowing toward the 
              ocean -<br> All living beings are heading for that single 
              destination.<br> <br> Now, like a small bird flying off from a 
              treetop,<br> I, too, will not be here much longer; soon I 
              must move on.<br> <br> <br> If you spend the present meaninglessly and leave
               with empty
                                      hands,<br> People of Tingri, a human life in the future 
              will be very hard to
                                      find.<br> <br> To apply yourselves with body, speech and mind 
              to the sacred
                                      Teachings,<br> People of Tingri, is the best thing that you can
               do.<br> <br> Give your very life, heart and soul to the Three
               Jewels the Buddha,
                                      the Dharma, and the Sangha,<br> People of Tingri, and their blessings cannot but
               arise.<br> <br> Forget your goals for this life - concentrate 
              instead on lives to
                                      come.<br> People of Tingri, that is the highest goal.<br> <br> Families are as fleeting as a crowd on market 
              day;<br> People of Tingri, don't bicker or fight.<br> <br> Wealth and poverty, like a magic show, just 
              seduce and
                                      deceive;<br> People of Tingri, don't let the knot of avarice 
              bind you.<br> <br> This body's just a bag containing various kinds 
              of filth;<br> People of Tingri, don't pamper it and spruce it 
              up so.<br> <br> Family and friends are no more real than a magic
               show;<br> People of Tingri, in your fondness for them 
              don't tie yourself
                                      down.<br> <br> Country and land are like a nomad's pastures<br> People of Tingri, don't cling sentimentally to 
              them.<br> <br> As parents, all beings in the six realms have 
              cared for you;<br> People of Tingri, don't relate to them with your
               ideas of "I" and
                                      "mine".<br> <br> The day you were born, your death began 
              approaching;<br> People of Tingri, remember: there is never any 
              time to spare.<br> <br> Fundamentally there's no delusion, it's an 
              ephemeral
                                      occurrence;<br> People of Tingri, look at the nature of what it 
              produces.<br> <br> Without distraction apply yourselves to the 
              sacred Dharma;<br> People of Tingri, after death it will guide you 
              on the path.<br> <br> The truth of cause and effect ensures that 
              actions yield their full
                                      result;<br> People of Tingri, avoid all actions that are 
              negative and
                                      evil.<br> <br> Leave all your activities behind like a country 
              in a dream;<br> People of Tingri, just put non-action into 
              practice.<br> <br> The very thing you feel attached to, let go of 
              it, whatever -<br> People of Tingri, there isn't anything that you 
              need.<br> <br> Since you won't be staying in this world 
              forever,<br> People of Tingri, make your preparations for the
               journey now.<br> <br> If you first finish what you have to do, you'll 
              never get to
                                      Dharma;<br> People of Tingri, while you're thinking about 
              it, practice straight
                                      away.<br> <br> Inside the forest, monkeys may be living happily
               at ease,<br> People of Tingri - but at the edges forest fires
               are closing in all
                                      round.<br> <br> Birth, sickness, ageing and death flow on, a 
              river without ford or
                                      bridge;<br> People of Tingri, have you prepared yourselves a
               boat?<br> <br> In the narrow defiles of birth, death and the 
              intermediate
                                      state<br> Bandits await the five poisonous emotions sure 
              to ambush you;<br> People of Tingri, avail yourselves of the 
              teacher as your
                                      escort.<br> <br> Your neverfailing source of refuge is the 
              teacher;<br> People of Tingri, carry him constantly on the 
              crown of your
                                      head.<br> <br> If your protection is the teacher, you'll reach 
              wherever you aspire
                                      to go;<br> People of Tingri, cultivate devotion as the fare
               you pay for the
                                      journey.<br> <br> Those who get wealthy get miserly too;<br> People of Tingri, give generously without being 
              partial.<br> <br> Whoever gets power acts sinfully, too;<br> People of Tingri, abandon all desire for rank 
              and power.<br> <br> Those with rank and riches are never happy and 
              at ease;<br> People of Tingri, get ready to claw at your 
              chest in anguish.<br> <br> In the next world, there are neither family nor 
              friends;<br> People of Tingri, place your confidence in the 
              Dharma.<br> <br> If you wander in distraction, you'll waste the 
              freedoms and
                                      advantages of human life;<br> People of Tingri, make a resolute decision now.<br> <br> While you're busy being distracted, the demon of
               Death will catch
                                      you;<br> People of Tingri, practice from this very moment
               onwards.<br> <br> When will the demon of Death appear? There is no
               easy way to
                                      tell;<br> People of Tingri, right now be always on your 
              guard.<br> <br> The day you die, there's no one who'll protect 
              you;<br> People of Tingri, be ready to have yourselves 
              alone to count
                                      on.<br> <br> If you reflect on death, there's nothing you 
              will need;<br> People of Tingri, always keep your death in 
              mind.<br> <br> Like lengthening shadows as the sun sinks low,<br> The demon of Death relentlessly draws nearer;<br> People of Tingri, quickly! Get away from him!<br> <br> The morning's ravishing flower will wither by 
              nightfall;<br> People of Tingri, don't put your hopes in your 
              body.<br> <br> Even if resembling, while alive, the children of
               the gods,<br> Once dead they are more frightful than a demon 
              horde;<br> People of Tingri, you've been deceived by these 
              illusory
                                      bodies.<br> <br> Visitors to market day, their trading finished, 
              on the morrow have
                                      dispersed;<br> People of Tingri, your friends will part from 
              you, be
                                      certain.<br> <br> Since the scarecrow conjured up by magic is sure
               to tumble
                                      down;<br> People of Tingri, act now according to the 
              linking of effect with

               death.<br> <br> In a state of emptiness, whirl the spear of pure
               awareness;<br> People of Tingri, the view is free of being 
              caught by anything at

               to abandon or
                                      adopt.<br> <br> The four bodies, indivisible, are complete in 
              your mind;<br> People of Tingri, the fruit is beyond all hope 
              and doubt.<br> <br> The root of both samsara and nirvana is to be

              reality.<br> <br> Desire and hate appear, but like birds in

              clinging to
                                      experiences.<br> <br> The unborn absolute body is like the very heart 
              of the sun -<br> People of Tingri, there is no waxing or waning 
              of its radiant
                                      clarity.<br> <br> Thoughts come and go like a thief in an empty 
              house -<br> People of Tingri, in fact there is nothing to be

              reference points.<br> <br> Without fixation, thoughts are freed by

              object.<br> <br> Pure awareness is without fixation, like a 
              rainbow in the
                                      sky;<br> People of Tingri, experiences arise quite 
              unimpededly.<br> <br> Realization of the absolute nature is like the 
              dream of a
                                      mute;<br> People of Tingri, there are no words to express 
              it.<br> <br> Realization is like a youthful maiden's 
              pleasure;<br> People of Tingri, the joy and bliss cannot be 
              described.<br> <br> Clarity and emptiness united are like the moon 
              reflecting in
                                      water;<br> People of Tingri, there is nothing to be 
              attached to and nothing to
                                      impede.<br> <br> Appearances and emptiness inseparable are like 
              the empty sky;<br> People of Tingri, the mind is without either 
              center or
                                      periphery.<br> <br> The mind with no thought and no distraction is 
              like the mirror of a
                                      beauty;<br> People of Tingri, it is free of any theoretical 
              tenets.<br> <br> Awareness and emptiness inseparable are like

              be grasped.<br> <br> Happiness and suffering, through a mechanism 
              like the sounding of a
                                      lute's body and strings,<br> People of Tingri, are produced when actions are 
              combined with
                                      necessary conditions.<br> <br> The natural freedom of samsara and nirvana is

              mind within;<br> People of Tingri, let the solid ice be melted 
              into liquid.<br> <br> The mechanism of ignorance is like the gush of a
               meadow
                                      spring;<br> People of Tingri, it cannot be halted by 
              obstructing it.<br> <br> The delusions of samsara and nirvana are like 
              coming face to face
                                      with an enemy;<br> People of Tingri, as your ally practice virtue.<br> <br> The natural clarity of the five kayas aspects of
               enlightenment is
                                      like the expanse of a continent of gold;<br> People of Tingri, there is no hope or doubt, 
              attachment or
                                      aversion.<br> <br> <br> With its freedoms and advantages, human life is 
              like a treasure
                                      island;<br> People of Tingri, do not come back an 
              empty-handed failure.<br> <br> The practice of the Great Vehicle is like a 
              wish-fulfilling
                                      gem;<br> People of Tingri, however hard you search, it 
              would be difficult to
                                      find again.<br> <br> For this life, come what may, you'll have enough
               to eat and clothe
                                      yourself;<br> People of Tingri, put everything you have into 
              practicing the
                                      Dharma.<br> <br> While you are young, practice hard and with 
              austerities;<br> People of Tingri, once you're old your 
              constitution won't withstand
                                      it.<br> <br> When emotions arise, bring antidotes to bear on 
              them;<br> People of Tingri, let free all concepts in their
               very nature.<br> <br> Think from time to time of all the defects of 
              samsara;<br> People of Tingri, that will make your faith 
              become much
                                      clearer.<br> <br> Right now, develop diligence and stand your 
              ground;<br> People of Tingri, when you die it will guide you
               on the path.<br> <br> If you're not free now, when will you ever get 
              to be free?<br> People of Tingri, your chance to eat comes only 
              one time in a
                                      hundred.<br> <br> Life is so ephemeral, like the dew on the grass;<br> People of Tingri, don't yield to laziness and 
              indifference.<br> <br> From where you are now, should you lose your 
              footing,<br> People of Tingri, it will be hard to find a 
              human life again.<br> <br> The Buddha's teaching is like the sun shining 
              through the
                                      clouds;<br> People of Tingri, now is the one time that it is
               present.<br> <br> You say such clever things to people, but don't 
              apply them to
                                      yourself;<br> People of Tingri, the faults within you are the 
              ones to be
                                      exposed.<br> <br> That faith succumbs to circumstance is only a 
              short step
                                      away;<br> People of Tingri, contemplate samsara's 
              imperfections.<br> <br> Frequenting evil friends is bound to make your 
              own behavior
                                      evil;<br> People of Tingri, abandon any friendships that 
              are negative.<br> <br> Frequenting virtuous friends is bound to make 
              your own good
                                      qualities arise;<br> People of Tingri, follow your spiritual 
              teachers.<br> <br> Deception and lies deceive not only others, but 
              yourself as
                                      well;<br> People of Tingri, as witness take your own

              poisons desire, hatred,
                                      ignorance, jealousy, pride, the path is near;<br> People of Tingri, generate powerful antidotes 
              against them.<br> <br> If your perseverance has no strength, you will 
              not reach

              <h1>Shambhala Rising</h1>
              <p>The prophetic elements in the Kalachakra literature detail the
                                      names and length of reigns of the Shambhala 
              kings, with special
                                      focus on the 25th Rigden King, Rudrachakrin. The
               texts predict a
                                      time in the not-too-distant future (estimates 
              range from quite near
                                      to about 400 years) when the whole world will be
               overwhelmed with
                                      pervasive suffering. Nations will steadily be 
              absorbed through
                                      relentless war waged by those of barbaric ways 
              and beliefs.
                                      Buddhist practice will wane until it barely 
              exists except in
                                      obscure lands like Shambhala. It's said that the
               female Buddha,
                                      Arya Tara, will skillfully emanate to become the
               barbarian ruler's
                                      queen. At just the time when that ruler feels he
               has achieved
                                      supreme dominion in this world, his queen will 
              reveal the hitherto
                                      unknown existence of Shambhala in all its 
              incomparable
                                      magnificence. Bursting with envy and rage, the 
              barbarian ruler will
                                      loose his armies at Shambhala, at which point 
              Rudrachakrin will
                                      counter-attack, leading his own legions of 
              Shambhala warriors in an
                                      epic battle which will utterly crush the 
              barbarian forces. The
                                      victory of the Shambhala armies will usher in a 
              golden age of
                                      Shambhala on Earth. This age will provide people
               with an excellent,
                                      but final opportunity to gain release in supreme
               enlightenment from
                                      their suffering round of rebirths before an 
              1800-year decline
                                      culminates in a world-ending cataclysm. Danzan 
              Ravjaa's
                                      specifically directed his Gobi activity toward 
              this aspect of the
                                      Kalachakra's predictions.<br> <br> Danzan Ravjaa's autobiography contains the 
              statement that:<br> <br> "...in the future, when the Panchen Lama reigns 
              as the king of
                                      Shambhala, when many enlightened Buddhas, 
              commanders and officials
                                      are waging battle against the mlecchas, I 
              received a prophecy that
                                      I will [reincarnate] as the commander Sanjay 
              Dorje Gyalpo and take
                                      under my command the soldiers and officers of 
              the outer, inner and
                                      secret places.It is widely believed that Tibet's
               Panchen Lama will
                                      reincarnate as Rudrachakrin, the king who will 
              lead this battle,
                                      and that countless other realized beings will 
              take form as
                                      commanders within his army. In his lifetime, 
              Danzan Ravjaa was
                                      especially close to the 7th Panchen Lama</p>

              <p>In the realm of the great sphere, the all-pervasive
                                      dharmadhatu,<br> In the sambhogakaya palace with the fivefold luminosity,<br> And in all the indefinite places of nirmanakayas who tame
                                      beings,<br> They turn throughout the three times<br> The wheel of Dharma of the inconceivable number of causal and<br> resultant vehicles,<br> For oceanlike assemblies of disciples possessing potential,<br> In accordance with the various types of suitability and capacity
                                      of<br> each individual.</p>
              <p>I will now teach to my closest disciples<br> The quintessence of all these condensed into one,<br> The essence of my heart, the ultimate counsel,<br> As a direct instruction that is easy to understand and simple to
                                      apply<br> Don't let it dwindle away, but practice one-pointedly.<br> It has that to be understood, that which causes realization, and
                                      the<br> final result.<br> Thus it is demonstrated by these three aspects.</p>
              <p>The ground to be understood is the all-pervasive sugata
                                      essence.<br> Uncompounded, luminous, and empty, it is the natural state of
                                      awareness.<br> Beyond confusion and liberation, it is completely quiescent, like
                                      space.<br> Although it abides without separation in samsara or joining in
                                      nirvana,<br> Due to the great demon of coemergent and conceptual
                                      ignorance,<br> From the solidified habitual patterns of grasping and
                                      fixation,<br> And the different perceptions of worlds and inhabitants,<br> The six classes of beings appeared as a dream.</p>
              <p>Although this is so, you have never moved and will never
                                      move<br> From the original condition of the essence.<br> Endeavor therefore in purifying the temporary stains.</p>
              <p>The stages of the path that bring about realization are
                                      innumerable.<br> Purify your beings, sow the seeds, and cultivate them.<br> Remove the hindrances, and likewise bring forth enhancement.<br> Thus enter the correct path through these five aspects.</p>
              <p>First of all is to purify your mind and being.<br> The vajra master, the root of the path,<br> Is someone who has the pure conduct of samaya and vows.<br> He is fully adorned with learning, has discerned it through
                                      reflection.<br> And through meditation he posseses the qualities and signs of<br> experience and realization.<br> With his compassionate action he accepts disciples.</p>
              <p>Serve a master endowed with these characteristics by means of
                                      the<br> three pleasing actions,<br> And do not commit the displeasing ones for even an instant.<br> Take the pledge to accomplish whatever he commands<br> By the skill of correctly training in his thoughts and deeds.</p>
              <p>The master should give the teachings suited to the mind of the
                                      disciple<br> Who has faith, renunciation, and compassion,<br> And who has sharp faculties, intelligence, and discipline.<br> He should not give instructions that are inappropriate for the
                                      recipient.</p>
              <p>For the way of guiding gradually in accordance with the types
                                      of<br> mental capacity,<br> First, keep far away from places of disturbance<br> By going to a place of solitude and giving up worldly
                                      activities.</p>
              <p>Sit on a comfortable seat, straighten your body, and expel the
                                      stale breath.<br> Supplicate the Three Jewels and generate devotion to your
                                      guru.<br> Apply mindfulness and reflect in the following way.</p>
              <p>This bodily support adorned with the perfect freedoms and
                                      riches,<br> Like the udumbara flower, is extremely hard to find.<br> If you skillfully take advantage of it,<br> Then this find has great value, exceeding that of a wish-fulfilling
                                      gem.<br> Therefore follow spiritual guides and virtuous friends<br> At all times and on all occasions.</p>
              <p>Giving up concerns for this life, and for the sake of the
                                      future.<br> Exert yourself quickly to take advantage of it, for if you don't,
                                      [it<br> will not last].</p>
              <p>Like the rising and setting of the sun and moon, composite
                                      things are<br> impermanent.<br> The time of death lies uncertain, like a flash of lightning in the
                                      sky.<br> At the time of death nondharmic things are of no help at all,<br> So practice the sacred and sublime Dharma correctly.</p>
              <p>The root of practicing the sacred Dharma is the law of
                                      karma.<br> Through evil deeds and nonvirtues you will go to the three lower
                                      realms.<br> By virtuous actions you achieve the higher realms and
                                      liberation.<br> Therefore confess evil deeds and make the wholehearted vow to
                                      refrain from them.</p>
              <p>Diligently take up the roots of virtue.<br> Prostrations and circumambulations purify the wrongdoings of your
                                      body.<br> Reciting and reading the Buddha's words purify the obscurations of
                                      your speech,<br> And supplicating the Three Jewels pacifies the faults of your
                                      mind.<br> Always train correctly in being mindful, careful, and
                                      conscientious.<br> In particular, for accomplishing the state of emancipation,<br> With the recognition and remembrance that all of samsara<br> Is like a fiery pit, a garden of razors, or a forest of
                                      swords,<br> Arouse again and again the intense and genuine attitude<br> Of desiring to be quickly freed from the three sufferings</p>
              <p>At some point, when you understand that all samsaric
                                      grandeur<br> Is impermanent, inconstant, and illusive,<br> Fascination with even the splendor of Brahma and Indra<br> Will have no occasion to arise for as much as an instant.</p>
              <p>While truly perceiving the Three Precious Ones, the Roots, and
                                      the<br> guardians of the Dharma<br> To be the unfailing and permanent protection,<br> Regard them repectfully as your refuge until enlightenment<br> In order to free yourself and others from the terrors of
                                      samsara.</p>
              <p>Using your own experience as a measure,<br> Arouse the bodhicitta of aspiration<br> Through the four immeasurables of love, compassion, joy and
                                      impartiality<br> In order that your mothers, all beings, may have happiness and be
                                      free<br> from suffering</p>
              <p>With the intent of pursuing complete enlightenment solely for
                                      the sake<br> of others,<br> Give away, like grass, your body and possesions,<br> And give the relief of protection to those disturbed by
                                      dangers.<br> Practice the Dharma yourself and establish others in it.</p>
              <p>With the intention of renouncing, a throughly delighted frame of
                                      mind,<br> Constrain yourself from committing the negative misdeeds of your
                                      three doors.<br> Practice the conditioned and unconditioned virtues as much as you
                                      can,<br> And motivate yourself to carry out all your deeds for the sake
                                      of<br> sentient beings.</p>
              <p>In order never to be overcome by harmdoers,<br> Cultivate patience through mindfulness of the demerits of
                                      anger.<br> Joyfully undertake hardships for the sake of the Dharma,<br> And be unafraid of the profound emptiness.</p>
              <p>By awakening a courageous fortitude for what is virtuous,<br> Don the armor of tirelessly engaging in bodhisattva deeds.<br> Exert yourself without distraction throughout day and night,<br> And cast away weariness when achieving the welfare of others</p>
              <p>With the thorough intention to calm your mind,<br> Take the mundane dhyanas as the foundation.<br> Through fully accomplishing samadhi with vipashyana,<br> Enter the domain of the experience of the tathagatas.</p>
              <p>By means of the intelligence that fully discerns
                                      phenomena,<br> First comprehend the words of all teachings through learning.<br> Next seek an understanding of their meaning through
                                      reflection,<br> And finally realize the meaning through meditation.</p>
              <p>Having ripened your own beings, gather followers through
                                      generosity,<br> Delight them with pleasing words, and comfort them by being
                                      consistent.<br> Through counseling them in meaningful conduct, fully establish
                                      them,<br> temporarily and ultimately<br> In the splendor of benefit and well-being.<br> As the essential point, take upon yourself the burden<br> Of all the miseries of sentient beings,<br> Give away your happiness and virtue to the six classes of
                                      beings,<br> And train in compassion and bodhicitta without being carried away
                                      by<br> difficulties.</p>
              <p>In particular, external objects grasped by fixation<br> Are all unreal and appear like an illusion.<br> Not permanent, yet their transiency is able to function.<br> They are not singular, since a variety emerges and changes.<br> They are not independent, but follow the karmic deeds.<br> They are not particles, since partless atoms do not exist.</p>
              <p>If they did exist, gross things could not be assembled.<br> If they had parts, this would contradict the assertion of
                                      partlessness.<br> They are nothing but a nonexistent and false appearance, an
                                      interdependence,<br> Like dreams, magical illusion, and the reflection of the moon in
                                      water.<br> Regard them as a city of gandharvas and as a rainbow.</p>
              <p>The mind that observes is also devoid of an ego or a
                                      self-entity.<br> It is neither seen as something different from the aggregates<br> Nor as identical with these five aggregates.<br> If the first were true, there would exist some other
                                      substance.<br> This is not the case, so were the second to be true,<br> That would contradict a permanent self, since the aggregates are
                                      impermanent.<br> Therefore, based on the five aggregates,<br> The self is a mere imputation by the power of ego-clinging.</p>
              <p>As to that which imputes, the past thought has vanished and is
                                      nonexistent.<br> The future thought has not occurred, and the present thought does
                                      not<br> withstand scrutiny.</p>
              <p>In short, understand the twofold self, the perceiver and the
                                      perceived,<br> To be totally quiescent, like the sky, and devoid of arising,<br> And also that this nonarising is beyond the domain of conceptual
                                      mind.<br> Since even the Omniscient Ones find no words for this,<br> This absence of mental constructs is called the Middle Way.</p>
              <p>Having realized this, rest in equanimity,<br> Free from conceptual activity, in the state devoid of fixation.</p>
              <p>Thoughts then subside, and the natural state of the essence is
                                      seen.<br> Hereby you accomplish the virtues such as the eyes,<br> superknowledge, and dharani-recall.</p>
              <p>The causal vehicle of the paramitas<br> Is to gradually attain the paths and bhumis.<br> On the path of fruition, you should still regard<br> The practice of unified emptiness and compassion as the basis of
                                      the path.</p>

                                      the<br> first section is the preliminaries — the recitation of the
                                      Four<br> Thoughts that Turn the Mind (from Samsara)</p>
              <p><br> NAMO LÜ ME TEN GYI GÖN PO LA MA KY’EN<br> Unfailing and constant protector, Lama, you who know,<br> DÄL ’JOR ’DI NI SHIN TU NYE PAR KA’<br> This body of freedoms and favourable conditions is extremely hard

              <p>Thus, reciting this as much as possible, train the mind.</p>
              <p>Second comes the actual preliminary practice, of which the
                                      first<br> section is going for Refuge. Firmly believing that your Root Lama,
                                      the<br> quintessence and embodiment of three supreme objects of Refuge,
                                      is<br> actually seated in the space before you in the form of Guru
                                      Rinpoche…</p>
              <p><br> ’DI ZUNG CHANG CHUB NYING PO MA T’OB BAR<br> From this day forth, and until I attain the very heart of

              <p>Thus recite as much possible with prostrations.</p>
              <p>The second section is the generation of the Enlightened
                                      Attitude<br> Requesting the objects of Refuge to bear witness…</p>
              <p>DA NE ZUNG TE ’KOR WA MA TONG BAR<br> From now until samsara is emptied,<br> MA GYUR SEM CHEN KÜN GYI P’EN DE DRUB<br> I shall work for the benefit and well–being of my mothers, all

              <p>Thus train the mind to generate the Enlightened Attitude.</p>
              <p><br> The third is the mandala–offering in order to gain merit 
                                      Laying out<br> an actual mandala of heaped up offerings as symbolic
                                      representation…</p>

              <p>Thus offer the mandala as much as possible.</p>
              <p>Fourth is the meditation on and recitation of Vajrasattva to
                                      purify<br> obscuration  Remaining in your ordinary state…</p>

              <p><br> Thus recite the hundred syllables while visualising the
                                      nectar<br> descending and purifying, and (then)…</p>
              <p>OM BENZAR SATTO HUNG<br> Recite the six–syllable mantra as much as you can, and when you
                                      have<br> completed this…</p>

                                      phenomena.</p>
              <p>Thus, Vajrasattva having gathered into oneself, remain in
                                      even–minded<br> meditation.</p>
              <p>Fifth is the swiftly penetrating blessing of the Guruyoga.</p>

                                      meditation.<br> The sixth section is the transference.</p>

              <p>Thus reciting as much as you possibly can, appeal for the
                                      transference.</p>
              <p>Seventh is the offering of the body and the dedication of
                                      merit.</p>

              <p>Thus earnestly make prayers of aspiration.</p>
              <p>Thus, in order to benefit those who do not know or who are

                                      practised,<br> I offer this pithy advice to you, my friends, who I hold as dear as
                                      my own heart.<br>  <br> Becoming attached to this life, you will lose your fortunate
                                      connection to the Dharma.<br> Indulging your desires again and again, your craving will only
                                      increase,<br> And you will never find satisfaction. Wealth, happiness, fame and
                                      praise—<br> To pursue them is like buying and selling in a dream. Let go of
                                      such concerns!<br>  <br> By relying on a genuine and qualified teacher,<br> Your spiritual qualities will develop and increase,<br> And all your faults and failings will be cast away,<br> So serve him in the three ways[1] and others’ aims will be
                                      accomplished.<br>  <br> Just as gardens are not to be found growing in midair,<br> All the bounties of the higher realms and liberation,<br> Will never be yours as long as you lack moral discipline,<br> So with mindfulness, awareness and caution, control your
                                      mind.<br>  <br> Up to now, you have wandered like madmen lacking any
                                      guidance,<br> Through the vast darkness of unknowing in beginningless
                                      existence.<br> So now, in order to find the great sanctuary of peace and
                                      happiness,<br> It is right that you take joy in studying the vast ocean of
                                      excellent teachings.<br>  <br> Yet hearing alone will not be enough to eliminate
                                      misconceptions,<br> And confidence in the teacher and teachings will not come
                                      easily,<br> So take advantage of hundreds of debates, teachings and
                                      compositions,<br> And rely upon the elixir of mind that is the wisdom born of
                                      reflection.<br>  <br> Even the most erudite of teachers with vast scriptural
                                      learning,<br> Can repeat words like a parrot, without taking them to heart,<br> But when death suddenly arrives, this will bring only pangs of
                                      regret,<br> So rely on the essential meaning of the teachings, my
                                      heart-friends!<br>  <br> All the infinite teachings of the buddhas, so vast in number,<br> Are imparted purely as a means to subdue our own minds.<br> Don’t put your faith in words alone! I urge you once again:<br> Let the key points of the deeper meaning seep into your
                                      hearts!<br>  <br> This physical existence is difficult to find, like an udumvara
                                      flower,<br> Yet more rewarding than the discovery of a million precious
                                      gems.<br> It will be incredibly difficult to find another opportunity like
                                      this later on,<br> So don’t let it pass you by without accomplishing the highest
                                      purpose!<br>  <br> Our great enemy, the lord of death, arrives like a bolt of
                                      lightning in the sky,<br> And nobody can predict when and where he will strike next.<br> So you can not afford to wait for months and years.<br> Now is the time for virtuous practice—right here, right now!<br>  <br> For all beings, actions will not go to waste, but will bear their
                                      fruit,<br> And when karma ripens, there is no way to change its outcome.<br> So now, while you are fortunate enough still to have some
                                      control,<br> If you insist on bringing ruin upon yourself, who will ever save
                                      you!<br>  <br> If merely thinking of the various sufferings of samsara,<br> Which are so unbearably intense, can make you shudder,<br> Ask yourself: What will it be like when body and mind<br> Are actually afflicted by these countless forms of duhkha?<br>  <br> Only they have the power to lead us out of this great terror,<br> So extremely difficult to escape. No one else could ever save
                                      us!<br> So we should take these three most precious jewels as our
                                      refuge,<br> For they are undeceiving, wise, compassionate and powerful.<br>  <br> All the suffering of the three worlds comes from wanting happiness
                                      for ourselves,<br> And all virtue and happiness is born of a mind that wishes others
                                      well.<br> So, following the example of the teacher of all gods and men,<br> You should generate the supreme and unsurpassed bodhichitta.<br>  <br> When the glass mirror of your own mind is completely covered
                                      over,<br> With the thick layer of dust that is the adventitious
                                      defilements,<br> It is difficult for the reflection of profound and clear samadhi to
                                      appear,<br> So take pains to wipe it clean using the pure cloth of the four
                                      powers.<br>  <br> All appearance, sound and awareness are deity, mantra and
                                      dharmata.<br> And the view is knowing that this is how it always has been.<br> Without losing this view, take aim with the arrow of your
                                      meditation,<br> And gain mastery over the practices of elimination and
                                      development.<br>  <br> If you can generate bliss, clarity and non-thought as means of
                                      support,<br> Through the techniques of breathing and adopting physical
                                      postures,<br> You will come to master the illusory body of clear light,<br> So penetrate to the core of enlightened mind through the perfection
                                      stage.<br>  <br> When the darkness of the five degenerations prevails,<br> It is not easily overcome with the starlight of the eight lower
                                      yanas,<br> So shine the brilliant light of the sun of Nyingtik with its
                                      countless rays,<br> All drawn along by the swift carriage of the three kinds of
                                      faith!<br>  <br> Whatever arises, in pure awareness, unaltered and unconfined,<br> Look into the mind that is settled by itself, resting
                                      naturally.<br> If you recognize the natural clarity, always empty and without
                                      origin,<br> You traverse the paths and stages all at once, and seize the
                                      stronghold of the fruition.<br>  <br> Resting in a state of just-as-it-isness, through the right postures
                                      and gazes,<br> If you experience the natural manifestation of basic space and
                                      spheres of light as pure awareness,<br> The darkness of samsara’s dualism will disappear in absolute
                                      space,<br> And, passing through the four visions, you will reach maturity in
                                      the light body of great transference.<br>  <br> What I have said here—this plain talk arranged in verses—is my
                                      heart’s advice.<br> Although it lacks the poetic turns of phrase that might delight the
                                      intellectuals,<br> As a spontaneous and unaltered outpouring from the depths of my
                                      mind,<br> It is in the preferred style of the vidyadharas of the old
                                      translation school.<br>  <br> Through the merit of this, may all beings without exception<br> Receive the supreme royal empowerment of the four kayas,<br> And may I never be separated, even for a moment,<br> From the courageous strength of youthful Manjushri!</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Remain as the

                                      sufferings of samsara and its lower realms!</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Listen well, my
                                      dear disciples who are gathered here,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And whose hearts
                                      have not been spoiled, consider this.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The chances of
                                      finding a human existence are one in a hundred.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Now that you
                                      have found one, if you fail to practise the sublime
                                      Dharma,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">How could you
                                      possibly expect to find such an opportunity again?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This is why it’s
                                      crucial that you take advantage of your situation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Conceiving of
                                      your body as a servant or a thing to ferry you about,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Don’t allow it
                                      to rest in idleness for even just a single moment;</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Use it well,
                                      spurring on your entire body, speech and mind to virtue.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You might spend
                                      your whole life pursuing only food and clothes,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">With great
                                      effort and without regard for suffering or harmful
                                      deeds,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But when you die
                                      you can’t take even a single thing—consider this well.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The clothing and
                                      alms needed to keep you alive are all you need.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You might dine
                                      on the finest meal of delicious meat and alcohol,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But it all turns
                                      into something impure the very next morning,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And there is
                                      nothing more to it all than that.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So be content
                                      with life-sustaining provisions and simple clothes,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And be a loser
                                      when it comes to food, clothing and conversation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you don’t
                                      reflect on death and impermanence,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There’ll be no
                                      way to practise Dharma purely,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Practice will
                                      remain an aspiration, one that is constantly postponed,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And you may feel
                                      regret the day that death comes, but by then it’s too
                                      late!</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There’s no real
                                      happiness among any of the six classes,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But if we
                                      consider the sufferings of the three lower realms,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Then, when you
                                      feel upset just by hearing about them,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">How will you
                                      possibly cope when you experience them directly?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Even the
                                      happiness and pleasures of the three upper realms</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Are just like
                                      fine food that’s been laced with poison—</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Enjoyable at
                                      first, but in the long run a cause of ruin.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">What’s more, all
                                      these experiences of pleasure and pain,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Are not brought
                                      about by anyone besides yourself.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">They are
                                      produced by your very own actions, good and bad.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Once you know
                                      this, it’s crucial that you act accordingly,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Without
                                      confusing what should be adopted and abandoned.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It’s far better
                                      to eliminate your doubts and misconceptions,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">By relying on
                                      the instructions of your own qualified teacher,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Than to receive
                                      many different teachings and never take them any
                                      further.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You might remain
                                      in a solitary place, physically isolated from the world,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Yet fail to let
                                      go of ordinary concerns, and, with attachment and

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Seek to bring
                                      defeat upon your enemies while furthering the interests of your
                                      friends,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And involve

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But there could
                                      hardly be anything worse than that at all.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you lack the

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You’ll think you
                                      need all kinds of useless things,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And end up even
                                      worse than just an ordinary person,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Because you
                                      won’t manage even a single session of practice.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So set your mind

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Wealth, success
                                      and status are all simply ways of attracting enemies and

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Limit yourself

                                      diligence.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Not allowing

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Make yourself
                                      comfortable on the seat in your retreat cabin,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This is the

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You might remain

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But if you fail

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Later, when you

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Aren’t you just

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And all their

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But those who

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Who take great
                                      pains to discover all the faults of others,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">While failing to
                                      keep proper guard over their own mindstream,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And who are

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Are certain to
                                      bring breakages of samaya upon all their associates,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So rely
                                      constantly on mindfulness, vigilance and
                                      conscientiousness.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">No matter where
                                      you stay—be it a busy place or a solitary retreat—</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The only things
                                      that you need to conquer are mind’s five poisons</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And your own
                                      true enemies, the eight wordly concerns, nothing else,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Whether it is by
                                      avoiding, transforming, taking them as the path or looking into
                                      their very essence,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Whichever method
                                      is best suited to your own capacity.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There’s no

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This is true
                                      victory for the real warrior who carries no weapons.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">When you
                                      practise the teachings of the sutras and tantras,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The altruistic
                                      bodhichitta of aspiration and application is crucial,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Because it lies
                                      at the very root of the Mahayana.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Just to have
                                      this is enough, but without it, all is lost.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">These words of

            <div class='col-md body'><p>On mountaintops, in secluded forests and on islands and the like,<br>Places which are agreeable to the mind and well suited to the season,<br>Cultivate tranquil samadhi, which is single-pointed and unwavering<br>Clear light, which is free from the slightest conceptual elaboration.<br>This is achieved naturally when three pure factors come together:<br>The ideal location, individual and Dharma to be practised. <br><br>First of all, the location must be one that is secluded and agreeable,<br>Somewhere conducive to spiritual practice in the different seasons.<br>In summer, meditate in cooler dwellings and cooler locations,<br>In places near to glaciers or on mountaintops and the like,<br>In simple dwellings made out of reeds, bamboo or straw. <br><br>In the autumn, adjust your diet, your clothing, and your conduct,<br>And stay in a region and residence of moderate temperature,<br>Such as a forest or a mountainside or a building made of stone.<br>In winter, stay somewhere warmer at a lower altitude,<br>Such as a forest, a rocky cave or a hollow in the earth,<br>And adjust your diet, clothing, bedding and the rest. <br><br>In the spring, stay in the mountains or on the edges of a forest,<br>On a deserted island or in buildings with mild and even temperature,<br>With diet, clothing and conduct all suitably attuned this is crucially important.<br>There is an important interconnection between outer and inner,<br>So keep to inspiring and secluded places which you find uplifting. <br><br>High among the mountains the mind becomes clear and expansive,<br>Ideal for refreshing mental dullness and for practising the generation phase. <br>Snowy regions help to make samadhi clear and awareness bright and lucid,<br>So for cultivating vipashyana they make ideal places with the fewest obstacles. <br>Forests bring stillness of mind and help us to develop mental stability,<br>So they are ideal places for cultivating shamatha with a sense of ease. <br><br>Below rocky cliffs we can feel a vivid sense of impermanence and disenchantment,<br>Clear and inspired, helping us to achieve the union of shamatha and vipashyana.<br>On the banks of a river, our attention becomes well focused,<br>And the wish to escape samsara comes rapidly and afresh.<br>Charnel grounds are powerful places for swift accomplishment,<br>Ideal for the generation or completion phases, it is said.<br><br>Villages, markets, empty houses, solitary trees and the like,<br>Which are frequented by humans and non-human demons,<br>Are distracting for beginners and can bring many obstacles,<br>But for stable practitioners, they are a support, regarded as supreme.<br>Temples and shrines, inhabited by gyalpo and gongpo spirits,<br>Can disturb the mind and incite thoughts of anger and aversion. <br><br>Caverns in the earth and such places, haunted by the senmo demonesses,<br>Cause passionate desire to arise and bring excessive dullness and agitation.<br>Solitary trees and other places, which are inhabited by mamos and dakinis,<br>Contribute, it is believed, to mental turmoil and bring all manner of obstacles. <br><br>The lands of outcastes, nagas, nyen, and local spirits,<br>By the lakeside, or in meadows, forests and such places,<br>Adorned with beautiful flowers, plants and trees,<br>Are pleasant enough at first, but later prove disruptive. <br><br>In short, all the areas and dwelling places that seem agreeable at first,<br>But not so once you come to know them, are sites of lesser accomplishment.<br>Whereas those which seem frightening and unpleasant at first,<br>But prove agreeable once you have grown accustomed to them,<br>Are powerfully transformative, bringing great accomplishments without obstacle.<br>And everywhere else in between is neutral, neither beneficial nor harmful.<br>As our minds are affected by the places in which we stay,<br>This can make our practice grow stronger or make it weaker,<br>So it is said that to examine locations is of crucial importance. <br><br>Moreover, there are four types of place based on the four activities:<br>Peaceful places, where mind naturally becomes focused and still,<br>Expansive places, delighting the mind, which are awesome and inspiring,<br>Magnetizing places, where mind feels captivated and develops attachment,<br>And wrathful places, where mind is disturbed by feelings of fear and dread.<br>Further divisions can be made, countless and beyond measure,<br>But in this context, for samadhi, peaceful places are the best,<br>And so, fearing an excess of words, I will elaborate no further. <br><br>In such a peaceful place, the meditation dwelling should be in solitude,<br>As this will suit the development of concentration in the mind.<br>The ideal dwelling is one that is open at the sides and has a clear view.<br>For nighttime yoga, practise inside a circular 'dark house',<br>In a high place, and in the middle of the central chamber,<br>With your pillow to the north, lying down in the posture of nirvana. <br><br>The location for practising the yoga of light during the daytime,<br>Should be mild in temperature and should have an entrance<br>With a broad, unobstructed view onto glaciers, waterfalls, forests or valleys,<br>And the vast and open sky, so that mind becomes clear and bright. <br><br>When cultivating shamatha, a solitary hut surrounded by a fence<br>Is the ideal place for stillness of mind naturally to arise.<br>For vipashyana, it is important to have a clear, inspiring view,<br>And to be constantly cheerful and well attuned to the seasons. <br><br>Low-lying and shaded areas, such as forests and ravines,<br>Are ideal for practising shamatha, whereas higher regions,<br>Such as among snowy mountains, are ideal for vipashyana<br>It is important that you know these different specifications. <br><br>To put it simply, any region or actual dwelling place for retreat<br>In which renunciation and disenchantment arise, attention is well focused,<br>And samadhi grows in strength—any such place of virtuous activity<br>Is said to be the equal of the sacred site of the heart of awakening.<br>Whereas any place in which virtues decline, mental afflictions increase,<br>And one is overcome by distractions and the affairs of this life,<br>Is a demonic haunt of evil actions, only to be avoided by the wise. <br><br>Since these points were taught by Padmasambhava,<br>They should be learned by all who wish for liberation.</p></div>

              <p>I bow down with devotion at the feet of my glorious divine Guru-Lama,
              incomparable in grace, and take refuge. I pray that through his
              blessing I and my disciples may quickly reach the immaculate
              realization of the profound path in the nature of our minds and attain
              the primordial existential citadel in this very lifetime.<br><br> For those fortunate individuals whose deep aspirations and pure karmic
              propensities have now coincided and who have faith in the profound
              Dzogchen teaching and in the teacher who reveals it, this simple
              gateway explanation now put into your hand is the quintessence of
              practice of the most sacred, mystical Dzogchen, being instruction on
              the main points of mountain retreat.<br><br> Apprehend this teaching by
              means of three main topics. The first topic is preparation: how to
              purify the mindstream by cutting clinging attachment and focusing the
              mind on the praxis. The second topic is the main endeavor: how to
              engage in the experiential praxis after eradicating misconceptions and
              doubts about view, meditation and action. The third topic is the stream
              of illuminated existential attainment: how to sustain the samayas and
              keep the vows and thus completely assimilate the karma of this lifetime
              to Dzogchen realization.<br><br> So first a little about the first topic  preparation.<br><br> Oh, the mind! This sad mind with its scintillating highs and depressing
              troughs originates in the here and now with Kuntuzangpo. Kuntuzangpo,
              knowing everything as himself, is free. But we who fail to recognize
              mind's nature are tossed around on the endlessly spinning wheel of life
              where we experience innumerable variations of the six types of bodymind
              syndromes and where our lives have no meaning.<br><br> Now that you
              have attained this outside chance of a human birth you must use it to
              avoid rebirth in the lower realms. If you fail in this you cannot know
              where you will be reborn after death, and no matter which of the six
              kinds of beings is your destiny there will be nothing but suffering.
              And, further, to attain a human body is not enough: the moment of our
              death is uncertain and you must act appropriately in this very moment.
              If you do the right thing now, at the moment of death, you, like
              Milarepa, will feel no shame or regret. Said Milarepa at the moment of
              his death, "My inner life gives me no cause for any self reproach."<br><br> Entering upon this spiritual quest, you should adopt outer,
              conventional, appearances. But more important than that, here and now,
              you must cut all attachment to the desirable qualities of fashion and
              show, and the mundane imperatives of existence. If the mind is not
              completely turned around and you once enter the gate of commitment with
              a loose compromising mind there will be residual attachment to
              homeland, wealth and property, family and friends, and so on. In this
              case the propensity for attachment as the primary cause and objects of
              attachment as circumstantial conditions will coincide to create
              pernicious obstacles. Then, again involved with the ordinary mundane
              world, you will backslide and regress.<br><br> So you must do what you
              can to deflate the importance of food, clothes, social interaction, and
              so on, and detaching yourselves from the eight mundane obsessions --
              loss and gain, pleasure and pain, anonymity and fame, praise and blame
              -- you must direct the mind one-pointedly to the inner objective.<br><br> You must follow the example of Gyelwa Yangonpa who said: "In the
              solitary place called Knowledge of Death / The hermit Disgusted with
              Attachment / Drew the mystic circle by abandoning all concern for this
              life / And excluded the visitors Eight Mundane Obsessions." If you have
              not achieved such detachment your inner life will be corrupted by these
              obsessions which are as poisonous as tainted food.<br><br> The eight
              mundane obsessions may be reduced to hope and fear, which arise from
              attachment and aversion. Internal attachment and aversion take on the
              outer appearance of the demons Gyelpo and Senmo and so long as you are
              bound by attachment and aversion you are plagued by Gyelpo and Senmo
              and obstacles will not cease.<br><br> So are there any residual
              conceits temporal and mundane obsessions lurking in the pit of your
              mind? Examine your mind repeatedly and concentrate on exterminating
              them. Harboring such ambitions while making the pretense of a spiritual
              life in order to make a living is gross hypocrisy and wrong livelihood.<br><br> "Abandoning your homeland is half of the quest!" is an ancient axiom.
              Put your home behind you and take to the road in unknown countries.
              Take cordial leave of your family and friends but ignore their attempts
              to dissuade you from your purpose. Give away your possessions and
              depend on whatever you receive as alms. Regard the desirable things of
              this life as stubborn obstacles produced by bad habits and cultivate a
              renunciate mindset. If in your attitude to possessions you fail to
              understand that a little is enough, when dissatisfaction with what you
              have arises it is easy for the consumerist demon to slip in.<br><br> Whatever people might say, good or bad, refraining from denial or
              affirmation, without attaching hopes or fears to it, don't believe it,
              and cultivate disinterest. Let them say whatever they like, as if they
              were talking about someone dead and buried. Only a real teacher -- and
              that excludes your parents -- can tell you what to do. So keep your
              independence and don't let anyone lead you by the nose.<br><br> We
              should always be well disposed and good natured and know how to relate
              harmoniously with people without putting anyone's nose out of joint.
              But when it comes down to the nitty gritty and someone no matter who it
              is tries to disturb our sadhana, be intractable, immovable, like an
              iron boulder pulled by a silk scarf. Don't be too easily moved and
              pliable, bending where the wind blows like grass on a mountain pass.<br><br> Whatever your sadhana may be, after vowing to complete it sustain it at
              any cost, even though your life be at issue though thunderbolts fall
              from the heavens, floods issue from the earth below, and landslides
              rain around you, persevere to the end. To that purpose, from the start,
              gradually establish a strict schedule of meditation periods, meals,
              breaks and sleep, precluding bad habits creeping in. Your practice may
              be elaborate ritual or formless meditation, but don't leave it
              undisciplined so that you have time to waste; rather, pace yourself
              evenly.<br><br> When going into retreat, the hermitage door should be
              sealed with mud. Failing this, don't relate to anyone, don't speak to
              anyone, and don't spy. Spurning the wanderings of the restless mind,
              expel stale breath, and assuming a good body posture let the mind relax
              into an all pervasive presence without so much as a fingersnap of
              distraction like a tent peg in solid ground. A strict retreat in those
              outer, inner and secret dimensions will quickly produce the signs and
              qualities that are evidence of attainment.<br><br> If something of
              importance comes up and you weaken and relent and you meet someone and
              even talk with him, thinking, "After this I shall be more strict!" you
              will lose the turga of the retreat and become looser and looser. On the
              other hand, if you resolve right from the beginning to keep your seat
              and make no exceptions, your retreat will become increasingly
              disciplined and your sadhana will not be plagued by obstacles.<br><br> There are many different recommendations to guide you to your actual
              place of retreat, but in general it should be somewhere blessed by a
              supreme master such as Guru Rimpoche and it should not be a place in
              the hands of people with beliefs antagonistic to your own. It should be
              an utterly solitary place where you feel completely at ease and where
              practicalities are no problem. If you possess the capacity and strength
              to spontaneously resolve outer appearances and inner susceptibilities
              in cremation grounds, cemeteries and other wild places of negative
              energy where malignant spirits and demons abide, your meditation will
              be greatly inspired and swiftly fulfilled; if you lack that capacity
              then all sorts of obstacles will arise in such places. When realization
              is identical to the here and now all difficult situations appear as
              positive reinforcement and it is most beneficial at that time to do
              secret yogas in places like cremation grounds and graveyards. The real
              solitary place, though, is the space of nonaction after our mindflow
              has become free of all self indulgent inner and outer games.<br><br> As
              to the actual process of purification: this consists of the ordinary
              training in the four mind changes and the extraordinary training in
              refuge, aspiration, confession, and offering meditation according to
              the oral instruction persevere in this until the benefits are palpable.
              Thereafter make Guru Yoga the mainstay of the training and work with
              that. Without these foundation practices meditation will be sluggish
              and even as it deepens it will be fraught with obstacles.<br><br> While
              pure realization is still not the pervasive element in our being pray
              with fervent heartfelt devotion and soon, through the transference of
              the heart-mind realization of the Lama, a wonderful inexpressible
              realization will spontaneously erupt within. Lama Shang Rimpoche said,
              "To find peace, to have mystic experiences, to attain profound
              absorption, and so on, these are common experiences. Much more precious
              is the realization born from within through the blessings of the Lama
              which arise out of fervent devotion."<br><br>The reality of Dzogchen
              suffusing the mind is directly dependant upon the preparation. That is
              why Je Drigung said, "Some traditions emphasize the main endeavor; our
              tradition stresses the preliminaries."</p>

how rare and precious<br>this human existence is. To spur our endeavour we reflected upon<br>impermanence. To increase our mindfulness we reflected on the way<br>actions lead to their results. Finally, we saw how the ordinary condition of<br>samsara is never beyond suffering and, realising the unchanging benefit of<br>liberation, we understood the need to find and rely upon a spiritual<br>teacher. Then we continued with the main part of the preliminary practice,<br>first crossing the threshold of the Buddhadharma by taking refuge in the<br>Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. After that, we developed bodhichitta, the<br>wish to attain enlightenment for the sake of others, which is the root of the<br>Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas. Now, as we enter the Vajrayana, we come to<br>the meditation and recitation on Vajrasattva (in Tibetan, Dorje Sempa), the<br>purpose of which is to remove hindrances on the path to enlightenment.<br>These hindrances are the obscurations and negative actions we have<br>accumulated in the past.<br><br>Vajrasattva is the sovereign lord of all the mandalas of the Vajrayana, or<br>Diamond Vehicle. To meditate on Vajrasattva is the same as to meditate<br>upon all the Buddhas. His hundred-syllable mantra is the quintessence of<br>all mantras.<br><br>The main obstacles to progress along the path to enlightenment are the<br>obscurations that come from our past negative actions. There are various<br>kinds of negative actions. Some, like killing, stealing, lying or cheating are<br>obviously intrinsically unvirtuous. Others are transgressions of vows and<br>precepts that the Buddha or one's teachers have taught to help one progress<br>spiritually.<br><br>The main purpose of Vajrasattva practice is to purify these obscurations. It<br>is said, "The only virtue of sin is that it can be purified." In fact, there is<br>nothing that cannot be purified, even the most apparently heinous deed.<br><br>The Four Powers<br>In order to purify negative actions completely, one needs four powers or<br>strengths: the power of support, the power of regret, the power of the<br>antidote, and the power of resolution.<br><br>Purification requires a support for us to express our remorse, make our<br>confession and repair the effects of our past negative actions. In this case,<br>the support is Vajrasattva. Visualise him above your head, utterly peaceful<br>and smiling, brilliant white like a dazzling snow mountain illuminated by<br>the rays of a hundred thousand suns. He is sitting in full vajra posture, upon<br>a thousand-petalled white lotus and a moon disc. In his right hand he holds<br>a golden vajra at his heart centre, and in his left, a silver bell resting on his<br>hip. Vajrasattva is wearing the thirteen Sambhogakaya adornments - the<br>five silken garments and the eight jewelled ornaments. He is in union with<br>his consort, Vajratopa,'° who holds a curved knife in her right hand and, in<br>her left, a skull cup filled with amrita, the nectar of immortality. Visualise<br>Vajrasattva not as someone made of flesh and blood, but like a rainbow in<br>the sky, vivid yet empty. Unlike a rainbow, on the other hand, he is not<br>simply something perceived physically, for he is pervaded with the<br>wisdom and compassion of all the Buddhas. Think of him as your kind root<br>teacher, appearing in the form of Vajrasattva.<br><br>The second power is the power of deep, intense remorse for one's past<br>actions. If you had swallowed a virulent poison without realising it, you<br>would certainly feel desperate when you found out you were going to die.<br>Similarly, up to now you have not been aware of the devastating power<br>that has accumulated from the negative actions you have committed<br>throughout many past lives. Today, realising that these negative actions are<br>the very cause of your wandering in samsara and of all your suffering, you<br>feel a strong regret at having acted so carelessly. If you did not feel this<br>regret, you would simply continue to accumulate negative actions and<br>perpetuate your suffering. But now you realise that you need to purify<br>yourself, so you turn to Vajrasattva to request the means to do so.<br>Why is it Vajrasattva that we choose for this purification? When he vowed<br>to achieve enlightenment for the sake of all beings, he made this wish:<br>"When I become a fully enlightened Buddha, may all beings be purified of<br>their obscurations, their ignorance and their negative actions simply by<br>hearing my name, seeing my form, thinking of me, or reciting the mantra<br>that contains my name."<br><br>Regret alone is not enough: we have to put into action the means for<br>purifying ourselves. This is done through the power of the antidote. Direct<br>your whole mind towards Vajrasattva, confident that, since he is the<br>all-encompassing sovereign of all mandalas, the union of all the Buddhas,<br>he has the power to purify your obscurations. Visualise Vajrasattva above<br>your head as previously described, with a moon disc in his heart centre,<br>upon which is a white letter HUNG surrounded by the hundred-syllable<br>mantra. Recite:<br><br>Ah! On the crown of my head, on a lotus and moon,<br>Sits Guru Vajrasattva in union with his consort.<br>From the mantra in his heart falls a stream of nectar,<br>Which purifies illness, harmful influences, negative actions and<br>defilements.<br><br>Then recite the hundred-syllable mantra as many times as you can.<br>While reciting, generate strong devotion towards Vajrasattva, thinking,<br>"Because of my past actions in this life and in all my previous lives, I am<br>in this miserable situation in samsara. Grant your blessings now so that I<br>can purify myself, or I will continue to circle in samsara forever."<br>This fervent supplication, offered with hands folded and tears of devotion<br>in your eyes, invokes the wisdom mind of Vajrasattva to purify your<br>negative actions. By the force of your prayer, from the letter HUNG in<br>Vajrasattva's heart, luminous nectar starts to flow, containing all his<br>wisdom, loving-kindness and power. This nectar completely fills the<br>bodies of Vajrasattva and his consort and flows out from the point of their<br>union, from their toes and from all the pores of their bodies into the<br>thousand-petalled lotus upon which Vajrasattva is sitting above the crown<br>of your head, and down through its stem, the end of which penetrates the<br>opening in the top of your head, the Brahma aperture. Through this aperture<br>the nectar descends and fills your body, completely washing away all your<br>obscurations and impurities, which pour forth from all the pores and<br>apertures of your body. Your illnesses come out in the form of pus and<br>blood, negative influences in the form of insects, scorpions, and snakes,<br>and mental obscurations as dark, smoky liquid. The cleansing stream of<br>nectar is so powerful that it washes away all your obscurations like a river<br>in flood carrying away all the trees and rocks in a valley. As these<br>obscurations flow out of your body, the earth below you opens, down to<br>seven levels below the surface. There, in the form of a red bull with mouth<br>gaping open, is Yama, the Lord of Death. The dirty liquid enters his mouth,<br>and, as he swallows it, turns into nectar. Now all your karmic debts, your<br>past actions, have been totally purified and transformed into wisdom.<br>Similarly, not only is your body purified, but even the ordinary aggregates<br>and elements - your flesh, blood, bones and skin - are no longer gross<br>material substances; they become transparent, as if made of light. You are<br>completely clear and luminous inside and out. Then you consider that this<br>red bull, and all those to whom you have past karmic debts, are completely<br>satisfied. The earth beneath you closes again and you are completely<br>purified, your body pure and transparent like crystal.<br><br>The amrita from Vajrasattva still continues to flow down, progressively<br>filling your body. As it fills your head, you receive the blessings of<br>Vajrasattva's body, and all the negative actions you have committed<br>physically, such as killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, are purified;<br>you receive the vase initiation and the seed is planted for realising the<br>Nirmanakaya, the manifested body of the Buddhas. When the nectar<br>reaches your throat, you receive the blessings of Vajrasattva's speech, and<br>all the negative actions you have committed verbally, such as lies, idle<br>chatter, slander, and harsh words, are purified; you receive the secret<br>initiation and the seed is planted for realising the Sambhogakaya, the body<br>of perfect enjoyment. Then, as the nectar flows down to your heart level,<br>you receive the blessings of Vajrasattva's mind, and all your negative<br>thoughts, such as animosity, envy, and false views are purified; you<br>receive the third empowerment, the wisdom initiation, and the seed is<br>planted for realising the Dharmakaya, the absolute body. Finally, as the<br>nectar reaches your navel centre, throughout your body you receive the<br>fourth initiation, the initiation of word, which indicates the absolute nature;<br>all the subtle defilements of body, speech and mind are purified, you<br>receive the blessing of the adamantine wisdom of Vajrasattva, and the seed<br>is planted for realising the Vajrakaya, the unchanging adamantine body of<br>all the Buddhas.<br><br>After this, conclude by reciting the supplication to Vajrasattva:<br><br>Protector, I have been ignorant and foolish, and I have broken and<br>spoiled the samaya. Guru and protector, be my refuge! Sublime Vajra<br>Holder, embodiment of great compassion, supreme among beings, I take<br>refuge in you. I repent and confess all deteriorations, breaches, faults<br>and downfalls of the root and branch samayas related to body, speech<br>and mind. Cleanse and purify all negative actions, obscurations and<br>habitual tendencies.<br><br>As soon as you have said this, think that not only your own defilements and<br>obscurations, but also those of all beings, are completely purified. Imagine<br>that Vajrasattva is pleased by your supplication. He smiles and says,<br>"Noble child, you are now purified of all obscurations." After that say:<br><br>Vajrasattva melts into light and dissolves into me.<br><br>The moment Vajrasattva dissolves into you, you no longer have your<br>ordinary form, but become Vajrasattva, united with his wisdom consort. In<br>your heart centre is a white moon disc, upon which there<br>is a blue letter HUNG surrounded by the six-syllable mantra, OM VAJRA<br>SATVA HUNG, pronounced om benzar sato hung in Tibetan). In front,<br>which should be thought of as being to the east, is the white syllable OM;<br>on the right, to the south, are the yellow syllables VAJRA; behind, to the<br>west, is the red syllable SA; on your left, to the north, is the green syllable<br>TVA.<br><br>From the HUNG, and from the syllables of the mantra, boundless rays of<br>multicoloured light emanate to the Buddhafields of the ten directions,<br>making infinite offerings to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Think that the<br>Buddhas, having accepted your offerings, send back their blessings, all<br>their wisdom, loving-kindness and power, in the form of rays of light<br>which dissolve into you. Like a lotus bud opening as the rays of the sun<br>touch it, Vajrasattva becomes even more brilliant and perfect.<br>Then visualise that from your whole body and from the syllables of the<br>mantra, boundless rays of light emanate, filling the whole universe around<br>you. The universe is now no longer an ordinary, impure place, but the<br>perfect Buddhafield of Vajrasattva, the Buddhafield of Pure Joy. The<br>sentient beings in it are also no longer ordinary: all the males have the<br>form and nature of Vajrasattva, and all the females the form and nature of<br>Vajratopa, his wisdom consort. To the east all beings become white<br>Vajrasattvas and Vajratopas of the Vajra or Diamond family; to the south<br>they become yellow Vajrasattvas and Vajratopas of the Ratna or Jewel<br>family; to the west, they become red Vajrasattvas and Vajratopas of the<br>Padma or Lotus family; to the north they become green Vajrasattvas and<br>Vajratopas of the Karma or Action family; and in the centre, they become<br>blue Vajrasattvas and Vajratopas of the Tathagata or Buddha family. All<br>these beings are continuously reciting the hundred-syllable mantra, the<br>sound of which fills the whole of space.<br><br>In this way, appearances, sounds and thoughts are no longer ordinary, but<br>appear as the sheer display of wisdom. The external world is a<br>Buddhafield and the beings in it are manifestations of Vajrasattva and<br>Vajratopa, all sounds are the resonance of mantra and all thoughts are the<br>spontaneous display of bliss-emptiness.<br><br>Now recite the six-syllable mantra as many times as you can. At the end of<br>the session, the whole outer universe together with the beings in it, starting<br>from the periphery, dissolves into you as Vajrasattva and consort. Then the<br>consort dissolves into Vajrasattva; Vajrasattva melts into light and<br>dissolves into the mantra in your heart centre. The syllables of the mantra<br>dissolve into each other one by one, and then into the central letter HUNG.<br>The HUNG, starting from the bottom, dissolves upward, melting into light,<br>until finally it vanishes like a rainbow in the sky, leaving only the vast<br>expanse of luminous emptiness. Sit for a while, simply remaining in that<br>state of utter simplicity, free from all concepts and clinging. It is the innate<br>wisdom, the immutable mode of being, the true face of the absolute<br>Vajrasattva.<br><br>After a while, when you start to come out of this meditation and thoughts<br>again arise in your mind, you should think that all outer appearances are a<br>Buddhafield, all beings are deities, all sounds are mantras, and all thoughts<br>are wisdom. As the mirror of your mind has been wiped clean through the<br>practice of Vajrasattva, all phenomena are dearly reflected in it according<br>to their true nature.<br><br>In order to make your purification last, you now need to apply the fourth<br>power, the power of resolution. This means to have the unwavering<br>determination that even if it costs you your life you will not revert to<br>negative action, which, as we now know, causes all our suffering and<br>keeps us circling in samsara.<br><br>Conclude by wholeheartedly dedicating the merit of this practice for the<br>sake of all beings, saying, "By this merit, may all sentient beings swiftly<br>achieve the level of Vajrasattva himself," and offering all the benefits from<br>this practice completely to all beings. You should not think that the merit is<br>divided up among them, but that each and every being receives all the<br>merit in its entirety. When dedicating the merit, however, you should<br>remain free of clinging and concepts, mindful that in absolute truth there is<br>no one who dedicates, no object of dedication and no act of dedicating.<br>The hundred-syllable mantra has to be recited a hundred thousand times,<br>and the six-syllable mantra six hundred thousand times. Until you have<br>completed the number of recitations of the hundred-syllable mantra, spend<br>most of each practice session on that, and then recite the shorter mantra a<br>few times at the end. Once you have completed the hundred thousand<br>recitations of the hundred-syllable mantra, recite it just a few times at the<br>beginning of each session and then concentrate on the recitation of the<br>shorter mantra.<br><br>We should remember that meditating upon Vajrasattva is the same as<br>meditating upon all the Buddhas. To achieve the realisation of Vajrasattva<br>is to achieve the qualities of all the Buddhas. Moreover, the mantra of<br>Vajrasattva, the hundred-syllable mantra, is the hundred peaceful and<br>wrathful deities in the form of sound; it embodies all the wisdom and<br>power of Vajrasattva himself. If you recite the hundred-syllable mantra<br>twenty-one times every day, concentrating completely on the visualisation<br>of the nectar pouring down and the purification, no breaches of vow or<br>samaya and no obscurations will be left unpurified. If you recite the<br>hundred-syllable mantra one hundred times without distraction, you can<br>even purify a "crime with immediate retribution" quite easily. If you do<br>this practice, all the Buddhas will think of you as their own child, and<br>everything that obstructs your spiritual experience and ultimate realisation<br>will be dispelled.</p></div>
