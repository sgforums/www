All planes in the sensuous plane will have gender. Those in the jhana planes however, do not have gender.<br><br><blockquote>what determines gender of some1 nt liberated from samsara ?</blockquote>I am not sure. Karma probably, and biological factors.<br><br><blockquote>is there sexual equality in gaining enlightenment ?</blockquote>Yes. There are countless bodhisattvas and arhats since Buddha's times, who are female. In modern times I have seen many enlightened female practitioners and teachers who are female. My local dharma teacher is also female.<br><br>Everyone has a Buddha nature that is already complete, and our Buddha nature cannot be discriminated as male or female. It has no name, no gender, race, class, etc and all the concepts that we identify with. Everyone is equal in their Buddha Nature.<br><br><a href="http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/hui_neng1.html" rel="nofollow">Platform Sutra</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>...I then went to pay homage to the Patriarch, and was asked where I came from and what I expected to get from him. I replied, "I am a commoner from Hsin Chou of Kwangtung. I have travelled far to pay you respect and I ask for nothing but Buddhahood." "You are a native of Kwangtung, a barbarian? How can you expect to be a Buddha?" asked the Patriarch. I replied, "Although there are northern men and southern men, north and south make no difference to their Buddha-nature. A barbarian is different from Your Holiness physically, but there is no difference in our Buddha-nature." He was going to speak further to me, but the presence of other disciples made him stop short. He then ordered me to join the crowd to work.<br><br>"May I tell Your Holiness," said I, "that Prajna (transcendental Wisdom) often rises in my mind. When one does not go astray from one's own Essence of Mind, one may be called the 'field of merits'.<br><br>I do not know what work Your Holiness would ask me to do." "This barbarian is too bright," he remarked. "Go to the stable and speak no more." I then withdrew myself to the back yard and was told by a lay brother to split firewood and to pound rice...</strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just guessing... what if it's the opposite attraction?<br>ie: when mind unwittingly "attracted to yang" then the rebirth is female and vice versa.<br>besides, the parents' generic and biological factors perform a significant part as well and with the infusion of the former perhaps in some cases result in people with special interest in the same sex gender ie: lesbian or homosexual.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br></div>
