              <p>thanks yjhow for the info.</p>
              <p>As a buddhist, i have tried to minimize the invasion of ants, cockroaches, lizards in my house by cleaning up all bits and crumbles so that ants will not come and stay and by making sure my kitchen is neat and clean. Yet some will still come , so i think this gadget may solve my problems of no killing too.</p>

              <p>I've done some online research on "fixed karma" especially on the worst 5 evils at Chinese Wikipedia: http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%94%E9%80%86%E7%BD%AA</p>
              <p>According to Pureland Buddhism (å‡€åœŸæ³•é—¨ï¼‰, under the sutra of ç„¡é‡�å£½ç¶“ (sutra of
                           immeasurable longetivity), under Amitabha buddha's 48 vows, the number 
                          18 vows (å��å¿µå¿…ç”Ÿ- 10 chanting will initiate rebirth into pureland) had an exclusive saying.</p>
              <p>å”¯é™¤<a class="mw-redirect" title="äº”é€†" href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%94%E9%80%86">äº”é€†</a>ã€‚èª¹è¬—æ­£æ³• (Apart from committing 5 worst evils and slandering Buddhism). i.e. apart from committing 5 worst evils and slandering Buddhism, it is possible to be reborn into Amitabha's Pureland.</p>
              <p>The 18th vow is as follow:</p>
              <p>æˆ‘ä½œä½›æ™‚ã€‚å��æ–¹çœ¾ç”Ÿã€‚è�žæˆ‘å��è™Ÿã€‚è‡³å¿ƒä¿¡æ¨‚ã€‚æ‰€æœ‰å–„æ ¹ã€‚å¿ƒå¿ƒå›žå�‘ã€‚é¡˜ç”Ÿæˆ‘åœ‹ã€‚ä¹ƒè‡³å��å¿µã€‚è‹¥ä¸�ç”Ÿè€…ã€‚ä¸�å�–æ­£è¦ºã€‚å”¯é™¤äº”é€†ã€‚èª¹è¬—æ­£æ³•ã€‚</p>
              <p>(When I become a buddha, all sentient beings, when they listen to my Buddha name, feel happy and rejoiceful. They will realize all goods.They all wants to be reborn into my pureland. Upon 10 chanting of my name, if one is not reborn, I will not realize Buddhahood. The only exception is 5 worst evils and slandering the right dharma)</p>
              <p>However, in the  ä½›èªªè§€ç„¡é‡�å£½ä½›ç¶“ (Buddha talks about observing immeasurable longetivity Buddha sutra), there was a written scripture:</p>
              <p>å�³ä½¿é€ äº”é€†ç½ªä¹Ÿèƒ½å¾€ç”Ÿï¼Œåƒ…èª¹è¬—æ­£æ³•ä¸�å¾—å¾€ç”Ÿã€‚</p>
              <p>(even if one commits the 5 worst evils, only those who slander buddhism will not be reborn).</p>
              <p>There are true buddhist story of Ajatashatru é˜¿é—�ä¸–çŽ‹ (disciples of Buddha) killing his parents, attempted murder of Shayamuni Buddha by Devadatta æ��å©†é�”å¤š and spoiling of the sangha community. I check some texts saying they are reborn into realm of hell. But Pureland buddhist texts says they have repented and have been reborn into pureland.</p>
              <p>Venerable Jinkong æ·¨ç©ºæ³•å¸« (a high buddhist monk from Taiwan) 's explanation is that those who cannot be reborn into pureland are those who slander buddhism or the right dharma because they refuse to believe, cannot accept, do not wish to reborn into the pureland. That was the greatest obstacle they have.</p>
              <p>In any case, just follow the true buddhist teaching.</p>
              <p>Do good</p>
              <p>Avoid Evil</p>
              <p>Purify your mind</p>
              <p>Amongst the worst evil, killing carries the worst karma. So avoid killing at all costs.</p>

              <p>In a certain way, slandering Buddhism is sometimes equal to disbelief, mocking and thus slandering Buddha's noble 8 foldpath. Slandering noble 8 foldpath means rejecting the entire buddha's basic teaching on path towards enlightenment. Even if Buddha shows you the way towards self-liberation, if you do not walk the way, it's as useless as it is. You won't be able to realize enlightenment, which is the goal of all buddhist.</p>

This is because Ä�layavijñÄ�na consciousness  é˜¿è³´è€¶è­˜ has already recorded through the eyes (visual consciousness çœ¼è­˜) the image of the porn. The 6th mano consciousness æ„�è­˜ creates the sexual thoughts and cravings. The 7th manas consciousness æœ«é‚£è­˜ then transmits this consciousness to the 8th Ä�layavijñÄ�na consciousness  é˜¿è³´è€¶è­˜ (storage consciousness) where it is stored as an evil karmic seed (or imprint in our mind). When the right conditions (timing, chances) occur, an "event/happenings" will occur, causes someone to commit a sexual misconduct such as masturbation or even buying sex. This evil act of sexual misconduct will be further recorded as a karmic imprint in the 8th Ä�layavijñÄ�na consciousness  é˜¿è³´è€¶è­˜ .<br><br>These 8 consciousness influences our behavior, mental mind and our thoughts. When one commits lots of evil, the 8th Ä�layavijñÄ�na consciousness  é˜¿è³´è€¶è­˜ is filled with lots of evil karmic seeds. This will continue to accumulate causing one to continue to commit evils and with the right causes and conditions, it returns to the person as an evil effect (æƒ¡æžœ), causing further sufferings. On the contrary, if one do lots of good, the 8th Ä�layavijñÄ�na consciousness  é˜¿è³´è€¶è­˜ is filled with lots of good karmic seeds. This will continue to accumulate causing one to continue to do good and with the right causes and conditions, it returns to the person as an good effect (å–„æžœ), causing more happiness.</p>

              <p>Things don't happen on its own without causes and conditions. Karma is not really a matter of blind faith or belief. Things do happen due to our own intention (guided by our karma), creating a cause and under the right conditions, a certain happening will occur and can be testifiable in our daily life.</p>
              <p>Karma is verifiable and can be testifiable in our daily life. I've encountered people with suffering and ask what they have done in the past. I was in China for a "beggar festival" partly to do some generosity work to give the 'beggars' some money and alms. A beggar I met was disabled with his hand being cut off. I asked what what he has done to cause his hand being cut off by. He replied he had been engaging in fishing for a long time and his hand got caught up in the fishing boat's engine. His hand was then ripped off. In buddhism, one should not fish or hunt, as that constitute killing. His very negative act caused his hand to be cut off. His fishing act left him a negative karmic imprint in his mind, and under the causes (i.e. fishing) and conditions (his hand got caught up in fishing boat's engine), such negative happenings will return upon him (his hand got cut off). Those fishes who had also been hunted and killed are also full of pain and hatred. Their mind sought to seek revenge on the fisherman and thus will do negative things to the fisherman to seek vengence on him. Hatred is the root of evil. It causes suffering. Unfortunately, this man does not know buddhism and ignorance blinds him, and he does not know what causes his own suffering.</p>
              <p>I also once read a newspaper article from Malaysia about a man who got killed by his own gun at home. According to this newspaper, this man had been engaging in hunting birds in his present life time. According to the newspaper report, he was sitting in his living room. The gun suddenly goes off "accidentally" and kills him. His killing act (by hunting bird) causes the killing to return back to him. In karma, we talk about minds full of hatred. The birds who got killed sought revenge on the man who hunted him. Inevitably, it caused this man to be killed by the very gun that he used to kill other birds. The negative action returns back to him.</p>
              <p>A divorce family (broken family) does not happen without causes and conditions, and does not happen without negative karma. Usually the negative karma is sexual misconduct such as adultery (sex outside marriage) or extra-marital affairs. A disloyal husband's very act of fooling around outside with other woman lefts a negative karmic imprint in his mind. This negative karma further influences his own behaviour, such as late hours at night, and excuses to work outside. He began to dislike his own wife and starts to quarrel with him. His wife began to suspect he is having affairs outside. Under the right causes and conditons (such as hiring a private detective outside), the wife will find out about this man's unfaithful adultery. This further lead to quarrels and then divorce effect. The man's negative karma (such as sexual misconduct) returns back to the man (ending up as a suffering in the form of broken family/divorce).</p>
              <p>There are countless of further examples of verifiable karma if you looks at tabloid news.</p>
              <p>A person who engages in stealing usually ends up being caught and jailed. His very negative act of stealing (bad karma) returns upon back to him as a negative suffering (criminal offence and jailing).</p>
              <p>A person who is bounded by greed and engage in gambling addiction left the person in great debt. He resorted to stealing to pay off his debt but ended in jail. His own negative act of greed (gambling) returns upon back to him as a negative suffering (poverty in the form of great debt, and jail sentence). Greed leads to poverty. This is moral law of karma.</p>
              <p>A girl who engages in business of selling sex toys (a negative karma of sexual misconduct) ended up with his boyfriend calling her a "slut" and lead to them being broken up. Her negative karma (of sexual misconduct) returns back upon to her (with sufferings such as being called a 'slut' and broken relationship). </p>
              <p>You do good. You reap good. You do evil. You reap evil. This is the moral law of karma.</p>

              happen due to our own intention (guided by our karma), creating a
              cause and under the right conditions, a certain happening will
              occur and can be testifiable in our daily life.</p>

              <p>Don't put words in my mouth when you have not grasped what i meant or are unable to. When I said that i take a neutral stand, i meant that i leave it aside and neither am i accepting nor rejecting karma. However, if u ask me to accept karma wholesale, i have to say no. karma and its resulting effects are not verifiable by myself right now.</p>

              <p>Karma is verifiable and can be testifiable in our daily life.
              I've encountered people with suffering and ask what they have done
              in the past. I was in China for a "beggar festival" partly to do
              some generosity work to give the 'beggars' some money and alms. A
              beggar I met was disabled with his hand being cut off. I asked what
              what he has done to cause his hand being cut off by. He replied he
              had been engaging in fishing for a long time and his hand got
              caught up in the fishing boat's engine. His hand was then ripped
              off. In buddhism, one should not fish or hunt, as that constitute
              killing. His very negative act caused his hand to be cut off. His
              fishing act left him a negative karmic imprint in his mind, and
              under the causes (i.e. fishing) and conditions (his hand got caught
              up in fishing boat's engine), such negative happenings will return
              upon him (his hand got cut off). Those fishes who had also been
              hunted and killed are also full of pain and hatred. Their mind
              sought to seek revenge on the fisherman and thus will do negative
              things to the fisherman to seek vengence on him. Hatred is the root
              of evil. It causes suffering. Unfortunately, this man does not know
              buddhism and ignorance blinds him, and he does not know what causes
              his own suffering.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Still, that doesn't convince me of anything. I also have heard stories like that but like i said before, none of us knows for sure the cause and effect. u can say yes the harm done to those animals have caused suffering to the fisherman and blahblah. but still, just speculation at best. </p>

              <p>A divorce family (broken family) does not happen without causes
              and conditions, and does not happen without negative karma. Usually
              the negative karma is sexual misconduct such as adultery (sex
              outside marriage) or extra-marital affairs. A disloyal husband's
              very act of fooling around outside with other woman lefts a
              negative karmic imprint in his mind. This negative karma further
              influences his own behaviour, such as late hours at night, and
              excuses to work outside. He began to dislike his own wife and
              starts to quarrel with him. His wife began to suspect he is having
              affairs outside. Under the right causes and conditons (such as
              hiring a private detective outside), the wife will find out about
              this man's unfaithful adultery. This further lead to quarrels and
              then divorce effect. The man's negative karma (such as sexual
              misconduct) returns back to the man (ending up as a suffering in
              the form of broken family/divorce).</p>

              <p>haha. you had to use 'karma' to explain these things? you can tell a primary school kid to study hard for his exam and if he gets good marks for it, he is able to see why. </p>
              <p>there's no need to talk about basic verifiable cause-and-effect relationship. u hold an orange in your hand, let go and it falls due to gravity. you think this is what i'm talking about? forget it.</p>

              <p>Yes, I'm saying the truth and not attacking. I can confidently say that if a person is not a true Buddhist and listen to dharma talks, he will never know what is real good and what is real bad. Buddha is the only wise and enlightened one on earth who knows what is real good and real bad. Most of us are not enlightened and we always use the wrong judgement on what is good and bad.</p>
              <p>If you still insist that you know better than Buddha, then carry on and I'll tell you the path to hell is always paved with "good intentions". Our definition of "good " is very far off from Buddha's definition of good.</p>

              <p>Buddhism generally advocates no killing of any visible sentient beings. That includes harmful pests, venomous snakes, fierce beasts such as lions, tigers etc.</p>
              <p>The Buddha once talked about endless 
                  lives in this world and other worlds. He pointed to a cup of water and 
                  said that there were eighty four thousand lives in the water (84,000 
                  signifies a large quantity). Today, scientifically, we have understood that the cups of water has millions of mico living organisms under a microscope.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">An often perplexing question posted to many buddhist venerables (dharma teacher) is that if we cook or drink the water, wouldn't buddhist be killing the micro-organism (i.e. sentient beings)? Also, certain medicine today kills bacteria to treat diseases. However, it is understood that some of these micro-organism or bacteria do not have any minds. The Buddha has forbidden his disciples (arhat) to use their supernatural (psychic) power to see these micro-organism and thus drinking these water is actually allowed. Thus, as long as the sentient beings cannot be seen with normal naked eyes, we can assume that it's ok to drink the water. Buddhism only discourages killing any sentient beings that can be seen with normal naked eyes.</p>
