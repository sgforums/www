              <p>I'm glad you see Buddha's teachings. There is this story which I don't remember the exact story. There was this person who asked Buddha or Bodhisattva (can't remember exactly who) he asked Buddha why whenever animals saw him, the animals would run as if they were running for their life whereas animals would not run when they saw Buddha. Buddha said it was because the animals could sense who were the ones cultivate no killings and they felt no harm so they would not run away. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>This is a true story. It happened in the village where I was staying when I was young. There was this relative who was "skilful" in killing chickens and ducks. Neighbours would come and ask for her help and praised her for being helpful in helping them to kill chickens. Ignorantly she thought she was being helpful and doing good deeds by helping the neighbours to kill the chickens and ducks. Her "good intentions" had actually advanced her early passing at the age of early forties. It is a long story if I want to explain why I said so. So, I'll just cut the story short. Buddha said if one wish to live a long healthy life, one should refrain from killings especially for those already with some illnesses.</p></div>
