              <p>I just bought an electronic pest repeller 2 days ago and it has been effective in repelling all pests (ants, cockroaches, lizards, mosquitos, flies etc.) at home. In fact, it uses ultrasonic sound wave that creates a noisy sound that irritates the insects and invite them to leave your home (it does not kill them). The sound wave does not affect human beings or pets at home.</p>
              <p>I'm glad to find such product at a electrical appliance shop as it can prevent my family member from killing at home. I've been practising no killing at home for quite sometime. But still, it might seem "irritating" to find insects at your home (esp. when you find so many ants on table and you have to 'clean them up'. In some cases, one might have fear (irritation) when one find a cockroach on your bed. In some cases, we have resorted to killing them. This creates bad karma. Killing creates heavy bad karma act and the results would normally be a reduction in your lifespan (you have to pay for it). Buddhism has taught us to practise compassion and avoid any form of killing.</p>
              <p>Now, I would advise all buddhist to get an electronic pest repeller at home. It repels away all pest at home, keep your home clean and furthermore, you will be able to practise no killing. It's a way in which we can practise buddhism in our daily life.</p>

              <p>Please have some form of scientific knowledge. The Buddha says one must not have any form of ignorance. Right view and right thoughts are the key to wisdom.</p>
              <p>Ultrasounds are used in the medical field esp. in medical sonography used as a form of medical imaging to visualize muscles, tendons. It's used to visualize foetuses in pregnant lady during routine and emergency prenatal care. It does produce any harm or risk to the human body. You can refer to medical journal for references: <span class="citation Journal">Hangiandreou, N. J. (2003). "Physics

              <p>When used against insects, it does not kill them. Many insects have good ultrasonic hearing and most of them are nocturnal insects listening for echolocating insects. Insects who hear ultrasound tend to make evasive manoeovre to escape being caught or eaten by other predators such as bats (known to use ultrasonic wave to detect their prey). Thus, towards cockroaches, ants, ultrasounds generators are designed to fighten them away. This will cause them to leave your home. But it will not kill them.</p>

              <p>Actually, I'm also kind of in a dilemma. I play buddhist chanting music at home. If these insects can hear the dharma. It's also good. I embrace all life forms, but not all my family members do.</p>
              <p>My father always resort to killing these insects, as he does not practise buddhism. Some of my family members regard these insects as disgusting...esp. cockroaches. I try to prevent my father from killing. Rather than causing the death of these insects, I would rather chase these insects away so as to save their lives. At the very least, their lives can be saved, rather than being slaughtered unwittingly.</p>
              <p>Amongst the 10 evils, killing carries the heaviest bad karma. It is important amongst all buddhist to save all lives. No killing is also one of the 10 goods practised by buddhist. Thus, though it appears that I'm chasing away these sentient beings making them feel unwelcomed, I'm preventing them from being killed in my home by my family members who do not practise buddhism. I'm saving their lives and warning them from approaching a place where they might be killed. In this way, it's equal to releasing life. I'm pretty sure that my decision is right and fits with the dharma.</p>

              <p>One gadget is good enough for one home. There are various brands and different types of reviews online on how effective they areÂ  in repelling insects. Anyway, some reported it wasn't effective. Some reported it was effective. So it's up to you to try out. It costs around S$45-60 per gadget and can be found in most electrical appliance shops. I suggest you do more survey online on various brands on their effectiveness, and make sure it has no harm to human/pets and do not kill insects, only repel them away.</p>
              <p>Just google online to see which brand you prefer. I'm now trying one at home (actually without doing any survey) just to see if it's effective. I just stumped upon it in one electrical appliance shop and bought it straightaway, since my mind is filled with "I want to prevent killing at home". My wife put it near the kitchen where there are more ants and cockroaches. Sofar, it has been effective.</p>

Laws of dharma are born with causes and conditions. With causes and conditions being extinguished, how can there be no change? To say that "fixed karma" cannot be changed is equal to karma which can still be changed, without anything that is unable to change; What cannot be changed is when the "condition"Â  is not satisfactory (or have not ripened). When one realize that laws of dharma is relative and that there is nothing that is unchangeable, what is good or bad karma can be changed.)</p>
              <p>Causes and effect can be changed. The karma is "fixed" because many sentient beings are bounded by their own self-attachments and they have decided they do not want to change their own karma. This is why "fixed karma" are hard to change. The Buddha only shows you the way, but if you do not follow his way or walk the path he shows you, it's useless. Only with your own enlightenment can you change your own karma.</p>

This is because all our actions in deeds or words are initiated by our thoughts. Good or virtuous thoughts beget good deeds, or karma, that eventually recompense rebirth as a human being or in the heavens. Evil thoughts, on the other hand, lead to evil karma that responds by rebirth in the animal, hungry ghost or hell realm as retribution. <br><br>
              </span></p><p>Fixed karma cannot be changed; it is already fixed that at a particular time one definitely has to bear the consequence either as a retribution or reward. It is like a vine bearing sour grapes, it is impossible to change that. Only by sowing good seeds can one expect the grapes to be sweet. To change the fixed retribution due to fixed karma is not an easy thing to do. It can only be changed after receiving the due retribution. Therefore, one should bear the retributions of the karma according to the conditions, but must not create new misfortunes.</p>

An example would be if someone kills their own parents. Such a deed is deemed so atrocious and evil that one is bound for rebirth in the hells for a very long time. Yet, at the same time, there is speak that there is no such thing as fixed negative karma, because karma is really dynamic like every other phenomenon in the universe, and therefore is subject to change. How can we reconcile these two seeming opposing points of view?<br><br>When we first come across the idea that there could be such thing as fixed negative karma, it is natural to feel a great sense of dread. But that probably is a skilful teaching in itself, because this dread has the power to deter us from even thinking of doing evil that is similar in heinousness. Instead it urges us to do more good, so as to go against any evil tendencies. This teaching thus has a preventive function, whether it is true or not. However, it is true that it can be difficult to make up for a serious evil deed. What if one's guilt for such evil done is so strong that it leads to severe despair? Is there any hope left? Even if there is fixed karma, it will come to pass, because it is impermanent in nature.<br><br>Whether there is fixed karma or not, whether evil was done or not, we should strive to do as much good as possible to repent for misdeeds, to create 'fixed positive karma' (whether this is possible or not). But what's the point of doing so if fresh positive karma might be unable to counter ill effects? It doesn't matter! Even if 'destined' to suffer, there would at least be abundant positive karma for thereafter! A powerful way out of fixed negative karma is to create the karma for birth in Pure Land with thorough repentance and the aid of Amitabha Buddha's boundless merits. There, we are bound for enlightenment due to its excellent Dharmic environment - via irreversible positive karma!</span> - <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"><em>Shen Shi'an<br><br></em></span>Your karma is only as dynamic as you are in changing yourself. <em>- Stonepeace</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><br>-------------------------</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"King Crystal and the Buddha were supposedly relatives, though in fact they were not. King Crystal's father, also a king, wanted to marry into the Gautama clan. Since the Gautama clan was a more honorable one than the king's, the members of the Gautama clan did not like the idea. No one wanted to give a daughter to the king in marriage, but they didn't dare refuse outright, because the king was powerful. A refusal might have resulted in a lot of trouble. Finally they decided among themselves to send one of their servant girls, a particularly beautiful one, and pretend she was of the Gautama clan. King Crystal was an offspring of that marriage. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"Once, while the king was still a child, someone built a temple for the Buddha, complete with an elaborate Dharma Seat.. When the seat was finished, but before the Buddha himself had ascended the platform to sit on it and speak Dharma, the child who was to become King Crystal climbed up and sat on it. The Buddha's disciples and the donors who saw him all scolded him, saying, 'You're the son of a slave; how dare you sit in the Buddha's seat?' Hearing them call him that, he was outraged, and he said to his attendant, 'Wait until I am king and then remind me of what was said here today, lest I forget it. People from the Gautama clan say I'm the son of a slave. Remind me of that. I intend to get even.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"Later, when he was king, his attendant did remind him, and the king issued an edict that the entire Gautama clan was to be exterminated, including the Buddha himself. When Mahamaudgalyayana got wind of this, he went to the Buddha to report. 'We have to think of away to save them,' he said. But the Buddha didn't say anything. And so Maudgalyayana loosed his spiritual powers, put five hundred members of the Gautama clan into his precious bowl, and sent them to the heavens. He thought they would be safe there. When the king had completed the extermination, Maudgalyayana told Shakyamuni Buddha, 'I've got five hundred Gautamans in a bowl stashed away in the heavens, and so the clan isn't totally gone after all. I'll bring them down now and let them go.' But when he had recalled them and took a look at his bowl, he found nothing there but blood. "Why was I unable to save them?' asked the puzzled Maudgalyayana. He wanted the Buddha to explain the causes and conditions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"'Ah, you don't know,' said the Buddha, "On the causal ground, a long time ago, at a place where the weather was hot, there was a pool with schools of fish in it. The two leaders of the schools were named Bran and Many Tongues. The water in the pool evaporated in the intense heat, and since the people in the area didn't have anything else to eat, they ate the fish. In the end there was just a mud-hole, but even then they noticed a movement in the mud. Digging in, they found the two big fish-kings--Bran and Many Tongues. At that time, I, Shakyamuni Buddha, was a child among these people, who were later to become the Gautama clan. Seeing that the two fish were about to be devoured alive, I beat them over the head three times with a club to knock them out first.' That is why in his life as a Buddha he had to endure a three-day headache as retribution. 'Further, the fish Bran was the present King Crystal, and the fish Many Tongues was his attendant who reminded him of the words spoken by the Gautama clan to the king as a child. And so it was fated that he would exterminate the Gautama clan.' Even though Shakyamuni had become a Buddha, he could not rescue his people from the fixed karma they were destined to repay."</span></p>
