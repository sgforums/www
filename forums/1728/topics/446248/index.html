              <p>"These are the five factors for exertion. Which five?</p>
              <p>"There is the case where a monk has conviction, is convinced of the 
              Tathagata's Awakening: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is pure &amp; rightly 
              self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an 
              expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those 
              people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, 
              awakened, blessed.'</p>
              <p>"He is free from illness &amp; discomfort, endowed with good 
              digestion — not too cold, not too hot, of moderate strength — fit for 
              exertion.</p>
              <p>"He is neither fraudulent nor deceitful. He declares himself to the 
              Teacher or to his wise friends in the holy life in line with what he 
              actually is.</p>
              <p>"He keeps his energy aroused for abandoning unskillful mental 
              qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities. He is steadfast, 
              solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful 
              mental qualities.</p>
              <p>"He is discerning, endowed with discernment leading to the arising of
               the goal — noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress.</p>

              <p>Then Ven. Upali went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed
               down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the 
              Blessed One: "It would be good, lord, if the Blessed One would teach me 
              the Dhamma in brief such that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed 
              One, I might dwell alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute."</p>

              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="sav" name="sav">Savatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a id="ana" name="ana">Anathapindika</a>'s
               monastery. Now at that time Ven. Cula Panthaka was sitting not far from
               the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, with 
              mindfulness established to the fore. The Blessed One saw Ven. Cula 
              Panthaka sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, 
              with mindfulness established to the fore.</p>

              <p>The venerable Ananda arose early one morning, and taking up his robe 
              and bowl approached a certain settlement of nuns, where he sat down on a
               seat that had been prepared. A number of nuns approached the venerable 
              Ananda, and after greeting him, sat down to one side. So seated, these 
              nuns said this to the venerable Ananda: "There are here, Ananda sir, a 
              number of nuns who abide with minds well established in the four 
              foundations of mindfulness. Their understanding is becoming ever greater
               and more excellent."</p>
              <p>"So it is, Sisters, so it is!" replied Ananda. "Indeed for anybody, 
              Sisters, whether monk or nun, who abides with a mind well established in
               the four foundations of mindfulness — it is to be expected that their 
              understanding becomes ever greater and more excellent."</p>
              <p><em>[Ananda later relates this exchange to the Buddha, who approves of his response and then elaborates:]</em></p>
              <p>Here, Ananda, a monk abides contemplating body as body<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn47/sn47.010.olen.html#fn-1">[*]</a> — ardent, fully aware, mindful — leading away the unhappiness that 
              comes from wanting the things of the world. And for one who is abiding 
              contemplating body as body,<a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag" name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn47/sn47.010.olen.html#fn-2">[*]</a> a bodily object arises, or bodily distress, or mental sluggishness, 
              that scatters his mind outward. Then the monk should direct his mind to 
              some satisfactory image. When the mind is directed to some satisfactory 
              image, happiness is born. From this happiness, joy is then born. With a 
              joyful mind, the body relaxes. A relaxed body feels content, and the 
              mind of one content becomes concentrated. He then reflects: "The purpose
               for which I directed my my mind has been accomplished. So now I shall 
              withdraw [directed attention from the image]." He withdraws, and no 
              longer thinks upon or thinks about [the image]. He understands: "I am 
              not thinking upon or thinking about [anything]. Inwardly mindful, I am 
              content." This is directed meditation.</p>
              <p>And what is undirected meditation? Not directing his mind outward, a 
              monk understands: "My mind is not directed outward." He understands: 
              "Not focused on before or after; free; undirected." And he understands: 
              "I abide observing body as body — ardent, fully aware, mindful — I am 
              content." This is undirected meditation.</p>
              <p>And so, Ananda, I have taught directed meditation; and I have taught 
              undirected meditation. Whatever is to be done by a teacher with 
              compassion for the welfare of students, that has been done by me out of 
              compassion for you. Here are the roots of trees. Here are empty places. 
              Get down and meditate. Don't be lazy. Don't become one who is later 
              remorseful. This is my instruction to you.</p>

              They penetrate the subtle truth
              As the tip of a hair with an arrow
              Who see the five aggregates as alien
              And do not regard them as self.
              
              Those who see conditioned things
              As alien and not as self
              Have pierced right through the subtle truth
              As the tip of a hair with an arrow.
              
              - Maha Mogallana
              
              (Thag. 1160-61)
              
              Buddha:
              
              With mindfulness of the body established,
              Controlled over contactâ€™s sixfold base,
              A bhikkhu who is always concentrated
              Can know Nibbana for himself
              
              ...
              
              Just as a mountain made of solid rock
              Stands firm and unshakable,
              Even so, when delusion is destroyed,
              A bhikkhu, like a mountain, is not perturbed.
              
              ...
              
              Mogallana: â€œIn what way, Lord, can it be briefly explained how a monk becomes liberated by the elimination of craving: how he becomes one who has reached the final end, the final security from bondage, the final holy life, the final consummation, and is foremost among devas and humans?â€�
              
              Buddha: â€œHere, Mogallana, a monk has learned this: â€˜Nothing is fit to be clung to!â€™ When a monk has learnt that nothing is fit to be clung to, he directly knows everything; by directly knowing everything, he fully comprehends everything; when he fully comprehends everything, whatever feeling he experiences, be it pleasant, painful, or neutral, he abides contemplating impermanence in these feelings, contemplating dispassion, contemplating cessation, contemplating relinquishment. When thus abiding, he does not cling to anything in the world; without clinging he is not agitated; and without agitation he personally attains the complete extinction of defilements. He knows: â€˜Rebirth has ceased, the holy life has been lived, the task has been done, there is no more of this or that state.â€™â€�
