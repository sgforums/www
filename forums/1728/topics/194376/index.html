            <div class='col-md body'>after reasoning for few years, i found out what i, as well as you all, should do. there is a common purpose for us after all.<br><br>first i agree we have to live life to the fullest. however, why does everyone seems to be ok with the idea that death is inevitable. for me, i believe that we should try our best to prevent death from aging and related sickness so that we can live as long as possible. i am not saying that we will find a solution, but i am just saying that we should at least try and put effort in this problem.<br><br>probably because the world is too absorbed in the materialistic and colorful world that it seems hard and unthinkable to achieve this. so they would rather play than to waste time on something which they did not think is really possible.<br><br>i agree that play and being with people is what we live for but we should first achieve longevity first, then after that we can do whatever you want to do.<br><br>a common response from people is "it is not the quantity that matters but quality of life" i truly agree with that but nevertheless, if we can prevent death, we still can lead a quality life with more time some more.<br><br>a life with both quantity and quality is better than a life with limited quantity and quality. hence, finding a solution to prevent death is right.<br><br>i believe skepticism is what prevents people from accepting this type of ideology. if you look at the world today, its mainly about living in the moment and coming with all sorts of interesting event. hence, i am now trying to work out a methodology some day to convince people about putting resources into researching death prevention to increase our chance of finding a solution.<br><br>i am not suggesting that we should stop all kind of pastime or social activities and just focus on death prevention (aging and others). just increase our time, effort in this area is a good start i think.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Tell you a secret... we never die and yet we die countless of time. Form changes all the time. Our essense is everpresent... timeless. No past...no future.<br><br>By letting go of thinking about the past or the future, we will discover the timelessness... and we will see that the universe is interconnected.<br><br>But if you want to know about overcoming physical death... Research this subject " Body of light" or "rainbow body".<br><br>The irony is that, by the time you attain rainbow body... you would have overcome your fear of death long long before  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>In my opinion, it is better to look at 'why' we want to prevent death...then at 'how' to prevent to death. The 'why's have the answers. The 'why's will lead one to the root. The 'how's will lead one into more and more actions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha taught that <strong>all existence is impermanent </strong>because there is nothing internal or external whatsoever which is permanent, stable, lasting, not subject to decay and destruction, and forever the same. Everything changes continuously. Existence is like the flowing water of a river or the burning flame of a candle, which is never the same in two consecutive moments.<br><br>Science teach that apparently permanent objects like the oceans, continents, mountain ranges and even the earth, the sun and the solar system are constantly changing and will some day become extinct. When all these are also subject to change and destruction, <strong>one cannot doubt the impermanence of life. Life can end at any moment. No one can avoid death and the destruction of the body.</strong><br><br>When one realises that people and situation are impermanent and constantly changing,, one will approach each moment of a relationship with an open mind. One will be able to react to each new situation without clinging to outdated ideas about people. Relationships can then develop fruitfully. Success in life depends on oneÂ’s ability to adapt to change in situations and to make the most of new opportunities arising.<br><br>Having understood that youth, health, material well-being and even life itself are impermanent, people should then make the most of those favourable circumstance while they last. This means that they need to practice the Noble Eightfold Path in order to achieve happiness and Enlightenment.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="color: green;">"Subject to change are all things, Strive on with diligence". </span></span><br><br><strong>-The Buddha</strong><br><br></div>

Our suffering often stems from the fact that we cling on to things as if they were(In your case is life). For example, we enjoy a pleasant taste but rather than just enjoy it for that moment we want it to last forever. In the nature of things, this cannot be and so when the pleasantness fades way we are disappointed, discontented, unhappy.<br><br><blockquote>then why are human working so hard to save lives everyday<br>lives that may be killed from accident, natural disaster, disease, virus. we intervene, we think, we come together and work out solutions how to prevent death and save life. we don't want people to die because human resource is valuable and death eliminates us. hence, in aging, we should adopt the same view too.</blockquote>Why not as every human life is precious  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><span class="large"> <span style="color: green;">"EVERYDAY, THINK AS YOU WAKE UP.<br><br>TODAY I AM FORTUNATE TO HAVE WOKEN UP.<br><br>I AM ALIVE,I HAVE A PRECIOUS HUMAN LIFE.<br><br>I AM NOT GOING TO WASTE IT<br><br>I AM GOING TO USE<br><br>ALL MY ENEGYIES TO DEVELOP MYSELF<br><br>TO EXPAND MY HEART OUT TO OTHERS<br><br>TO ACHIEVE ENLIGHTENMENT FOR<br><br>THE BENEFIT OF ALL BEINGS.<br><br>I AM GOING TO HAVE KIND<br><br>THOUGHTS TOWARDS OTHERS.<br><br>I AM NOT GOING TO GET ANGRY.<br><br>OR THINK BADLY ABOUT OTHERS.<br><br>I AM GOING TO BENEFIT OTHERS<br><br>AS MUCH AS I CAN"</span></span><br><br>-<span class="large"><strong>BUDDHA</strong></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps u wana use technology to preserve ur body and find a way to retrive  a thousand years later? if there is such a technology being developed in the first place and how expensive it can get...lol<br><br>Have u read in the news that healthy teenage without history of heart failure can died of heart attack suddenly. The plane u are in suddenly crashed from mechanical failure. How are u going to prevent death? of course u can take precautions like having a healthy lfiestyle but some things are not within our control.<br><br>our lifespan might prolonged to hundred ++ in the future using medical technology. However, we all died in the end.<br><br>Anyway, this death thingy remind me of a true story.<br><br>Have u seen peopel wearing this yellow wrist band with words "live strong" on it. This wrist band was inspired by Lance armstrong who won the battle of testical cancers. The doctor lied to him that he has 40 to 50% of survival rate.<br><br>The cancer has actually spread to his lungs, brain and his testical has swollen to the size of a lemon. His case was actual the worst that they have ever seen. But for him he has a strong fighting spirit, with family support and he successfully battle this cancer ( the pain from chemo, surgery ) and went on to achieve "the first person winning 6 Gold constructively in france tour" after his recovery (one of the gruesome competition in the world ).<br><br>some of us might accept death with peace and some might want to give it all and fight.. but we can't deny we will not died in the end.<br><br></div>
