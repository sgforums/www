              Help Us Overcome The Biological Pull Of Dissatisfaction?</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"There's
              a kind of a bridge between cognitive therapy and Buddhist practice in evolutionary
              psychology," says author Robert Wright.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Are
              human beings hard-wired to be perpetually dissatisfied? Author Robert Wright,
              who teaches about the interface of evolutionary biology and religion, thinks
              so.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wright
              points out that evolution rewards people for seeking out pleasure rather than
              pain, which helps ensure that human beings are frequently unsatisfied: "We
              are condemned to always want things to be a little different, always want a
              little more," he says. "We're not designed by natural selection to be
              happy."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              all is not lost. In his new book, Why Buddhism is True, Wright makes the case
              that some Buddhist practices can help humans overcome the biological pull
              towards dissatisfaction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"I
              think of mindfulness meditation as almost a rebellion against natural
              selection," he says. "Natural selection is the process that created
              us. It gave us our values. It sets our agenda, and Buddhism says, 'We don't
              have to play this game.' "</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Interview Highlights </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On how natural selection is at odds with
              the Buddhist notion that pleasure is fleeting </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              was in the Buddha's first sermon after his enlightenment is that a big source
              of our suffering is that we crave things, we want things, but then the
              gratification tends not to last. So we find ourselves in a state of almost
              perennial dissatisfaction. And, in fact, people may have heard that Buddhism
              says that life is full of suffering, and it's true that suffering is the
              translation of the word dukkha. It's a respectable translation, but a lot of
              people think that that word would be just as well translated as
              "unsatisfactoryness."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Certainly
              when you think about the logic of natural selection, it makes sense that we
              would be like this. Natural selection built us to do some things, a series of
              things that help us get genes into the next generation. Those include eating
              food so we stay alive, having sex — things like that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              it were the case that any of these things brought permanent gratification, then
              we would quit doing them, right? I mean, you would eat, you'd feel blissed out,
              you'd never eat again. You'd have sex, you'd, like, lie there basking in the
              afterglow, never have sex again. Well, obviously that's not a prescription for
              getting genes into the next generation. So natural selection seems to have
              built animals in general to be recurrently dissatisfied. And this seems to be a
              central feature of life — and it's central to the Buddhist diagnosis of what
              the problem is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On how to approach physical pain with
              mindfulness </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              basic principle of mindfulness meditation is to not run away from feelings that
              you normally run away from. By "run away from" I mean you're averse
              to them. Like, if you feel anxiety or physical pain, you want it to go away.
              You want to do something that makes it go away. And the idea of mindfulness
              meditation is that you actually sit there — kind of observe the feeling,
              experience the feeling — and ironically, that can give you a kind of critical
              distance from it, a kind of detachment from it. So not running away from the
              pain or the emotional distress, or whatever, can, through meditative practice,
              disempower the pain or the distress.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On how Buddhist meditation can
              counteract the biological pull towards dissatisfaction </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              I can say about meditation is that it attacks the levers that natural selection
              kind of uses to control us, at a very fundamental level. ... By our nature we
              just seek good feelings and avoid bad feelings, that's just our nature.
              Buddhism diagnosed this as kind of a problem and remarkably came up with a
              technique that allows you to actually disempower those levers, to no longer
              respond to the fundamental incentive structure of trying to avoid painful
              feelings and try to always seek the thing that promises to be gratifying.
              That's an amazing thing — that it can work.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On how cognitive behavioral therapy and
              Buddhism work together </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Cognitive
              Behavioral Therapy works by kind of interrogating people about the logic behind
              things like fears and anxieties, like, Is there really much of a chance of you
              projectile vomiting while speaking to a crowd? You've never done it before. ...
              So there's a suspicion there about the logic behind feelings.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Well,
              in Buddhism there's a suspicion of the logic behind feelings more broadly, I
              would say. But as a practical matter, Buddhism works at the level of feeling.
              They don't interrogate the logic explicitly, but you deal with the feeling
              itself in a way that disempowers it. And there's a kind of bridge between
              cognitive therapy and Buddhist practice in evolutionary psychology; because
              evolutionary psychology explains that, indeed, a lot of the feelings we have
              are not worth following, for various reasons. They may have literally been
              designed to mislead us to begin with by natural selection. ... We live in an
              environment so different from the environment that natural selection designed
              us for that we have these counterproductive feelings, like fear of public
              speaking. So evolutionary psychology gives a back story, explaining why it is
              that we so often are misled by feelings ... and then Buddhist meditation tells
              us what to do about that.</span></p>
