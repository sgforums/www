            <div class='col-md body'>BTW you sure is 'girlfriend' and not just 'friend'? You said just now that they are just 'friends'.<br><br>anyway... if it regards a family's relation... both parties must try to be tolerant.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no3c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no3c.htm</a><br><br>Mutual respect begets harmony<br><br>How may a family whose members have different religions live together harmoniously?<br><br>One common principle that mankind all over the world abides by is the freedom of choice of religion and faith. A country may have different religions co-existing at the same time, such as Buddhism, Catholicism, Christianity or Islam. But, we have to understand that it is the condition arising from love that causes people to have families, parents and children. It is a good thing if the family is happy and blissful. However, if the family members bear different faiths, so long as each member keeps his faith to himself, refrain from slandering or debating over each otherÂ’s faith, but mutually respecting each otherÂ’s faith and character, then the family will naturally be harmonious.<br><br>Further, the younger generation ought to refrain from arguing with their elders because it is their parents who brought them up. Moreover, there is no purpose in arguing with them. We have to practise filial piety and be good so that we do them proud. Then, they will feel that their children are righteous, well behaved, and may willingly join us to learn about Buddhism. This will be ideal. Otherwise, it is not filial to constantly argue with them. When we learn and practise Buddhism, we have to exercise wisdom. With regards to differences in religions and faiths, as long as we maintain mutual respect, I believe, the family will be harmonious.<br><br>Freedom in choice of religion<br><br>If the children of a Buddhist family choose to marry a person of a different faith, will the marriage work out well?<br><br>Although a person may be a Buddhist himself, it is not necessary that his children must also Buddhists. We may, of course, promote and encourage our children to embrace Buddhism. However, we cannot force it upon them. Moreover, we should not object to their marriage just because their partners are from a different faith.<br><br>In this present age, everybody has the freedom to love and choose his or her own lifetime partner. Similarly, everyone has the freedom of choice of religion and faith. No religion can compel its followers (and their dependants) to only believe in that particular faith, and object to marriages outside that particular faith. I believe, as parents, with regards to their childrenÂ’s marriages, the primary concerns are the relationship between the two parties and how to guide their children in deciding their lifetime partners. Religion and faith are secondary factors; it is their happiness after the marriage that matters most of all. It would be useful for parents to counsel their children about the code of family ethics, such as the role and responsibilities of a husband and wife, and how to be good parents themselves. If they do not know how to live harmoniously and fulfil their responsibilities as husband and wife, or to be good parents, even if both of them believe in Buddhism, the marriage may still not work out well. If, for instance, the choice partner believes in a different faith, as a parent, one may promote the teachings of Buddhism so that he or she finds it acceptable. It will, of course, be good to establish a household based on the principles of Buddhism. If, meanwhile that cannot be achieved, one should adopt the Buddhist teaching of loving-kindness, compassion and equality towards all beings, in relation to the son-in-law or daughter-in-law. It is a good thing for a couple to bear the same faith and share the same principles and values, with both cultivating together and becoming partners on the Bodhi-path. It would be even better if they were eventually reborn in the Buddha-land.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just dont understand why they need to convert everyone! Ok let me tell you straight. If there is a couple, one a buddhist and one a christian, definately the christian will preach about his/her religion to their children or whatsoever. Its a very natural thing. Most Christians love their God more than they cherish their relationship.<br><br>As a buddhist, i find it very unright. It is very rude in my eyes to convert someone who already have their own beliefs. Why should they think that only their religion is true while all others are false? I also find it not the middle path. They are overdoing it. Yes, they can preach, but nowadays they are preaching too much an extend.<br><br>So if you ask me, i will not marry someone who is a christian! Its most likely she will convert me or defeat my belief. Marrying someone whos a buddhist or free thinker is more ideal. I have been liking someone who is a very devoted christian, but i gave it up now.</div>

I have been exchanging emails with a US Christian, and he does not like to be referred to as a Christian. When asked why, he said that to him "Christian" is a dirty word that conjures up images of the offensive fundamentalist and evangelical movements. Instead, he refers himself as a "Follower of Christ".<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wilsonhao:</div><div class="quote_body">So if you ask me, i will not marry someone who is a christian!

You should not fear being converted if you are more than just a 'joss-stick' type of Buddhist. I would never marry a "serious" and "devoted" Christian (though I wouldn't mind marrying a nominal one). The reasons as I mentioned before is that it is very difficult to have a "life/ soul partner" that does not share even the most basic and fundamental spiritual/ metaphysical belief and who values her "God" more than your relationship.<br><br>I am thankful this is a moot issue for me as I am blissfully married to a fellow Buddhist girl, and are raising our two children as Buddhists.</div>

In fact evangelism is part of many other religious movements as well. It is all up to how these people are doing it. Some christians are quite okay; some are of course more aggressive. I suspect the more aggressive ones are so because in the christian cosmology, they only have the present and the afterlife, so unlike the buddhist cosmology where we can 'take our own sweet time' (was told by some buddhists), these more aggressive christians would have probably have the sense of urgency to see that their faith (which they believe to be the sole truth) is shared extensively.<br><br>It's this simple. And to my observation, it is usually the converted ones who are the over-zealous lot, born christians are usually not so aggressive. And probably the converted ones are so because they experience the transformations and are eager to share it with others.<br><br>Okay I talk too much liao. To really know christians, please attend church or cell group service for like 3 to 6 months and you will learn from them de. Quite fun actually.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My personal opinion is that if she really is a devout christian, forget her.<br><br>Unless you can really accept it and convert, all the things that christians do will continue to irritate you until one day you cannot take it anymore.<br><br>However, it's mostly up to the couple.<br><br>My girlfriend is a christian. My girlfriend's parents are devout christians. My girlfriend's dad probably could have a PhD in Theology if he bothered to go get one.<br><br>However, my gf does not preach about christ to me and I don't criticize christianity in front of her. Overall, it works out pretty well.<br><br></div>
