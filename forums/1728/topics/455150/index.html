              DIRECT INTRODUCTION<br><br>Six
               points summarize the process of direct introduction: The true ground of
               all experience is nondual and free of bias. The confused perception of 
              that ground is the nature of samsara. Confused perception and fixation 
              on that confusion are magical expressions of your own mind. Reversing 
              that confusion lies in refining your experience of the dynamic energy of
               awareness, which has no fixed basis. Ordinary appearances and mind 
              resolve naturally, free within timeless awareness, and so you take a 
              firm stance in the primordial state of naturally pristine timeless 
              awareness. These six points are extremely important general themes in 
              the teachings; the mere realization of their meaning naturally brings 
              fulfillment.<br><br>DIRECT INTRODUCTION TO THE THREE KAYAS<br><br>The 
              distinct features of a crystal sphere, a mirror, and rays of sunlight 
              represent the three aspects of innately limpid essence, nature and 
              expression. Dharmakaya is by nature a state of complete purity, 
              comparable to the inherent purity of a crystal sphere. Sambhogakaya's 
              mode of presence is by nature a state of utter lucidity, comparable to a
               reflection in a polished mirror. Nirmanakaya's manifest mode is an 
              embodiment that entails no division of outer and inner, like rays of the
               sun or moon shining in the ten directions. In that the kayas are 
              timelessly and spontaneously present within you, do not seek them 
              elsewhere, but understand that they are natural attributes.<br><br>CONCEPTS AS ALLIES<br><br>There
               are six ways to embrace concepts as allies: Maintain an ongoing 
              awareness of conceptual consciousness as if it were a gentle breeze, 
              dying down in and of itself; you will experience naturally occurring 
              timeless awareness arising from within. Train in experiencing the 
              stirring of the mind as if it were lighting in the sky, pure in and of 
              itself; you will experience anything that stirs in the mind arising as 
              naturally lucid timeless awareness. Maintain an ongoing awareness of 
              consciousness as if it were a ripple on water, diminishing in and of 
              itself; you will experience all consciousness arising as the naturally 
              occurring and majestic state of enlightened intent. <strong>Maintain an 
              ongoing awareneess of any concepts as allies, arising as expressions of 
              the true nature of reality; you will experience enlightened intent 
              arising from deep within, involving no acceptance or rejection. Maintain
               an ongoing awarness of your fixated perceptions as allies, resolving 
              naturally with no object remaining; you will experience timeless 
              awareness arising within you, without fixed basis, and will perceive 
              things as evanescent.</strong> Maintain an ongoing awareness of the natural 
              radiance of awareness, lucid and pure, as an ally--the lucid expanse of 
              being; you will experience timeless awareness arising from deep within, 
              vivid yet leaving no trace. You who practice thus, immersing yourselves 
              in genuine being, will experience timeless awareness <strong>arising from thoughts themselves</strong>.
               It is absolutely essential that you experience all things manifesting 
              as your allies, just as stacks of dry wood fuel a great fire."

              <p>Thanks too!  I find the SOV very helpful in this respect.</p>
              <p> I think it was Gampopa who said, the more thoughts the better the meditation... of course, that is if one recognises the nature of thoughts.</p>
