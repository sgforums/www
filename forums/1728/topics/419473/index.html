              <p>To my knowledge, in at least one book (a book which is base on his speech in the 90s), he recommend people to just study one sutra Wu Liang So Jing in one's entire life.</p>
              <p>In a dvd, a recent talk with a professor or teacher, he said that its best people use 10 years to just study a sutra.</p>
              <p>I dun think its a right view, to spend entire life to study only one sutra, or use 10 years to study only one sutra.</p>
              <p>Whats your take?</p>

              <p>a real life example of a guy never study any sutra, as he quite old, hence this master told him to stay in a old temple and recite Namo Amituofo all the time. about 3 years, he was reborn in pureland standing! not just one example, many. even during Buddha's time. Story of Culapanthaka is an example. He is the one sweeping the floor with a stanza. the theory is to discipline the mind. with discipline of the body/mind come concentration. and with concentration come wisdom. æˆ’å®šæ…§.</p>
              <p>it's not that it wouldn't work, its whether one can do it or not. if cannot by all mean study other sutra, provide u have enough time.</p>

              <p>to what i know Hui Neng was enlightened by the stanza in Diamond sutra when he walked pass someone reciting it. He not even study any sutra yet.</p>
              <p>after that a nun was reciting the Lotus sutra for many years, but did not understand the meaning, he then asked her to recite to him. after reciting a few chapters, straight away Hui Neng was able to explain the meaning to her. by then he was already enlightened.</p>
              <p>practicing the dharma is when he was hiding in the bandits' lair. slowly he liberated all the bandits.</p>

              <p>ps: haha...kind of think of it, this is a contradicting thread. at first say ...advocate  studing other's books, then now say advocate to study only Wu Liang So Jing and nothing else? that mean the statement cannot hold ground what.  hmm i think it's simply picking bone from an egg only.</p>

              <p>Jing Kong Dharma Master is in the wrong to advocate people go study only one sutra their entire life, or study only one sutra for ten years.</p>
              <p>Jing Kong Dharma Master is in the wrong to advocate Confucius book and Daoism book as entry level book and foundation for Buddhism.</p>
              <p>There's no contradiction. I just wanna point out that, Jing Kong Dharma Master has got some serious wrong views. There's even one advice he gave which is life threatening: asking people dun go see doctor or take medicine when fall sick, just chant AMTF name thats all. Dun go blindly follow his teachings.</p>
              <p>Please be objective, dun go blindly defend his wrong views and wrong action. Remember: ä¾�æ³•ä¸�ä¾�äººã€‚Thank you.</p>
