              Buddhism </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">JOE FREEMAN September 10, 2017 Politico</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Recent violence in Myanmar reminds us that religion has long
              been central to Southeast Asian politics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As Buddhist Myanmar is once again in the news for a brutal
              crackdown on its Rohingya Muslim minority, it’s worth remembering just how
              politically volatile religion can be in Southeast Asia—a part of the world more
              famous for meditation retreats than religious conflict. While the influence of
              Buddhist nationalism in Myanmar, for instance, is often framed as an entirely
              new phenomenon, it has reared its head before, in similar times of uncertainty
              and confusion. During the Cold War, this region became a hotspot of competing
              visions and ideologies. And Buddhism was at the center of it all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 1953, several months after the inauguration of Dwight D.
              Eisenhower, Vice-President Richard M. Nixon travelled with his wife, Pat, on a
              whirlwind tour of Asia. The trip included stopovers in Burma, Cambodia, Laos
              and Vietnam, where the French took him to the front lines of the first
              Indochina war to watch a bombardment of Viet Minh fighters. Nixon was impressed
              but unsettled. He didn’t like the patronizing way the French, which the United
              States was backing against the communist insurgency in the country, treated
              their Vietnamese allies, concluding they had failed to summon an attractive
              alternative to the soul-stirring nationalism of their enemies. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The trip was a formative experience. The next year, in a
              letter to Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith, Nixon wrote, “As you
              know, I have deep and continuing interest in the peoples of Southeast Asia, as
              well as the firm conviction that we have not done enough to convince the people
              themselves, as distinct from the government leadership, that their ideals and
              aspirations are very similar to, and held in common with, ours.” The sentiment
              might seem laughable in light of his secret bombing of Cambodia as president
              years later, but Nixon was onto something. He added that there might be a
              solution to the French problem. “I believe that the enclosed proposal would
              contribute to such mutual understanding,” he wrote. The proposal he included
              was from a relatively obscure group called the Foundation for Religious Action,
              or FFRA, and it called for a “Spiritual Counteroffensive in Southeast Asia.”
              The plan was to pump U.S. money into Buddhist institutions, hoping that the
              lure of faith would overpower the anti-religious hostility of the Soviet Union,
              China and global communism. Theirs would be a Saffron Curtain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">American officials had been intrigued by Buddhism for years.
              In the shadow of World War II and the defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu in
              1954, the U.S. realized that military action alone would not be sufficient in
              containing the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. They needed hearts and
              minds, or pagodas and temples. This is the story Eugene Ford sets out to tell
              in the forthcoming Cold War Monks: Buddhism and America’s Secret Strategy in
              Southeast Asia, which recounts America’s short-lived infatuation with Buddhism
              as a political force and its subtle attempts to strengthen Buddhist
              institutions in the region at a time when ideologies could sway millions.
              “Religion was a lever the United States could use to wield influence of a
              nonmilitary or psychological nature,” Ford writes. “Not least by emphasizing to
              local populations the supposed communist threat to their religious
              institutions.” As they would find out, those threats were real.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Submerged in thrillers and spy movies pitting west versus east,
              we forget the religious crusade-like rhetoric of the period. In 1950, U.S.
              Senator Edward Martin said that America must proceed “with the Atomic bomb in
              one hand and the cross in the other.” Communism was “godless.” Religion,
              therefore, was a powerful weapon against it. In the words of one government
              agency, faith was a key “cold war instrumentality.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The effort was not limited to Buddhism alone. In 1946,
              President Harry S. Truman called for a domestic religious and spiritual revival
              across faiths. As the historian Dianne Kirby has noted, the two words “Under
              God” were added to the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954, and “the barrage of
              anti-communist, anti-Soviet propaganda in the early Cold War years subsumed
              most Christian leaders and certainly their congregations.” Attendance at houses
              of worship rose. Truman’s administration maintained close contacts with the
              Vatican for the purpose of sharing intelligence on communist activity in
              Europe. Ford also refers to a tantalizing but inconclusive plan for working
              with overseas Islamic organizations. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As for Buddhism, America’s Cold War fascination with using
              religion as a weapon against communism coincided with mounting excitement over
              the 2,500th anniversary of the Buddha’s death and first “council” of his followers,
              who met to fully review his teachings. The lead-up to this milestone in the
              mid-1950s generated a wave of fresh pan-Buddhist consciousness, resulting in
              the founding of the World Fellowship of Buddhists. On May 25, 1950, the WFB
              held its first major conference in Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka. “[F]or
              better or worse a new politico-religious organization with worldwide
              connections and a powerful appeal to the masses of Southeast Asia has been
              born,” one U.S. official reported from the event. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Southeast Asian governments understood the powerful appeal,
              too. They worried about the dissolution of Buddhist traditions with the popular
              rise of communist thought. A CIA memo in August 1951 captures the mood in the
              context of Burma, which like many governments saw communist ideas gaining
              traction. “Communist control of Burma would be a great strategic advantage to
              both the Chinese Communists and the USSR. It would drive a wedge between
              India–Pakistan and Southeast Asia, facilitate Communist penetration into Indochina
              and the other countries of South and Southeast Asia, and in a psychological
              sense give impetus to the claim that Communism in Asia is an irresistible
              force,” the memo said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Looking warily at Mao Zedong’s triumph in China and seeing
              how vulnerable they were as Kuomintang forces spilled over borders, some
              regional leaders took action by themselves. Ford writes that in early 1950,
              Thai officials recruited rural monks to “teach respect for father, mother, King
              and State, and to make clear the distinction between communism and Buddhism.”
              More famously, Burma’s prime minister after independence, U Nu, said in 1950
              that ideas attributed to Karl Marx were “less than one-tenth of a particle of
              dust that lies at the feet of our great Lord Buddha.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And so the timing was right for the U.S. to step in. By the
              time Nixon sent his letter, the CIA was already busy working with Buddhist
              groups across the region. The agency had gathered intelligence on Bangkok’s
              ethnic Vietnamese monasteries as early as 1948 for the purpose of monitoring
              possible communist networks. But the CIA could not operate openly and needed to
              go through private organizations. The agency provided behind-the-scenes funding
              for the newly established Committee for a Free Asia—known from 1954 as the Asia
              Foundation—through the National Committee for a Free Europe, which oversaw
              Radio Free Europe at the time. The CIA continued to provided covert funding
              until it severed links with the foundation after they were exposed in the late
              1960s.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Much of the early U.S. efforts occurred in Burma, which Ford
              describes as something of a laboratory for covert Buddhist ops (Burma’s U Nu,
              as we have seen from his comments on Marx, was a fervent Buddhist). The
              Committee for a Free Asia arrived in Burma in 1952 and helped provide
              assistance for the upcoming 1954-1956 council, billed as the sixth such
              gathering since the first was held two and a half millenia earlier. U Nu had
              asked the U.S. government for help with making the council, sometimes referred
              to as the Sixth Synod, a reality. Preparations would cost the Burmese
              government an estimated $6 million and involve the construction of a man-made
              cave to resemble the one in which the first council was held after the Buddha’s
              death. This cave still exists in Yangon, Burma’s commercial capital, and is a
              popular tourist site and part of a Buddhist college. Ford writes that by 1962
              the CFA and its successor the Asia Foundation contributed more than $300,000 in
              printing equipment and technical advice, helping make Burma’s Buddha Sasana
              Press the “largest and best equipped” Buddhist publishing house in the world.
              The Asia Foundation, meanwhile, expanded its operations to nearby countries,
              including Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, giving Washington a regional platform
              and network in the Buddhist world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The U.S. used the same quiet approach in other
              countries—grants to Buddhist educational and development groups, the
              distribution of anti-communist propaganda, staking out a presence at Buddhist
              conferences and the sponsoring of trips to the U.S. for senior members of the
              Sangha, or clergy, where they visited such sites as the Empire State building.
              The overall idea was to, as one official put it, give more “consideration to
              the possibility of pointing out to a greater extent the inconsistencies between
              communism and freedom of religion among all religious faiths.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Naturally, U.S. officials were wary of looking as if they
              were exploiting Buddhism. A 1957 draft of a more formulated policy towards the
              region explained that “whatever is done should not appear to Buddhist leaders
              as a U.S. government ‘program’ but rather as friendly gestures designed to be
              mutually helpful to Buddhist and American lay and religious groups.” Still,
              U.S. officials noted a sense of urgency, as communist China was also busy
              cultivating religious contacts at the same conferences and gatherings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 1956, experts at the State Department went so far as to
              establish a “Buddhist Committee.” U.S. officials were learning that Buddhism
              was not a monolithic entity. There were different sects, and even though
              countries like Burma and Thailand shared a border and similar traditions, they
              also shared an unhappy history of war dating back hundreds of years. With
              respect to Laos, Ford cites a 1958 census that shows only about half of the
              population there had adopted Buddhism, meaning any attempts to influence the
              public through its teachings would be meaningless to many.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">America’s efforts to forge ties with Buddhist leaders seem
              rather mild in hindsight, especially compared with U.S. military meddling in
              Southeast Asia and other countries during the Cold War. This wasn’t the “ugly
              American” tramping around places he didn’t belong or understand; Ford concludes
              there was “nothing sinister about their civic empowerment focus, and the sincerity
              and substantive expertise of some local implementers arguably fail to comport
              with the stereotype of arrogant interloper.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But America’s brief romance with Buddhism was also clearly
              not very successful. Despite U.S. support on both military and religious
              fronts, communist regimes took power in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, where the
              Khmer Rouge killed senior monks and sent others into labor camps. In Burma, the
              military deposed the prime minister and Buddhist patron U Nu in 1962, and the
              junta later decided to fight communists the old-fashioned way—with guns. With
              America’s tacit support, Thailand carried out anti-communist and anti-leftist
              crackdowns whose brutality made the Asia Foundation’s work look irrelevant.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This history reminds us what Buddhism is not. The Western
              obsession with Buddhism’s spiritual and mystical qualities has obscured the
              faith’s more political—and sometimes violent—past. We don’t grapple with the
              militant Zen Buddhists who promoted imperial Japan’s violent incursions into China
              as a holy war. We don’t spend too much time thinking about the Buddhist monks
              in Sri Lanka who blessed soldiers going to fight Tamil Tiger insurgents. And we
              are shocked in Myanmar today—the country changed its name from Burma in 1989—by
              the nationalist monks who spark bloody religious riots and cheer pogroms
              against Muslims. The lesson here isn’t that Buddhism is uniquely violent—</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">it’s not—but that all religions, even seemingly peaceful
              ones, can be contorted to serve political and sometimes evil ends.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Did the Cold War fuel Buddhist militancy, as it did in
              pumping energy into the mujahideen in Afghanistan? That is the big question
              that hangs over the book, and while Ford alludes to it, he is not able to
              answer it. But the tensions of the Cold War undoubtedly fueled a more severe
              strain of political Buddhism, and Ford brings some of the politicized monks to
              life. One of them, a Thai monk named Kittivudho, was active in the 1970s and
              famously compared killing communists to slaughtering fish. “There is certainly
              demerit in killing the fish, but we place it in the alms bowl of a monk and
              gain much greater merit.”</span></p>
