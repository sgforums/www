              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The remarkable thing in Gopi Krishna's case, is that he was a scientifically well informed man who wrote a detailed account of his life story and dramatic kundalini awakening which first occurred in 1937 and stabilized roughly 12 years later into a full state of perennial enlightenment in around 1949.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In this privileged state, he spent the next 35 years, until his departure from the earthly plane in 1984. During this long enlightened period, he wrote more than 15 books, and toured the world talking to and lecturing to groups of scientists, yoga devotees and the general public with his yoga based scientific explanation of the phenomena of evolution, religion and genius, based on his unique understanding and personal experience of a full kundalini awakening.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His first major work was "The Biological Basis of Religion and Genius" with an introduction by the esteemed German scientist Professor Carl Friedrich Von Weiszacker. In this relative short but momentous revelatory work he explains how his knowledge and experience of the biological mechanism in the body known to yoga philosophy as kundalini is the true cause of evolution, thus overturning the theories of the Darwinian Evolutionists, who have in his view by their misunderstanding of the true evolutionary process brought both religion and mysticism into disrepute, thus leading us into what he calls "the present crisis", in which we are witnessing the breakdown of morality, law and order, and a progressive disintegration into war, terrorism, and global disaster.</p>
              <p>According to Gopi Krishna, this disaster is only avertable by a scientific understanding of the evolutionary mechanism in the body known as kundalini, and a consequent return to moral standards - though not necessarily those of a prurient, puritanical nature - which are in harmony with our current stage of evolutionary development, and pre-requisite for us taking the next step of the evolutionary ladder, into what he describes as "a fairytale like kingdom of light, beauty, intelligence and bliss."</p>
              <p>The reader is warned firstly, that Gopi Krishna's works are detailed and complex, and his message cannot be absorbed fully without a serious and protracted study, and secondly that he never advised anybody to awaken kundalini without the guidance of a true master, which he felt at this time was not generally possible to find, even in India, long considered the true home of yoga.</p>

              <p>non-religious people who have their kundalini awakened usually prefer to read Gopi Krishan's books on awakening. He was as normal as any people until his kundalini shot up his spine one sudden day.  He was a father of 3 kids and he was fortunate to have a very supportive wife who rough out the chaotic journey with him.</p>
              <p>Some people who practised Yoga will find their kundalini awakened by the exercise.</p>
              <p>Some people who went to ask for a "shakti" blessing or an empowerment in a religious ceremony may also find themselves suddenly spiritually awakened. In the sense of physical "heat' up their sole/spine , body jerking, seeing and hearing things.  Different from their past normal being.</p>
