              see you are looking more at the likely ‘fruits’ resulting from
              one’s intents and actions. What you stated as ‘it is his karma’,
              basically mean his fate. Things can only become so-called ‘fated’
              due to one’s ignorance of the causes or when one refuse to take any
              action to correct what is coming our way. If it is considered as a
              Buddhist term, it is certainly a complete misused of the

              <p> ~ from <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm#2">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm#2</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>There are some 
                            who criticise thus: "So, you Buddhists, too, administer capitalistic 
                            opium to the people, saying: "You are born poor in this life 
                            on account of your past evil karma. He is born rich on account of 
                            his good Karma. So, be satisfied with your humble lot; but do good 
                            to be rich in your next life. You are being oppressed now because 
                            of your past evil Karma. There is your destiny. Be humble and bear 
                            your sufferings patiently. Do good now. You can be certain of a 
                            better and happier life after death." </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Buddhist 
                            doctrine of Karma does not expound such ridiculous fatalistic views. 
                            Nor does it vindicate a postmortem justice.</span> The All-Merciful Buddha, 
                            who had no ulterior selfish motives, did not teach this law of Karma 
                            to protect the rich and comfort the poor by promising illusory happiness 
                            in an after-life. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>While we are 
                            born to a state created by ourselves, yet by our own self-directed 
                            efforts there is every possibility for us to create new, favourable 
                            environments even here and now.</strong> Not only individually, but also, 
                            collectively, we are at liberty to create fresh Karma that leads 
                            either towards our progress or downfall in this very life. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> According to 
                            the Buddhist doctrine of Karma, one is not always compelled by an 
                            ‘iron necessity’, for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Karma is neither fate, nor predestination</span> imposed upon us by some mysterious unknown power to which we must 
                            helplessly submit ourselves. It is one’s own doing reacting 
                            on oneself, and so one has the possibility to divert the course 
                            of one’s Karma to some extent. How far one diverts it depends 
                            on oneself. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Is one bound 
                            to reap all that one has sown in just proportion? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The Buddha 
                            provides an answer: </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> "If 
                              anyone says that a man or woman must reap in this life according 
                              to his present deeds, in that case there is no religious life, 
                              nor is an opportunity afforded for the entire extinction of sorrow. 
                              But if anyone says that what a man or woman reaps in this and 
                              future lives accords with his or her deeds present and past, in 
                              that case there is a religious life, and an opportunity is afforded 
                              for the entire extinction of a sorrow." (Anguttara Nikaya) </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Although it 
                            is stated in the Dhammapada that "not in the sky, nor in mid-ocean, 
                            or entering a mountain cave is found that place on earth where one 
                            may escape from (the consequences of) an evil deed", <span style="color: #000000;">yet one 
                            is not bound to pay all the past arrears of one’s Karma.</span> If 
                            such were the case emancipation would be impossibility. Eternal 
                            recurrence would be the unfortunate result. </span></p>

              <p>My (Mahayana) Buddhist master says its not possible. Vajrayana masters however disagree.</p>
              <p>Here's what Namdrol says:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><br> I am simply reporting what Garab Dorje, Padmasambhava, Shri Singha
                                          et al actually say. I don't need to interpret anything.</em> <em><br> <br> In HÄ«nayÄ�na, Shakyamuni taught arhatship as buddhahood. In
                                          MahÄ�yana, he taught that arhatship was not buddhahood, and was
                                          inferior to buddhahood. And that in fact, after attaining
                                          arhatship, arhats would be roused from their nirodhasamapatti at
                                          some point and then they must traverse the paths of stages of
                                          MahÄ�yÄ�na. So, was the Buddha lying in HinÄ�yÄ�na when he told his
                                          followers that arhatship was it?</em> <em><br> <br> In VajrayÄ�na, in the Samputa tantra it is clarified that there are
                                          three stages of Buddhahood. Two stages of Buddhas who do not
                                          recognize all phenomena as being the display of their own wisdom
                                          and the thireenth bhumi, Vajradhara, where all phenomena are so
                                          recognized. Does this make the Buddha a liar about MahÄ�yÄ�na?</em> <em><br> <br> In Dzochen, there are enumerated another three stages, three more
                                          stages of those who dwell within wisdom, rendering the thirteenth
                                          bhumi a lower stage of buddhahood. Does this make the Buddha a liar
                                          about VajrayÄ�na?</em> <em><br> <br> In any event, this notion of "Buddhahood that reverts to the basis
                                          [gzhi, not kun gzhi]" as an inferior buddhahood that is not
                                          complete is well attested in Dzogchen. It has to be the case
                                          because as Garab Dorje points out, all sentient beings in the
                                          previous eon attain buddhahood by the end of the eon. This is
                                          explicitly stated by Garab Dorje in the commentary I mentioned to
                                          above.</em> <em><br> <br> But to illustrate my point further, the Drikung view is Dzogchen is
                                          definitely subordinated. For example, Jigten Sumgon states in
                                          Gongcik: “The supreme realization is not touched by the three great
                                          ones.” This is echoe of a statement by Gampopoa to his nephew,
                                          Gomchung.</em> <em><br> <br> But I don't during Jigten Sumgon's time Nyingthig was wide spread.
                                          At this point in history Nyingma was very much on the
                                          decline.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody can truly verify these things (unless you become very wise or enlightened yourself), in the same way that nobody can verify Buddha who lived 2500 years ago, or even verify pali canon, etc. This is religion that we are speaking of. You decide for yourself. Discern with your own wisdom.</p>
              <p>I'm sure when you start practising, all these issues become side-issues. You will be able to see with much greater clarity what is true.</p>
              <p>Also, when you start to experience the truth of what a tradition says, you will have much greater faith.</p>

              <p>sorry I do not follow the masters words. I only follow what the Buddha has taught. thats why I say, it is better to follow what the Buddha taught, you cant be wrong. if the masters teachings goes against what the Buddha has taught, then something is not right.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Nobody can truly verify these things (unless you become very wise or enlightened yourself), in the same way that nobody can verify Buddha who lived 2500 years ago, or even verify pali canon, etc</strong>. </em></p>
              <p><em>you are wrong. when he first expounded the dhamma, there are people who are enlightened after he expounded the dhamma. thats the best verification the Buddha can get. as for pali canon, it was the preservation of the original words of the Buddha ie you dun amend, insert , omit or change any of the Buddha's teachings to suit your teachings or philosophy.</em></p>

              <p>Then it depends on whether you believe in the validity of pure visions. In Mahayana, we do believe in pure visions, celestial Buddhas and bodhisattvas and so on. I can easily apply your same reason and say that many people were enlightened by Mahayana sutras. Authorship isn't such as issue to me as it is to you - wisdom is more important.</p>
              <p>In any case, just keep an open mind and don't let doubt become an obstacle in your journey.</p>

              <p>I think we all know this...... If there is no Mahayana... will Buddhism flourished at other northern countries like China, Tibet etc...?

Afterall Mahayana teachings does not deviate from 4 Noble Truths and Noble 8 fold Paths. It's just built on only.</p>

              <p><br>Hey 2009novice</p>
              </div>
              <p>That is indeed so truth. In fact, in the Buddhist circle, we are well aware that Mahayana sutra came 500 years after Buddha nirvana. However, it does not reduce the essence of Mahayana spirit and its core teaching.</p>
              <p>Intellectually, we tend to gear our to believe based on actual proof such as seeing. Sometime we are unable to verify things due to the constraint of time and space however we can depend on credible people, people experience and testimony. Example, we are unable to travel like astronaut to the moon. What make you think that the Apollo 17 spaceship landed on the moon in 1972? We can only believe  based on the report, the photo and the verification of credible people like John F Kennedy. Does it make the Apollo 17 landing less real?</p>
              <p>In the same manner, the Mahayana teaching was built on the 4 Noble Truths, Noble 8 fold Paths and 3 marks of existence shared by those great master when the layman is seeking the teaching. This teaching has travelled 3 land, India, China and Japan and expounded by great master. It is not based on one person experience but many unknown individuals. They experience the graces through practising the key principle. People can still experience it just like for yesterday, today and future. In fact, it was known to bring peace and order to the nation when practise on a societal level. Perhaps only by practising one then can verify its validity.</p>
              <p>For Mahayana practitioner, it is a balancing act between intellectual and faith. In good faith, when we read the sutra, we are trying to model ourselves after certain Bodhisattva to make this world a better place. Yet when an intellectual ask if our role Bodhisattva is historically verifiable, we need to prepare to say no from academic point of view.</p>
              <p>In the same manner, we known Germ and Bacteria exist but we can't see them through the naked eyes. Yet under microscope, they are real.These role model Bodhisattva although we are unable to see them, they were introduce by Buddha and the great master for a purpose. It does not make them less real. Perhaps, we can see them through practise then our mind will be clear to see them, just like the microscope. Then we will become one the unknown individual who can testify the good graces of Mahayana teaching.</p>
              <p>Each of us has our affinity with a particular practise. If Pali Sutta will make one a better person, one should embrace it with a wholeheart. Same goes with the Mahayana Sutra.</p>
              <p> At the end of the day, the essence will be as Robbie William has sung,</p>
              <p>"I know I'm leavin' here a better man <br>For knowin' you this way <br>Things I couldn't do before, now I think I can <br>And I'm leavin here a better man"<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
