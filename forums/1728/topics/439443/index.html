Sthavirah and Mahasanghikah are the two earliest sects in Buddhism. At first, they were not considered to be different. Sthavirah merely represented the intimate and older disciples of Shakyamuni, while Mahasanghika being the rest. It is said that a century later, a difference of opinion arose on certain doctrines. Three divisions were named as a result (all in Ceylon):<br><br>1)Mahaviharavasinah - A subdivision of the Sthavirah school, which<br>opposed to the Mahayana system.<br>2)Jetavaniyah - Or Jetiyasailah, school of the dwellers on Mount Jeta, which is a sub division of the Sthavirah, one of the Hinayana sect. Also known as Caitya-vandana, who paid reverence to or worship a stupa. Caitya is a religious monument or stupa in which the relics of the Buddha or other reverend sages are placed. This sect held that the Buddha's discourse was transcendent, his enlightenment was already determined when he was born, that he could violate the<br>natural laws, and could be reborn wherever he wished (in his previous lives as a Bodhisattva).<br>3)Abhayagiri-vasinah - A subdivision of early Sthavirah school. Abhayagiri, the Mountain of Fearlessness in Ceylon, where the disciples dwelled in a monastery.<br><br>In the course, the eighteen Hinayana sects were developed. From the time of Ashoka, four principal school are regarded as prevailing:<br><br><br>1) Mahasanghika - Literally means the Member of the Great Order, majority, community.<br>2) Sthavira<br>3)Sammatiyah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from Vatsiputriyah. It is a school of correct measures, or correct evaluation, formed about 300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni. It was classified in the Pudgalavadin category, thus often linked with Vatsiputriyah.<br>4) Mulasarvastivada - a branch of the Sarvastivadin sect, which asserted the doctrine of the reality of things. It held that all is produced by causative action, and everything is dynamic, not static. Mulasavastivada is a school of reality of all phenomena, one of the early Hinayana sects, said to have been formed, about 300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni. Later it subdivided into five:<br><br>a) Mulasarvastivadah ,<br>b ) Dharmaguptah - a subdivision of Sarvastivadah, developed from Mahisasakah and located in northwest India and Central Asia. Literally means those who protect (or preserve) the Law. They were instrumental informing the cult of the stupa, and were expert in incantation.<br>c) Kasyapiyah - a subdivision of Sarvastivadah.<br>d) Mahisasakah - a branch of Sarvastivadah founded 300 years after the Nirvana, but the doctrines of the school are said to be similar to those of the Mahasanghika. Literally means a ruler who converted or rectified his land or people. The school denied reality to past and future, but maintained the reality of the present. Similarly, the school rejected the doctrine of the void and the non-ego, the<br>production of taint by the Five consciousness, the theory of nine kinds of non-activity, and so on.

Hinayanist sect often linked with Sammatiyah, which broke from the orothodox Sarvastivada. The founder was Vatsa. They may be classified as Pudgalavadins, accepting the pudgala transmigrated, and rejecting the theory of the Five Skandhas (the Five Aggregates comprising personality). They were considered schismatics through their insistence on the reality of the self. That individual self is neither the same nor different from the Five Skandhas. The doctrine challenged the Dharma exposition by the Sarvastivadah. The school was later dividied into four:<br><br>i)Dharmottariyah - a branch of Sthavirandin developed from Vatsiputriyah.

              <p>yes there is a difference. the role of a monk or nun is to achieve enlightenment and insight, hence of the need to observe vinaya rules of the sangha, as it will lead a discipline life and lead to mental development from there.</p>
              <p>as for laity, they do not need to.</p>

              <p>Now to answer Rooney's questions:</p>
              <p><em>if sutras that were not taught by the Buddha, were attributed
                                                                          and taught by the Buddha, this is a heinous karma committed. second
                                                                          this is not an act of truth, its like plagiarism, not to say it is
                                                                          wrong to do that.</em></p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p><em>so did the Buddha expounded Amitabha sutra after all? if he did,
                                                      I am not sure why it was not included in the pali canon.</em></p>
              <p>No. I already answered you - Mahayana sutras are taught by pure visions of Buddha - i.e. in visions, not by the historical appearance of Buddha. But the pure visions of Buddha are valid.</p>
              <p>Mahayana accepts revealed teachings and pure visions of Buddha as truth, and by pure visions means they were received from Buddhas albeit in their Sambhogakaya (i.e. celestial) form and not the physical, historical version of Shakyamuni i.e. Nirmanakaya. Whatever they said are therefore true.</p>
              <p>Further we believe in revealed teachings: not all teachings were revealed in Pali suttas. (In fact the Buddha did say in the Pali suttas that the amount of Dharma that he taught then were merely like a handful of leaves compared to the number of leaves in the forest)</p>
              <p>Therefore Mahayana sutras do not contradict Pali suttas, they merely add on, while not contradicting them - they merely build upon them or perhaps even clarify them.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;">Scholars believe that Mahayana as a distinct 
                              movement began around the 1st century BCE in the North-western<strong> Indian</strong> subcontinent, estimating a formative period of about three 
                              centuries before it was transmitted in a highly evolved form to China in the 2nd 
                              century CE. According to Williams (1989), the development of the Mahayana was a 
                              slow, gradual process. The Mahayana was not a rival <em>school</em>, and therefore 
                              it was not the consequence of a schism (<em>sanghbheda</em>). Mahayana and 
                              non-Mahayana <strong>monks</strong> could live without discord in the same 
                              <strong>monastery</strong>, so long as they held the same code.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;">The first known Mahayana texts are translations 
                              made into Chinese by the Kushan monk Lokaksema in the Chinese capital of Loyang, 
                              between 178 and 189 CE.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-size: x-;">Lokaksema's work includes the translation of the 
                              <strong>Pratyutpanna Sutra</strong>, containing the first known mentions of the 
                              <strong>Buddha Amitabha</strong> and his <strong><a title="Pure Land Buddhism page" href="http://www.thaiexotictreasures.com/pure_land_buddhism.html">Pure Land</a></strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;">, said to be at the origin of Pure Land 
                              practice in China, and the first known translations of the PrajñÄ�pÄ�ramitÄ� SÅ«tra,

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;">The earliest stone inscriptions containing 
                              recognizably Mahayana formulations were found in the Indian subcontinent in 
                              Mathura and dated to around 180 CE. Remains of a <strong>statue</strong> of a Buddha bear 
                              the Brahmi inscription:</span></p>
              <dl> <dd><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;"><em>"Made in the year 28 of the reign of king 
                              Huvishka, ... for the Buddha Amitabha"</em> (Mathura Museum). </span></dd></dl>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;">Such inscriptions are rather late and few (the 
                              next known one is dated to the end of the 3rd century), in comparison to the 
                              multiplicity of Mahayana writings transiting from Central Asia to China at that 
                              time, and the involvement of Central <strong>Asian</strong> <strong>Buddhist 
                              monks</strong>, suggesting the focus of Mahayana development was probably in the 
                              northwest.</span></p>

              <h3><span style="color: #000066;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a name="The%204th%20Buddhist%20Council">The 4th Buddhist Council</a></span></span></h3>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;">The formal rise of Mahayana Buddhism has been 
                              dated to around the middle of the 2nd century CE, when the Kushan emperor 
                              Kanishka convened the 4th Buddhist Council in Gandhara, which confirmed the 
                              formal scission of Mahayana Buddhism from the traditional 
                              <strong>Nikaya</strong> schools of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;">This was also the time and place of a rich 
                              cultural interaction between Buddhism and Hellenistic culture, which influenced 
                              the early representations of Buddhas, in what is known as <a title="Buddhist Art page" href="http://www.thaiexotictreasures.com/buddhist_art.html"><strong>Greco-Buddhist

              <h2><span style="color: #000066;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a name="Mahayana%20scriptures">Mahayana 
                              scriptures</a></span></span></h2>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;">Mahayana departs from the <strong>Nikaya</strong> tradition (sometimes referred to as the Hinayana schools) in its acceptance of 
                              the Mahayana sutras. Mahayana schools do not, however, reject Nikaya sutras, 
                              such as those recorded in the <strong>Pali Canon</strong>; these are also seen 
                              as authoritative.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;"><strong>The Mahayana scriptures were probably set in 
                              writing around the 1st century BCE. Some of them, such as the Perfection of 
                              Wisdom sutras, are presented as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">actual sermons of the Buddha </span>that would have 
                              been hidden. By some accounts, these sermons were passed on by the oral 
                              tradition as with other sutras, but other accounts state that they were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hidden </span> and then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">revealed several centuries later </span>by some mythological route. In 
                              addition to sutras, some Mahayana texts are essentially commentaries.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;">Among the earliest major Mahayana scriptures that 
                              are attested to historically are the <strong>Perfection of Wisdom</strong> (<strong>Prajna-Paramita</strong>) Sutras, the <strong>Avatamsaka 
                              Sutra</strong>, the <strong>Lotus Sutra</strong>, the <strong>VimalakÄ«rti 
                              Sutra</strong>, and the <strong>Nirvana Sutra</strong>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;">The Mahayana <strong>canon</strong> further 
                              expanded after Buddhism was transmitted to China, where the existing texts were 
                              translated. New texts, such as the <strong>Platform Sutra</strong> and the 
                              <strong>Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment </strong>were explicitly not of Indian 
                              origin, but were widely accepted as valid <strong>scriptures</strong> on their 
                              own merits. Other later writings included the Linji Lu, a commentary by <strong><a title="Chan Buddhism page" href="http://www.thaiexotictreasures.com/chan_buddhism.htm"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chan</span></a></strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-;"> master Linji. In the course of the development of Korean 
                              Buddhism and Japanese Buddhism, further important commentaries were composed. 
                              These included, for example, in Korea, some of the writings of Jinul, and in 
                              Japan, works such as Dogen's Shobogenzo.</span></span></p>

              existed as a separate school in competition with the so-called 
              "HÄ«nayÄ�na" schools. Due to the veneration of buddhas and bodhisattvas, 
              MahÄ�yÄ�na was often interpreted as a more devotional, lay-inspired form

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Now to answer Rooney's questions:</p>
              <p><em>if sutras that were not taught by the Buddha, were attributed and taught by the Buddha, this is a heinous karma committed. second this is not an act of truth, its like plagiarism, not to say it is wrong to do that.</em></p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p><em>so did the Buddha expounded Amitabha sutra after all? if he did, I am not sure why it was not included in the pali canon.</em></p>
              <p>No. I already answered you - Mahayana sutras are taught by pure visions of Buddha - i.e. in visions, not by the historical appearance of Buddha. But the pure visions of Buddha are valid.</p>
              <p>Mahayana accepts revealed teachings and pure visions of Buddha as truth, and by pure visions means they were received from Buddhas albeit in their Sambhogakaya (i.e. celestial) form and not the physical, historical version of Shakyamuni i.e. Nirmanakaya. Whatever they said are therefore true.</p>
              <p>Further we believe in revealed teachings: not all teachings were revealed in Pali suttas. (In fact the Buddha did say in the Pali suttas that the amount of Dharma that he taught then were merely like a bit of sand compared to the vast amount of sand alongside the rivers)</p>
              <p>Therefore Mahayana sutras do not contradict Pali suttas, they merely add on, while not contradicting them - they merely build upon them or perhaps even clarify them.</p>
              <p>As Loppon Namdrol says:</p>
              <p><em><br>I am simply reporting what Garab Dorje, Padmasambhava, Shri Singha et al actually say. I don't need to interpret anything.</em> <em><br><br>In HÄ«nayÄ�na, Shakyamuni taught arhatship as buddhahood. In MahÄ�yana, he taught that arhatship was not buddhahood, and was inferior to buddhahood. And that in fact, after attaining arhatship, arhats would be roused from their nirodhasamapatti at some point and then they must traverse the paths of stages of MahÄ�yÄ�na. So, was the Buddha lying in HinÄ�yÄ�na when he told his followers that arhatship was it?</em> <em><br><br>In VajrayÄ�na, in the Samputa tantra it is clarified that there are three stages of Buddhahood. Two stages of Buddhas who do not recognize all phenomena as being the display of their own wisdom and the thireenth bhumi, Vajradhara, where all phenomena are so recognized. Does this make the Buddha a liar about MahÄ�yÄ�na?</em> <em><br><br>In Dzochen, there are enumerated another three stages, three more stages of those who dwell within wisdom, rendering the thirteenth bhumi a lower stage of buddhahood. Does this make the Buddha a liar about VajrayÄ�na?</em> <em><br><br>In any event, this notion of "Buddhahood that reverts to the basis [gzhi, not kun gzhi]" as an inferior buddhahood that is not complete is well attested in Dzogchen. It has to be the case because as Garab Dorje points out, all sentient beings in the previous eon attain buddhahood by the end of the eon. This is explicitly stated by Garab Dorje in the commentary I mentioned to above.</em> <em><br><br>But to illustrate my point further, the Drikung view is Dzogchen is definitely subordinated. For example, Jigten Sumgon states in Gongcik: “The supreme realization is not touched by the three great ones.” This is echoe of a statement by Gampopoa to his nephew, Gomchung.</em> <em><br><br>But I don't during Jigten Sumgon's time Nyingthig was wide spread. At this point in history Nyingma was very much on the decline.</em></p>

              <p>Now to answer Rooney's questions:</p>
              <p><em>if sutras that were not taught by the Buddha, were attributed and taught by the Buddha, this is a heinous karma committed. second this is not an act of truth, its like plagiarism, not to say it is wrong to do that.</em></p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p><em>so did the Buddha expounded Amitabha sutra after all? if he did, I am not sure why it was not included in the pali canon.</em></p>
              <p>No. I already answered you - Mahayana sutras are taught by pure visions of Buddha - i.e. in visions, not by the historical appearance of Buddha. But the pure visions of Buddha are valid.</p>
              <p>Mahayana accepts revealed teachings and pure visions of Buddha as truth, and by pure visions means they were received from Buddhas albeit in their Sambhogakaya (i.e. celestial) form and not the physical, historical version of Shakyamuni i.e. Nirmanakaya. Whatever they said are therefore true.</p>
              <p>Further we believe in revealed teachings: not all teachings were revealed in Pali suttas. (In fact the Buddha did say in the Pali suttas that the amount of Dharma that he taught then were merely like a bit of sand compared to the vast amount of sand alongside the rivers)</p>
              <p>Therefore Mahayana sutras do not contradict Pali suttas, they merely add on, while not contradicting them - they merely build upon them or perhaps even clarify them.</p>
              <p>As Loppon Namdrol says:</p>
              <p><em><br>I am simply reporting what Garab Dorje, Padmasambhava, Shri Singha et al actually say. I don't need to interpret anything.</em> <em><br><br>In HÄ«nayÄ�na, Shakyamuni taught arhatship as buddhahood. In MahÄ�yana, he taught that arhatship was not buddhahood, and was inferior to buddhahood. And that in fact, after attaining arhatship, arhats would be roused from their nirodhasamapatti at some point and then they must traverse the paths of stages of MahÄ�yÄ�na. So, was the Buddha lying in HinÄ�yÄ�na when he told his followers that arhatship was it?</em> <em><br><br>In VajrayÄ�na, in the Samputa tantra it is clarified that there are three stages of Buddhahood. Two stages of Buddhas who do not recognize all phenomena as being the display of their own wisdom and the thireenth bhumi, Vajradhara, where all phenomena are so recognized. Does this make the Buddha a liar about MahÄ�yÄ�na?</em> <em><br><br>In Dzochen, there are enumerated another three stages, three more stages of those who dwell within wisdom, rendering the thirteenth bhumi a lower stage of buddhahood. Does this make the Buddha a liar about VajrayÄ�na?</em> <em><br><br>In any event, this notion of "Buddhahood that reverts to the basis [gzhi, not kun gzhi]" as an inferior buddhahood that is not complete is well attested in Dzogchen. It has to be the case because as Garab Dorje points out, all sentient beings in the previous eon attain buddhahood by the end of the eon. This is explicitly stated by Garab Dorje in the commentary I mentioned to above.</em> <em><br><br>But to illustrate my point further, the Drikung view is Dzogchen is definitely subordinated. For example, Jigten Sumgon states in Gongcik: “The supreme realization is not touched by the three great ones.” This is echoe of a statement by Gampopoa to his nephew, Gomchung.</em> <em><br><br>But I don't during Jigten Sumgon's time Nyingthig was wide spread. At this point in history Nyingma was very much on the decline.</em></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>the crux of the issue is the authenticity of the sutra taught by the Buddha. either he taught or he doesn't. if he didnt, but it was attributed to him as being taught, and thus I have heard was inserted, then this is not right. this has to do with being truthful of the authenticity of the sutra and second misleading.</p>
              <p>I dun understand why can't the sutra cant be explained by pure visions of enlightened masters? why is there a need to incorporate Thus I have heard and say it was being taught by the Buddha. I have no issue if it was the sutra of other enlightened masters who have received pure vision.</p>
              <p>another issue I am concerned is this. we have a lot of charlatans who claimed to have this or that visions. some even claimed they are a living Buddha or bodhisatvva.</p>
              <p>of course arhatship cannot be compared to Buddhahood, as it takes eons for the bodhisatvva to practise their perfections before they are ready to be a Buddha. as for rousal of arhatship for them to strive for Buddhahood, this is not in the pali canon. I am wondering if Buddha said arhats can be aroused after they have attained Nirvana. clearly there is a split on this issue. What I want to know is what did the Buddha said about this?</p>
              <p>as for visions, how is it different from insight, as in realising the truth. if you receive vision, does it mean you realised the truth yourself as compared to receiving visions from an external source. as Buddha was not around, anyone can say what they like in regards to visions.</p>

              <p>I have faith with what the Buddha taught and expounded. to me, labels like mahayana or theravada doesnt exists. I believe truth or reality has no distinctions, as one and all.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Yes, this topic on texts that come from ‘revelation’ is quite a controversial subject. I have come across remarks from fundamentalist Buddhists who believe that the Pali Suttas are the only true recorded words of the Buddha. All others Buddhist texts are just superstition, papanca and not to be believed. These would mean most, if not all of the Mahayanist Sutras that we know of, as most can be considered to be ‘revealed’ texts.</span></p>

              <p>the reason is this. Buddha is the ultimate. after his demise, who can verify these visions? but I have a question though. Why didnt the Buddha foretold about the split and gave instructions on visions for the benefit of future generations in time to come? if he has detailed this, then there would not no quarrels whatsover on the visions.</p>

              <p>I, being a Mahayana Buddhist, have no problems with their claims that only the Pali suttas are the true recorded words of the Historical Buddha.</p>
              <p>And yes, Mahayana Sutras are at most "revealed texts".</p>
              <p>But they certainly are not (to me) superstitions but are derived from pure visions and wisdom.</p>
              <p>In other words since we accept the three kayas and the validity of not just Nirmanakaya appearance of Buddha, we can accept the validity of Mahayana scriptures being taught in pure visions.</p>

              <p>my second question is this, yes there are alot of things the Buddha did not teach, but then if it is important and beneficial, why didnt he teach it during his 45 years of expounding the dhamma? surely he has strived so hard to practise the perfections in order to be a Buddha, the ultimate a person can strive, so that he is able to teach and guide sentient beings the dhamma. I still cant think of a reason for the Buddha not to teach this in his 45 years of propulgating the dhamma.</p>
