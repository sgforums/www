            <div class='col-md body'><p>I will like to share my life with people who dun mind reading. Pardon my lousy english.<br><br>i am in 30s now. When i am in my teenage 18+, i suffered from insomina and simply cannot sleep well, i dropout from poly as i cannot concentrate at all and went working. I can take 3 or 4 sleeping pills and wake up 15mins later and cant sleep again and take again and wakeup again. Once a fellow interviewee started talking to me all about ghost experiences of his, give me a final comment that if i am free i should go temple to pray. <br><br>Fast forward abit. Later than i realised am disturbed by spirits. I was cured when my parents brought me to a taoist temple to seek medium help(My family religion is Taoist). I was told my forehead 'fire' (forehead and shoulders makeup the human 'san ba huo')was gone and the medium after trance light an oil lamp and instruct my parents to make sure the oil lamp fire remain buring for 49 days without fail so as to relight my forehead 'fire'.<br><br>All went well and i was better. However i remain fearful of ghost.</p></div>

              <p>I always tot taoism and buddhism is same and no difference as both take joss sticks and pray.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Year Jan 2005 when i was 28. A date that changed my life entirely.  I get to know a gal who later become my gf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One fine day, when we checked in to H81 at 1plus afternoon, after passionate we both slept. 5plus pm when we both awoke, she asked me whether i smell any durian smell, which i say no. She then asked me if i hear anyone singing. Indeed i do, we both hear a lady singing a oldie chinese song. I immediately on the tv and jump to every single channel. there was no channel on anyone singing. We quickly packed up and left.<br><br>At the coffeeshop, she was a baptised catholic then, she flew frequently and<br>once at Hongkong for work she even shared a room with a ghost, simply just tell the ghost she is here to work and hope both will not disturb each other. She keep on telling me must be brave and have faith in the buddha pendant i am wearing(Me wearing a thai buddha pendant after my teenage case). She know that i was terrified. Afterawhile when she opened her bag we are both surprised to see a H81 comb in the bag, we never had any habits of taking souveniers, moreover in this situation. My face turn paled and suggested lets head home.<br><br>We walked to the road and i flagged a taxi, however she ignored and keep walking forward. i catchup with her and we both boarded the taxi.<br><br>After few mins in the cab, out of sudden she talk to herself, "Why u smoke in the cab", " Dun touch me". sensed something wrong, i use hp and sms her asking her how many people in the taxi?<br><br>Her reply shocked me. 5 was the answer. Me , her and the taxi driver was only 3.<br><br>I brought her back my home. i quickly on "Da Peh Chou", she insisted i turn off saying very noisy. I told my dad what happen and he went downstairs to burn joss papers. And she tell me better le, wanted to go home.<br><br>I sent her, Next day at work i called her and asked her if she is better, she then told me actually at the coffeeshop when she asked me to be brave, the "2 male ghost" is already sitting at the table. I asked her i tot she not scared?, how come in the end she so terrified?? She told me the 2ghost wana catch me cos they know i terrified, thus she took off her courage so that they will target her instead. Infact in the cab i was braver cos seeing her in fear i wanted to protct her. Suddenly she cried on the phone and begged me never ask this again cos she wanted to forget it. I agreed to her.<br><br>Few months later towards year end 2005. I asked her to follow me to the taoist temple that saved me. After they save me when i teenaged, every year their birthday "Da Ri Zhi" i will attend and walk the "Ping Ann Bridge" . This year i wanted her with me is i wanted her be safe. We went togehter and everything seems fine. </p>

              <p>The spirits issue was soon slowly forgotten and got over.</p>
              <p>We arent married but we loved eachother deeply and plans to have kids as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May2006. A sad incident happened, she was back from US working trip and developed rashes due to climate. The GP gave her an injection. Then things all went wrong. She realised she was pregnant and the gyno told her our child does not have any heartbeat and miscarriage due to the injection. I was devasted and accompany her for the operation. I wanted to sue the doc who gave the injection without asking anything like r u plannings for kids or filling any questions forms.<br><br>I went bugis temple and pray and burn stuffs for the poor child, the shop auntie chant and told me dun need always burnt so that the child can go peacefully.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="post_message_4372130">Year2006. Months later, one day we had a big quarrel.  She apologised to me but i refused to listened. Finally end the call. She sms me and tell me she is very tired le. She cannot sleep well at nite for months. She is very stressed in life. She wants to go find our baby and takecare of him. She will fulfill her promised to them and oso ask the uncles to help her find our baby.<br><br><br>I was very shocked!! And i asked her " What uncles"?? "What Promises"???<br>It was only then she revealed year05 she had a deal with the 2spirits and now she willing to fulfill the promise instead of resisting.<br><br>I was so stressed and finish all my cigarettes. I went downstairs to get another pack, suddenly she called me and asked me y so late i still go downstairs and y am i wearing the yellow slippers( cos usually i wear black slippers) I was terrified and asked her hw she know??? She just say "u dun haf to know" We were on the phone till i am home, i opened the fridge and drink water. She then told me, " Remember to close the fridge door" I panicked and dropped the water bottle but insisted i nvr opened the fridge, I dunwan her to know the spirits so powerful..<br><br>She told me she is tired and wana sleep. She slept but it took me hours then i sleep. The next day everything changes.</div>

              <div id="post_message_4372251">Hi fantagf, i saw the thai medium buddhist thread,  thats y i decide to share my story here.  I believe yes still got spirits.  I dun mind spirits hanging ard, as long as they not notti.  Anyway when go temple, if they followed me, in another way i am bringing them to Buddhism, not tat bad. All beings are equal are what happen bound to have a reason.</div>
              <div>Back to story.</div>
              <div>I woke up everly at 6plus, sms her and wait for her reply. 7plus liao. getting worried i keep calling her, finally she picked up the phone and say she needs to rush to prepare for work.<br><br>Her tone changed, i dun feel any love from her voice, no warmth except coldness. In my heart i know the spirits have taken over.<br><br>I panicked, in fear, but i know i must seek help. I called up my frd "called A", he occasionally helps at a taoist temple.<br>We decided to meet bugis and after praying to Guanyin Pusa, her lot to me was " Seek help in time to Buddha all will be fine" Tianyi ah Tianyi, its an obstacle we had to go thru, cos Pusa knows very well i duno the difference of Buddhism and Taoism, to me is the same, take joss sticks and prayed. So to me God and Buddha is same them, really ignorant.<br><br>Me and A sat at the bugis market drink and i told him what happened. Out of sudden the cover that is covering his coffee cup overturned by itself. The cover circumfere overlapped the cup nicely and how can it overturn itself when no one, not him, not me and not any other people knk onto the table.<br><br><br>We stoodup and left for OG direction in the hot sun. My frd told me he can feel "something" follwoing us. We both panicked. I called up my younger cousin out of desperation, my cousin is just starting studying thai buddhism(novice) me being in fear find who oso can. We arrange bring her to his area evening time.<br><br>Me and A metup with my gf after she knked off. I suggested going this coffeeshop eat cos food nice. She looked at me and say "" DUn think i duno," "your cousin stay there rite"". My frd A distract her and changed topics to the cup issue. SHe tell us dun nid scared "he trying to scare u only" If u wanted to ask can ask him and point to her front, which is air and no one seated. <br><br><br>We sat at coffeeshop order food and eat. I called cousin and he came down, when he was down we chatted awhile, my cousin says excuse awhile cos he made needed to make a call. He walk away.<br><br>After sometime i tell W, i go findout what cousin busy with so long on hp. SHe just tell me go ahead, but say dun need ask la, Ur cousin first thing will just ask u to go up his home.<br><br>I walked to my cousin and waited for him finish call. I ask him how isit?? True enough his only reply is " u follow me home first".<br><br>Back his home, he took a cup of water and chant and asked me drink. He only tell me he cant really tell oso. My gf called me and throw temper say y so long, say she wanted to go hm. I quickly went down and managed persuaded her go my home sleep with the help from my father cos he come and join us(as i already told my parents what happened). My frd A oso head for his home.<br><br>While with her, she keep saying she feel like going drinking or clubbing. But i managed persuade her go home rest. Back home, i quickly ask mother to keep all keys as i am worried she might sneak out. <br><br>Back home in my room, she lay on bed and rest, i on tv for her. I told her i go shower. After i shower i went back to her. Guess what she told me???<br><br><br>" Go and Drink some Hot water" gf said. I ask her y?? Her reply was " Course your heart is shivering". True enough i am in fear. U are facing something that u cannot see but u know its there. When i shower earlier, when i wash my face i dun dared to closed my eyes cos i scared i see ghost when i reopened.<br><br>She then told me she tired wana sleep. I pat her and hugged her tight but leaving the lights in the room on cos i am scared. She fall asleep. I went to living room and mum told me newspaper got some monks event here for Vesak day but wasted cos just after Vesak day.<br>From the newspaper i found and called up, begging for their help, thankfully their flight is afternoon. <br><br>Its year May2007 when all this happened.<br><br>After confirming appt with the monk carehelper. I went back to the room, i went and hugged her tight, with the lights on, i was hoping my body "YangQi" can helped her lower the spirits power. But in my heart i am so scared, so very scared. Whole nite i did not sleep never dared closed my eyes as well cos i am terrified and worried she may wakeup and sneak out oso.<br><br><br>Morning came, my frd A called me and he will come over my place helped me both forced her go if she resist. I went back, try to wake her but she deep in sleep. I on the "da Peh Chou" and the tv volume i only set about 5bar, when i watch tv is 16bars. She awoke and say very noisy!!! Ask me to off it. I didnt cos i know the spirit scared of it, i was hoping the spirit power dropped. Shortly after My frd A arrived and waited living room.<br><br>I hug her and begged her, ask her to resist and fight, i ask her to think of how much we went thru, dun give up on herself and on us. I begged her to let me help her, i told her she just need to follow me, she refused. I cried and keep begging, She relent and soften and told me muz tell her go where first before she agreed. Finally she agreed cos i only tell her bring her to paya lebar area, rest all i say i duno.<br><br>In the cab, she keep asking for the place details, if dun tell her she will opened door and jumped cab.<br><br>I held her tight and show her the paper i cut from newspaper.<br><br><br>Finally we reached the place, its a HDB flat where the thai monks stay temporary. I and gf went in, she sat down back facing the Buddha, the monks still in room, and she told me she wanted to smoke.<br><br>After she smoke, back to the living room, amazingly she sat down facing the Buddha with about 6 monks in a circle around her. They started chanting and nothing happened. The carehelper says ur gf shld be ok la dun worry. She was given a neck and wrist string to wear.<br><br>Done. Three of us, me, gf and A went to coffeeshop and eat breakfast. My gf told me and A, this was what she says,<br><br>"lucky i see the old monk very kind", if not wont let them off, and she further says "Do u know the monks are already panicking when they ask me pour the water from the vase to the cup"??? "They already chant 2nd round, U guys duno meh" "If a person got problem, the cup will never be filled up" "i see the monk very old and very kind", " thats y i spared them"..<br><br>My W then tell me to let her be and everything will be okie, tell me dun waste $$ find anything le, She is well and Fine.<br><br>But in the heart of Me. I know its never over, my fear grew further cos even so many monks oso no use..</div>

              <div id="post_message_4372301">I left out something when at coffeeshop when she say the old monk looks kind. While she was talking her wrist and neck area developed rashes and keep scratching. We all left for home. Afternoon i got a call from her, she told me she told her parents about what happened, her mum then comment she everytime 5plus pm ever saw a dark thing enter gf bedroom.<br><br>Next was her dad and mum took holy water and with her, went to gf room and sing the Holy songs and spray Holy water around. And she took off the wrist and neck strings and throw away. She oso told me she fail her GOD, she is baptised catholic. She will go back to her religion and seek forgiveness.<br><br>I was happy for awhile cos if her faith and will return she shld be fine, i am wrong days later her temper worsed towards me. And i realised its a ploy to get rid of the Blessed strings by the monks.<br><br><br>I discussed with my family, and decide to seek help from the taoist temple that saved me when i was teenage, the very same temple that i brought her walk the "Ping Ann bridge" in year end 2005.<br><br>Meanwhile between me and gf, she will find the slightest fault to quarrel with me and say break. I endure and endure cos i know its the spirits that want me to leave so there will be no obstruction for them taking over. <br><br>The day came, my mum accopany me to the taoist temple, the medium after in trance ask me what i seek, I told the medium what happen, The medium only tell me, "U cant seek help for others, u need to bring her personally here".

She flared up and wanted to break with me cos i break my promise. " Din u promised me to leave me be, <br>I  told u Ok rite!! Dun nid any help!.. It went on and on and i begged her, She ask me bring her wherE?? FInally she relent and says ok.<br><br>We went and get a number. Next to the temple was hafing a getai then. Actually when W reached the temple, the temple helpers are all smiling at her.<br><br>The medium went into a trance, finally when its our turn, The medium told my gf, Its not ghost that is after u, Its "Sang Chai Tong Ci". For people who dun Sangchai TOng Ci is the character "Hong Hai Er" who later become Guanyin Pusa Discipline.<br><br>The medium tap gf head and instruct the helpers. She then drink amulet water and burn some joss papers. We seated after that and rest awhile while the medium carry on answering others question.<br><br>Gf says wants go home, i say ok. <br><br>Suddenly her legs cannot moved and become all weak. The temple helpers actually most of them are the medium disciples. Instruct dun resist, remove her earing and jewellery. Dun resist and let "SangChai Tong CI" in. They told the medium master and he instruct them bring her to altar and place her on the chair. 3 disciple were supporting gf chair, And gf started shaking heads and legs going into a trance.<br><br>While she still not fully in trance and just shaking, 2 of the 3 who are supporting the chair went weak.<br><br>Both 2 of them went into trance as well. So suddenly got 3 Gods. And singaporeans u all know rite, the getai audience all went see the temple show instead of getail. <br><br>My gf went into trance as well and total u see 4 Gods.<br><br>When she was in trance she was sucking a "nai cui" baby suck type. And The 2 disciples actually i tink become, 1 is Pusa, ! is oso SangChai. And u can see gf snatching the other SnagChai "NaiCui'.<br><br>After they all detrance, The medium master tell gf and me that gf have to become a medium as well. Cos if God wants u be medium, theres no escape. Only 3 paths, 1 is medium, 2 is become crazy, 3 is death.<br><br>We agreed. Infact i was happy that everything is finally over. I call my friend A and tell him the good news. Back home i shared the good news with my family as well. Cos not everyone can be a God Messenger. <br><br>For once i so relieved, we slept at my home. Morning she told me she never slept so well in years, she has the best nite sleep. Peaceful and no disturb.<br><br>Life is so unpredictable, when u tink its over, its actually just started .</div></div>

              <p>Sounds like a classical case of ghosts impersonating deities to gain access to humans.</p>
              <p>There are some Yin temples in which ghosts are worshiped or ghosts impersonating deities to receive offerings. Once the head ghost or ghost king 'likes' you and pester you to be their medium, the ghost king will send his retinue after you. Long term association with these lower realm spirits will bring harm to the person. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Usually very hard to get rid of these spirits as the retinue can number in the thousands. One small ghost gone, the ghost king can usually just send another.  These ghost kings are like mafia. </p>

              <p>Personally, I don't feel the whole incident has much to do with what religion the affected folks had before or after the whole episode, as anyone with any religion or without can fall prey under the 'right conditions'.</p>
              <p>It's more a result of the affected folks' general state of mind and how they were living their lives prior to the possession and spirit entanglement. Negativity attracts negativity. Negative spirits seldom bother with typical humans.</p>
              <p>Negative spirits often try to disturb 2 types of people: 1) those who have extremely negative energy which they can 'feed' on, 2) those who have a lot of good positive energy which may be of use to them.</p>
              <p>For type (1), which is more problematic, the affected person will often need external help as he/she obviously lacks the necessary experience and spiritual strength to handle, and so causes a vicious cycle of growing more negativity, giving the negative spirits more 'strength'. For type (2), if the affected person has the necessary experience and ability to dispel or help the negative spirits move on to the appropriate realm, they won't return again.</p>
              <p>My advice is to monitor the affected person's behaviour after the 'treatment', and ensure that all is really well again. And more importantly, live positively and maintain a positive composure at all times. Avoid harmful substances that weaken the mind, like drugs (eg. Ecstacy, heroin, etc), excessive alcohol to the state of alcoholism, prolonged use of suppressive medication, as this results in a weakened 'backdoor' that enables negative entities to take control.</p>

The lot read out someting like this, we are stunned when we read it.<br><br><br>The Lot says " One should not don ancient costume when not suitable, what lies ahead is only dirt and thorns. When 3 is of 1 heart, all will be fine.<br><br>If u read my story so far, Don ancient costume means become medium, 3 of 1 heart excatly, me, A and gf add up is 3.

Took a queue no, pray, and i begged all the Gods in the temple to help us and W, and went coffeeshop cos its only about 3 plus, medium trance always start 7.30 or 8pm.<br><br>Sitting and discussing, the lot says 3 of a heart, but gf is out liao. Cant do much as well. <br><br>5 plus my gf called again and question me where am i? i lied we go walk ard, but she just say "Dun tink i duno, wat u guys doing?" " Anything Find my shifu" She threatened me and say if i dun listen to her, she will breakup with me. This time round for once i nvr give in, course i know i need to do this to help her. She hanged up the phone.<br><br>6plus i sms her, exchange of sms, i keep telling her dun break, we been thru so much, how much and how deep our love is.<br><br>Love is a powerful ting, it can soften a person temper, it can oso give a person courage.<br><br>She asked me how is A? A ask me say he very jialat nw. So i told her A very jialat and xinku, and oso ask her if she wanted to come and help me look after A cos i scared i cannot handle.<br>Surprisingly gf says ok and says she will come down.<br><br>To myself i guess she managed control her mind awhile, being worried i went into temple and begged every individual God to help escort her here make sure she can reach here.<br><br>True enuff she reached here, we are so glad. I immediately show her the Guanyin Pusa lot, and she oso says she find that temple werid oso. See the way afternoon n now she tok so different.<br><br>My friend was served assigned to "Tua Ah Pek" and my gf was "Li Ah Pek". We all told them our situation, "Tua Ah Pek helped my frd lightup brighter the forehead fire, As for gf, Li Ah Pek tell us we still had to go back to that temple and tell her shifu that she dunwan be medium. When finished and before going off, one temple helper remind us not to mention we ever been to this temple seek help.</div>

Its my frd becoming funni, me chant in my heart cos my friend during afternoon juz taught me a chant. When i chant in my heart, my friend become frustrated and told us stopped chanting. <br><br>Chant from heart, lips never even moved leh. How he know?? I know his not rite liao. Me and gf sent A home and we agreed meet tomoror after gf knocked off. Me and A happen to be jobless taking a break that stage. </div>

              <div>it was still ard july07.<br><br>My frd A quiet down and says he ok after the "Jiu Tian Xuan NU" help.<br><br>For me and gf, many problems and her temper i had to endure. When i cannot take it, i went to bugis Guanyin Pusa for advice. I cannot recalled the whole lot, only thing i remember is something wait for the golden rooster.<br><br>Back home i started tinking "Golden Rooster"??? I asked my mum, we got any relatives is a rooster??<br><br>Indeed, Pusa never leave u to died. My great aunt is born in year of rooster, She oso a buddhist and taken 3refuge. Lastime she say we pray God and Buddha is different. I oso tell my mum she a joker, both take joss stick where got different.<br><br>I get mum call her up, tell her about my case, her advise is asked us go her temple there pray or chant.<br><br>U guys know something??? If u got spirits with u, u got soooooo many problems and obstruction to reach where u want to go where there is buddhism.<br><br>We arrange go on sun, and it will be sun after sun. Cos days before we will endup quarrel, or she will cannot sleep at nite and cannot wakeup morning or she will at nite diarrohoe.<br><br>Finally we reached there, but not able to chant cos duno y i forget liao oso. Its at bukit gombak "Zulin Shi" .</div>
              <div><br>Tho never chant we ended up at the basement at the Thousand Arms Guanyin Pusa, by chance they are playing a VCD of Venerable Chuanxi, and it so happen that one of his topic is about ghost and Medium possession. My gf was interested in listening, however the aunties there all talk and very noisy. She got piss off and left the hall, we then proceed to the top library to read books.<br><br>Library theres a librarian, endup i tok to her about our case and she recommend us watch the Venerable Chuanxi vcd, actually its her who play the VCD at the hall earlier, she then say she will lend us the VCD home.<br><br>Back home when we watch, i then start to know whats taoism and buddhism difference. <br><br>Not to offend, but not all temples with mediums are Gods. Some are spirits but they do not wish to harm humans as well, they too are seeking enlightenment to be Gods, minus points is however they are just like humans with emotions.<br><br>From the Vcd, after hearing wat Venerable Chuanxi is capble of, my confident in buddhism grows. I began finding news on Venerable Chuanxi and realise he will be in Singapore in Aug07. I was so happy and thinking to myself died died muz seek his help.<br><br>Suddenly my gf tell me she very stressed and booked a trip for both of us to phuket. Immediately i checked the dates, and the day we back to spore is 5plus pm is the day Venerable Chuanxi event at 7pm.<br><br>All is not lost and i pray to Guanyin Pusa to help us able to be back in time for the event.<br><br>Off we went to Phuket, do u all know whats in mind other than able to reach the Venerable Chuanxi Fahui??<br>My mind is in extreme fear, i am thinking is the spirit trying to lure me away from my home and spore so as to deal with me??? At phuket where got temples can help?? Home i at least got my family members around, travel abit got Bugis temple. The 3 days 2 nites is really a fear factor.<br><br>Finally we were back to spore at 6plus, we unload stuff at my home and we race to the event fahui. We managed to reach there 7Plus, it was crowded but we managed get seats at the back. However ..</div>

              <p>After the Suai Yuan. Life back to the same, enduring her tempers over slightest things. My investment failed already in debt plus so long nvr work run here. Worst is so stress smoke almost 2packets cigarettes daily.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One day, ard sep07, i brought my gf to "Ju Shi Lin". Somehow she endup throw temper and raise voice to me, i was so helpless, cos i am thinking hw come the spirits so powerful?? Here the temple so big and so many buddhas here.<br><br>Therefore me and her sit in the main hall, in front the Biggest Buddha who is Amituofuo i ever see in my life. <br><br>I sat there grumbling and voicing out my frustration of all the encounters. We left the temple thereafter.<br><br>That nite or a nite after, i had a dream. This dream is so precious to me that even if someone give me a Million cash to trade for the dream, i will not hestitate say no. Cos i rather be a begger to forgo this dream.<br><br><br><br>MY DREAM<br><br>I dreamt i was like in the skys, surroundings are clouds. Infront of me i can only see the lower part of... if i am 1cm tall the person infront of me is about 20cm tall bah.<br><br>I looked up, and i saw exactly the same Buddha at the "Ju Shi Lin" temple. He was so big in size, he was talking to me but i cannot hear what he say to me, all i know was i can only see his lips mumbling.<br><br>The next day when i awoke, everything about me changes. My fear is gone, I know our encounter is our karma, the spirits are all actually very poor beings suffering as well, infact the spirits, the tangki temple are all our benefactors, without them without this encounter, i will never know whats is buddhism.<br><br>Thus this dream to me is priceless. Since young i only have nightmares, watever monster u can think of i had it. Werewolfs, ghost, chinese vampires, draculas, anacondas, alligators, tigers, lions, snakes, even elephants can oso run after me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Around Oct07 i went to take on a new job.<br><br>Since the shifu ting every nite is a rountine i pray to Guanyin Pusa to look after her.<br><br>There will be times she throw temper then she says ok she will go back to her shifu. Her hp will be off and no where to find her. WHat i can only do is prayed and begged Guanyin Pusa helped. Once i kowtow till my forehead really bruised.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Around Nov07. Once i really cannot take it liao. I send my problem to Kong Meng San using their feedback section.<br><br>They read my encounter and a guy called me up, however he oso mentioned he got a frd but the case is depression. Walua if my gf depression can have such powers to know what u doing or what other people going to say. Think everyone will rather have depression rite.<br><br>He suggested me seeking help from Drophen Ling. He told me they specialized in helping these kinda of cases. I went down meetup with them, give them gf name and date of birth, they can check her just with these info.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Around Dec 07. <br>My workplace collegue got 1guy can fortune tell by just ur chinese name, quite zun. He oso borned with yinyang eyes and oso a rooster. i manage get him n gf n me for dinner. After that he told me wat he saw is ard a 7 or 8 yrs old boy spirit with her. I then guesses it must have been the abortion she had with her ex then.<br><br><br>True after sometime DroPhenling got back to me, and told me her case very serious especially nxt yr08. They will need to do 2 pujas, and she told me the cost was 1K plus for both, cos the ingredients use is very rare and expensive. I told her i not abled to afford. She told me try ask family chide in. i nvr asked ard cos if 1k plus can really settled it, i am most willing,  cos thai monks spent about 200odd but no results.<br><br><br>I have not been a filial son by becourse of a gf whom i love dragged my family into these kinda of stress. All the more wont ask them for $. I looked to sky and pray to Pusa and thank her for showing me a path, but i am sorry that i cant afford it.<br><br>U know something? after that jan08, the gal called me back and asked me how come never get back to her??? i told her i cannot afford, and she tell me maybe they charge me $100 for it cos the ingredients really very rare and exp. i agreed immediately.<br><br>U know something more amazing???? We went bugis pray cos i wanted to thank Pusa, happen then my gf wanted to draw $$ from atm, we went to the POSB teller near the trishaw there, we went up and the teller opened and 2 $50 came out again, we call out to the previous queuer infront of us but nowhere in sight le. We took the $100 cos if not people take oso. We change them into all $10 and give all the beggers we see till $100 given out.<br><br><br>Appt with them was made without my gf knowledge, and i had to postpone 3 or 4 times. cos suddenly company keep need her go korea or US.

              <p>The next day i brought to the Drophening, we arrived there without much obstacles cos everynite i been praying for Pusa help.<br><br>Its tibetan Buddhism over there. My gf keep telling me she is alright, i say never mind juz $200 only cos i was told its 100per puja. I was then told the first puja to be done is the darma protector puja, the 2nd is demon destroying puja.<br><br>We sat down and about 6 or 7 tibet monks started chanting...<br><br>Everything is quiet i see no reaction, there am i thinking liao.. Eh no power??<br><br>Towards the end of the first she only feel very tired and weak. When finished, the helper told us we had to come back in the afternoon for the 2nd puja.<br><br>My gf start grumbling to me says very tired, wants to go home sleep, dunwan go for the 2nd puja. I told her i hungry, lets go eat, she reply okie and she wants to eat meat cos she feels hungry as well. But in my heart i keep praying and reciting Guanyin Pusa ask her to help me successfully bring her back for 2nd puja.<br><br>I suggest go bugis eat cos i like the porridge there, once reached, i told her since here lets as well pray to Guanyin Pusa in the the temple. We prayed. Amazingly when we are out walking towards the market hawkers, we pass the vegeterian shop which is just outside near the temple. SHe told me she just pray to Pusa and feel like eating vegets to respect her. Yeah for me cos first problem solved, cos the puja is best required she is on veget.<br><br>After eating, i say lets go back for the 2nd puja. Amazingly again she didnot object.<br><br><br>The 2nd puja "demon destroying puja" begin, i hear the name of the puja i somehow got more confident. After a while, no response from gf, she sat there quiet and guaiguai like tat, I excused myslf to go out toilet, when i ask the helper if she ok? The helper say wait u see.<br><br>I rejoin my gf, finally i can see results.<br><br>Her head started shaking milding just like when she medium trance. She oso funny tell me she okie but ask me y her head shaking. Soon after she shake more violently, and she started crying very loud, non stop crying. When the puja finished, i thanked the monks, but i oso duno whats the result or so, cos i dun understd their language, the helpers there oso are out for lunch.<br><br><br>We left the place happily. Course the way my gf talk was just like when i first knew her. Very cheerful and bubbly.. She even told me this place very good helped people, and must make sure like once a while or a mth come back here to be volunteer help out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I asked her y she cried lastnite and oso dun let me hugged her.  She finally related to me y she was upset. She told me when i told her tmr need bring her drophening, she know straight away her childs will be gone. lets y she very upset and refuse me hug her and sleep. She ask to see them, and saw a boy about 8yrs old, and a smaller child 1yr old odd but unclear the sex gender, 8yr is the one with ex partner abortion, 1yr is the one with miscarriage with me in year 06.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Things are all fine, we carry on sunday chanting at bukit gombak "Zulin Shi".<br><br>Slowly we cut down our visits, due to her work, due to her tiredness, due to taking for granted. And slowly she lost her caring ways to me as well. As and when our quarrels become more, over different issues.  <br><br><br>Finally something happen, one fine day when we are there for chanting, she told me she very tired y not i chant and she go basement or library seat and wait for me finish.<br><br>I lost my cool and tell her we already here le, and we argue, cos she tell me, give her time, dun force her into the religion.<br><br>I told her straight our life is as such that if we both never chant, we will never had a future. Course i know many things will happen to disrupt us.<br><br>I walkout from her and went out smoke. At the same time i realise, a ghost, a ant, a animal or human. All is same and equal and infront of Guanyin Pusa. Doesnt means ur a human, Pusa will condemn the spirit, all are equal to her.<br><br>I went back to temple and rejoin her, after taking some books, we left for breakfast. Course i oso decided, very tired, dunwan force her anymore, just let heaven decide our fate. </p>

              <p>Year 08 after the 2pujas.<br>After stopping our chanting, life was back to only our realtionship problems, the spirits issue i leave it be cos i very tired mentally le, cos might have might dun have, dun want to let my mind wander too much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fast forward Ard June2009</p>
              <p>We had a quarrel and she got upset and brokedown!! Sitting on her bed she was crying, and suddenly her body are weak and trembling. Her head start shaking like trance. I immediately went over and hugged her, hold her head, comfort her, apologised, pray to Guanyin Pusa for help.<br><br>I managed cool her down. She begged me dun hurt or give her stress anymore. Cos once she stressed she will like that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For her career, suddenly she got sickness but not H1N1 but keep on sick and at same time resigned from her job, cos health plus her final exams coming.<br><br>This decision of her take away stress from work, but come another new stress which is financial.<br>One nite she sms me ask me to move on in life and forget her, she cannot take the stress anymore and wants to died. Immediately i rushed over, she was just laying on her bed, like a body with no soul, i quickly on the "Da Peh Chou" and again ask Pusa for help. <br><br>Guess what she told me. She wants me to read storys for her sleep, and ask point to me the books, Kaoz the title is like 3 little pigs, these kinda of storys. I read books after books and she fall asleep. <br><br>I know things are going too far liao, i browse online and chanced upon a webiste forum. <a href="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">www.lioncity.net Driver Error</span></span></a><br><br>I went in and write my story under "My Encounter" seeking help. Soon replies came in. 1guy who is singaporean as well pm me.<br><br>Soon we liasied thru sms, he recommend me to "CHANGSAN BUDDHIST SOCIETY" Before i bring my gf there, again i went bugis Guanyin Pusa for lots, issit ok to seek help there?? The lot was good, and off we went.<br><br>However that place told us my gf okay not spirits disturbing her, Just pray often will do.<br><br>After that she managed found another job and oso got her degree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whole year of 2009 we only went chanting at "Zulin Shi' temple once after the changsan buddhist society, however when we are there, she didnt join in with all sangha members to chant, she says again same dun forced her into it, dun rush cos she say during chanting Guanyin Pusa name and doing the "rua fo" very mushy. So she just seat in but in the same hall.<br><br>After the chanting, i ask her does she feel better, she only comment that when chanting started she only felt as tho got a Big Bell bang into her.<br><br>I told her its okay, we just try fortnightly chants, but i guess we nvr went back again due to her work high commitments and health.</p>

              <p>It's good that you've realised the above. Every being has a right to exist in the Universe. We should not view ourselves as superior above all others, regardless of beliefs or faiths or skin colour or species. Instead, we should help other beings wherever possible, should they pass our way. Everything in Life happens for a reason. There are no coincidences in Life. There are different ways to help lost souls or negative spirits move on to the respective realm; one of the ways was used in your case.  </p>
              <p>Kuan Yin must have answered your prayers because you were finally true of heart, and knew you truly cared for your gf. Kuan Yin is an extremely caring being, who often assists people true of heart to help lost souls and spirits move on, as the lost souls will be stuck in our 3rd dimension (considered as 'middle of nowhere' to the lost souls) if no one helps them.</p>
              <p>Hope things have since turned out well for you and your gf. Let Nature takes its course. Everyone has his/her own learning journey to walk.</p>

              <p>Hi, thanks a lot for taking the effort to type out your story... certainly a very interesting one and I have to say you are very very fortunate to have discovered what Buddhism is. Many people cannot distinguish between Taoism and Buddhism. As I was explaining in the other thread, those so called deities are actually from the spirit realm or as OhGreat mentioned, they are 'ghost kings'. As a Buddhist, we do not practice these things so as not to form the karma and affiliation with this realm, though we do have compassion equally for all living beings alike, understanding that all beings do seek to end suffering and attain nirvana.</p>
              <p>May I know.. you mentioned that the aborted child spirit has left since the Drophenling puja. Is she still disturbed by spirits after that, and is she feeling better now?</p>

              <p>Your girlfriend has internal conflicts and guilt issues.</p>
              <p>Guilt and conflict about leaving her and family's faith. Personally, I feels she thinks is being punished for abandoning her religion. And the trauma of losing one children especially through abortion. Hence all the negativity.</p>
              <p>When one is ingrained that everybody are born sinners and can only receive salvation through eternal grace , and everything else is the agent of the devil, you got a helluva guilt trip! </p>
              <p>My mother,  in her last years of her life, confided me of her "sins" of aborting foetuses , during the"two is enough" policy. Mother loves children, and she never got over her guilt. </p>
              <p>And although she took the Three Refuges, she studied under christian nuns when she was a child, she uses references like the "devil will catch you" and such.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is do transfer merit"chao du "puja for the her children and you, daily do transfer of merits after to the children after your prayers especially in her presence and slowly get her to do the same . In the same breath also to her parents and family. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not know whether the aborted child has left anot, cos i did not ask the tibetan monks due to language barrier plus the helpers all out. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When we ever do fortnight chanting at Zulin Shi during late 2007, "PuMen Ping", she ever told me she feel happy after chanting, and ask me promise her if she dunwan to go, no matter what force her even by saying breakup. And def she will go. Duno which year she oso say wana take 3refuge so no spirits can disturb her. But soon we stopped and i nvr did forced her cos this encounter oso drained me physically and mentally, cos either she unwell or too tired and stress from work.  08 and 09 she studying for degree. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastime she went with me was last yr09 ard june.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now whatever she say to me nvr fulfill even certain small things. There is countless times i wanted to give up the relationship. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last Sun, i told her that i will fulfil the one promise i nvr fulfill to her. I be forcing her go chanting once a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I ask her about taking 3refuge?  Her comments is saying she already stressed liao when i force her go chant if not break.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What shld i say?? Split personality??? I just told her what i am doing now is what she say before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I duno if the child still with her, or it maybe other spirits,  cos i believe she done the swearing "Kaiguang" ceremony, so i believe its easier for any spirits to entered her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Paiseh very long story, cos saw the thai medium thread, so decided to post to let other be aware and choose the path wisely.  For info, a spirit can wait 10, 20 years to wear u down, in order to possess u .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i can only do now is try ensure she go chanting and see how from there. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Things in life everything is like a coin, two sided, its either positive or negative.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u look at it in a positive way, the spirits are all benefactors, cos they are pushing us back to buddhism.</p>

              <p>You must find a qualified person who has great spiritual power to intervene, to broker a deal between you and the spirits. You might want to look for Nyingma or Kagyu Rinpoches to help you. </p>

              <p>Yes if the problem persist due to karmic 'affinity' or 'debt' then have to find someone to help. The kaiguang can create a certain 'affinity'.</p>

              <p><em>Have you practised concentration without 
                      proper guidance
                                              especially in focusing between the eyebrow? Cos 
                      this can open up
                                              the channel for medium.</em></p>
              <p><em><br> I am told by a friend.. thusness, that <span>There
                       are several
                                              reasons, it can arise due to karmic affinity, it
                       can arise due to
                                              karmic debt, it can arise due to wrong 
                      practices. If he practice
                                              concentration without proper guide especially 
                      focusing in between
                                              the eyebrown, it might open up the channel for 
                      medium. Without
                                              proper guidance, this could happen.</span><br><br> If it is due to karmic affinity and karmic debt,
                       then i think it is
                                              easier to solve as the experience negotiator can
                       do something about
                                              it. But if one practices wrongly, that level 
                      stays and is
                                              open...this can be quite troublesome.</em></p>
              <p><em>...Yes thats right. Often this needs to be 
                      done.. if you want to
                                              overcome yourself without such help with 
                      negotiators, then you must
                                              be prepared to suffer many years, it can take 
                      years and depends
                                              on your practice. No doctors can help. </em></p>
              <p><em>If you practice no-self and is able to experience presence in the correct way, it does not affect you. Because there will be no entry point. When we are constantly authenticated by Presence and there is no entry for that trance level to take place. That level of consciousness does not exist. No external forces can forcefully create that communication unless it is open due to some reason. Due to lack of proper practices.</em></p>
