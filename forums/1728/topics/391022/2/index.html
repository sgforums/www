              <p>Yes. suicide is an escapism. according to master chin kong, those who die via suicide, will be reborn as a ghost. the ghost will want to find a substitute, otherwise once every 7 days, he/she will relive the scene of the suicide once more. the lifespan of a ghost is very long, minimum a few hundred years old.</p>
              <p>so those people who died 2000 years ago, reborn as a ghost when they die, they still wander as a ghost till this day and age.</p>

              <p>depends on their last thought moment and their karma. I really dunno what they will be reborn. if they have this mentality in this lifetime, then their next lifetime will be the same. heard of old habits die hard. the only way out of rebirth is enlightenment or Nirvana. no more rebirth after enlightenment.</p>

              <p>depends on their last thought moment and their karma. I really dunno what they will be reborn. if they have this mentality in this lifetime, then their next lifetime will be the same. heard of old habits die hard. the only way out of rebirth is enlightenment or Nirvana. no more rebirth after enlightenment. The 4 Noble Truths are the best of Truths.</p>

              <p>haha dun blame you lar. I did quite well for my RK though because I have interest in it.</p>
              <p>Doubt I also understand what the 4 Noble Truths were then. Now I deeply realised and understand what it means. Life is suffering. causes of rebirth/existence are craving and ignorance. There is a way to end suffering called Nirvana and the way to end suffering is Noble Eightfold Path. The best of path is the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

              <p>Yes but she should also understand that it is in her best interest and the interest of the child to take rebirth in a higher realm. It is very pitiful for the child to be stuck in the ghost realm.</p>
              <p>She can help her child take birth in human or other higher realms by dedicating merits to the deceased. Whether by attending pujas, donating, or other virtuous deeds. And this is also not enough... she should practice dharma seriously and dedicate her entire lifetime of merits to the child. She should also repent for the abortion.</p>

              <p>TS, abortion is already unwholesome and now the attachment to the ghost child? in the first place you shouldnt have aborted the foetus and now because of your gf attachmentt o teh foetus? this is really foolish, unwholesome and ignorant to say the least. sorry if I am being harsh. if the foetus can speak, did you ever ask for his/her feelings of being unwanted? if it can speak, what do you think are the words it can say out its feelings?</p>
              <p>Karma has already manifested itself on your gf's guilt. usually those who abort the foetus will feel guilty for the rest of their lives. if you really want to show regret of your actions, perhaps you should made sure not to repeat this ever again, no matter what circumstances you are in.  you can volunteer yourself in children's home, or to even adopt a child. as mentioned from others, you can transfer merits to the foetus in the hope that he/she can reborn better than his/her existing condition. offering to donate money to print dhamma books is one way, donating robes to the sangha is another, or to donate money to the temple or even volunteering yourself in the temple.</p>

              <p>You may ask you gf to buy a statues of guan yin and has the name of your feotus write on it and put it in the temple and they will pray for your foetus to quickly go reborn again. That is the only way your gf can do if your gf really love the child. Give your child a door to go and rebirth. Though it might hurt your gf heart, time will heal.</p>

              <p>May2006. A sad incident happened, she was back from US working trip and developed rashes due to climate. The GP gave her an injection. Then things all went wrong. She realised she was pregnant and the gyno told her our child does not have any heartbeat and miscarriage due to the injection. I was devasted and accompany her for the operation. I wanted to sue the doc who gave the injection without asking anything like r u plannings for kids or filling any questions forms.</p>
              <p>For me and her, our baby is without heartbeat and dead in the tummy. I dun have any choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when she was with her ex, she did done an abortion that was maybe about 10years ago.</p>
