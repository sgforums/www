              <p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>An informal talk given at 
              Ajahn Chah's kuti, to a group of lay people, one evening in 1978.</em></span></p>
              <hr>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There 
              are two ways to support Buddhism. One is known as <em>Ä�misapÅ«jÄ�</em>, 
              supporting through material offerings. These are the four requisites of 
              food, clothing, shelter and medicine. This is to support Buddhism by 
              giving material offerings to the <em>Sangha</em> of monks and nuns, 
              enabling them to live in reasonable comfort for the practice of Dhamma. 
              This fosters the direct realization of the Buddha's teaching, in turn 
              bringing continued prosperity to the Buddhist religion.</p>
              <p>Buddhism can be likened to a 
              tree. A tree has roots, a trunk, branches, twigs and leaves. All the 
              leaves and branches, including the trunk, depend on the roots to absorb 
              nutriment from the soil and send it out to them. In the same way as the 
              tree depends on the roots to sustain it, our actions and our speech are 
              like ''branches'' and ''leaves,'' which depend on the mind, the 
              ''root,'' absorbing nutriment, which it then sends out to the ''trunk'',
               ''branches'' and ''leaves.'' These in turn bear fruit as our speech and
               actions. Whatever state the mind is in, skillful or unskillful, it 
              expresses that quality outwardly through our actions and speech.</p>
              <p>Therefore the support of 
              Buddhism through the practical application of the teaching is the most 
              important kind of support. For example, in the ceremony of determining 
              the precepts on observance days, the teacher describes those unskillful 
              actions which should be avoided. But if you simply go through the 
              ceremony of determining the precepts without reflecting on their 
              meaning, progress is difficult. You will be unable to find the true 
              practice. The real support of Buddhism must therefore be done through <em>patipattipÅ«jÄ�</em>,
               the ''offering'' of practice, cultivating true restraint, concentration
               and wisdom. Then you will know what Buddhism is all about. If you don't
               understand through practice you still won't know, even if you learn the
               whole <em>Tipitaka</em>.</p>
              <p>In the time of the Buddha there was a monk known as 
              Tuccho Pothila. Tuccho Pothila was very learned, thoroughly versed in 
              the scriptures and texts. He was so famous that he was revered by people
               everywhere and had eighteen monasteries under his care. When people 
              heard the name ''Tuccho Pothila'' they were awe-struck and nobody would 
              dare question anything he taught, so much did they revere his command of
               the teachings. Tuccho Pothila was one of the Buddha's most learned 
              disciples.</p>
              <p>One day
               he went to pay respects to the Buddha. As he was paying his respects, 
              the Buddha said, ''Ah, hello, Venerable Empty Scripture!''... just like 
              that! They conversed for a while until it was time to go, and then, as 
              he was taking leave of the Buddha, the Buddha said, ''Oh, leaving now, 
              Venerable Empty Scripture?''</p>
              <p>That was all the Buddha said. On arriving, ''Oh, hello,
               Venerable Empty Scripture.'' When it was time to go, ''Ah, leaving now,
               Venerable Empty Scripture?'' The Buddha didn't expand on it, that was 
              all the teaching he gave. Tuccho Pothila, the eminent teacher, was 
              puzzled, ''Why did the Buddha say that? What did he mean?'' He thought 
              and thought, turning over everything he had learned, until eventually he
               realized... ''It's true! Venerable Empty Scripture - a monk who studies
               but doesn't practice.'' When he looked into his heart he saw that 
              really he was no different from lay people. Whatever they aspired to he 
              also aspired to, whatever they enjoyed he also enjoyed. There was no 
              real <em>samana</em><a title="tex2html111" name="tex2html111" href="http://www.forestsangha.org.uk/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=28%3Aliving-dhamma&amp;id=226%3Atuccho-pothila-venerable-empty-scripture&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default&amp;page=&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=6#foot5390"><sup>1</sup></a> within him, no truly profound 
              quality capable of firmly establishing him in the Noble Way and 
              providing true peace.</p>
              <p>So he decided to practice. But there was nowhere for 
              him to go to. All the teachers around were his own students, no-one 
              would dare accept him. Usually when people meet their teacher they 
              become timid and deferential, and so no-one would dare become his 
              teacher.</p>
              <p>Finally 
              he went to see a certain young novice, who was enlightened, and asked to
               practice under him. The novice said, ''Yes, sure you can practice with 
              me, but only if you're sincere. If you're not sincere then I won't 
              accept you.'' Tuccho Pothila pledged himself as a student of the novice.</p>
              <p>The novice then 
              told him to put on all his robes. Now there happened to be a muddy bog 
              nearby. When Tuccho Pothila had neatly put on all his robes, expensive 
              ones they were, too, the novice said, ''Okay, now run down into this 
              muddy bog. If I don't tell you to stop, don't stop. If I don't tell you 
              to come out, don't come out. Okay... run!''</p>
              <p>Tuccho Pothila, neatly robed, plunged into the bog. 
              The novice didn't tell him to stop until he was completely covered in 
              mud. Finally he said, ''You can stop, now''... so he stopped. ''Okay, 
              come on up!''... and so he came out.</p>
              <p>This clearly showed that Tuccho Pothila had given up 
              his pride. He was ready to accept the teaching. If he wasn't ready to 
              learn he wouldn't have run into the bog like that, being such a famous 
              teacher, but he did it. The young novice, seeing this, knew that Tuccho 
              Pothila was sincerely determined to practice.</p>
              <p>When Tuccho Pothila had come out of the bog, 
              the novice gave him the teaching. He taught him to observe the sense 
              objects, to know the mind and to know the sense objects, using the 
              simile of a man catching a lizard hiding in a termite mound. If the 
              mound had six holes in it, how would he catch it? He would have to seal 
              off five of the holes and leave just one open. Then he would have to 
              simply watch and wait, guarding that one hole. When the lizard ran out 
              he could catch it.</p>
              <p>Observing the mind is like this. Closing off the eyes, ears, nose, 
              tongue and body, we leave only the mind. To ''close off'' the senses 
              means to restrain and compose them, observing only the mind. Meditation 
              is like catching the lizard. We use <em>sati</em> to note the breath. <em>Sati</em> is the quality of recollection, as in asking yourself, ''What am I 
              doing?'' <em>Sampajañña</em> is the awareness that ''now I am doing such
               and such.'' We observe the in and out breathing with <em>sati</em> and <em>sampajañña</em>.</p>
              <p>This quality of 
              recollection is something that arises from practice, it's not something 
              that can be learned from books. Know the feelings that arise. The mind 
              may be fairly inactive for a while and then a feeling arises. <em>Sati</em> works in conjunction with these feelings, recollecting them. There is <em>sati</em>,
               the recollection that ''I will speak,'' ''I will go,'' ''I will sit'' 
              and so on, and then there is <em>sampajañña</em>, the awareness that 
              ''now I am walking,'' ''I am lying down,'' ''I am experiencing such and 
              such a mood.'' With these two things, <em>sati</em> and <em>sampajañña</em>,
               we can know our minds in the present moment. We will know how the mind 
              reacts to sense impressions.</p>
              <p>That which is aware of sense objects is called 
              ''mind.'' Sense objects ''wander into'' the mind. For instance, there is
               a sound, like the electric planer here. It enters through the ear and 
              travels inwards to the mind, which acknowledges that it is the sound of 
              an electric planer. That which acknowledges the sound is called 
              ''mind.''</p>
              <p>Now this
               mind which acknowledges the sound is still quite basic. It's just the 
              average mind. Perhaps annoyance arises within this one who acknowledges.
               We must further train ''the one who acknowledges'' to become ''the one 
              who knows'' in accordance with the truth - known as <em>Buddho</em>. If 
              we don't clearly know in accordance with the truth then we get annoyed 
              at sounds of people, cars, electric planer and so on. This is just the 
              ordinary, untrained mind acknowledging the sound with annoyance. It 
              knows in accordance with its preferences, not in accordance with the 
              truth. We must further train it to know with vision and insight, <em>ñÄ�nadassana</em><a title="tex2html112" name="tex2html112" href="http://www.forestsangha.org.uk/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=28%3Aliving-dhamma&amp;id=226%3Atuccho-pothila-venerable-empty-scripture&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default&amp;page=&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=6#foot1429"><sup>2</sup></a>, the power of the refined mind, so
               that it knows the sound as simply sound. If we don't cling to sound 
              there is annoyance. The sound arises and we simply note it. This is 
              called truly knowing the arising of sense objects. If we develop the 
              Buddho, clearly realizing the sound as sound, then it doesn't annoy us. 
              It arises according to conditions, it is not a being, an individual, a 
              self, an ''us'' or ''them.'' It's just sound. The mind lets go.</p>
              <p>This knowing is called <em>Buddho</em>,
               the knowledge that is clear and penetrating. With this knowledge we can
               let the sound be simply sound. It doesn't disturb us unless we disturb 
              it by thinking, ''I don't want to hear that sound, it's annoying.'' 
              Suffering arises because of this thinking. Right here is the cause of 
              suffering, that we don't know the truth of this matter, we haven't 
              developed the <em>Buddho</em>. We are not yet clear, not yet awake, not 
              yet aware. This is the raw, untrained mind. This mind is not yet truly 
              useful to us.</p>
              <p>Therefore the Buddha taught that this mind must be trained and 
              developed. We must develop the mind just like we develop the body, but 
              we do it in a different way. To develop the body we must exercise it, 
              jogging in the morning and evening and so on. This is exercising the 
              body. As a result the body becomes more agile, stronger, the respiratory
               and nervous systems become more efficient. To exercise the mind we 
              don't have to move it around, but bring it to a halt, bring it to rest.</p>
              <p>For instance, when
               practicing meditation, we take an object, such as the in- and 
              out-breathing, as our foundation. This becomes the focus of our 
              attention and reflection. We note the breathing. To note the breathing 
              means to follow the breathing with awareness, noting its rhythm, its 
              coming and going. We put awareness into the breath, following the 
              natural in and out breathing and letting go of all else. As a result of 
              staying on one object of awareness, our mind becomes refreshed. If we 
              let the mind think of this, that and the other there are many objects of
               awareness, the mind doesn't unify, it doesn't come to rest.</p>
              <p>To say the mind stops means 
              that it feels as if it's stopped, it doesn't go running here and there. 
              It's like having a sharp knife. If we use the knife to cut at things 
              indiscriminately, such as stones, bricks and grass, our knife will 
              quickly become blunt. We should use it for cutting only the things it 
              was meant for. Our mind is the same. If we let the mind wander after 
              thoughts and feelings which have no value or use, the mind becomes tired
               and weak. If the mind has no energy, wisdom will not arise, because the
               mind without energy is the mind without <em>samÄ�dhi</em>.</p>
              <p>If the mind hasn't stopped 
              you can't clearly see the sense objects for what they are. The knowledge
               that the mind is the mind, sense objects are merely sense objects, is 
              the root from which Buddhism has grown and developed. This is the heart 
              of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>We 
              must cultivate this mind, develop it, training it in calm and insight. 
              We train the mind to have restraint and wisdom by letting the mind stop 
              and allowing wisdom to arise, by knowing the mind as it is.</p>
              <p>You know, the way we human 
              beings are, the way we do things, are just like little children. A child
               doesn't know anything. To an adult observing the behavior of a child, 
              the way it plays and jumps around, its actions don't seem to have much 
              purpose. If our mind is untrained it is like a child. We speak without 
              awareness and act without wisdom. We may fall to ruin or cause untold 
              harm and not even know it. A child is ignorant, it plays as children do.
               Our ignorant mind is the same.</p>
              <p>So we should train this mind. The Buddha taught to 
              train the mind, to teach the mind. Even if we support Buddhism with the 
              four requisites, our support is still superficial, it reaches only the 
              ''bark'' or ''sapwood'' of the tree. The real support of Buddhism must 
              be done through the practice, nowhere else, training our actions, speech
               and thoughts according to the teachings. This is much more fruitful. If
               we are straight and honest, possessed of restraint and wisdom, our 
              practice will bring prosperity. There will be no cause for spite and 
              hostility. This is how our religion teaches us.</p>
              <p>If we determine the precepts 
              simply out of tradition, then even though the Master teaches the truth 
              our practice will be deficient. We may be able to study the teachings 
              and repeat them, but we have to practice them if we really want to 
              understand. If we do not develop the practice, this may well be an 
              obstacle to our penetrating to the heart of Buddhism for countless 
              lifetimes to come. We will not understand the essence of the Buddhist 
              religion.</p>
              <p>Therefore the practice is like a key, the key of meditation. If we have 
              the right key in our hand, no matter how tightly the lock is closed, 
              when we take the key and turn it the lock falls open. If we have no key 
              we can't open the lock. We will never know what it is in the trunk.</p>
              <p>Actually there are two kinds
               of knowledge. One who knows the Dhamma doesn't simply speak from 
              memory, he speaks the truth. Worldly people usually speak with conceit. 
              For example, suppose there were two people who hadn't seen each other 
              for a long time, maybe they had gone to live in different provinces or 
              countries for a while, and then one day they happened to meet on the 
              train... ''Oh! What a surprise. I was just thinking of looking you 
              up!''... Actually it's not true. Really they hadn't thought of each 
              other at all, but they say so out of excitement. And so it becomes a 
              lie. Yes, it's lying out of heedlessness. This is lying without knowing 
              it. It's a subtle form of defilement, and it happens very often.</p>
              <p>So with regard to the mind, 
              Tuccho Pothila followed the instructions of the novice: breathing in, 
              breathing out... mindfully aware of each breath... until he saw the liar
               within him, the lying of his own mind. He saw the defilements as they 
              came up, just like the lizard coming out of the termite mound. He saw 
              them and perceived their true nature as soon as they arose. He noticed 
              how one minute the mind would concoct one thing, the next moment 
              something else.</p>
              <p>Thinking is a <em>sankhata dhamma</em>, something which is created or 
              concocted from supporting conditions. It's not <em>asankhata dhamma</em>,
               the unconditioned. The well-trained mind, one with perfect awareness, 
              does not concoct mental states. This kind of mind penetrates to the 
              Noble Truths and transcends any need to depend on externals. To know the
               Noble Truths is to know the truth. The proliferating mind tries to 
              avoid this truth, saying, ''that's good'' or ''this is beautiful,'' but 
              if there is Buddho in the mind it can no longer deceive us, because we 
              know the mind as it is. The mind can no longer create deluded mental 
              states, because there is the clear awareness that all mental states are 
              unstable, imperfect, and a source of suffering to one who clings to 
              them.</p>
              <p>Wherever he 
              went, the one who knows was constantly in Tuccho Pothila's mind. He 
              observed the various creations and proliferation of the mind with 
              understanding. He saw how the mind lied in so many ways. He grasped the 
              essence of the practice, seeing that ''This lying mind is the one to 
              watch - this is the one which leads us into extremes of happiness and 
              suffering and causes us to endlessly spin around in the cycle of <em>samsÄ�ra</em>,
               with its pleasure and pain, good and evil - all because of this one.'' 
              Tuccho Pothila realized the truth, and grasped the essence of the 
              practice, just like a man grasping the tail of the lizard. He saw the 
              workings of the deluded mind.</p>
              <p>For us it's the same. Only this mind is important. 
              That's why they say to train the mind. Now if the mind is the mind, what
               are we going to train it with? By having continuous <em>sati</em> and <em>sampajañña</em> we will be able to know the mind. This one who knows is a step beyond 
              the mind, it is that which knows the state of the mind. The mind is the 
              mind. That which knows the mind as simply mind is the one who knows. It 
              is above the mind. The one who knows is above the mind, and that is how 
              it is able to look after the mind, to teach the mind to know what is 
              right and what is wrong. In the end everything comes back to this 
              proliferating mind. If the mind is caught up in its proliferations there
               is no awareness and the practice is fruitless.</p>
              <p>So we must train this mind to
               hear the Dhamma, to cultivate the <em>Buddho</em>, the clear and 
              radiant awareness, that which exists above and beyond the ordinary mind 
              and knows all that goes on within it. This is why we meditate on the 
              word <em>Buddho</em>, so that we can know the mind beyond the mind. Just
               observe all the mind's movements, whether good or bad, until the one 
              who knows realizes that the mind is simply mind, not a self or a person.
               This is called <em>cittÄ�nupassanÄ�</em>, Contemplation of Mind<a title="tex2html113" name="tex2html113" href="http://www.forestsangha.org.uk/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=28%3Aliving-dhamma&amp;id=226%3Atuccho-pothila-venerable-empty-scripture&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default&amp;page=&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=6#foot1455"><sup>3</sup></a>. Seeing in this way we will 
              understand that the mind is transient, imperfect and ownerless. This 
              mind doesn't belong to us.</p>
              <p>We can summarize thus: The mind is that which 
              acknowledges sense objects; sense objects are sense objects as distinct 
              from the mind; 'the one who knows' knows both the mind and the sense 
              objects for what they are. We must use <em>sati</em> to constantly 
              cleanse the mind. Everybody has <em>sati</em>, even a cat has it when 
              it's going to catch a mouse. A dog has it when it barks at people. This 
              is a form of <em>sati</em>, but it's not <em>sati</em> according to the 
              Dhamma. Everybody has <em>sati</em>, but there are different levels of 
              it, just as there are different levels of looking at things. Like when I
               say to contemplate the body, some people say, ''What is there to 
              contemplate in the body? Anybody can see it. <em>KesÄ�</em> we can see 
              already, <em>lomÄ�</em> we can see already... hair, nails, teeth and skin
               we can see already. So what?''</p>
              <p>This is how people are. They can see the body alright 
              but their seeing is faulty, they don't see with the Buddho, the one who 
              knows, the awakened one. They only see the body in the ordinary way, 
              they see it visually. Simply to see the body is not enough. If we only 
              see the body there is trouble. You must see the body within the body, 
              then things become much clearer. Just seeing the body you get fooled by 
              it, charmed by its appearance. Not seeing transience, imperfection and 
              ownerlessness, <em>kÄ�machanda</em><a title="tex2html114" name="tex2html114" href="http://www.forestsangha.org.uk/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=28%3Aliving-dhamma&amp;id=226%3Atuccho-pothila-venerable-empty-scripture&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default&amp;page=&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=6#foot6746"><sup>4</sup></a> arises. You become fascinated by 
              forms, sounds, odors, flavors and feelings. Seeing in this way is to see
               with the mundane eye of the flesh, causing you to love and hate and 
              discriminate into pleasing and unpleasing.</p>
              <p>The Buddha taught that this is not enough. You must 
              see with the ''mind's eye.'' See the body within the body. If you really
               look into the body... Ugh! It's so repulsive. There are today's things 
              and yesterday's things all mixed up in there, you can't tell what's 
              what. Seeing in this way is much clearer than to see with the carnal 
              eye. Contemplate, see with the eye of the mind, with the wisdom eye.</p>
              <p>People's understandings 
              differ like this. Some people don't know what there is to contemplate in
               the five meditations, head hair, body hair, nails, teeth and skin. They
               say they can see all those things already, but they can only see them 
              with the carnal eye, with this ''crazy eye'' which only looks at the 
              things it wants to look at. To see the body in the body you have to look
               much clearer than that.</p>
              <p>This is the practice that can uproot clinging to the 
              five <em>khandhas</em><a title="tex2html115" name="tex2html115" href="http://www.forestsangha.org.uk/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=28%3Aliving-dhamma&amp;id=226%3Atuccho-pothila-venerable-empty-scripture&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default&amp;page=&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=6#foot5401"><sup>5</sup></a>. To uproot attachment is to uproot
               suffering, because attaching to the five <em>khandhas</em> is the cause
               of suffering. If suffering arises it is here, at the attachment to the 
              five <em>khandhas</em>. It's not that the five <em>khandhas</em> are in 
              themselves suffering, but the clinging to them as being one's own... 
              that's suffering.</p>
              <p>If you clearly see the truth of these things through meditation 
              practice, then suffering becomes unwound, like a screw or a bolt. When 
              the bolt is unwound, it withdraws. The mind unwinds in the same way, 
              letting go, withdrawing from the obsession with good and evil, 
              possessions, praise and status, happiness and suffering.</p>
              <p>If we don't know the truth of
               these things it's like tightening the screw all the time. It gets 
              tighter and tighter until it's crushing you and you suffer over 
              everything. When you know how things are then you unwind the screw. In 
              Dhamma language we call this the arising of <em>nibbidÄ�</em>, 
              disenchantment. You become weary of things and lay down the fascination 
              with them. If you unwind in this way you will find peace.</p>
              <p>The cause of suffering is to 
              cling to things. So we should get rid of the cause, cut off its root and
               not allow it to cause suffering again. People have only one problem - 
              the problem of clinging. Just because of this one thing people will kill
               each other. All problems, be they individual, family or social, arise 
              from this one root. Nobody wins... they kill each other but in the end 
              no-one gets anything. I don't know why people keep on killing each other
               so pointlessly.</p>
              <p>Power, possessions, status, praise, happiness and suffering... these are
               the worldly dhammas. These worldly dhammas engulf worldly beings. 
              Worldly beings are led around by the worldly dhammas: gain and loss, 
              acclaim and slander, status and loss of status, happiness and suffering.
               These dhammas are trouble makers, if you don't reflect on their true 
              nature you will suffer. People even commit murder for the sake of 
              wealth, status or power. Why? Because they take them too seriously. They
               get appointed to some position and it goes to their heads, like the man
               who became headman of the village. After his appointment he became 
              ''power-drunk.'' If any of his old friends came to see he'd say, ''Don't
               come around so often. Things aren't the same anymore.''</p>
              <p>The Buddha taught to 
              understand the nature of possessions, status, praise and happiness. Take
               these things as they come but let them be. Don't let them go to your 
              head. If you don't really understand these things you become fooled by 
              your power, your children and relatives... by everything! If you 
              understand them clearly you know they're all impermanent conditions. If 
              you cling to them they become defiled.</p>
              <p>All of these things arise afterwards. When people are 
              first born there are simply <em>nÄ�ma</em> and <em>rÅ«pa</em>, that's all.
               We add on the business of ''Mr. Jones,'' ''Miss Smith'' or whatever 
              later on. This is done according to convention. Still later there are 
              the appendages of ''Colonel,'' ''General'' and so on. If we don't really
               understand these things we think they are real and carry them around 
              with us. We carry possessions, status, name and rank around. If you have
               power you can call all the tunes... ''Take this one and execute him. 
              Take that one and throw him in jail''... Rank gives power. This word 
              ''rank'' here is where clinging takes hold. As soon as people get rank 
              they start giving orders; right or wrong, they just act on their moods. 
              So they go on making the same old mistakes, deviating further and 
              further from the true path.</p>
              <p>One who understands the Dhamma won't behave like this. 
              Good and evil have been in the world since who knows when... if 
              possessions and status come your way then let them simply be the 
              possessions and status, don't let them become your identity. Just use 
              them to fulfill your obligations and leave it at that. You remain 
              unchanged. If we have meditated on these things, no matter what comes 
              our way we will not be fooled by it. We will be untroubled, unaffected, 
              constant. Everything is pretty much the same, after all.</p>
              <p>This is how the Buddha wanted
               us to understand things. No matter what you receive, the mind adds 
              nothing on to it. They appoint you a city councilor... ''Okay, so I'm a 
              city councilor... but I'm not.'' They appoint you head of the group... 
              ''Sure I am, but I'm not.'' Whatever they make of you... ''Yes I am, but
               I'm not!'' In the end what are we anyway? We all just die in the end. 
              No matter what they make you, in the end it's all the same. What can you
               say? If you can see things in this way you will have a solid abiding 
              and true contentment. Nothing is changed.</p>
              <p>This is not to be fooled by things. Whatever comes 
              your way, it's just conditions. There's nothing which can entice a mind 
              like this to create or proliferate, to seduce it into greed, aversion or
               delusion.</p>
              <p>Now 
              this is to be a true supporter of Buddhism. Whether you are among those 
              who are being supported (i.e., the Sangha) or those who are supporting 
              (the laity) please consider this thoroughly. Cultivate the <em>sÄ«la-dhamma</em><a title="tex2html116" name="tex2html116" href="http://www.forestsangha.org.uk/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=28%3Aliving-dhamma&amp;id=226%3Atuccho-pothila-venerable-empty-scripture&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default&amp;page=&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=6#foot6747"><sup>6</sup></a> within you. This is the surest way
               to support Buddhism. To support Buddhism with the offerings of food, 
              shelter and medicine is good also, but such offerings only reach the 
              ''sapwood'' of Buddhism. Please don't forget this. A tree has bark, 
              sapwood and heartwood, and these three parts are interdependent. The 
              heartwood must rely on the bark and the sapwood. The sapwood relies on 
              the bark and the heartwood. They all exist interdependently, just like 
              the teachings of Moral Discipline, Concentration and Wisdom<a title="tex2html117" name="tex2html117" href="http://www.forestsangha.org.uk/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=28%3Aliving-dhamma&amp;id=226%3Atuccho-pothila-venerable-empty-scripture&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default&amp;page=&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=6#foot6748"><sup>7</sup></a>. Moral Discipline is to establish 
              your speech and actions in rectitude. Concentration is to firmly fix the
               mind. Wisdom is the thorough understanding of the nature of all 
              conditions. Study this, practice this, and you will understand Buddhism 
              in the most profound way.</p>
              <p>If you don't realize these things you will be fooled by
               possessions, fooled by rank, fooled by anything you come into contact 
              with. Simply supporting Buddhism in the external way will never put an 
              end to the fighting and squabbling, the grudges and animosity, the 
              stabbing and shooting. If these things are to cease we must reflect on 
              the nature of possessions, rank, praise, happiness and suffering. We 
              must consider our lives and bring them in line with the teaching. We 
              should reflect that all beings in the world are part of one whole. We 
              are like them, they are like us. They have happiness and suffering just 
              like we do. It's all much the same. If we reflect in this way, peace and
               understanding will arise. This is the foundation of Buddhism.</p>
