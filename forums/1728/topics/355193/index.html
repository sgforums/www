              <p>   This reminds me of an incident which happen on my birthday celebration where my family and relatives were celebrating at east coast park . That time i was very young i can't remember is pri school or maybe even younger .</p>
              <p>   Anyway that day one of my uncle bought me a inflatable 3 men boat as my present . Then my bro , and one cousin was paddling the boat with me sitting inside beside them along the shore then followed by going further and further away from the shore . Suddenly i reliased that we are actually already very far away from the shore with pple shouting at us to go back . But when i look at my bro and my cousin , both of them doesn't seem to realise it and keep on rowing further and further away towardss the container boats in the middle of the sea . I called both of them but only my bro turn to look at me blankly then continue to row again . I became very scared and was about to cry when suddenly a motorboat with i can't remember how many men inside came to stop us and tell my bro and cousin to turn back to shore .</p>
              <p>   Although after the the pple in motorboat stop us from going any further and my bro and cousin were rowing back , both of them didn't say a sound untill we reach shore with my relatives staring at us . By then i was so frightened that i coudn't rememeber what happen after that anymore . I only remember that my bro was scared stiff after reaching shore and couldn't say anything when questioned by my mother and relatives .</p>

              <p>Whatever month is the same, ghosts will be there. 7th month is not a special time, hell gates do not open and ghost do not increase. It is just that it is a time for dedication of merits to the deceased.

              <p>If you were really a water ghost from past life, then it is a 'fortunate mistake' you can be reborn in the human realm.</p>
              <p>Because ghosts belong to the lower realm of sufferings. To be reborn as a human is very fortunate as we belong to the '3 higher realms'.</p>
              <p>Further, human realm has the best opportunity for dharma practice and cultivation, it is a great opportunity to walk the path to liberation and enlightenment.</p>

              dun trust 2 much on your fortune teller, as if he/she has the power to read people's past lives. if you believe in past lives, we were been animals, devas, ghosts, reborn in hell etc, since life has no beginning nor an end, unless you attain Nibbana or Nirvana.
              
              Salvation is achieved by own, Buddha's are teachers who guide you, but you yourself need to walk the talk or teachings.

              <p>Buddhism teaches that there are 6 realms in samsara that we will keep cycling/rebirth uncontrollably by karma until we achieve liberation and enlightenment.</p>
              <p>The 6 realms include:</p>
              <p>3 lower realms - Hell, Ghost, Animal</p>
              <p>3 higher realms - Asura, Human, Heaven</p>
