              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Many people have this question the minute they walk into the zendo and
              are told to make full prostrations to the Buddha image on the altar. They come
              with an idea that Zen is beyond words and letters, beyond religion, beyond
              rules, beyond piety, and so the idea of such a thorough-going and outrageous
              display of what seems like religious fervor seems quite disturbing to them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So why do we bow? I had this same question myself in the beginning of my
              practice. My teacher at the time took me up to the altar and let me look
              closely at the tiny Buddha there. He pointed out to me that the little Buddha
              was also bowing. So I was bowing to the Buddha and the Buddha was bowing to me.
              “If he can do it you can do it,” he said. I thought that was fair enough.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Bowing is just bowing. You do it mindfully, in a particular way, aware
              of the body and mind in the doing of it. The so-called meaning of it is extra.
              It’s not a symbolic or conceptual act. It’s just another form of sitting
              practice. You sit, you walk, the bell rings, you get up and bow. To just do
              what you do withfull attention and without much worry is an important part of
              the method in Zen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>And there’s another way of looking at it: We are bowing to an image
              which suggests for us. So the bowing is a training method. We offer our whole
              body and mind to wisdom or to compassion, opening ourselves, in the act of the
              bow, to that quality letting go of everything else in our life but that
              quality, bringing it out, making it big, fashioning it day by day, bow by bow.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When I bow to the Buddha on the main altar at Green Gulch, I train my
              mind deeply, creating a powerful predisposition in myself toward the
              development of love and appreciation for the Buddha nature that is my own
              nature. When I bow to Tara, I am training my mind, creating a predisposition in
              myself toward the feminine and active in my own nature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This kind of training is not something most of us are used to. Our sense
              of training has largely to do with will or skill, and this kind of training has
              to do with warmth and devotion. Yes, piety. But after all, piety is all right,
              devotion is all right. In fact, they are very tender and splendid emotions if
              you can cultivate them without getting hysterical about it. It’s okay to
              respect Buddha and make offerings to Tara. We can appreciate Buddha and Tara
              and all the other figures that we practice with as “other” when we really
              appreciate that they aren’t really other. The more familiar we are with
              ourselves as we actually are, the more comfortable we are with Tara and
              Manjushri and everyone else. As my first teacher said, the bowing is always
              mutual; there is one bow back and forth. Buddha bowing to Buddha, Tara bowing
              to Tara.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>A long time ago, when I was serving as his attendant, I noticed that
              Katagiri Roshi always mumbled something as he bowed. I asked him what it was
              but he couldn’t tell me since it was in Japanese. Later on, I received in the
              mail a translation of the bowing verse, which I have used ever since.</span></p>

              of one’s self and others are not two/ I bow with all beings to attain
              liberation/ To manifest the unsurpassable mind and return to boundless truth.”</span></p>
