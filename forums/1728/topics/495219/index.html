              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Robert Bellah SPRING 2008 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Fundamentalists here and abroad have been giving religion a
              bad rap lately, and so-called militant atheists have used the opportunity to
              take up the offensive. But according to prominent sociologist Robert N. Bellah,
              both sides have it wrong: they are mistaken about what religion actually is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In our current atmosphere of cultural polarization, the term
              religion has become highly contested. Just how contested was brought home to me
              in April 2006, when, during a public lecture I gave at the University of
              Montana in Missoula, a man in the audience sharply questioned my very use of
              the word. I said that I was simply following a long history of usage, that I
              knew that some people contrast spirituality, which they see as good, with
              religion, which they believe is bad, but that I had never found that dichotomy
              helpful, as spirituality until recently was always considered an aspect of
              religion, not a rival to it. But he was adamant. Religion, he insisted, is a
              terrible thing and if I didn’t want to use the term spirituality, I should
              think of some new word. Like what? I queried. He had no answer but insisted I come
              up with one. It was his fervor rather than the content of his remark that
              struck me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It seems that the biologist Richard Dawkins, the author of
              the 2006 book The God Delusion, doesn’t just dislike the word religion, he
              dislikes the very thing, attributing many of the ills of the world to it and
              advocating its early demise. As one reviewer pointed out, echoing my experience
              in Montana, it is the strength of Dawkins’s conviction rather than his argument
              that is striking. Indeed, for a scientist accustomed to arguments based on
              evidence, Dawkins’s book contains remarkably little in the way of proof. In the
              case of the man in Montana, I think the problem was that religion to him meant
              “institutional religion,” that is, churches and such, and institutions are, to
              his mind, intrinsically alien and oppressive, whereas spirituality is the free
              expression of individuals. Dawkins’s problem is somewhat different.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Religion for Dawkins is a cognitive system, a kind of
              science, but bad science with bad consequences. Therefore it should be gotten
              rid of. For a social scientist, on the other hand, religion is not primarily a
              scientific theory at all: it is the many ways humans have sought to find
              meaning, to make sense of their lives. As such, it is an inescapable sphere of
              life, like economics and politics. Because there is much wrong with our
              economy—social injustice and environmental degradation, to mention two major
              effects of our capitalist sytem—can we just abolish the economy? Because there
              is much political corruption and incredibly incompetent political leadership,
              can we just abolish politics? Like other spheres of human life, religion—the
              meaning-making sphere—is often subject to distortion and can become horribly
              destructive. But getting rid of it isn’t an option. Religion meets a human
              need, and if you get rid of it in one form, it will come back in another.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Dawkins’s idea of religion as theory is widespread among
              educated people, and this might partly account for the popularity of his book
              and other equally silly ones by so-called militant atheists, who are attempting
              to respond to religious extremism armed only with half-understandings and
              misconceptions about what religion actually is. After all, they say, isn’t
              Christianity just a set of beliefs? Christianity has in fact emphasized belief
              more than any other of the great religious traditions, and Protestantism more
              than other forms of Christianity, so this understanding has some historical
              foundation. Yet belief is not the same as theory. Religious belief is not a
              kind of quasi-science, even though that is how people like Dawkins view it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Religion isn’t about theory; it’s about meaning. Religious
              texts and statements are not, in their basic function, about imparting
              information with which one must agree or disagree. What they impart is meaning,
              and meaning doesn’t tell us something new; it seems just to be saying the same
              old thing, though in a deeper understanding it makes sense of the new. Meaning
              is iterative, not cumulative. If someone in an intimate relationship says to
              the other, “Do you love me?” and the other replies, “Why do you ask? I told you
              that yesterday,” we can say that he doesn’t get it. The request was not for
              information or some new bit of knowledge but for the reiteration of meaning.
              Similarly, if someone said, “Why do we have to say the Lord’s Prayer this
              Sunday?—we already said it last Sunday,” again, we would say that the person is
              missing the point, that he or she is making what philosophers call a category
              mistake. For Christians, the Lord’s Prayer is not news that we can forget once
              we’ve heard it; it is an expression of who we are in relation to who God is,
              and its reiteration is not redundant but a renewed affirmation of meaning, an
              invocation of a total context.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We are inclined to think that sacred texts, canonical texts,
              have in themselves an intrinsic meaning and are by nature qualitatively
              different from other texts, but this is an error. In fact, sacred texts must be
              read or listened to in the context of a community for which they are sacred: it
              is in the ritual practices of a living community that they become sacred.
              Ritual is the place where meaning occurs. Saying “I love you” to an intimate
              other is indeed a ritual, but it contributes more than we imagine to
              maintaining the meaning of the intimate relationship, just as the ritual of
              reciting the Lord’s Prayer reiterates the meaning of our worship of God.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While it is good to regard religion as that sphere of life
              where we seek to make sense of the world, it is also good to recognize that it
              is not a neatly demarcated sphere with clear boundaries, even in our society,
              where we tend to try to separate the spheres more than earlier societies have
              done. In most societies until modern times, the spheres have largely
              overlapped. Economics and politics were saturated with religion and vice versa.
              Because religion gave expression to the meaning of life, it was hard to
              separate it from a way of life as a whole.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Since religious practices have been central to human life
              from the beginning of our species, and are really coexistent with our being as
              a species, they must be considered as a whole. As one of my own mentors,
              Wilfred Cantwell Smith, put it in Toward a World Theology, they are,
              historically speaking, singular. This is not to say that all religions are the
              same. Far from it. Wilfred championed diversity before the word ever became
              fashionable. His sense that the history of religion is singular does not mean
              that in their particularities religions are the same. In fact, he didn’t even
              think the same religions are the same, and therefore he urged the abandonment
              of such terms as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and so forth. For Wilfred, it
              would be absurd to suppose that all people have been religious in the same way:
              “No two centuries have been religious in the same way; certainly, no two
              communities, in the end, no two persons.” But while recognizing the variety of
              humankind’s religious life, he also discerned that this life was contained
              within a historical continuum. To consider religious practices as historically
              singular is also “to affirm that they are all historically interconnected; that
              they have interacted with the same things or with each other, or that one has
              ‘grown out of’ or been ‘influenced by’ the other; more exactly, that one can be
              understood only in terms of a context of which the other forms a part.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is, of course, obvious that while all religions may be
              related, the family of religion is not a happy one. Even so, without ever
              denying the enormous complexities in this field, the recognition that we are
              all part of a single history, may move us closer to mutual intelligibility,
              even toward a recognition that we are all ultimately members one of another.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In his essay “The Widening Gyre: Religion, Culture and
              Evolution” (Science &amp; Spirit,July/August 1999), the evolutionary
              psychologist Merlin Donald postulates that religion emerged out of two
              developments in the evolution of human capabilities. The first of these
              involves mimesis, “learning by observing a behavior and mimicking it, acting it
              out, in our own lives.” Mimesis, he writes, “is a whole-body skill, unique to
              human beings, whereby we can use our entire bodies as expressive devices. It is
              the basis of most nonverbal communication, as well as art, craft, dance, and
              athletics. But more importantly, it is the primordial source of our communal
              cultural traditions.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The second great evolutionary event in the background of what
              we call religion is the emergence of our capacity for speech, probably over
              100,000 years ago. Donald describes the consequences:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Oral traditions were the inevitable outgrowth of this
              capacity for language. These traditions may be viewed as gigantic
              representational conventions that summarize the accumulated wisdom of a people.
              Such narratives were a great leap from the older framework of simpler
              ritualized behaviors that had been put in place by mimesis, and served as a
              kind of collective governor of values, beliefs, and behavior for every member
              of the society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">However, oral traditions did not displace or conflict with
              mimesis. They incorporated mimetic ritual under a more powerful system of
              narrative thinking, which produced “mythic” cultures. Myth, in the sense of an
              authorized set of allegories and narratives, became the ruling construct in
              such societies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Modern society still preserves much of this structure, and
              still depends upon mimesis as a sort of elemental social glue. The universal
              form of traditional religion consists of precisely this: a narrative, a sacred
              story overlying a deeper core of mimetic traditions—ritual and beliefs whose
              origins lie in the depths of time. These form a “governing hierarchy” that
              regulates both individual consciousness and public behavior on much of the
              planet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But although the deepest truths of our being continue to be
              expressed in mimetic and mythic forms, another much more recent evolutionary
              advance has also to be taken into account: the emergence of theoretic culture,
              the capacity for objective critical reasoning. The beginnings of theory as a
              cultural form go a long way back, but the first clear emergence of theory as an
              alternative to mimesis and myth occurred in the Axial Age, the first millennium
              B.C.E., in Greece, Israel, India, and China, and have to a considerable degree
              influenced the religions that derive from that period, that is to say, all the
              great religions that still survive. But just as mythic thinking did not and
              could not displace mimetic consciousness, so theory did not and could not
              replace mimetic and mythic culture. It gave the possibility of critical
              reflection that, at its best, could prevent distortions of older truths, but
              always with the possibility of adding new distortions of its own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Theory can greatly enrich our religious life and has done so
              in all the great traditions for millennia. But theory can’t replace the older
              forms of human culture that give religion its vitality. When it tries to do
              that, it becomes a parody not only of religion but also of the realm of
              critical reason itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">An example of this kind of parody occured at a recent
              conference on science and religion at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies
              in La Jolla, California. The discussion, as reported in the November 21, 2006
              New York Times, apparently took a turn toward a kind of anti-religious
              scientific evangelicalism:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Carolyn Porco, a senior research scientist at the Space
              Science Institute in Boulder, Colo., called, half in jest, for the
              establishment of an alternative church…</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">She was not entirely kidding. “We should let the success of
              the religious formula guide us,” Dr. Porco said. “Let’s teach our children from
              a very young age about the story of the universe and its incredible richness
              and beauty. It is already so much more glorious and awesome—and even
              comforting—than anything offered by any scripture or God concept I know.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What she wants to “teach our children” is not a theory but,
              as she says herself, a story, that is, a myth. That the universe is incredibly
              rich and beautiful I have no doubt, but I know for certain that science is not
              in the business of telling us that and, in fact, cannot possibly tell us that
              and still be science. Even more clearly, science is not in the business of
              comforting us with the glorious and the awesome. All of its great achievements
              would be undermined if it tried to take on that role. In imagining that science
              can do what only religion can do, we have once again a category mistake, one
              that messes up science in the process. Further, it is dangerous to imagine that
              such a thing could be done while leaving behind the mimetic and the mythic,
              because what is thrown out at the front door will come in at the back door.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It’s no surprise that science would be seen as an appealing
              substitute for religion. Science claims to be universal, the same truth for
              everyone, whereas religions seem to be indelibly particular, and in their
              particularity, often deadly: If you are not like me, then I’ll kill you. And if
              you are a Sunni in a Shi’ite neighborhood in Baghdad or vice versa, you may
              indeed find yourself in such a situation. Our task, however, is not to deny our
              particularity in favor of some abstract theoretical universalism. I am not in
              the least denying that what we have in common is important—it is critically
              important—as is the search for ethical universals that can appeal across all
              forms of diversity. But if genuine universality is possible for humans, it must
              derive from and not deny particularity. The idea of the history of religion in
              the singular lets us see that, though we are indelibly different, not only from
              other religions but also from other forms of our own religion, we yet share a
              common history, and we cannot understand ourselves except in the context of the
              whole.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To illustrate this point, we can look at two religious
              rituals that, though they may appear to be worlds apart, actually underscore
              the very same religious theme. First, a Tewa Pueblo initiation ceremony that
              Robert Darnton described in his reflection on anthropologist Clifford Geertz in
              the January 11, 2007 New York Review of Books. During the ceremony adolescent boys
              are awakened from their beds in the middle of the night and led into the
              deepest and most secret room in the pueblo. There they wait, in the dark, clad
              only in ritual loincloths. Suddenly there’s a terrifying thumping over their
              heads. The overhead door opens, and into the room comes a god in a frightful
              mask, and he asks if the boys are ready to be “finished” as men. (Although
              Geertz uses the word “god,” for reasons having to do with the connotations that
              word has in monotheistic cultures, I prefer to use the term Powerful Beings.)
              When they assent, he flails them mightily with a yucca whip. Eventually, having
              beaten and terrorized the youths, the Powerful Being pulls off his mask and the
              boys see that the man looking back at them, now laughing, is a neighbor or
              relative.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The important lesson is not that the Powerful Being was Uncle
              X, but that during the ritual Uncle X was the Powerful Being. After that, he is
              just Uncle X again. Yet the boys have learned something about the relationship
              between humans and Powerful Beings, namely, that under certain circumstances
              they can become identical. But the point I want to make about this “strange”
              event is that, in its particularity, it tells us something important about
              religion generally: It often involves human participation in what we can call,
              for want of a better term, divinity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The ritual of the Eucharist, if one thinks about it, seems as
              strange as the Tewa initiation. It is familiar culturally—especially for
              Christians, obviously—and so many of us tend not to see the strangeness of it.
              But what is going on here? A narrative account of its institution is an
              essential part of the ritual, but the event is mimetic, enacted. Ordinary bread
              and wine become, through the words and actions of the priest, the body and
              blood of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and the members of the congregation
              approach the altar and partake of that body and blood. In partaking they
              reaffirm their membership in the body of Christ, their identity with Christ:
              Though we are many, we are one body because we all share one bread and one cup.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">My point is that when we make the effort to understand what
              may seem strange in the religious practices of others, we may find that it
              opens the door to something beyond the particular case, something quite
              general: the capacity of humans to participate in divinity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The particularities of religions may illustrate their most
              universal features. All religions involve bodily enactment, performance,
              mimesis. Even reading, when done as a religious practice, is a form of
              embodiment. Young Chinese in pre-modern times, for example, began by memorizing
              the classics before they could understand them. The point was to make the texts
              a part of oneself so that the poems’ meaning, as it unfolded, did not only come
              from the acquisition of external knowledge, but also from within. While each
              religion involves unique stories, narratives, and myths, the centrality of
              narrative is one thing that all faiths have in common.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The concreteness and particularity of mimesis and narrative
              seem to limit the capacity for generalization. While all religious people
              incorporate mimesis and narrative, they do so in very different ways. Theory,
              as I said earlier, has one great advantage: It can transcend context, it can
              rise above the particular, or at least try to. The theoretical achievements of
              the religions transformed in the Axial Age may show us even more clearly that
              we are part of one history.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Of course, the axial transformations in Greece, Israel,
              India, and China were not all the same. Far from it; they were each quite
              different and each led to later developments that took quite different
              directions. But they were similar, indeed this is what makes them axial, in
              that they involved a new element of explicit theory: the ability to criticize,
              to give reasons why certain religious, ethical, or social practices are wrong
              and should be corrected. It is not the case that narrative religions wholly
              lack criticism. But they have little capacity to make criticisms explicit; what
              they do is tell a new story, one that includes what they feel is left out in
              the old story. Any primarily narrative culture has a plethora of stories, often
              conflicting, and different depending on who tells them. The myths of women in
              some Australian Aboriginal societies, for example, kept secret from men, claim
              that originally they, the women, had all the ritual secrets, that they gave
              them to the men because the rituals they involve are too much trouble, and that
              they still know the secrets even though the men think they don’t.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But the kind of criticism I am calling theory moves beyond
              telling another story to giving reasons why one’s criticism is justified. Axial
              criticism can be political, ethical, or religious, and sometimes all three at
              once. Axial societies inherited from their archaic Bronze Age predecessors the
              notion that the ruler is “the shepherd of the people.” When the rulers are
              clearly not good shepherds, there is great complaint, but little in the way of
              argument. In the Axial societies ideas such as justice emerge for the first
              time. Similarly, in pre-Axial societies, if ritual doesn’t work, the failure
              will be explained by saying there was some mistake in the ritual, or the people
              will try a new ritual borrowed from a neighboring people. But in Axial societies
              ritual itself comes under fire, and its very meaning is altered.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One of the best examples is Amos, one of the great prophets
              of early Israel. Amos is relentless in his criticism of injustice and
              unrighteousness, of the oppression of the poor by the rich and powerful. In
              viewing such injustice, God will not be placated by conventional ritual.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Thus says the Lord: “I hate, I despise your feasts, and I
              take no delight in your solemn assemblies. Even though you offer me your burnt
              offerings and cereal offerings, I will not accept them, and the peace offerings
              of your fatted beasts I will not look upon. Take away from me the noise of your
              songs; to the melody of your harps I will not listen. But let justice roll down
              like the waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.” (Amos 5:21–24)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is not worship as such, I would argue, that Amos
              criticizes, but worship used to placate or even bribe God into overlooking
              sins. What we see in Amos and in other prophets is the capacity to criticize
              the existing order, social and religious, and to offer criteria in terms of
              which they may be reformed. The prophets do not reject, however, the mimetic
              and the narrative, but seek to reform them to bring them closer to their
              deepest meaning. Here theory, critical thinking, is used not as an autonomous
              basis from which to reject the received tradition, but as a way of opening up
              the particularity of the tradition to a more general level of understanding.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One could produce evidence of similar developments in ancient
              Greece and China, but I will give only some examples from ancient India, the
              teachings of the Buddha in particular. In Axial India, too, a radical critique
              of ritual occurs, one in which the sacrifice so central to Vedic religion
              becomes the sacrifice of self in mystical liberation, a development already
              apparent within the Vedic tradition itself in the Upanishads. But the Buddha
              carried through the criticism of the received tradition more radically than any
              other critic in Axial India. Key Vedic terms become radically transvalued. The
              central Vedic term dharma (Pali dhamma), which originally meant the act of
              animal sacrifice itself and was then generalized to mean duty in the context of
              one’s inherited status, was radically inverted to mean the teachings of the Buddha,
              also assertively called saddharma, the real or true dharma. Similarly, the
              central Vedic idea of karma (Pali kamma) was changed from a determinative
              principle focused on meeting primarily ritual obligations defined by social
              status to a moral principle focused on purifying the intention of one’s acts.
              To put it in more general terms, one could say that the Buddha gave an
              unprecedented emphasis to the rational agency of individuals and radically
              devalued differences of inherited status, including in principle the
              varnasystem of social hierarchy and any notion of the divine status of kings.
              He placed the virtues of compassion and generosity at the center of religious
              ethics and as preparatory to the practice of meditation that could lead to
              liberation. Although the Buddha, like all the great Axial reformers, took many
              inherited ideas for granted—above all in his case the ideas of reincarnation
              and liberation—he brought a theoretic clarity to religious life that undermined
              all inherited structures of inequality and exploitation, at least in principle.
              (We must admit, however, that the “promissory notes” issued in the Axial Age
              were never fully redeemed then or later and remain tasks for our own future
              action.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">My point is not that all the Axial cases are the same, or
              even that terms we translate as “justice” and “compassion” are the same. In
              every case, both ideas and words are rooted in particular traditions. Yet the
              use of theory, not to replace but to reform social and religious practice,
              provides a level of generality where we can begin to discern analogies, not
              just of form but of content, between the traditions. It has been a long hard
              road even to discern these analogies, and they are still disputed by scholars
              who argue for radical relativism and even incommensurability. That is an
              argument I cannot get into in this essay. Nor can I deal with the many ways in
              which power, economic and political, has used and abused religious belief and
              practice, a matter that can never be forgotten in any serious discussion of the
              role of religion in human history.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But if I am right and the objections can be overcome, then,
              without abandoning our indelible particularity, the fact is that, in a very
              important sense, we are our history. We can move to a new history in which we
              see that those of other faiths are not as Other as some like to claim, that we
              have much in common with them, that, in spite of all the differences, we are
              part of the same story, the human story. Religion is certainly not the whole
              story—science, politics, economics, and the other realms of human endeavor are
              part of it as well—but it is in and through and because of religion that this
              story is meaningful.</span></p>
