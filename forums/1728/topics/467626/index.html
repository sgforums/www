              <p><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua';"><strong>All Phenomena 
              are Empty</strong>;<br> They Are Without Inherent Existence<br> <br> When we say "all," that means everything, including the Buddha, enlightenment, 
              and the path. Buddhists define a phenomenon as something with characteristics, 
              and as an object that is conceived by a subject. To hold that an object is something 
              external is ignorance, and it is this that prevents us from seeing the truth of 
              that object. <br> The truth of a phenomenon is called shunyata, emptiness, which implies that the 
              phenomenon does not possess a truly existent essence or nature. When a deluded 
              person or subject sees something, the object seen is interpreted as something 
              really existent. However, as you can see, the existence imputed by the subject 
              is a mistaken assumption. Such an assumption is based on the different conditions 
              that make an object appear to be true; this, however, is not how the object really 
              is. It's like when we see a mirage: there is no truly existing object there, even 
              though it appears that way. With emptiness, the Buddha meant that things do not 
              truly exist as we mistakenly believe they do, and that they are really empty of 
              that falsely imputed existence.<br> It is because they believe in what are really just confused projections that sentient 
              beings suffer. It was as a remedy for this that the Buddha taught the Dharma. 
              Put very simply, when we talk about emptiness, we mean that the way things appear 
              is not the way they actually are. As I said before when speaking about emotions, 
              you may see a mirage and think it is something real, but when you get close, the 
              mirage disappears, however real it may have seemed to begin with.<br> Emptiness can sometimes be referred to as dharmakaya, and in a different context 
              we could say that the dharmakaya is permanent, never changing, all pervasive, 
              and use all sorts of beautiful, poetic words. These are the mystical expressions 
              that belong to the path, but for the moment, we are still at the ground stage, 
              trying to get an intellectual understanding. On the path, we might portray Buddha 
              Vajradhara as a symbol of dharmakaya, or emptiness, but from an academic point 
              of view, even to think of painting the dharmakaya is a mistake. <br> The Buddha taught three different approaches on three separate occasions. These 
              are known as The Three Turnings of the Wheel, but they can be summed up in a single 
              phrase: "Mind; there is no mind; mind is luminosity."<br> The first, "Mind," refers to the first set of teachings and shows that 
              the Buddha taught that there is a "mind." This was to dispel the nihilistic 
              view that there is no heaven, no hell, no cause and effect. Then, when the Buddha 
              said, "There is no mind," he meant that mind is just a concept and that 
              there is no such thing as a truly existing mind. Finally, when he said, "Mind 
              is luminous," he was referring to buddhanature, the undeluded or primordially 
              existing wisdom.<br> The great commentator Nagarjuna said that the purpose of the first turning was 
              to get rid of non-virtue. Where does the non-virtue come from? It comes from being 
              either eternalist or nihilist. So in order to put an end to non-virtuous deeds 
              and thoughts, the Buddha gave his first teaching. The second turning of the Dharma-wheel, 
              when the Buddha spoke about emptiness, was presented in order to dispel clinging 
              to a "truly existent self" and to "truly existent phenomena." 
              Finally, the teachings of the third turning were given to dispel all views, even 
              the view of no-self. The Buddha's three sets of teaching do not seek to introduce 
              something new; their purpose is simply to clear away confusion. <br> As Buddhists we practice compassion, but if we lack an understanding of this third 
              seal-that all phenomena are empty-our compassion can backfire. If you are attached 
              to the goal of compassion when trying to solve a problem, you might not notice 
              that your idea of the solution is entirely based on your own personal interpretation. 
              And you might end up as a victim of hope and fear, and consequently of disappointment. 
              You start by becoming a "good mahayana practitioner," and, once or twice, 
              you try to help sentient beings. But if you have no understanding of this third 
              seal, you'll get tired and give up helping sentient beings. <br> There is another kind of a problem that arises from not understanding emptiness. 
              It occurs with rather superficial and even jaded Buddhists. Somehow, within Buddhist 
              circles, if you don't accept emptiness, you are not cool. So we pretend that we 
              appreciate emptiness and pretend to meditate on it. But if we don't understand 
              it properly, a bad side effect can occur. We might say, "Oh, everything's 
              emptiness. I can do whatever I like." So we ignore and violate the details 
              of karma, the responsibility for our action. We become "inelegant," 
              and we discourage others in the bargain. His Holiness the Dalai Lama often speaks 
              of this downfall of not understanding emptiness. A correct understanding of emptiness 
              leads us to see how things are related, and how we are responsible for our world. 
              <br> You can read millions of pages on this subject. Nagarjuna alone wrote five different 
              commentaries mostly dedicated to this, and then there are the commentaries by 
              his followers. There are endless teachings on establishing this view. In Mahayana 
              temples or monasteries people chant the Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra-this is also 
              a teaching on the third seal.<br> Philosophies or religions might say, "Things are illusion, the world is maya, 
              illusion," but there are always one or two items left behind that are regarded 
              as truly existent: God, cosmic energy, whatever. In Buddhism, this is not the 
              case. Everything in samsara and nirvana-from the Buddha's head to a piece of bread-everything 
              is emptiness. There is nothing that is not included in ultimate truth.<br> Question: If we ourselves are dualistic, can we ever understand emptiness, which 
              is something beyond description? <br> Buddhists are very slippery. You're right. You can never talk about absolute emptiness, 
              but you can talk about an "image" of emptiness-something that you can 
              evaluate and contemplate so that, in the end, you can get to the real emptiness. 
              You may say, "Ah, that's just too easy; that's such crap." But to that 
              the Buddhists say, "Too bad, that's how things work." If you need to 
              meet someone whom you have never met, I can describe him to you or show you a 
              photograph of him. And with the help of that photo image, you can go and find 
              the real person. <br> Ultimately speaking, the path is irrational, but relatively speaking, it's very 
              rational because it uses the relative conventions of our world. When I'm talking 
              about emptiness, everything that I'm saying has to do with this "image" 
              emptiness. I can't show you real emptiness but I can tell you why things don't 
              exist inherently.<br> In Buddhism there's so much iconography that you might think it was the object 
              of meditation or an object of worship. But, from your teaching, am I to understand 
              that this is all non-existent?<br> When you go to a temple, you will see many beautiful statues, colors and symbols. 
              These are important for the path. These all belong to what we call "image-wisdom," 
              "image-emptiness." However, while we follow the path and apply its methods, 
              it is important to know that the path itself is ultimately an illusion. Actually, 
              it is only then that we can properly appreciate it.</span>
