              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">The Nalanda
              University enterprise has been a national misadventure because of the lack of
              fiscal probity.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">It has also
              been a source of international embarrassment because the resurrection of
              Nalanda was to be underwritten by seven countries (Australia, New Zealand,
              Brunei, Cambodia, Singapore, Lao PDR and Myanmar) that signed the memorandum of
              understanding (MoU) with India in 2013.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">China,
              Japan, Thailand and other countries had also made commitments for or
              contributed to the rebuilding of Nalanda. And because of its expected
              international outlook, Nalanda was to transform the image of India’s insular
              higher education system, but cronyism in recruitment and hidebound curriculum have
              had a defiling effect.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">Nalanda’s
              placement at Rajgir (10 km from ancient Nalanda) in rural Bihar was justified
              by claiming that it would bring employment and development to the region — a
              common argument of avaricious developers preying on rural lands to build
              multi-storeyed apartments.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">Sober minds
              like Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education
              at Boston College, had sounded a note of caution by stating that “Nalanda may
              attract a certain number of big thinkers, but academics like to be where the
              infrastructure is.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">They want
              culture and amenities and coffee shops, and a wider community of intellectuals
              than that [of Nalanda] on campus”.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">The Nalanda
              Mentor Group, headed by Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, came to be viewed as a
              self-appointed group mainly educated in the West and adrift from the Asian
              Buddhist intellectual community.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">The
              exclusion of Buddhist representation in the Mentor Group, and absence of any
              Buddhist studies in the curriculum produced scathing criticism from Buddhist
              scholars and activists.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">“They
              totally missed the core philosophy and ingenuity of the original Nalanda,”
              thundered Malaysian Buddhist Lim Kooi Fong, the founder of the Buddhist
              Channel, the premier Buddhist news website.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">“There is no
              Sri Lankan representation on the board [of governors] despite this country’s
              claim to have the oldest continuing Buddhist civilisation in the world,”
              complained lawyer and Buddhist activist Senaka Weeraratne.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">The whole
              Nalanda enterprise rose from a fundamentally false premise: That “Nalanda was
              the only institution of learning outside China to which anyone from ancient
              China ever went for higher education” (Chancellor Amartya Sen’s interview in
              the Indian Express, February 28, 2015). </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">Regrettably,
              this erroneous assertion of Nalanda’s primacy historically marginalises the
              contributions of other ancient centres of learning in the development of the
              Indian civilisation. Between Nalanda in the east in Bihar and Takshashila in
              the west in Rawalpindi district of Pakistani Punjab, there were many other
              distinguished places of learning visited by foreigners.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">Obviously,
              Nalanda profited from the fact that the distance between Chengdu in China and
              Patna is roughly 1,900 km, making Nalanda more accessible to the ancient
              Chinese.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">The relative
              quiet and geographic location that protected the Magadha region from Central
              Asian invasions also facilitated Nalanda’s rise to importance.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">Takshashila
              benefited from its proximity to the Silk Route, notwithstanding its location
              closer to the Khyber Pass, the gateway to the invading hordes from Central Asia
              and farther west.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">Still, the
              Brahmanical culture and the influx of invading peoples prompted the rise of yet
              other centres in classical India: Vikramashila in Patna’s Bhagalpur district
              was a robust one, matching Nalanda; Pushpagiri in ancient Kalinga (Odisha) was
              also a thriving institution; Dharmapala of the Pala dynasty during the late 8th
              century established Odantapuri in Magadha (Patna), as well as Somapura
              Mahavihara in Bengal; and in southern India, Travancore and Cochin were
              frontiers of learning.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">So what
              should India do with its ancient centres of learning?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">One option
              is to turn them into museums, suggested the distinguished economist Jagdish
              Bhagwati, which would attract visitors globally and serve the local community
              and schools “funded by private philanthropy and small individual contributions
              by citizens in what might be called the ‘Tirupati Temple approach’”. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">The Tirupati
              Temple attracts more than 100,000 visitors a day, generating a daily income
              upward of $150,000. Of course, the popularity of and devotion to Lord Sri
              Venkateshwara, the presiding deity of Tirupati, result from the bhakti
              tradition rooted inVaisnavism in south India, which democratised Hinduism,
              making Sri Venkateshwara the most accessible of all Hindu gods.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">But museums
              don’t do well in India. Given the remoteness and rural settings of India’s
              ancient learning spots, and their spiritual and artistic quest aimed at
              achieving self-realisation, a hybrid model might be better suited for India:
              one that incorporates the features of Tirupati and the Buddhist-oriented Rubin
              Museum of Art in New York.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">Founded by
              Donald and Shelley Rubin, and committed to Tibetan art and Buddhism, its
              mission statement is much broader: “The Rubin Museum of Art is an arts and
              cultural hub in New York [City] … that inspires visitors to make connections
              between contemporary life and the art and ideas of the Himalayas, India, and
              neighbouring regions.” </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">In the City,
              “Rubin is a space to contemplate ideas that extend across history and span
              human cultures.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">Exploration
              of Buddhist spirituality for self-actualisation and cross-cultural learning is
              precisely what India’s ancient learning centres pursued, including at Valabhi.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">Following
              the collapse of the Guptas in the 5th century, Valabhipura emerged and thrived
              as the centre of learning in Saurashtra between the 6th and 12th centuries.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   ' lang="EN">The kingdom
              of Valabhi in peninsular Gujarat stood independent of Magadha, with its capital

              century, Chinese travellers Hiuen Tsang (Xuanzang, Hsuan Tsang) and I-tsing

              in China. </span></p>

              400 and 700, many Chinese travellers and Buddhist monks visited India in search
