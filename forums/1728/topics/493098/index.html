              Sujato: Personal Courage and Restoring the Sangha’s Moral Purpose</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Raymond Lam Buddhistdoor
              Global | 2016-12-09 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">The
              tall and robust teacher of Ajahn Chah’s forest tradition speaks with a
              typically blokeish Aussie accent, however the words of wisdom and compassion he
              voices do not sound like those of a typical bloke at all. While I have deep
              traditionalist loyalties and instincts, I have long admired Ajahn Bhante
              Sujato, who ordained in 1994 and left behind his identity of Anthony Best to
              live the monastic life. He is one of the most incisive and courageous
              progressive thinkers in contemporary Western Buddhism. He has not updated his
              famous blog, which remains an engaging and passionate source of Buddhist social
              critique, in a while however, having lived in seclusion in Taiwan over the past
              year to work on his main project, SuttaCentral, a website hosting texts from
              Buddhism’s most ancient period (the so-called pre-sectarian era) in more than
              30 languages.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bhante’s
              decision to engage intellectually and critically on issues of social justice
              came during a moment in Thailand many years ago. He had seen an article in a
              newspaper about bhikkhunis, or fully ordained nuns. “The monk being interviewed
              was making statements about bhikkhunis that I knew, as a student of the Vinaya,
              were incorrect. So what was I supposed to do about it? Do I just sit here and
              let this happen? Should I write a letter to the editor or contact the monk . .
              . ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“Then
              I realized that as long as I was living in Thailand, I was essentially a guest
              in somebody else’s country. Someone was looking after my visa, and so on. And I
              knew that these were very sensitive issues, so for me to merely do what I would
              see as trying to establish what’s true would be seen by some as very
              controversial. Apparently saying things that aren’t true aren’t controversial,
              but saying things that are true is much more controversial,” he added,
              laughing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“This
              was one of the things that prompted me to want to go back to Australia, my
              home, and find a way of living in Buddhism where I could pursue my
              contemplation and meditation, but also to live in a way that I could feel true
              to my authentic voice. I think that the world we have today is very largely
              dominated by voices that don’t have a lot of wisdom to them. I’m not saying
              that I have any great wisdom, but hopefully because of the Dhamma, I might have
              at least a little bit of the Buddha’s wisdom that I could share.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Academics,
              both lay and monastic (such as Ven. Analayo and Bhante’s own teacher, Ajahn
              Brahm), have done extensive research that should have conclusively demonstrated
              that the Theravada Vinaya permits the revival of the bhikkhuni order.
              Furthermore, on the ground, the bhikkhuni order is already resurgent in
              countries with a Theravada presence, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and
              Thailand. These grassroots movements are supported by many laypeople hungry for
              the fresh and sincere perspectives that these nuns offer and cannot simply be
              wished away by the Buddhist establishment, which is dominated by men.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Yet
              Bhante is hearing more incorrect assertions about bhikkhunis than ever. “Well,
              like how you can’t live as a bhikkhuni in the modern day, the Buddha didn’t
              care about equality . . . and these are the mild ones. I’ve heard things like
              if you support bhikkhunis you’re going to go to hell. It’s strong language
              that’s not based on wisdom or love. It’s based on hate and fear. So a lot of
              people get intimidated and would prefer not to get involved. People are stuck
              in their ways and there’s greed, hatred, and delusion everywhere. There is a
              lot of perceived self-interest.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He
              is keen to distinguish between the Dhamma and how the Buddhist tradition has
              manifested in a culture like Thailand’s. “Much of what functions as Buddhism in
              many cultures has very little to do with Dhamma, and more to do with prestige
              and billions of dollars worth of real estate.” Bhante was offered several large
              monasteries during his last year in Thailand and still recounts the incident
              with disbelief. “The number of monks has collapsed and so there are these
              monasteries that are completely empty. The thought is that the bhikkhunis might
              then move into these monasteries—from my point of view that’s a good thing—but
              that means the monks lose control of them.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Has
              trust has collapsed between the Thai sangha establishment and the lay Buddhists
              to whom the former owes pastoral care? “Certainly it’s a lot less than it once
              was. Thailand is a mixed bunch, like anywhere else there are good and bad monks.
              I think the overall trend is towards a lessening of people’s faith in the
              sangha. One of the reasons why I think trust collapsed was that overall the
              sangha became too lazy and decadent.” He related a story during the 1960s when
              Ajahn Chah visited London with a companion, and a punk verbally accosted them
              on the street. “What are ya on about, mate?” After brushing off the incident,
              Ajahn Chah observed wryly that he should bring all his senior monks to Britain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“I’ve
              spoken about this issue to Ajahn Brahm as well. We didn’t realize how arrogant
              and egotistic we had become until we left Thailand and came back to Australia,
              because of how reverently we were treated. It’s over the top, excessive.”
              Bhante insists that it is one thing to treat the sangha with respect, another
              to treat monks in a way that facilitates an unhealthy relationship with
              laypeople. He personally had a wonderful time in Thailand, but feels
              disappointed by how the sangha does not seem to have kept up with the pace of
              Thailand’s development over the past three decades. He also holds unabashed
              scorn for some practices he sees as superstitious, such as amulet dolls (often
              costing thousands of dollars) that are even brought to Buddhist temples to be
              blessed. Some might say that this is simply Thai Buddhism, but Bhante counters
              by suggesting that it is also Thai tradition to self-critique and to try to do
              better.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">While
              he hasn’t updated his blog in a while, he has not lost sight of how to critique
              global politics and society while staying centered on the Dhamma. “I find that
              Buddhists often feel too shy to come forward and aren’t bold in what they say,”
              Bhante observed. “I think the world is missing out on a lot of Buddhist wisdom,
              and something that I’ve heard in my home state of Western Australia, the former
              premier Geoff Gallop said to a group of monks that politicians need to hear
              more from the Buddhist community. They want to hear more but they don’t know
              what the Buddhist community wants or what we think about issues. Buddhism does
              have something to contribute to the political sphere in Australia.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bhante
              is particularly critical of the Australian government’s handling of climate
              change and its undermining of environmental legislation. “We have gone from
              being one of the most forward-thinking countries on the environment to one of
              the most regressive in the past decade.” He has spoken to more than a dozen
              Liberal Party politicians on climate change (in Australia, the Liberal Party
              represents right-wing politics). “A lot of them just don’t have a clue, while
              others just want to make money off fossil fuels. I was speaking to the
              environment minister at the time, Greg Hunt, and I asked him, ‘How much do you
              actually talk about climate change in the Liberal party?’ And his response was
              very telling: ‘I think about these things every day.’ I said, ‘With respect,
              that’s not what I asked.’ And I never got an answer from him.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He
              then talked to an Indigenous minister from Western Australia (the minister’s
              name escaped him for the moment). “He was a lovely man, very gentle and wise,
              and I asked him the same question. He said, ‘Not at all. No one talks about
              it.’”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He
              answers possible charges that he may be “politicizing” Buddhism by pointing out
              that in Vietnam and Sri Lanka there are monks in political parties and
              parliament. A monastic council appointed by the king manages the Thai sangha,
              while in Myanmar the sangha runs according to an act of parliament. “How
              political can you get?” he laughs. “And in Tibet, the monks were the
              government. Such political involvement far exceeds anything we do or advocate
              in the West.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bhante’s
              final thoughts are both a warning and encouragement. If Buddhists do not speak
              up with voices of compassion and wisdom, that vacuum will be filled by voices
              of delusion and violence. Instead of hearing Buddhist voices, governments will
              listen to lobbyists from the coal and arms-dealing industries. “Being engaged
              just means talking about issues that matter with people. What it doesn’t mean
              is politicking, trying to exert power over others, or manipulating them. Always
              be clear, civil, polite, and kind. Remember that the only reason we’re speaking
              is to try to help all beings. Buddhism has been a shared force of values that
              has influenced the whole of Asia and I would love to see those shared values
              articulated in our world today because they can help address extremely urgent
              issues.”</span></p>
