I know it is very inadequate to make a statement like that and not explain why I said that.<br><br>I can only give you something to chew on though.<br><br>If you realized "Emptiness" then you will know that there is no such thing as Christianity/Hinduism/Jesus/Buddha as understood/known/realized in your head and in everybody's head and so how would it be right to promote it and in reverse, how would it be wrong (as you are complaining) to promote it? How will it be right or wrong to promote something that does not exist?</div>

When you attend talks by self proclaimed "realised" buddhist masters, you have to be prepared hear stuff like the above.<br><br>I also have this slight suspicion that the talk you've attended is only labelled buddhist, but belonged to other cult, which is banned in this forum.  I've attended similar talk before long long time ago, that belonged to a cult group, and I never went back.</div>

First, FREE-THINKER is not a religion, therefore the 'religion package' I mentioned doesn't apply. But if you think free-thinkers are perfect beings - that of course is your flawed thinking!<br>I would say unless your mind can be controlled or manipulated, most people are free to think. However, this 'free' is in form but not in substance.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mrcuteblackie:</div><div class="quote_body">I have been wondering why realized buddhists parallel Buddhism with Christianity. Doesn't this mean that they think Christianity is best, and must use it as a reference? I have my reasons why I object to this:<br>1) The creation story is childish<br>2) The God described in the bible has not reached enlightenment: he has hate, jealousy, pride, etc<br>3) The God described in the Bible has a very strong ego: he needs people to worship him, else he kills them.<br>4) I also hate it when during talks, spiritual masters list the Buddha, Jesus Christ, Krishna, and Miohammed. Mohammed was not even spiritual. He raped and killed, ande did not practice compassion. Nor did any so-called prophets.<br>There is only one reason why they include Mohammed: They are afraid of being m,assacred by the muslims. Well, we just have to be politically correct.<br>If I have to meditate to become one with such a being, no thanks. I am better off as I am.  But if I will develop infinite compassion, then Christianity cannot be true.</div></blockquote>When did Mohammed rape and kill? (sorry, i never read the koran before...but this is kinda shocking...)</div>
