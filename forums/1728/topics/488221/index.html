              cigarettes un-Buddhist?</span></strong></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Bernie Flynn, a longtime student of Chögyam Trungpa, recently told me
              about the time he and the Rinpoche tried to quit smoking cigarettes. A few days
              in, he was driving the Rinpoche to a meeting. Antsy and in withdrawal, Bernie
              couldn’t help but notice his teacher sitting calmly in the passenger seat.
              Finally, his nerves on edge, Bernie turned to Trungpa and asked how the whole
              quitting thing was going. “It’s easy,” said Trungpa. “Either you smoke, or you
              don’t smoke.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Ah, so simple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Later that evening, Bernie entered a room to find the Rinpoche gleefully
              chain smoking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Oh, not so simple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The psychoactive effects of drugs, alcohol included, don’t exactly jibe
              with the goals of Buddhist practice. Sure, some people stumble into the dharma
              after stumbling through an acid trip, but the fact that LSD can be a gateway to
              practice doesn’t mean it’s allowed beyond the gate of any respectable dharma
              institution. And though many Buddhists drink, it’s generally understood that
              this should occur in moderation and off the zafu. Hence, refraining from
              intoxicants is one of the five basic Buddhist precepts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Cigarettes, however, seem to exist in a hazy gray area, both literally
              and figuratively. Caffeine, a substance that might otherwise find itself in
              similar ambiguous territory, has a sexy origin story: the Ch’an patriarch
              Bodhidharma, angry at himself for dozing off during zazen, rips off his eyelids
              and flings them to the ground, from which sprout the first tea leaves. Thus
              caffeine has long been accepted by Buddhists the world over as a mild
              performance enhancing drug, endorsed by legend. Tobacco, lacking such an
              auspicious beginning, has long been tolerated in Buddhist communities anyway,
              though the Buddhist stance on smoking is vague at best. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Thus, the question remains. Either you smoke, or you don’t smoke, yes,
              but <em>should</em> you smoke? I found the answer, like a good koan, to be both
              elusive and entirely dependent upon who is answering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: center; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>_____</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Smoking is not technically prohibited in Buddhism, but then again,
              neither is juggling chainsaws or playing Russian roulette. It would be tedious
              if all prohibited actions had to be spelled out (which doesn’t mean people
              haven't tried. See: the Vinaya). I pointed this out to Dr. Joel Smith,
              Associate Professor of Philosophy at Skidmore College. “Of course [smoking is
              not prohibited],” said Smith, “but if you look at the eightfold path and you
              have any kind of subtle interpretation about right action and right effort, it
              doesn’t take much to argue that [right action and right effort] should be
              applied in that kind of way.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Smith traveled in Japan with John Daido Loori Roshi, longtime abbot of
              the Zen Mountain Monastery in upstate New York, when Daido was receiving his
              confirmation rituals at Eihei-ji many years ago. He remembered Daido stepping
              outside the Eihei-ji buildings to smoke in between ceremonies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“I asked him about it once,” Smith said, “and he responded, ‘Zen is not
              a health trip.’”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>While this may be true, it glosses over the fact that smoking is, at its
              most basic, a harmful action. Dr. Smith has been teaching Buddhism and Eastern
              philosophy for decades, and over the years he has brought many students to
              dharma institutions to hear teachings. A number of them, he said, are turned
              off by the fact that they see monks smoking. “This is really where the rubber
              hits the road,” said Smith. “You can talk generally about compassion, but if
              you can’t apply it to something so basic in one’s personal life, then what the
              heck is going on?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Aside from the issue of alienating the dharma-curious, the fact that
              Buddhists smoke raises a deeper issue for Smith. “If you love life and affirm
              it and want to do good in the world and be compassionate to other people, then
              you want to make your body and your mind as much of a vehicle for that as
              possible for as long as possible.” Smoking cigarettes would seem to undercut
              that possibility, limiting the amount of time one has to be a vehicle for the
              dharma. So why do Buddhist teachers continue to allow their addiction to
              impinge on their responsibilities? Shouldn’t overcoming their addiction be of
              the utmost importance, both as exemplars of the teachings and as vehicles for
              them?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I put this question to Dr. Judson Brewer, the director of research at
              the Center for Mindfulness. Brewer and his team at Yale University have
              developed the Craving to Quit app, which uses mindfulness to help people kick
              their addiction. “It’s a great question and I would want to talk to these folks
              and get their story,” said Brewer. “Is it just a habit that’s so much in the
              background that you’re not paying attention or is the level of suffering that
              it causes so minimal that there’s no drive to change the behavior?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I asked Brewer if Buddhist teachers have a moral imperative not to
              smoke.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“If I had a gun and I killed myself, that wouldn’t be that helpful if I
              were a good teacher. And smoking has obviously been linked to increased
              mortality and morbidity, as well as a number of illnesses, including cancer.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Indeed, John Daido Loori Roshi died of lung cancer in 2009 (though he
              did give up smoking later in life). Like shooting yourself with a gun, smoking
              will ultimately aid in your demise. “It’s not exactly suicide,” said Brewer.
              “It’s just a slower burn.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: center; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>_____</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In 2005 I was one of 33 college students who lived in a Burmese
              monastery in Bodhgaya, India, where we studied Buddhism and lived according to
              the five basic precepts. Though it may have gone against our youthful
              inclinations, we refrained from taking intoxicants, sex, stealing, lying, and
              killing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Cigarettes, however, were not prohibited, and like many of my fellow
              students, I took up smoking. We spent countless afternoons on the roof of our
              dorm, watching our cigarette smoke drift away while ruminating over deep
              questions like, is killing a malaria-ridden mosquito bad karma or good karma?
              Since we were suddenly living a life of previously unimaginable austerity,
              smoking didn’t seem like such a big deal. It gave us something to do, and
              though we were learning about the emptiness of self, smoking seemed like the
              last way we could fill ourselves up, albeit with smoke. It gave us something to
              cling to, the last iceberg in a sea of melting vices.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Maybe the fact that Buddhists smoke is as simple as that. Maybe
              Buddhists the world over puff because it is one of the few remaining ways they
              can puff themselves up. For a spiritual tradition so devoted to compassion and helping
              others, cigarettes may be the final frontier of autonomy. In a spiritual
              tradition so devoted to the eradication of self, cigarettes might be the last
              shred of selfishness. <em>Fumo ergo sum</em>.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I smoke, therefore I am.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: center; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>_____</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Google Buddhism and smoking and the resulting hits are not what I would
              describe as particularly helpful (unless you want lurid details about the monks
              recently arrested for smoking Crystal Meth in Phnom Penh, Cambodia). However, I
              did come across an amusing anecdote from the blog of the Scottish-born Buddhist
              teacher Bodhipaksa:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>A young monk strolled into the office of the head monk.</span></em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“Say, man. Would it like be okay if I smoke when I meditate?”</span></em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The head monk turned pale and began quivering. When he recovered, he
              gave the young man a stern lecture about the sanctity of meditation. The novice
              listened thoughtfully and went away.</span></em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>A few weeks later, he returned with another question.</span></em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“I’m concerned about my spiritual development. I notice that I spend a
              lot of time smoking. I was wondering, do you think it would be okay if when I
              am smoking, I practice my meditation?”</span></em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The older man was overjoyed and of course said yes.</span></em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I’m not so sure about the credentials of this pale, quivering head monk
              (or, for that matter, the novice), but I found the anecdote surprisingly
              informative. Perhaps the point isn’t what we do, but how we do it. Perhaps, in
              taking a “thou shalt not” approach, we miss the moment for the creed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When I emailed the Bodhgaya alumni to ask for help researching this
              topic, one person responded, “Wouldn’t a Buddhist smoking cigarettes be kind of
              hypocritical, irresponsible, and ironic?” It is attitudes like this that reveal
              the gap between what people believe about Buddhists and how Buddhists actually behave.
              And maybe this is the crux of this issue. Maybe this isn’t about smoking at all
              but about the ideals we place on our teachers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In his book <em>Sex, Sin, and Zen,</em> author and Zen teacher Brad Warner
              writes, “When we project our expectations about what a divine being ought to be
              onto real people, what else can we hope for besides disappointment?” After all,
              addiction does not discriminate between enlightened and unenlightened, and
              perhaps, in smoking, teachers unwillingly demonstrate that addiction is not a roadblock
              to realization. This notion—that an enlightened person can be an addicted
              person—might shatter our preconceptions about realization, but to practice
              Buddhism and believe one’s preconceptions will remain neatly intact seems about
              as naïve as believing a teacher is a divine being.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Warner’s own teacher, Gudo Nishijima, was himself a heavy smoker. But,
              said Warner, it wasn’t a problem. “He told me once that he just happened to
              notice one day that smoking was a bad habit, so he stopped doing it.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“I tend to think Buddhist teachers are like artisans who take on
              apprentices,” said Warner. “If we take that viewpoint, it’s not such a big deal
              whether the teacher smokes or not. But a teacher who smokes should know that
              their behavior is going to be imitated. If the teacher cares about that, then
              maybe they should not smoke.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So should Buddhists be required to refrain from smoking?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“I don’t think Buddhism should be in the business of requiring people to
              do or not do things. That seems to go against everything Buddhism is about. If
              you demand people follow the Buddhist rules, that demanding itself is counter
              to the Buddhist philosophical approach. The precepts are not requirements.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Randall Ryotan Eiger, sensei at the Village Zendo in Manhattan, who
              studied with Daido for eight years, was himself a smoker for 20 years, and as a
              freelance speechwriter in the 80s and 90s worked for a major tobacco company.
              His Buddhist smoking credentials run deep, so I asked him the same question.
              Should Buddhists refrain from smoking?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“To be a Buddhist means to take refuge in the three treasures of Buddha,
              dharma, and sangha,” said Ryotan. “I don’t believe one needs to be a
              non-smoker, or any particular kind of person, in order to take refuge.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Indeed, such stringent requirements would create a culture of exclusion,
              leaving out those with addictions who might otherwise benefit immensely from
              the dharma. As Dr. Brewer pointed out, his app has exposed many people to the
              dharma “through their own doorway of suffering, which is smoking.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As for Buddhist teachers, Ryotan disagreed with the idea that they have
              a “moral imperative” not to smoke.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“One sign of the moral confusion in our market-driven society is that
              people have the tendency to elevate consumer and lifestyle choices into matters
              of high moral drama, leading to overblown talk of ‘moral imperatives.’ Tortuous
              analysis of one’s thoughts and actions produces a facsimile of moral
              seriousness that is pleasing to the ego, but it is no substitute for the wisdom
              and compassion that arise from the awakened heart.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>He continued, “Is smoking inherently unhealthy, unwise, and maybe a
              little selfish? The answer is ‘yes.’ Are smokers inherently unable to realize
              their buddhanature and save all beings? The answer is ‘obviously not.’”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: center; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>_____</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Zen is not a health trip. Depending on your view of smoking, this
              response is either frustratingly reductive or refreshingly concise. For some,
              like Dr. Smith, smoking remains one of the largest thorns in Buddhism’s side.
              “Smoking involves in a personal, immediate way the core Buddhist issues of
              suffering, craving, death, compassion, and awakening,” said Smith. “What
              matters is how well one deals with those issues concretely, in smoking and
              other concrete immediate situations. Smoking isn’t the only place where we
              can engage these issues—they come up elsewhere, obviously—but it’s one of the
              ways, and we must engage them there.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>For others, the fact that some Buddhists smoke is as mundane as the fact
              that some Buddhists eat meat. But even Brad Warner understands the reservations
              one might have about teachers who smoke. “As a learner, I would steer clear of
              teachers who have such obvious bad habits on the grounds that if they can’t
              even get it together to stop smoking, how can I believe they can guide me to get
              past my own bad habits?” And yet, Warner’s own teacher smoked, and perhaps that
              is why he and other teachers are unwilling to take a stance against cigarettes.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Nirvana</span></em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '> means “extinguishing the flame.” When faced with the issue of human
              suffering, the burning ember of a lit cigarette might not seem like the highest
              priority. There is a more pressing conflagration at hand. Either you smoke, or
              you don’t smoke, yes, but in the end, we are all part of the slow burn anyhow.
              And maybe in the end, to borrow a phrase from the smoker Charles Bukowski, what
              matters most is not whether or not you smoke, but how well you walk through the
              fire.</span></p>

              <p>Please be patient, as I wish to share my personal experience on smoking, so please spare some indulgence for the following reply:-</p>
              <p>I started smoking when a packet of 20s of marlboro costs s$1.80. It was under peer pressure that I started smoking, hanging out at recessed corners of shopping centers to steal a smoke or two while in school uniform. It started innocuously enough,there is no mental tug of war on whether it was right or wrong, it was only just don't get caught. Simply part of being within a group.</p>
              <p>A few cigarettes later, when it was no longer a group ritual, where you bought cigarettes to share with your peers, you start buying for own personal consumption, stealing a smoke in the toilet, sucking cough drops to mask the cigarette of odor,splashing water in the toilet to reduce smoke of our, naively thinking the adults do not know. Still, you never considered it a habit, an addiction. You could even appreciate a fresh pack over one that was kept overnight. Smoking has become personal ritual, but still not considered an addiction as you only smoke when no one is around.</p>
              <p>So, when do you consider smoking an addiction? When you are considered a young adult, with unfettered access to purchase and right to smoke in public. Cigarettes are still cheap, $2.10(or was it $2.80? I forget),by then. Back then, they(cigarette companies) distribute cigarettes as part of advertising. Peter Stuyvesant,if I remembered correctly, nasty cigarettes! But when you are broke, it provide relieve even if the smoke have a nasty bite on the throat!</p>
              <p>So by now you have admit that you are addicted. But still,not serious problem as it is still easy to assauge the addiction. Even though you know you need one before work (stress), after work (stress), when you got to bog and the one after a meal. Especially after a meal, Ooh....what a way to complete a meal, heavenly! </p>
              <p>You know you have an addiction, when you resolve to quit when you smoking 50 sticks (2&amp;1/2packs) a day, and despite a hackers cough, you could not stop. You could literally smoke stick after stick to while time away. </p>
              <p>You know you have an addiction when you resolve to quit smoking umpteen times, only to return smoking after a period of 24, no, 36 hours of quitting. It didn't work.</p>
              <p>You switched tactics, you pace your smoking to how many cigarettes you can smoke per day, slowly cutting back. That didn't work either, the craving and relief comes back stronger after abstinence, that you doubled your rations!</p>
              <p>So, did I finally stop smoking, yes actually, twice.  Quit smoking for around four years, and surprisingly didn't smoke during NS as most picked up smoking during that period.</p>
              <p>Still, the stress alleviating and heavenly pleasure of an after meal smoke lingered in my mind. And after all, I have successfully not smoked for four years. Quitting should not be a big problem, bad mistake!</p>
              <p>Second time quitting is even harder, going through the same cycles of quitting, with an addition, mentholated, or "women"(an impression)cigarettes. Mentholated cigarettes are " supposed" to be milder and kinder to the throat, but hackers cough come and go anyway, with or without the "cool" and "mild". Smoke enough, you will get the cough.</p>
              <p>So how do you quit? With strong resolve knowing what smoking has done to you, and not allowing yourself to crave the heavenly sensation it offers. Go cold turkey, no if and buts, complete abstinence, with vigorous exercise and some other non habit forming distractions, sucking strong tasting candies in this instance. It is strongly possible you have shifted your craving to food, gaining weight. Until you no longer crave the pleasurable sensations in your mind, you will still fall back into addiction.</p>
              <p>Side steps into non direct inhaled smokes like cigars or pipe smoking will not work either, it will still lead you back to cigarette smoking. I do not know about the the current smokeless electronic gadgets. I am not keen to experiment.</p>
              <p>There are actually two forms of addiction, one physical, the other mental. The physical one  creates current craving. The other, creates lingering craving, a residual craving if you wish. It resides in within our recollection, memory.</p>
              <p>Today,I would not touch cigarettes with a twenty foot pole, because of how difficult it is for your resolve to overcome smoking. You will know how seriously your resolve becomes weaker the second time round, you might not win the third time. </p>
              <p>I am lucky to say I am smoke free for around twenty years. For those who have already quit, stay away. For those intending to smoke, please,please stay away. </p>
              <p>For those wishing or trying to quit, I say keep trying and good luck, you will succeed if you keep trying!</p>
