              mystery to Westerners looking to explore Buddhism, despite it being the
              largest, most populous temple in Thailand.<span style=" color: #999999;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">For those who
              have heard of the temple, they are probably most familiar with the<a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/makha-bucha-2016-buddhist-festival_us_56cc90dce4b0ec6725e405df"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">photos of the temple’s massive scale and grandiose ceremonies</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span>that make<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/feb/22/buddhist-monks-makha-bucha-thailand-in-pictures"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">headlines in the West.</span></a></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Curious minds who try to explore the
              temple deeper will probably have a hard time trying to find out what really
              goes on there. A quick web search of Dhammakaya and you will probably run into
              the temple’s<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://en.dhammakaya.net/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">official website</span></a>, its Wikipedia page and several
              outsider news articles about the temple: mostly negative and sensationalist
              tabloid pieces.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Defendants of the temple say the media
              distorts the facts to get views and that if you really want to know the truth
              behind Dhammakaya, you should simply come visit.<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://en.dhammakaya.net/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">The doors are always open to those interested</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span>in investigating for themselves.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">I would agree, having been a member of
              the temple for much of my life, there is no better way to find out the truth
              than to explore it for yourself, firsthand. But for those who just prefer to
              use the Internet, reading this article is an okay substitute.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">So what’s the real deal? What’s so
              different about this so called<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://inspirebyserene.blogspot.ca/2016/04/abc-news-mistakes-onion-submission-for.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">“controversial”</span></a>Buddhist temple?

              Practicality from the Bottom up</span></strong><br> One of the things I’ve noticed about how things are done at Dhammakaya is that
              they put practicality at the front of their operation. In contrast to the
              intricate and decorative design of most traditional Thai temples in Thailand,
              Wat Phra Dhammakaya sticks to a<a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://en.dhammakaya.net/about/dhammakaya-temple/the-main-chapel/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">simpler design</span></a>.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Taking a walk
              (or more practically, a drive) through Dhammakaya’s massive main temple in
              Pathum Thani and you can hardly even tell you are in a Thai temple, if
              anything; somebody who stumbles upon Dhammakaya would confuse the place for a
              small modern city. With only a few odd buildings out, such as its<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://en.dhammakaya.net/about/dhammakaya-temple/the-dhammakaya-cetiya/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">iconic, modernly designed stupa</span></a>.<br> Another uniquely Dhammakaya custom is the use of just one Buddha statue in the
              chapel, something that is distinct from the Thai custom of having a collection
              of various Buddha statues enshrined at the front.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Don’t get me
              wrong, there’s nothing wrong with elaborate architecture or having a collection
              of Buddha statues, I have even heard visitors and tourists complain about all
              the concrete and the plain design of Dhammakaya, asserting their preference for
              the more majestic beauty of traditional Thai temples.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Of course, Dhammakaya doesn’t disagree
              with incorporating beauty into temples, a Thai tradition parallel to the
              European tradition of ornate churches. It has to do simply with the custom not
              aligning with the temple’s goals. For Dhammakaya, it’s best to allocate those
              resources elsewhere and to create quick-to-build, easy to maintain buildings
              for the primary purpose of fitting temple goers.<br> An objective that makes a lot of sense when you consider that in just 40 some
              years Dhammakaya went from<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://en.dhammakaya.net/about/dhammakaya-temple/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">a single 80 acre plot of land</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span>with a few thousand attendees to the 3
              million followers worldwide today that attend the 1,000 acre campus at the main
              temple and its near 200 affiliates throughout Thailand and in 35 countries
              internationally.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As for the
              single Buddha statue issue, the reason Dhammakaya does it is because it provides
              essentially the same purpose as a collection of Buddha statues, with less of
              the work of keeping the shrine clean and dust-free.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;"><strong style="box-sizing: inherit;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Dhammakaya Centers
              Itself on Meditation</span></strong><br> Another reason Dhammakaya puts so much simplicity into the temple, other than
              practicality, has to do with its focus on meditation. The simple design allows
              for a more serene atmosphere to bring one’s thoughts inward, a detail that’s
              sensible considering the temple’s special emphasis on meditation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Anybody who has
              explored Dhammakaya is probably familiar with its slogan, “World Peace through
              Inner Peace”, coined by the temple’s abbot<a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://en.dhammakaya.net/about/the-dhammakaya-masters/phrathepyanmahamuni/"><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">the most Venerable Dhammajayo</span></a>. One
              of the most iconic traits of Dhammakaya is its devotion to the practice and
              spread of meditation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">The temple does stand out with its
              emphasis on the “center of the body” referencing<a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://en.dhammakaya.net/the-meditation/basic-dhammakaya-meditation-practice/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">the meditation technique it teaches</span></a>. While the
              technique is not exclusive to Dhammakaya and is used in a variety of temples
              throughout Thailand, Dhammakaya is by far the biggest temple that uses the
              technique.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">If you attend any service hosted by
              Dhammakaya you will find both monks and laity engaged in lengthy meditations en
              masse. If you tune into Dhammakaya’s 24 hour satellite TV program, you will hear
              reminders multiple times a day to keep the mind centered.<br> The temple’s emphasis on meditation can even be seen in its use of symbols.
              While Thai temples usually employ statues and pictures of the Buddha in a
              variety of postures and mudras, Dhammakaya puts the Buddha in a single standard
              position throughout its vast grounds; a meditation position. Dhammakaya even
              asks all followers to wear white to the temple to promote a sense of peace and
              serenity conducive to meditation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another way
              Dhammakaya reminds its members of the importance of meditation is in its use of
              regular references to the center. Everything from how they count<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="https://zeroseventwo.net/about/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">“072” (zero in Thai sounds like center, while 7 and 2 are other
              references</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span>to
              the<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://en.dhammakaya.net/the-meditation/basic-dhammakaya-meditation-practice/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">meditation technique</span></a>), to how they fold their mats
              (toward the middle).<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><br style="box-sizing: inherit;"> <strong><br style="box-sizing: inherit;"> </strong><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>A Temple with
              Followers Highly Devoted to Buddhist Principles</span></strong><br> In an<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nicholas-liusuwan/an-observation-of-a-buddh_1_b_9667086.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">earlier article</span></a>, I detailed my own experiences as a
              devout Buddhist growing up in America. And honestly, I think my experiences
              would have been much different had I not grown up a member of Dhammakaya.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another
              identifying characteristic of Dhammakaya is how devoted the members are to the
              temple and to Buddhism. The stereotypical Dhammakaya member has a no-excuses
              mentality when it comes to attending services, they never miss an opportunity
              to make merit, and they bring the teachings home with them.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">This description holds true for most
              Dhammakaya goers, even the younger attendees. And it won’t be hard finding a
              Dhammakaya member who strictly keeps all<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sila/pancasila.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">5 precepts</span></a>in his/her daily life.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">The devotion Dhammakaya members have to
              Buddhism can also be seen in its practice of uniquely Thai customs. The Thai
              tradition of short term ordination as a Buddhist monk for men has been on
              decline in modern times. But at Dhammakaya, it’s not too difficult to find a
              man who has undertaken temporary monkhood at least once.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">I myself have undertaken the Thai
              tradition of<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://ordinationthai.org/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">short-term monkhood</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span>a few times (13 occasions to be exact),
              if you include ordinations as a novice (below 20 years old) monk. That number
              may seem staggering, but I have met many fellow Dhammakaya members who have
              undertaken the short-term ordination tradition several times as well. This
              track record of devotion isn’t uncommon at all among those who identify with
              Dhammakaya.<br> So how was Dhammakaya able to achieve such a devoted base of supporters? In short,
              it has a lot to do with its distinct approach to Buddhism.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Dhammakaya is
              famous in Thailand for its strict monastic discipline aimed to uphold the faith
              of the laity. Even as a short term monk, I have encountered monks from other
              temples that have approached my group of fellow temporary monks and can
              instantly identify us as Dhammakaya because of our orderliness and the
              disciplined way we carried ourselves.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Another reason Dhammakaya commands such
              a devoted following comes down to how Dhammakaya approaches teaching Buddhism.
              The temple tends to keep Buddhism practical: focusing on self-development and
              cultivating moral character. One of the most common sermons I hear when
              attending Dhammakaya is the importance of creating good habits.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Practicality in teaching is present even
              when it comes to the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism that westerners tend to
              overlook. Your average Dhammakaya member tends to have a much stronger
              background in aspects of Buddhism involving the Law of Karma.<br style="box-sizing: inherit;"> <strong><br style="box-sizing: inherit;"> </strong><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>To Conclude</span></strong><br> Despite all these differences, it is inaccurate to call Dhammakaya its own
              sect. Talking to those on the inside, you would know Dhammakaya’s goal isn’t to
              break away from traditional Thai Buddhism, but to promote it. It’s unique
              aspects are nothing doctrinal, and are just a part of the leader,<span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a style="box-sizing: inherit;" href="http://en.dhammakaya.net/about/the-dhammakaya-masters/phrathepyanmahamuni/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;">Venerable Dhammajayo’s</span></a>, strategy to align the
              temple’s operation with his vision of promoting Buddhism and advocating
              meditation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Dhammakaya’s
              unique style however, has made itself stand out from traditional Thai Buddhism.
              And their distinct way of operation has had its own share of criticisms.
              Traditionalist critics and sensationalist tabloids looking to attract readers
              with scandalous stories about the Buddhist juggernaut are not uncommon. It’s an
              interesting situation I’d love to address, but for length reasons, let’s leave
              that for another time.<br> Controversial or not, Dhammakaya’s unconventional methods have certainly proven
              themselves effective in drawing in massive crowds and inspiring Buddhists by
              the millions. And the temple’s rapid rise in membership is definitely an
              indicator of the success of their distinct approach.</p>
