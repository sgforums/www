              <p>[<em>This article is part of a currently-in-progress resource for meditation practitioners entitled <a href="http://www.pragmaticdharma.com/guidebook/">Pragmatic Dharma : A Digital Guidebook</a></em>]</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.pragmaticdharma.com/">Pragmatic Dharma</a> is a 
              modern approach to the path of awakening.  It pulls from the time-tested
               teachings and practices of the Buddhist tradition, but is 
              simultaneously infused with a modern mindset that isn’t afraid to tinker
               with the traditional formulation.  Pragmatic Dharma, at its core, is 
              about asking the question:  What works?</p>
              <p>If something doesn’t work, then it’s relinquished.  If it works, it’s
               used.  If something else works better—at certain times or for certain 
              people—then we go with that.  In that way Pragmatic Dharma is a 
              completely practical way of approaching the spiritual path.</p>
              <p>That said, this approach begins with the Buddhist tradition as a 
              starting point.  Buddhism has one of the most exhaustive collections of 
              theory and practice to help enact spiritual transformation.  It’s built 
              upon thousands of years of individual experimentation, trial-and-error, 
              and success.  Many people have used this system to train their minds, 
              awaken their hearts, and manifest deep wisdom.  For this reason we use 
              it as a starting point, respecting the deep streams of knowledge that 
              our own exploration rides upon.</p>
              <p><strong>The Relationship of Theory and Practice</strong></p>
              <p>Pragmatic Dharma includes a collection of helpful theories and 
              practices.  At the same time it is a particular way of approaching 
              theory and practice.  If we look at the word “pragmatic” we see that it 
              stems directly from Western philosophy.  This is a description, <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pragmatism">from Wikipedia</a>, of one of the defining features of pragmatism in the Western tradition:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The pragmatist proceeds from the basic premise that the 
              human capability of theorizing is integral to intelligent practice.  
              Theory and practice are not separate spheres; rather, theories and 
              distinctions are tools or maps for finding our way in the world.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If we look at what theory is, it’s essentially an abstraction, or 
              representation, of direct experience.  It’s a way for us to take our 
              understanding and transmit, through the medium of ideas, the same 
              understanding to another person.  Language is such an important 
              innovation, because it allows us to do this.</p>
              <p>Because theory is an abstraction or representation, without directly 
              experiencing, or really understanding what these things are pointing 
              too, abstractions can remain just that.  We all know people who confuse 
              concepts about reality with reality itself.  One need only bring to mind
               a know-it-all scholar or nerd to see living examples of what happens 
              when we emphasize theory over practice.</p>
              <p>The flip side of emphasizing theory over practice, is in emphasizing 
              practice over theory.  Many people conclude that all you need to do is 
              practice and you’ll figure out everything by yourself.  But how do you 
              understand why you’re practicing or learn to practice?</p>
              <p>If you emphasize practice too much you can get what Tibetan 
              meditation master Chogyam Trungpa called “dumb meditators”—people who 
              don’t understand what they’re doing or why.  They never really got what 
              they were supposed to be looking for, so they spin out endlessly doing a
               practice, which leads to something interesting, but not to what was 
              intended.</p>
              <p>Another pitfall of leaving out theory is that we find it difficult to
               integrate the experiences we’ve had into their lives.  We have trouble 
              because we are rejecting the importance of the thinking mind.  Our 
              complex mental abilities and highly developed brains are what make us 
              distinctly human.  Without complex thought it’s unlikely that we’d even 
              be able to ask ourselves the important spiritual questions.  <em>Homo sapien</em> is latin for “knowing man” or “wise man.”  It can be a disaster if we throw out the “wise” part of our evolutionary heritage.</p>
              <p>What’s encouraging is that if we can these helpful theories <em>into</em> practice, using them as maps to help us find our way, then we get into 
              the business of having direct experiences ourselves.  Through doing this
               we become internal scientists, and can begin to confirm, reject, and 
              even build upon the theories we’ve been handed.  Theories are alive and 
              open-ended when we can test their validity.  They are not the end point 
              but rather the starting point for an incredible journey.</p>
              <p><strong>Awakening is Possible</strong></p>
              <p>At the center of this whole approach is the shining gem of Awakening.
                Awakening is often experienced as a process—sometimes rapid and 
              sometimes more progressive—by which the sense of personal identity is 
              radically transformed.  Identity begins as a small, separate, and 
              localized phenomenon that is always in reference to <em>my</em> body, <em>my</em> emotions, <em>my</em> perception, and <em>my</em> self.  Through questioning the very assumptions this sense of identity 
              rests upon it transforms to a more expansive, open-ended, and constantly
               changing situation, one that can simultaneously include us, but which 
              goes beyond us as well.  This shift brings an incredible sense of 
              internal freedom, expansiveness, and well-being.</p>
              <p>To say that Awakening is possible is to say that we acknowledge from 
              the beginning that this transformation, which has been described and 
              taught by people for millennia, is a real possibility for us.  It isn’t 
              something that happened to someone else a long time ago, or happens only
               for special people, but is a living potential for us.  If we don’t 
              believe it’s possible, than it’s highly unlikely we’ll be able to 
              marshal the resources to begin the journey, let alone to arrive at the 
              “destination” of abiding awakening.</p>
              <p><strong>Maps are Helpful</strong></p>
              <p>Along with recognizing that awakening is possible, another key 
              feature of Pragmatic Dharma is that we recognize that there are helpful 
              maps which describe some of the underlying patterns of spiritual 
              development.  The specifics of our experience can vary quite a bit, but 
              the underlying pattern of spiritual development appears to be hardwired 
              into our biology and psychology.  These deep patterns form the basis for
               the maps which describe the Stages of Concentration and the Stages of 
              Insight and Awakening.</p>
              <p>At the same time, we hold these maps as useful pointers only, not as 
              ultimate truths.  It’s important to not completely give over our 
              authority to someone else’s theory, as convincing as it may be, but to 
              verify for ourselves what is true, what works, and what does not.  This 
              is another way in which Pragmatic Dharma stands apart from more 
              traditional faith-based approaches.</p>
              <p><strong>Reality-Testing is Crucial</strong></p>
              <p>What happens if we’re willing to question and test the various 
              assumptions and ideals that we bring to the spiritual path?  What 
              happens if we question the ideals and models that come from the 
              spiritual traditions?  Reality testing is the constant commitment to 
              holding in question our own beliefs and theories, and those of others, 
              until we can test and verify things for ourselves.  Even once we’ve done
               so, reality testing invites us to continue holding open the door for 
              new information or experiences to transform our understanding.  Reality 
              testing is a way to live in concert with change.</p>
              <p>A wonderful example of reality testing comes from the Western 
              scientist and philosopher Galileo Galilei.  Often referred to as “the 
              father of modern science” Galileo was well-known for turning the 
              geocentric view of the earth on its head—the belief that the earth is at
               the center of the universe.  By using a high-powered telescope and 
              observing the movement of various  celestial bodies he discovered that 
              the sun was at the center of the observable universe.  This became known
               as the heliocentric view, and serves as the basis for what we now refer
               to as our “solar system.”  Galileo used direct observation to discover 
              something new.  And by doing this he completely upended the theories of 
              his day.</p>
              <p>Reality testing doesn’t happen just on a personal level, but also 
              happens within a community of peers.  There is much we can learn alone, 
              but we can’t ultimately do it by all ourselves.  Even Galileo was 
              standing on the shoulders of hundreds of years of scientific exploration
               and developing technology.  So we use everything that has come before 
              us, as well as our peers and mentors to help refine our own observations
               and understandings.  Or to put it in a more humorous way, as <a href="http://www.pragmaticdharma.com/the-three-speed-transmission/">Kenneth Folk</a> once did, we recognize that “enlightenment is a team sport.”</p>
              <p><strong>Openness &amp; Transparency For the Win!</strong></p>
              <p>The final principle of Pragmatic Dharma is that openness and 
              transparency beat out secrecy and dogma every time.  When information is
               accessible we don’t have to reinvent the wheel ourselves.  We can 
              quickly learn from others and build upon that learning.  And instead of 
              relying on some special empowerment or secret instruction we have all 
              the information we need to begin.  We treat each other like adults, who 
              can handle complexity, rather than like children, who often need 
              information pre-digested for them.</p>
              <p>An environment of openness and transparency can also allow us to 
              reveal things about our experience that we might not otherwise reveal.  
              Often our cutting edge lies in the areas that are most difficult to 
              explore or see.  When we value openness and transparency we don’t have 
              to be as afraid of going into those areas.  There is an incredible power
               that gets unlocked through doing this.</p>
              <p>Another thing that happens, especially as a community, if we 
              preference openness and transparency, is that authority begins to become
               more widely distributed.  Instead of authority only being at the top of
               a hierarchy, with the founders of a tradition, or the senior teachers 
              or lineage holders, authority also rests in the hands of regular people.
                Everyone who can realize something for themselves and share what 
              they’ve gleaned is a source of spiritual wisdom.  And this massively 
              distributed authority is not a flat, “everyone is equal” point of view. 
               Rather it’s a naturally flowing hierarchy of knowledge and skill, which
               is inherently dynamic and flexible.</p>
              <p>When everyone in a community is more empowered to learn and share it 
              creates an incredible positive feedback loop of enthusiasm, skill, and 
              energy.  People become more invested in what they’re doing and more 
              empowered to embody their own wisdom.  And because we haven’t thrown out
               a recognition of varying levels of depth there’s a constant stream of 
              checks and balances throughout the system, which if set up properly can 
              become self-regulating.  Of course, this is the ideal, and with all 
              ideals reality-testing again becomes important.  But these principles 
              have been enacted well in other systems and we can learn a lot from 
              them.  Indeed, I would say that if we ever want to have a shot at 
              modernizing the path of awakening, we’ll have to.</p>
