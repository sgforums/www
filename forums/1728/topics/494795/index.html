              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Les Kaye SUMMER 2011 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">All the “spills” we create—not just with our hands but in the
              ocean of personal relationships as well—begin in our own mind. Distracted by
              the many things we have to do in a brief time, our attention wanders away from
              taking care of the activity in front of it, becoming concerned instead for
              finishing the task as quickly as it can so it can move on to another item on
              its list of priorities. Giving in to distraction, we give up caring about the
              activity we are doing. And in a subtle but real way, when we do that we also
              give up caring about our self, about the value of the effort we are making with
              our life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Perhaps like never before, a major concern these busy and
              stressful days is for the lack of time—time to do everything that needs to be
              done, to do it “on time,” and to do it in a quality way. But the real problem
              for us is not about the scarcity of time— which we can, after all, learn to
              manage through a variety of strategies. Instead, the real source of suffering
              is the feeling that “I must get on to something else; this activity is taking
              too much time.” When we have this attitude, we really don’t know what we are
              doing—our mind is somewhere else, not focused on what it earlier decided it
              needs to take care of. If we don’t know what we are doing, how can we be our
              self? If our mind is somewhere else, it means we are trying to be someone else,
              not who we are in the present moment. However, by practicing awareness, we can
              train ourselves to respond to distractions in a positive way and increase our
              capacity to give full attention to the task or relationship before us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The quiet, empty space of zazen reveals the mind’s addiction
              to imagining the future and reminiscing about the past. It helps us understand
              how dwelling in a time other than the present starts to churn the ego:
              anxieties arise, desires become distractions, and to do things well is nearly
              impossible. But when there is no idea of time, there are no expectations, and
              desires do not become a problem.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Meditation teaches us to be wary of allowing ideas of time to
              interfere with our activity. Through experience, we discover how not to lose
              our self, but instead to be fully engaged in the “doing” of whatever it is we
              decided that we must do. Awareness practice is like any other skill-building
              activity. It is not meant to be casual, or occasional, or reserved for only
              when convenient.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By setting aside ideas of how productive or efficient we are
              in our use of time, we can take time to take care of ourselves physically,
              emotionally, and spiritually. Meditation is the best way to “manage” time, the
              best way to prevent spills. Spilling something and making a mess can be a
              signal that we are too concerned about time and all the things we have to do.
              Developing the skill to recognize that we are distracted and to return the mind
              to awareness of the present moment enables us to appreciate our self in all
              activities.</span></p>
