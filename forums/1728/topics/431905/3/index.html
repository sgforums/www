Why can't just teach Mahayana vehicle(Bodhisattva way) 2500 yrs ago?

              <p><br>erm why would Arahats <strong>stay</strong> in their nirvana for <strong>eons</strong>? eons sound as if it's limited and as if nirvana is a place? "Liberated" why cannot return to samsara? as in Buddha was liberated from suffering and achieved nirvana at the age of 35, and was He not still alive in samsara? Buddha Parinirvana at the age of 80. then between 35 to 80, He's not liberated? then why say He's Fully Enlightened? in Sanskrit canon, and even in Pali canon, nirvana is not extinction.</p>

              <p>to me, He did teach it to lay buddhists, who are more into Bodhisattva ideal. the ordained are more into arahat ideal. it's the lay buddhists or bodhisattvas that follow up the sanskrit canon.</p>
              <p>but i think the pali canon also acknowledge that Buddha did teach the Bodhisattva ideal.</p>

              <p>The Existence of the Universe</p>
              <p>In their attempts to prove God’s existence, Christians will sometimes say “The universe didn’t just happen, someone must have made it and therefore there must be a creator God.” There is a major flaw in this argument. When it starts to rain ~e do not ask “Who is making it rain?” because we know that rain is caused not by someone but by something – natural phenomena like heat, evaporation, precipitation, etc. When we see smooth stones in a river, we do not ask “Who polished those stones?” because we know that the smooth surface of the stones was caused not by someone but by something – natural causes like the abrasive action of water and sand.</p>
              <p>All of these things have a cause (or causes) but this need not be a being. It is the same with the universe – it was not brought into being by a God but by natural phenomena like nuclear fission, gravity, inertia, etc. However, even if we believe that a divine being is needed to explain how the universe came into existence, what proof is there that it was the Christian God? Perhaps it was created by the Hindu God, the God of Islam or one of the gods worshipped by tribal religions. After all most religions, not only Christianity, claim that their God or gods created the universe.</p>
              <p>The Argument from Design</p>
              <p>In response to the above refutation, the Christian will maintain that the universe does not merely exist but its existence shows perfect design. There is, a Christian might say, an order and balance which point to its having been designed by a higher intelligence, and that this higher intelligence is God. But as before, there are some problems with this argument.</p>
              <p>Firstly, how does the Christian know that it was his God who is behind creation? Perhaps it was the gods of non-Christian religions who designed and created the universe.</p>
              <p>Secondly, how does the Christian know that only one God designed everything? In fact, as the universe is so intricate and complex we could expect it to need the intelligence of several, perhaps dozens, of gods to design it. So if anything the argument from design proves that there are many gods, not one as Christians claim.</p>
              <p>Next, we would have to ask, is the universe perfectly designed? We must ask this because if a perfect God designed and created the universe, then that universe should be perfect. Let us first look at inanimate phenomena to see whether they show perfect design. Rain gives us pure water to drink but sometimes it rains too much and people lose their lives, their homes and their means of livelihood in floods. At other times it doesn’t rain at all and millions die in drought and famine. Is this perfect design? The mountains give us joy as we see them reaching up into the sky. But landslides ~nd volcanic eruptions have for centuries caused havoc and death. Is this perfect design? The gentle breezes cool us but storms and tornadoes repeatedly cause death and destruction. Is this perfect design? These and other natural calamities prove that inanimate phenomena do not exhibit perfect design and therefore that they were not created by a perfect God.</p>
              <p>Now let us look at animate phenomena to see whether they reveal perfect design. At a superficial glance, nature seems to be beautiful and harmonious; all creatures are provided for and each has its task to perform. However, as any biologist will confirm, nature is utterly ruthless. To live, each creature has to feed on other creatures and struggle to avoid being eaten by other creatures. In nature, there is no time for pity, love or mercy. If a loving God designed everything, why did such a cruel design result? The animal kingdom is not only imperfect in the ethical sense, it is also imperfect in that it often goes wrong. Every year ~lions of babies are born with physical or mental disabilities, or are stillborn or die soon after birth. Why would a perfect creator God design such terrible things?</p>
              <p>So if there is design in the universe, much of it is faulty and cruel. This would seem to indicate that the universe was not created by a perfect all-loving God.</p>

              <p>But when u say Buddha Shakyamuni, it's different. That was his job as a Buddha to show the way. He remained in samsara to teach people the way to liberation. But Arahats are already liberated, why is there a need for them to come back as bodhisattvas. If they were to remain in nirvana(which is the whole point of Buddhism), then isn't it better? Somemore, there are countless buddhas. As if these countless buddhas can't do the job of liberating more sentient beings? No offense to those countless buddhas.</p>

              <p>you certainly cant reach more than 100 in your lifetime becos you will lost some of their contact information</p>
              <p>Similarly Buddhas of Past Aeons also do not have close affinity to your friend except you yourself wad .So if countless Buddha dont know your close friend well , do you think they able to guide your close friend ? affinity is a results of cause and condition .Its already stated in the Buddha's time, that even some of his sangha still reborn in hell ,bcos there nothing the Buddha can do ,when  karmic offense is that great .</p>

              <p>arhats don't have skilful means to lead others to liberation as compared to buddha? of course. but they are already liberated, why should they go back to samsara since there are countless buddhas? can say thats the duty of the buddhas since they are omniscient and all. </p>
              <p>if you say Arhat nirvana is incomplete, thats just because you subscribe to the notion coming from your so-called Tientai school. But in the Pali Canon suttas(can't remember which), it's said that the Buddha said that once they attain liberation, to quote if i may, "theres nothing else to do." So in other words, u are refuting what Buddha Shakyamuni has said.</p>

That was the goal. The Buddha could have taught something else, to the effect to lead the people then on the Bodhisattva path, to get them to be bodhisattvas and not lead them to become Arahats. </p>

              <p>no, not that the historical Buddha couldn't teach Mahayana. the 'Mahayana' vehicle is just a label or a name. what i'm saying is what was taught 2500 years ago by Buddha, was actually the Theravadin-Arahat ideal. That was the goal. The Buddha could have taught something else, to the effect to lead the people then on the Bodhisattva path, to get them to be bodhisattvas and not lead them to become Arahats. </p>

              <p>I am not sure if I understood you.  The bodhisattva ideal is emphasized by Mahayana.  You are saying that the historical Buddha should have taught people to achieve bodhisattva and not arahat?</p>
              <p>All that the Buddha taught was suffering and end to suffering.  Everthing else was made up by his disciples!</p>

              <p>The world had been suffering before the birth of Jesus Christ, was suffering during Jesus Christ era and is still suffering after the death of Jesus Christ.  He had already came once but did not stop the sufferings of the world. His 2nd coming (if it is true) will not make any difference. Who are we still waiting for to stop our sufferings ? Listen to Buddha, only we ourselves can liberate ourselves from sufferings. Wait no more.</p>
              <p>If you read up on history, you will realise the world has been suffering from earthquakes, tsunamis, flood, famine, drought and many other natural disasters for thousands of years, years before the birth of Jesus Christ.</p>

              <p>I make a distinction between distributing the gift of the dharma and coming back as bodhisattva to 'save' the world.  The former is what I think the Buddha said while the latter is an individual's idealistic aspiration.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Going back to history, there were monks/nuns who were scholars, thinkers, analysts, charismatic leaders, teachers and writers.<span>  </span><span> </span>That they developed their own ideas, interpretations, analyses, approaches, inclinations and aspirations shouldn’t sound surprising and thus must inevitably separate in order to distinguish one from another.<span>  </span>Some schools faded and disappeared for good while others gained acceptance, popularity, and support and grew to be where they are today.</span></p>
