              <p>The world had been suffering before the birth of Jesus Christ, was suffering during Jesus Christ era and is still suffering after the death of Jesus Christ.  He had already came once but did not stop the sufferings of the world. His 2nd coming (if it is true) will not make any difference. Who are we still waiting for to stop our sufferings ? Listen to Buddha, only we ourselves can liberate ourselves from sufferings. Wait no more.</p>
              <p>If you read up on history, you will realise the world has been suffering from earthquakes, tsunamis, flood, famine, drought and many other natural disasters for thousands of years, years before the birth of Jesus Christ.</p>

              <p><br>At another perspective, Buddhism exists longer than Christian and sufferings are abound. Those less suffered are called fortunate. Lucky to be well off suffering levels. I see logistics and medical advances and insurance policies probably helped lessen suffering more.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I find this thread rather
                  intriguing.<span> </span> Let’s get real and
                  down-to-earth.<span> </span> What exactly did the
                  Buddha taught in his life-time?<span> </span> What
                  caused schisms within the original Buddha-sangha?<span> </span> The many schools or traditions were the result of
                  not only dissatisfactions within the monastic but the desire to
                  interpret Buddha’s teaching in their own perspective, idealism,
                  aspirations, and adaptation to ethnicity, absorption of local
                  customs, culture and beliefs.<span> </span> While
                  there is one common chord, the Four Noble Truths, the various
                  schools are as different as apple and orange, at least from the
                  outer skin.<span> </span> Each must stake their own
                  truth and superiority over the other, hence you find the expression
                  ‘inferiority’ mentioned.<span> </span> There is no
                  one vehicle; there is greater or lesser vehicle to take you to
                  Nirvana, just like you can take a Mercedes limousine or a Hyundai
                  taxi to the airport!</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Going back to history, there were
                  monks/nuns who were scholars, thinkers, analysts, charismatic
                  leaders, teachers and writers.<span> </span> <span> </span>That they developed their own ideas,
                  interpretations, analyses, approaches, inclinations and aspirations
                  shouldn’t sound surprising and thus must inevitably separate in
                  order to distinguish one from another.<span> </span> Some schools faded and disappeared for good while others gained
                  acceptance, popularity, and support and grew to be where they are
                  today.</span></p>

              <p>Bodhisattva ideal was mentioned.  So, it isn't idealistic?</p>
              <p>Whether Theravada or Mahayana, the Buddha certainly did not urge his disciples at his parinirvana to return to samsara or to upgrade themselves.</p>

              Buddha did not discourage returning as bodhisattva but did not encourage either as the time has not come to teach mahayana in the pali sutta, so it does not contradict. Mahayana sutras are latter revealed teachings. Its complicated and I will not dwell on this but there is another thread about the origin of mahayana sutras which you can search.

              <p>Arahats stay in their nirvana for eons, i read that from books. U see, the whole point of Buddhism is liberation, so if Arahats are already liberated, imo, there should be no need to call them back. Might as well say, the whole point of practising Buddhism is to have arahats, they are already liberated and then Buddhas come and preach Dhamma to teach people to be liberated. </p>
              <p>But when u say Buddha Shakyamuni, it's different. That was his job as a Buddha to show the way. He remained in samsara to teach people the way to liberation. But Arahats are already liberated, why is there a need for them to come back as bodhisattvas. If they were to remain in nirvana(which is the whole point of Buddhism), then isn't it better? Somemore, there are countless buddhas. As if these countless buddhas can't do the job of liberating more sentient beings? No offense to those countless buddhas.</p>

              <p>ok, i got bit time. :)</p>
              <p>it depends, i see/illustrate this "liberation" as <em>graduation</em> and going out to society to earn a living. we can agree that Buddha's knowledge/wisdom is unlimited as compare to arahats, as with the handful of leaves simile. Buddha become Buddha due to his previous numerous Bodhisatta path. one can earn a living after graduation from college/high school, For example. one can "forever" carry on with this kind of living without changing anything until death, if one is not bored of the living, OR one can go for further study to become more knowledgeable, like Master, PHD etc. this is a common mind of upgrading oneself to become better until there's no more higher.</p>
              <p>so the arahats can also exit nirvanic state (not place) and try to advance into the All knowing Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>but there were also some arahat disciples of Buddha that had reached beyond Mahayana wisdom and i called them Great/Maha Arahats, i.e. <em>graduated from Mahayana wisdom</em>. they are liberated and no need any more learning. besides, learning itself is also a problem according to Mahayana wisdom.</p>
              <p>they can stay even in samsara and still experience Nirvanic bliss. samsaric is transform into nirvanic. samsara is samsara, to delusional beings, but not to a liberated being. end of suffering is even higher when one can be non-suffering amid the "suffering" of samsara.</p>
              <p>like stress in the modern society. one can go and relax in some remote place and have a peace of life. but when they return to work, they suffer stress again. those that can withstand stress and still be at peace is the one i salute the most rather than the escapists.</p>

              <p>Lol i wonder who was the 1 who 'requested' the deletion. IF i didn't like any of your posts, maybe i could request deletion and it'd get deleted too. The onus is on you as 1 of the moderators here, to deem fitting the request or not. As far as i'm concerned, the stuff i typed in that post was essentially the same as my previous posts made. It's no big deal and I'll let this slide. Unless of course more people were to come forward and request deletion of all my posts too </p>

And starting from the earlier post you made about 'graduation' etc, too. That is so common in alot of buddhism forums right...Arahat=PSLE, Buddhahood=Ph.D. I also know. Sorry, i'm not convinced still.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">BTW, i do not always equal Theravada to be hinayana. Both Mahayana and Theravada can also have "mahayanist" and "hinayanist".<span> </span> they are mentalities per se.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">the mentality of the hinayana WITHIN the Mahayana school would want to "see" that one do not breach the precept with their Bodies. while the mahayana mentality would want to "see" that one do not breach the precept with their MIND, which is even more difficult per se.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">as we all know the teaching of egolessness or selflessness of person (Skt. pudgalanairatmya).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">but have you learned the egolesseness or selflessness of phenomena (Skt. dharma-nairatmya)? understanding, selflessness of phenomena, you accomplished selflessness of person. but understand selflessness of person might not accomplish selflessness of phenomena.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">so base on my experience on Hua Yen Sutra/Buddha vehicle(</span><span style="font-family: SimSun; font-size: 10pt;">ä¸€ä¹˜æ³•</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">), and seeing people's reactions, i had notice the difference between hinayana and mahayana not base on the apparent or what people had wrote or journalized, that said Theravada is Theravada/Arahathood and Mahayana is Mahayana/Bodhisattvahood. or Theravada is hinayana.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">No. i think within Theravada, there's mahayana And hinayana. And within Mahayana, there's hinayana and mahayana. All in one, one in All. note i use cap for the 'm' and 'M'.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">What differences?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">hinayana cultivator - emphasis on the apparent meaning of what Buddha said; emphasis on sunyata of self; clear distinction between Buddhism from worldly dharma; prefer to meditate base on stillness of body; avoid polutions best as possible.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">mahayana cultivator - emphasis more on the significant than apparent; emphasis on sunyata of self And Dharma itself; able to blend/use worldly dharma to convert into Buddhadharma; able to meditate amidst daily activities. ie after they had cultivated bodily stillness in the mountain, they re-enter 'polutions' of urban area to enhance their meditative stillness. such standard of stillness of the mind is more powerful.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">so sometime i can fall into the hinayana category and sometimes in mahayana category. but look forward to practice like mahayana standard, while hinayana is my foundation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">imho,</span></p>
