              A Cup of Tea
              
              Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868-1912), received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.
              
              Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept on pouring.
              
              The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself. "It is overfull. No more will go in!"
              
              "Like this cup," Nan-in said, "you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?"

              <p>All the yanas do not lack the essence of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, or any visualising  deities are embodiment of Paramitas, compassion, wisdom, generosity etc. Do not think  less of these methods of practice. It depends on your predominant defilement on which deity practice is more suitable for you.</p>
              <p>It is a shame that not only that you are unable receive blessings from the others vehicles, because you have created a division in your mind, a prejudice which will hinder you in your cultivation. Also your views created your personality.   All this will create friction, owing to your uninhibited expressions. Please be mindful that you don't demonize what you don't agree or unable to accept. It does'nt help matters in any way.</p>
              <p>You reminded me of a evangelist from America I saw in an religious rally many years ago in Singapore. He denigrated the statues of Buddha in Burma, now Myanmar. He does'nt understand the word offensive, what about you? The moment you mouth your ill feelings, this bastard , that bitch ,it gets personal, you create ill will. Yes, you are more refined and eloquent than that, but the ill will created is negative and counterproductive. Ill will obscures and negates good reasoning, a shame, is'nt it? </p>
              <p>Buddhism of course can be studied and read more,but you create view points which is really contextual. See the manifestations for the embodiment  they really represent. If you practice Avalokiteshvara, emulate the compassion, or Manjushri, cultivate wisdom. But that is hard for you now, for you have created an aversion, also a grasping or clinging to the external form. You missed the symbolism involved. You also under valued Bodhicitta!</p>
              <p>It took around 20 years or so before I finally  took the 3 refuges, I hope it will not take you that long! We all have varying experiences and backgrounds, therefore world views differ too. So please understand our beliefs and affinity are not homogenous, neither gain attainment on the same breadth! The wisdom and aspiration of Mahayana Buddhism to free all! All are complementary!</p>
              <p>If you are comfortable with Theravada teachings, read if you must, but practice to experience what Buddhism is all about, what is Self, what causes Suffering. </p>
              <p>A simple analogy for experience; imagine everybody have chronic backache or some other ache all their lives,and along the way. we manage find temporary relief and then we realise what relief from backache means. In this instance the Buddha found permanent relief.</p>
              <p>But, because that you have experienced relief and others had not, how will you be able to relate that to those that have not experienced relief. You now understand what it is to suffer and also what bliss the relief brings,where previously you had not. You must has had to experience the suffering and relief to be able to relate. You start with temporary then later onto permanent relief. </p>
              <p>Another experience analogy, you see colour but the colourblind only see shades of gray. They will never see the explosion or vividness of colours, just like we will never see ultraviolet light like a bee.</p>

              <p>Contrary to what you asserted, I am trying very hard to debunk
                  false views propagated by the degenerated schools/traditions of
                  Buddhism in order not to be stuck.  For instance, the many
                  buddhas of past and future.  That bodhisattva are like
                  saviours and Buddha had supernatural powers.</p>

              <p>I shall focus on Buddha's power.  Could you specify what kind of power the Buddha had and how it is compare to "people nowadays have powers".  I know what kinds of power people have, for example: power of corruption, power of authority (legitimate as well as illegitimate), power by possesion of arms, power of using money, power of influence, power of physical/sensual attraction, ...... and more (perhaps, you can add).</p>

              <p>Your observation is correct.  We don't have to talk about other religion.  Here, you see dogma and dogmatic practice in this thread and forum.</p>
              <p>Dogma means a set of beliefs that people are expected to accept without reasoning.  Many here had advocated their beliefs and expect visitors here to accept without reasoning.  Buddhism, they advocated is not based on logic (and logic is reasoning)!</p>
              <p>Dogmatic means holding one's beliefs very strongly and expecting other people to accept them without questionings.  Some of my pertinent questions were ignored.</p>
