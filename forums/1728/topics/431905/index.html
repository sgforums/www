              <p>Loppon Namdrol:</p>
              <p><br><br>I am simply reporting what Garab Dorje, Padmasambhava, Shri Singha et al actually say. I don't need to interpret anything. <br><br>In
               HÄ«nayÄ�na, Shakyamuni taught arhatship as buddhahood. In MahÄ�yana, he 
              taught that arhatship was not buddhahood, and was inferior to 
              buddhahood. And that in fact, after attaining arhatship, arhats would be
               roused from their nirodhasamapatti at some point and then they must 
              traverse the paths of stages of MahÄ�yÄ�na. So, was the Buddha lying in 
              HinÄ�yÄ�na when he told his followers that arhatship was it? <br><br>In 
              VajrayÄ�na, in the Samputa tantra it is clarified that there are three 
              stages of Buddhahood. Two stages of Buddhas who do not recognize all 
              phenomena as being the display of their own wisdom and the thireenth 
              bhumi, Vajradhara, where all phenomena are so recognized. Does this make
               the Buddha a liar about MahÄ�yÄ�na?<br><br>In Dzochen, there are 
              enumerated another three stages, three more stages of those who dwell 
              within wisdom, rendering the thirteenth bhumi a lower stage of 
              buddhahood. Does this make the Buddha a liar about VajrayÄ�na? <br><br>In
               any event, this notion of "Buddhahood that reverts to the basis [gzhi, 
              not kun gzhi]" as an inferior buddhahood that is not complete is well 
              attested in Dzogchen. It has to be the case because as Garab Dorje 
              points out, all sentient beings in the previous eon attain buddhahood by
               the end of the eon. This is explicitly stated by Garab Dorje in the 
              commentary I mentioned to above.<br><br>But to illustrate my point 
              further, the Drikung view is Dzogchen is definitely subordinated. For 
              example, Jigten Sumgon states in Gongcik: “The supreme realization is 
              not touched by the three great ones.” This is echoe of a statement by 
              Gampopoa to his nephew, Gomchung. <br><br>But I don't during Jigten 
              Sumgon's time Nyingthig was wide spread. At this point in history 
              Nyingma was very much on the decline.</p>

              <p>Wah this thread... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/oh.png" alt="oh.png"></p>
              <p>I got questions to ask ...</p>
              <p>Why is there a distinction of Arhats and Bodhisattvas?</p>
              <p>Buddha discovered the initial path and pointed the way out, and the arhats followed it, but both leads to Nirvana and enlightenment.</p>
              <p>But bodhisattvas have higher goal: to reach out to more sentient beings and lead them to the right path... But if the arhats take in disciples, teach dharmas to laity, aren't they are bodhisattvas as well...? Why it sound inferior in the Mahayana context? Be it arhats or bodhisattvas... all leads to Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>What is Dzogchen....? Is it a dharma door? Sorry and the last paragraphs I do not know the names...</p>

              <p>correction. Buddha did not teach Arahatship as Buddhahood in Hinayana or Theravada or whatever labels. In Theravada, Buddhahood and Arhatship are cleared defined and spelt out. At that time, there were no Theravada or Mahayana. anyway since the goal of most people is to get out of samsara, Buddha taught the path. I have talked to a Bhante in Theravada tradition, he knew what is arhatship and the path to Buddha. but that is not to say there are no monks in Theravada that cannot practise the path of Buddhahood, it depends on their aspirations really.</p>
              <p>You have to be clear. The aspirations of Buddhahood are different from those aspirations for the common folks like you and me. I dare say most people would like an end of suffering ie getting out of samsara. But if you are to aspire to be a Buddha, you need to undergo much more than the path to Arhatship. there are no right and wrong on this, only your aspirations.</p>

              <p>During Buddha era, basically, all its followers then from ascetics practitioners were liberated to arhat states and gradually, these arhats continues to follow the skilfull means of Buddha expediency to upgrade them to Mahayana. Finally, as stated in the Lotus Sutra, achieving the only one vehicle of Buddhaness, as all the other vehicles are merely expediency, to reach the final goal. Similarly, for some, like the secular education, the kindergarden is just the earlier stage designed to achieve the final goal of professorship/doctorate level.</p>
              <p>In spite of the above, there are many who bypass some level as their aptitude is tremendously high in view of their many past lives of merits accrued. Another aspects is the hardworked of practice with good teachers, that pushed all their scattering merits into this lifespan, to attain fruition of buddhaness <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Basically is emptiness, the decrees of emptiness <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>the word arhat is literally translated in pali or sanskirt as "no more learning / æ— å­¦" or graduated( from six realm). in Mahayana, we got 10 realms (including the 4 noble realms). Mahayana sutra name the "upgraded" arahats as "Great" Arahats. Great mean Maha. that mean they are no more learning from Mahayana. 'Graduated' from the 10 realms.  not hinayana. :)</p>

              Arhat is achieved thru self liberate. Meaning to say they dun practice Pu ti xin.
              Its all inside their precept and inside pu sha jie (bodhisattva vow) abandon pu ti xin is a sin.
              
              Becoming an Arhat doesnt mean u stop there, buddhahood is the final destination. Only Mi zhong can achieve buddhahood in 1 life time.
              
              Now for infor. Shakyamuni doesnt achieve buddhahood in 1 life time. He achieved thru 3 da ar seng di jie. And how long is 1 ar send ti jie.... its 1 plus  47 zero behind. 
              
              Different ppl has different affinity and ability so there are different paths to follow but utimately all has to become buddha.

              <p>Its not polite to use the term hinayana because hina means lowly or derogatory.</p>
              <p>There are very few people who can become arahants.</p>
              <p>I am quite sure none of the people on this forum can achieve it in this lifetime.</p>

              <p><br>cannot like that say. it's more inconceivable than word can say regarding pureland path. once born in pureland, one is at least an 8th stage bodhisattva(Mahayana non-retrogress state). those got practice one, their attainment will be <strong>double</strong> by Amitabha when Amitabha shine His light on you during the time of rebirth.</p>
              <p>and, conventional saying, there are 4 different "lands" for different level. first is for ordinary people, second for arahat realisation, third for bodhisattva realisation, fourth for Buddhas. but ultimately, and inconceivable, there's no level, as Pureland is land of Equality. Your power is equal to Amiatbha. and once born there, one's already beyond a "resemblance Buddha" of the ten realm. the four lands can also be seen as the three bodies of Buddha, i.e Dharmakaya for the fouth, Sambhogakaya for the third and the rest nirmanakaya. t'is why pureland path is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> for all class</span> of different level.</p>
              <p>some with realisation also cannot conceive the Pureland path. as one is using a thinking mind. i can relate this to Dzogchen by Loppon Namdrol.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Dzogchen is not rocket science. It is very easy to understand if you have an open mind and you do not go around complicating things.<br><br>Sometimes, the biggest obstacle to understanding Dzogchen that people have is Buddhism, so they constantly try to compare Dzogchen with the vehicles of cause and result. This causes them to automatically deviate. Dzogchen is completely beyond cause and result. All notions of paths and stages are completely irrelevant in Dzogchen.<br><br>There are mainly one thing that matters in Dzogchen -- whether or not you are a fortunate person. If you are a fortunate person you will meet a master who has experience who can demonstrate to you your real condition and the methods to discover that for yourself. <strong>You do not have to be an educated person like me who has studied way too many books. There is a saying in Dzogchen,</strong> <strong>an illterate person who has personal experience of their real state will gain liberation far sooner</strong> <strong>than a Pandita who is expert in a hundred dharma systems but does not have that experience.</strong> Dzogchen is not intellectual. It is based on personal experience. You do not have to be literate, or particularly well educated to have that experience. Our friend adinatha will tell you that realization of Dzogchen based on the blessings of the lineage. But actually, it is based on recognizing a personal experience. Maybe we mean the same thing. <strong>Certainly having that recognition is wonderful thing, inexpressible, a cause for faith and a great blessing.</strong> But collecting blessings and reciting supplications will never get you that experience. Only an experienced master who has that experience will able to introduce it to you in a direct personal way. That is the best blessing.<br><br>N</p>

              Forgot to add, that what unique Mahayana is bodhicitta. Very important.  now then  realise, that every time u deeply generate this towards all sentient beings, u'll feel as if the entire world system trembles, Buddhas, bodhisattas, gods, etc take notice. It is it that get one going.

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">According to Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, there are 2 main stereotypes and prejudices that have divided followers of the two main forms of Buddhism:</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">  (1) Arahants, and TheravÄ�din Buddhists, are concerned exclusively with their own salvation as opposed to the benefit of others; they have a narrow fixation on personal liberation because they are "fearful of birth and death" and therefore have little compassion for others and don't undertake activities intended to benefit them.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">  (2) Followers of the bodhisattva ideal, and MahÄ�yÄ�na Buddhists, are so much involved in social projects aimed at benefiting others that they don't take up the practice that the Buddha assigned to his disciples, namely, the taming of the mind and the development of insight. They have overwhelmed themselves with social duties and forsaken meditation practice.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">  Buddha’s arahant diciples did not just selfishly reaped the benefits of the path and did nothing for others.<span>  </span>In the<span>  </span>suttas, there were many who became great teachers in their own right who were capable of guiding others towards liberation.<span>  </span>The best known among them are SÄ�riputta, MahÄ�kaccÄ�na, MoggÄ�llana, and Ä€nanda.<span>  </span>For 400 years, the Buddhist texts were preserved orally, transmitted from teachers to pupils, all for the purpose of preserving the good Dharma and Vinaya in the world.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">  Although the bodhisattva vows to work for the welfare of others, their efforts are superficial if they are not motivated and supported by true<span>  </span>bodhicitta.<span>  </span>The ability to give materials and security are worthy but do not equal in value to the gift of the Dharma. The gift of Dharma leads to permanent extinction of suffering which requires skills beyond social service.<span>  </span>In addition, the bodhisattva through the perfections of meditation and wisdom , through contemplative practice, also seek out lifestyle similar to that of one seeking arahantship.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">  In a nutshell, the lifestyles of the two are not very different.<span>  </span>True Buddhism needs all three: Buddhas, arahants and bodhisattvas.<span>  </span>It needs Buddhas to discover and teach the path to liberation; it needs arahants to follow the path and confirm that the Dharma does indeed lead to liberation, adorning the teaching with examples of those who lead the purest holy life; it needs bodhisattvas to bring forth the resolve to perfect those qualities that will enable them at some point in the future, near or distant, to become Buddhas themselves and once again turn the unsurpassed Wheel of the Dharma.</span></p>

              <p>i don't discriminate even sentient beings let alone arahats. :) the word "compassion and wisdom" can be quite general. there's a saying that there's no goal and Bodhisattva defer nirvana.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">if there's a goal, u will suffer too. </span></p>
              <p>yet yes i agree, all will lead to the same "goal" in the very end. i got other views...so won't comment too much.</p>

              <div id="post-body-790409250447202394" class="post-body entry-content">I thought I'd therefore share some further reflections on Gampopa's threefold classification of Compassion (from The Jewel Ornament of Liberation).<br><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gs04Y63Nob0/Rzl3XfbvIiI/AAAAAAAAACo/vBA_eDgV49Y/s1600-h/white_tara_sm.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132264495823921698" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gs04Y63Nob0/Rzl3XfbvIiI/AAAAAAAAACo/vBA_eDgV49Y/s320/white_tara_sm.jpg" border="0" alt="White Tara"></a>Gampopa's first category - 'Compassion with reference to Sentient beings' is simply the desire to help beings when we see that they are suffering. However, due to our level of understanding and practice, we ourselves suffer alongside those who wish to help. Our compassion, (but lack of wisdom and skillful means) leads us to pain, as we don't have sufficient understanding to help without causing ourselves pain. It's worth noting that this wouldn't be a reason for us to not help! It's still important as a means to develop further compassion and wisdom, and also to actually alleviate suffering, that we do reach out to others, even if that causes us pain :-)<br><br>The second form of Compassion that Gampopa notes is that of 'Compassion with reference to the Dharma'. Here we have a deepened level of understanding. As a result, we 'understand' something of the causes of suffering, due to our increased 'understanding' of Dharma. So, when we see suffering, and our desire to help arises, we know that this suffering arises from causes. We know the suffering arises from attachment, from craving and ill-will, and ultimately, from ignorance (of how things really are). We understand something of the Four Noble Truths, and we know something of causality - of Dependent Origination. As such, when compassion arises, and we seek to help others, we suffer less, as we are less inclined to attach, or to crave whilst helping.<br><br>For example, we don't get so caught up in results, in needing to 'solve' the others' problem. So we can help, to our utmost, but let go of results, let go of having to take things through to a solution. Sometimes it's not possible to solve the other persons problem (they might have an incurable illness, for example) and in this case, we can help to our utmost, without causing ourself suffering at not being able to control the outcome.<br><br>Another aspect here is that now that we've generated some understanding of how suffering comes about - its causes and conditions - we sense that those we see suffering do *not* know what is causing their suffering. We see that they live life only wishing to be happy, but that their very actions are the cause of their suffering. As such, that recognition of their situation is the cause for a much stronger compassion to develop.<br><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gs04Y63Nob0/SDlNwQHLWPI/AAAAAAAAADw/mOx4UYcK8rI/s1600-h/gampopa3.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5204276335757449458" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gs04Y63Nob0/SDlNwQHLWPI/AAAAAAAAADw/mOx4UYcK8rI/s320/gampopa3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The third form of Compassion Gampopa talks about is that of 'Compassion without Reference Point'. This is where we have developed sufficiently that we see something of the true nature of things. We have some experience of Shunyata, of Emptiness, and therefore we no longer cling to the notion of person, of illness, of helping as solidly existent 'things'. As a result of seeing the play of mere appearances in mind, we don't attach to these illusory notions, and therefore we don't suffer whilst helping alleviate suffering. We see this play of appearances, which are ultimately empty, but at the same time, we recognise that the 'person' before us does not see this. <br><br>We also see that the difference between seeing things as they are, and of grasping onto the solidity or reality of things, is, in a sense, razor thin. The difference is so slender between seeing, and not seeing. <br><br>When the experience of emptiness arises, we see that seeing how things are, and seeing with ignorance is the most subtle shift, in a sense, (and yet the most enormous shift, in another sense!!!!). We see how easy it is to lose this 'view', both during, and between meditations. We slip into it and out of it so easily. So, we have an appreciation of how small a shift it is, in a sense, and how 'easy' it could be for those suffering beings to see in accordance with the nature of things, to act in accordance with the nature of things, and therefore not suffer. That recognition of how 'easy' it would be for them to not suffer becomes the cause for a great compassion to arise in us. The recognition of how unnecessary that suffering is, indeed, how unnecessary and how easily thrown off.<br><br>Further, the recognition from the previous stage (and classification) that we ourselves self-cause our own suffering is deepened here - with the addition of now seeing the potential 'ease' of throwing it off. <br><br>At this stage, our compassion arises without having an object, as we no longer 'see' any being to be the object of our compassion. Indeed, we no longer see 'ourselves' as being compassionate, nor see the 'act' of compassion either. We see the play of empty appearances - and yet, and yet ... we act. How is this? How can we act, when we no longer see sentient beings, as such? Well, from my very limited experience, this Compassion is the natural response, the natural outpouring of the mind that sees things as they are. It's as if when we take all this mistaken understanding and seeing out of the way, what lay beneath - the sun behind the clouds - can pour forth its energy, which had been previously obscured and dammed up.<br><br>- an attempt to clarify in my own mind my own confusion, and previous potentially confusing post ... in the hope it might also be of help to others -<br><br>may we all give rise to the Compassion that has no reference point ...</div>

              <div id="post-body-8640908326243305280" class="post-body entry-content">In a sense, what distinguishes the three types of Compassion that Gampopa sets out in 'Jewel Ornament of Liberation' is the development and level of our Compassion *and* our Wisdom.<br><br><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Gs04Y63Nob0/RzgYE_bvIhI/AAAAAAAAACg/bB8C0jNJD00/s1600-h/gampopapp.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5131878249414992402" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Gs04Y63Nob0/RzgYE_bvIhI/AAAAAAAAACg/bB8C0jNJD00/s320/gampopapp.jpg" border="0" alt="Gampopa's classification of Compassion"></a>With the first, Compassion with reference to Sentient Beings, we see beings suffering, and we feel a response to that suffering which is our compassion. At this level, we tend to suffer ourselves with that response. We see them suffer and tend to get attached to taking that suffering away.<br><br>With Compassion with Dharma as objects, we again see other beings<br>suffering, but this time we no longer suffer ourselves as a result, even though we may not be able to directly relieve our suffering. We understand something of the nature of things, of dependent origination, of suffering, and the cause of suffering, and therefore can help in a less 'sticky' or attached fashion. We are less attached to our ignorant ideas of how things are, and less attached to 'making things right'. We are able to help more, and let go.<br><br>At the level of Compassion without Reference Point, we no longer see things as solid and permanent as we would ordinarily have done. As a result of our developing practice, we see that these beings we have before us are actually all manner of sizes, shapes, colours, smells, etc, arising in our minds. We see that we don't really know where these sensations arise from, nor where they go to. We see that we cannot place or grasp any of those sensations, let alone the 'person' that we assume we see before us. Life begins to take on something of the nature of a dream, rather than the seemingly self-existent solid drama that is somehow 'out there'.<br><br>As we begin to see the play of our minds, we become less attached to our ignorant views of what we believe to be actually existent.<br><br>As we ourselves begin to loosen the bonds of our suffering, through no longer grasping at our deluded understanding of appearances, we notice how those around us make the same mistakes as we have continually done. We see how they cause there own suffering, through believing in the permanence and solidity of the world, and wanting/not wanting all that passes through it.<br><br>As a result of our newly found tendency to let go of this grasping, and causing of our own suffering, we see how they too could let go of causing their own suffering. We see how easy it is, in a sense, to not cause suffering for themselves. Even though this ability has been very hard won for ourselves, and we know full well how easily we lose this ability, we also see how easy it is to not cause self-suffering. It's easy in the sense that in a moment, just one moment, we can either give rise to attachment, or we can just let go. It's just a choice in one moment.<br><br>So at one and the same time, we hold a lighter grasp on life, through not grasping at experience as though it was solid, real, and self-existing. And yet we clearly see the suffering of those before us, self-caused suffering, and the natural desire to help them arises.<br><br>We see no-one before us, just dreamlike mere appearances, yet we feel strongly compelled to help others to loosen the bonds of suffering, just as we've loosened them.<br><br>We we hold these two things, the ultimate and the relative, the view of the dreamlike nature of things, yet the compassionate desire to help dreamlike beings be free of their suffering, then we tend not to suffer ourselves through this compassion.<br><br>This is the sense in which I believe Gampopa sets out this classification of Compassion. When we fully believe in the fixed selfhood of ourselves and of others, then we suffer through our compassion. When we see things as they are, with a direct apprehension of appearance and emptiness, then we feel the strongest urges to help relieve that suffering, yet that doesn't become the cause of suffering for ourself.<br><br>In those moments, we simply do what needs to be done, without rigid conceptualisation, without attempting to force things, but just a simple outpouring of spontaneous action, with no thought of self or other.<br><br>Seeing phenomenon for what they are, we act with compassion, naturally, and most effectively.</div>
