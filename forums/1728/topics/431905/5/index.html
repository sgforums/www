              <p>Theravada and Mahayana are different ideals that a practitioner can undertake. you want me to elaborate a question like this, i would like to know what kind of expectations do you have on my answer? </p>
              <p>if i were to summarize in just one sentence it will be as follow:</p>
              <p>one who is more inclined in Theravada may seek to work on one's own liberation through meditation on the fetters. </p>
              <p>one who is more inclined in Mahayana may seek to work on liberation of all sentient beings while at the same time progress through realization of twofold emptiness, culminating in Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>on a sidenote, while more of the posts in this forum are more inclined to Mahayana ideal. It doesn't mean that the posters do not agree with Theravada teachings.</p>
              <p>The arguments on which is the Buddha's actual teachings fall apart in the face of an understanding of emptiness. The Dharma is just the Dharma, no point getting all worked up by the scenery.</p>
              <p>of cos this is just my twenty cents worth haha, if its wrong pls correct.</p>

              <p>And yes, there is only one historical Buddha. The Buddhas and the Purelands are derive from our primordial awareness, our innate Buddha nature.</p>
              <p>It is a form of skillful means from which I have benefited greatly. I have also benefited from the Theravada or Hinayana, which are just labesl for the convenience of reference. I do not think any less of them. </p>
              <p>Coming from my traditional Chinese background, I am exposed to Mahayana as an organised religion,assimilated with Taoism, Confuscian and polytheistic folk beliefs,  therefore easier accept and to get into.

              <p>Precisely. Nirvana is not a place - it is the cessation of suffering and delusion. If you are free from suffering and delusion, then wherever you are, you are free, otherwise you are not.</p>
              <p>"Right there and then" refers to "wherever you are".</p>

              We respect both Shakyamuni Buddha and the Second Buddha Guru Padmasambhva as the Buddha.
              
              May be you should find the " Million Name Buddha Sutra " and studied the names of all the Buddhas from the past, present and future.  Your mind will open and accept that there is more than one buddha.
