            <div class='col-md body'>Religions, it is often observed, are products of fear. This fear is in turn based on ignorance. With the dawn of wisdom and the ever-expanding horizons of knowledge, faith and confidence in religions begin to evaporate, like morning mist under the rising sun.<br><br>As William Macquitty puts it,<span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="color: red;">"With the advance of science and psychology many of the older faiths have suffered. Their beliefs went against the new knowledge and the new knowledge won." </span></span><br><br><strong><span class="large">Not so</span> </strong>with Buddhism. Buddhism is a result of the human quest for the ultimate truth, an aspiration for that which is the highest and noblest in life. It is based on the Buddha's wisdom, on his  enlightenment, attained through the complete eradication of ignorance, fear and all other defilements from his mind. His teachings, called the Dhamma (Sanskrit: Dharma), have stood the test of time for more than twenty-five centuries.<br><br>It is with deep faith and conviction in the Buddha's teachings that Francis Story, a British scholar, asserts:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="color: darkred;">"The doctrines of Buddha Dhamma stand today, as unaffected by the march of time and the expansion of knowledge as when they were first enunciated. No matter to what lengths increased scientific knowledge can extend man's mental horizon, within the framework of the Dhamma there is room for the acceptance and assimilation of further discovery." </span></span><br><br>One of the most outstanding features of Buddhism is its total independence of divine elements. It is <strong>a religion of self-help</strong>. According to Buddhism, human beings should learn to be <strong>self-reliant and to have faith in their own ability.</strong> Buddhist philosophy is anthropocentric in its outlook and practical implementation, <span class="large"><strong>placing man at the center of its metaphysical and ethical systems</strong>.</span> It is a religion that insists primarily on man's own effort and perseverance to achieve his goals, be they material or spiritual, rather than prayer or wishful thinking.<br><br>As Venerable Dr. H. Gunaratana points out, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Buddhism as a whole is <span style="color: darkred;">quite different from the theological religions</span> with which Westerners are most familiar. It is a <span style="color: darkred;">direct entrance to a spiritual or divine realm without addressing deities or other agents</span>. Its flavor is intensely clinical, much more akin to what we would call psychology than to what we would usually call religion. It is an <span style="color: darkred;">ever-ongoing investigation of reality, a microscopic examination of the very process of perception</span>. Its intention is to <span style="color: darkred;">pick apart the screen of lies and delusions through which we normally view the world, and thus to reveal the face of ultimate reality." </span></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Those who have studied Buddhism often claim, with some justification, that Buddhism <span style="color: darkred;">is scientific in nature</span>. It is certainly the most scientific of all religions. Its teachings are <span style="color: darkred;">logical</span> and its methods are <span style="color: darkred;">compatible with scientific methods</span>. That is why many modern scientists and thinkers believe that the teachings of the Buddha are still valid and practical in spite of their great age. The Dhamma is an ancient spiritual legacy that can benefit mankind as much today as it did more than twenty-five centuries ago.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Blind faith is anathema to Buddhism</span>, which clearly urges us to <span style="color: darkred;">think freely and not to accept things blindly</span>. In Buddhism, free thought is upheld, questions are welcome, and positive doubt is considered the first stepping stone to wisdom. Buddhism believes in human potential. It also asserts human equality, emphasizing personal and social responsibilities, based on the doctrine of kamma (Sanskrit: karma -- action and result).<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Kindness, compassion, and tolerance </span>are some of the virtues that Buddhism strongly encourages. This explains why Buddhists are generally peace-loving people and why religious war is unknown in the long history of Buddhism. Much of the suffering in the world today is a direct result of the lack of these qualities. Religions that should be serving to unite people and maintain harmony are instead being used to divide and alienate them from each other. The history of some religions is full of bloodshed and violence. Against this unfortunate background, Buddhism stands out as the most tolerant religion in the annals of human civilization.<span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="color: blue;">"Alone of all the great world religions," </span></span>observes Aldous Huxley, <span style="font-style: italic;">"<span style="color: blue;">Buddhism made its way without persecution, censorship or inquisition</span>." </span></div>
