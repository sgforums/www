              All you need is the aspiration to put others first and some inspiration from

              scriptures speak of inviting all sentient beings as our guests. When we invite
              a guest, we have a sense of the importance of that relationship. Guests are
              usually fed specially cooked food and receive extra hospitality. The life of a
              bodhisattva is relating with<span> </span><em>all</em><span> </span>sentient beings as guests. The
              bodhisattva invites everyone as a guest, constantly offering a feast<strong>.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Inviting all
              sentient beings as our guests is the starting point of applying compassion in
              the Mahayana. By viewing sentient beings as guests, the bodhisattva has a
              constant sense of the impermanence of the relationship, because eventually all
              guests leave. So we view the time with our guests as precious. There is a sense
              of the preciousness and the impermanence of the relationship. Our guest may be
              our husband, our wife, or our child—everybody is the guest of everybody,
              constantly. On a day to day level, all relationships for a bodhisattva are
              based on relating with guests.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #a0a0a0;'>Just as fish cannot live without water, compassion cannot develop
              without egolessness.</span></em></p>

              combination of<span> </span><em>maitri</em>, or loving-kindness, and
              generosity. It is a journey outward, a journey of communication. On one level,
              compassion is feeling friendly toward ourselves. On another level it is
              experiencing a sense of richness, that we can expand the warmth we feel toward
              ourselves to other sentient beings.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>It is said in the
              scriptures that just as fish cannot live without water, compassion cannot
              develop without egolessness and without the experience of emptiness, or<span> </span><em>shunyata</em>.
              It may seem that this view of compassion is somewhat abstract, but in fact it
              is the heart of the practice of meditation in action.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>The presence of
              compassion is experienced as a sudden glimpse, a sense of clarity and warmth
              simultaneously. According to the scriptures, that glimpse, if you analyze it,
              takes one-sixtieth of a second. It is so fast and so sharp. The sharpness is
              the intelligence of the compassion. Compassion also means being open and
              communicative. It contains warmth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>So, first there
              is<span> </span><em>maitri</em>, trusting in the heart.</span></p>

              a gap in which you experience the openness of<em>tathagatagarbha</em>,
              or buddhanature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Third, there is a
              sense of communication—having already woken up at that level, there is a sense
              of freedom to expand and to relate with your actions, whatever you are doing.
              That seems to be how to develop compassion.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>The path of compassion, says
              Judy Lief, starts with stepping out of your usual storyline. Here are five ways
              to do it.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>It is amazing how
              often we think we are out in the world interacting with and helping others,
              when actually we are simply acting out our preconceived internal storyline. Our
              vision is clouded and we can only take in what feeds into our plot line.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>One way to soften
              this pattern is by exploring some basic steps that can lead us in the direction
              of kindness. Instead of trying to will ourselves to be kind—presto!—we can
              create an atmosphere congenial to the development of loving-kindness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Here are five
              small steps to kindness you can practice. You can explore these steps
              singularly or in combination. The idea is that if you create the right
              atmosphere, compassion naturally arises. It is already present, just waiting
              for your invitation.</span></p>

              and a connection between the two. So the first step is to slow down and let
              your mind settle enough that you are able to drop from the heights of
              conceptuality back into your body, a simple form in space. Can you really feel
              present, in your body as it is, right where you are?</span></p>

              quality of space within you and around you. Pay attention to the boundaries of
              your physical body and the space in front, behind, and on each side of you.
              Also pay attention to the mental–emotional space that accommodates the comings
              and goings of sensations, thoughts, moods, and emotional upheavals. Whatever
              arises on an outer or inner level, notice the space in which both you and your

              accommodation, acceptance, and nonjudging. When you sense the arising of
              territoriality and fear, accommodate that too in greater spaciousness.</span></p>

              directing levels of harshness, demand, and judgment inward that they would
              never dream of directing toward another person, knowing the harm that would be
              incurred. They are willing to do to themselves what they would not do to
              others.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'></span></p>

If

              very difficult to take care of another person. In the Buddhist teaching, it’s

              the now. We may lack the capacity to realize that happiness is possible in the
              here and now, that we already have enough conditions to be happy right now. To
              go home to the present moment, to take care of oneself, to get in touch with
              the wonders of life that are really available—that is already love. Love is to

              non-self, you see that the object of your love is always there and the love
              continues to grow. Nothing is lost and you don’t regret anything, because if
              you have true love in you, then you and your true love are going in the same

              must have a broad focus, including not only ourselves and those close to us but
              all sentient beings. All beings want to be happy and free of suffering, yet
              most sentient beings experience only suffering and cannot obtain happiness.
              Just as we have a desire to clear away the suffering in our own experience and
              to enjoy happiness, we come to see through meditating on compassion that all
              other beings have this desire as well.</span></p>

              we must bring our meditation on compassion to the deepest level possible. We
              must reflect on the intense suffering of sentient beings in all six realms of
              samsara. Reflecting on our connection to these beings, we must engender a
              compassion that cannot bear their suffering any longer.</span></p>

              unbearable compassion is extremely important. Without it, we might feel a
              compassionate sensation in our minds from time to time, but this will not bring
              forth the full power of compassion. But when we witness with unbearable
              compassion the suffering of sentient beings, we immediately seek out ways to
              free them from that suffering. We are unfazed by complications and doubts; our
              actions for the benefit of others are effortless and free from doubt.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'></span></p>

              compassion strong, we need the path. We already have compassion, wisdom, and
              many other positive qualities, yet our mental afflictions are stronger than
              these most of the time. It is as if the afflictions have locked all of our

              damaging impact of abuse in many of our childhoods helps us cultivate the mind
              of love. Abuse is always about lovelessness, and if we grow into our adult
              years without knowing how to love, how then can we create social movements that

              knowledge, responsibility, respect, and trust, we can then be guided by this
              understanding. We can use these skillful means as a map in our daily life to

              are necessarily working to end domination. This movement is what most people
              fear. If we are to galvanize the collective longing for spiritual well-being
              that is found in the practice of love, we must be more willing to identify the

              <p>Is correct. Loving kindness is a nature and normalcy. When a mother feed a baby is out of loving without condition. Compassion is a nature of all and uncondition as well, it needs fearlessly stable serene when executing it. And when this nature is consistently performed in daily works and routine without expecting kind mannerism in returns from the other party, it is bodhisattva.
