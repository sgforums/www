If you practise Buddhism, you will eventually reach this realisation from direct intuitive experience, you will see for yourself that there is no self separate self to be found, and then you attain enlightenment. This is not a theory, and there are many people today including many in this forum who have become enlightened to the reality of no self... and we all can.<br><br>Consciousness or self is not an agent, or entity that lives in our body, nor is it a permanent entity that moves from one lifetime to the next like some Hindus or other religions think. It is only a momentary self that is reborn -- Self1, Self2, Self3, not a permanent 'soul'. Rebirth happens not only lifetime to lifetime, but every moment in our lives as long as we have not attained enlightenment.<br><br>BUT, conventionally, in terms of relative truths, we still speak of 'you and me', 'him or her', we still recognise people by their appearance. In terms of relative truths for example, I met you 5 years ago, but now I saw you again and I know that you are monkeywarrior -- I know you are the same person, because I recognise your looks. This is relative truths, concepts, perceptions, names.<br><br>But in terms of ultimate reality there is no 'monkeywarrior' that is the same person for 5 years... it's like asking are you the same person since you were a baby? Actually there is really no permanent self, only a momentary Self1, Self2, Self3, so you are neither the same you nor different -- because a 'self' with inherent existence cannot be found in the first place. It is empty.<br><br>Back to rebirth. So since 'No Self' is about ultimate reality, it does not mean that there is 'No Self' therefore our consciousness cannot continue after death. It continues but not as a fixed entity -- just like Self1, Self2, Self3, etc. There is no inherently existing self, but a momentary self that is utterly empty. It does not mean just because there is no self to be found, a person cannot fall into the ghost realm.<br><br>When we die, our consciousness undergoes stages of <span style="font-style: italic;">bardo</span>, which is an intermediate state of existence between death and rebirth. Bardo can last up to 49 days. There are exceptions of those who do not stay in bardo for long -- for example, those with very good karma may ascend to celestial realms/heaven almost immediately after death, while those with very bad karma may descend to the hell realms almost immediately after death. Those whose conditions are there and chants Amitabha, and sincerely wish to be reborn in Pure Land, Amitabha can bring them to his Pure Land, also almost immediately. And then there are those who at the time of death, his consciousness dissolves into the infinite Clear Light of our Buddha Nature, and attains Nirvana, a state of liberation from Samsara. This is truly possible if we practise the Dharma well, so we must all start practising until we can overcome rebirth at death. Such a person no longer needs to be reborn in the 6 realms, but when the condition arises (i.e compassion; bodhisattva vows) he takes birth in the 6 realms to lead sentient beings to enlightenment as a Bodhisattva. Such a person is not reborn due to the power of Karma, but due to the power of Vows, and he will appear in the world not as an ordinary unenlightened sentient being but as a Bodhisattva.<br><br>But let's talk about the case of most people. For most people, the dead person's consciousness eventually leaves the body and takes form of an Antarabhava, or Zhong Ying Sheng, which is an intermediate body. You can call this 'soul' or whatever you like, no problem, but you must understand that this 'soul' is also empty in the ultimate sense -- but relatively speaking we can say that there is an intermediate body, just as relatively speaking we can say that we have a physical self/body right now.<br><br>Within this 49 days, the Antarabhava seeks for conditions for rebirth. It happens that every 7 days there will be a light that appears to the consciousness and serves as an opportunity for rebirth, those whose karma syncs will be reborn to the various 6 realms of existence according to their karma. During this period, there are many people who report visions of their dead relatives coming to their dreams. This is a very common phenomena. During the 49 days we should also invite venerables to speak the dharma, about the teachings of impermanence, suffering and emptiness to the antarabhava so that he can quickly let go of the life he passed away from (things such as his family, belongings, etc etc), be reborn quickly and not dwell longer.<br><br>There are those who after 49 days fail to take rebirth, mainly due to their attachment. Like they are very attached to their wife, or to anything. Then they will turn into a ghost after 49 days because all opportunites for rebirth are gone. Even if they do not have bad karma, they have to dwell in the ghost realm for some period of time in a state of misery though they probably dont have to go through the torment of those ghosts who fall into that realm due to bad karma. They'll be those 'wandering ghosts' who dwell in the place of his attachment. If your loved ones keep appearing to you after 49 days, then the likelihood is that he has become too attached and turned into a ghost. In such cases you should ask a venerable for advise, the ghost should be told to let go of their attachment, and merits should be dedicated so that he can be reborn in the 3 higher realms as quickly as possible and not dwell any longer.<br><br>Next, Asuras and Ghost realm are different. Asuras belong to one of the 3 realms. They also have good karma... but they like to fight and are violent.. so those devas/celestial beings that love to fight eventually descend into the Asuras realm.<br><br>Ghost is a different realm... there are many evil ghosts (and also good ones) but they are not the same as asuras.</div>

This current produces additional six currents and together they are called the seven common currents, These seven common currents in turn produce 6 supplement currents. All these 13 currents together produce the 17 reflective waves or thought moments, These reflective waves, being influenced by consciousness derived from the sense organs produced the 14 defilements and 25 purities.

For most people, the dead person's consciousness eventually leaves the body and takes form of an Antarabhava, or Zhong Ying Sheng, which is an intermediate body. You can call this 'soul' or whatever you like, no problem, but you must understand that this 'soul' is also empty in the ultimate sense -- but relatively speaking we can say that there is an intermediate body, just as relatively speaking we can say that we have a physical self/body right now.</div></blockquote>This antarabhava is also the functioning of our 7th consciousness, the consciousness of an individual, separate self. It is also responsible for dreaming while we are asleep.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...All of us have a Â“transient-invisible-body (Antara-bhava)Â”. While we are alive this is called Â“mind-consciousnessÂ”. It is commonly referred to as the Â“soulÂ”. When we are asleep, this mind-consciousness does not sleep. Instead, it combs through the past records that are stored in the eighth mind-consciousness (All of us have eight consciousness. In addition to the six sense-consciousness, namely, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind, there are the seventh [Klista-mano-vijnana] and eighth [Alaya-vijnana] mind-consciousness. The eighth consciousness is the planting field of the mind. The seeds of all our encounters, both virtuous and evil, of our aeons of many past lives are planted here. The seventh mind-consciousness gives rise to the Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ”.) When a person is dead, his six sense-organs, namely, the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind stop functioning. His sense of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch and perception also cease to function. Thereafter, the seventh mind-consciousness no longer resides in the body. It leaves the body and begins to search for the right conditions for rebirth to the next life. (At this stage, the mind-consciousness is called a Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ”. It is an intermediate existence between death and rebirth to the next life.) The right conditions of rebirth are found within a period of 49 days, on each of the seven cycles of the seventh day after the person has passed away ( i.e. 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, Â… 49th day)...</span></div>
