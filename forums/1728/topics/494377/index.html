              a Buddhist teaching</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">July 19, 2017 Justin
              Whitaker Patheos</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              early Buddhists texts contain a treasure trove of teachings. I have not read
              them all, and perhaps never will. For they are like a great set of tools, to be
              used as needed. One can touch or handle all of them but understand the depths
              or purpose of none. The Buddha famously gave teachings specific to the hearer,
              suggesting that at least some of the teachings should not be taken as universal
              in their application.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is better, in my experience, to rely on wise teachers to pull out those
              necessary for the student and guide them on their practical utility. And, over
              time, the student begins to be able to do this on their own and perhaps even
              becomes a teacher in turn. Yet, we might aspire to read them all and apply them
              in our lives, here and there, bit by bit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sariputta</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              it is with this sense of aspiration that I turn to Sariputta’s teaching on the
              death of the teacher (in his case the Buddha). Sariputta was one of the
              foremost of the Buddha’s disciples, the monk foremost in wisdom; a sort of
              philosopher patron-saint of early Buddhism. As Nyanaponika Thera notes,
              Sariputta was a:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dhamma-senapati, Marshal
              of the Dhamma … a man unique in his patience and steadfastness, modest and
              upright in thought, word and deed, a man to whom one act of kindness was a
              thing to be remembered with gratitude so long as life endured. Even among the
              Arahats, saints freed from all defilements of passion and delusion, he shone
              like the full moon in a starry sky.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              one discourse, Sariputta calls for fellow disciples and tells them of a thought
              which arose to him while deep in meditation:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> ‘Is
              there anything in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise
              within me sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair?’ Then the thought
              occurred to me: ‘There is nothing in the world with whose change or alteration
              there would arise within me sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp;
              despair.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">No
              change of anything whatsoever could cause him distress and despair. Equanimity,
              renunciation, imperturbability: these are virtues of the early Buddhist
              world. These are aspects of Buddhist ethics, Buddhist attitudes and behaviors
              to be understood and taken on as one’s own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              we hear this claim it is natural to ask ourselves if we could say the same. The
              answer “no” will probably come pretty quickly up to us. I lament – a bit at
              least – every time my fruit goes bad before I can eat it. If something so
              seemingly minor can cause stress, how much so countless larger things.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              we can see the virtue in not clinging to circumstances here, and many Buddhist
              teachings warn of the suffering arising from this disposition. Thus, teachings
              like this, often short and often seemingly pointless, can have profound impact
              upon us if understood correctly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ananda</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              discourse goes on from there with the Buddha’s cousin and attendant, Ananda,
              pressing Sariputta on the point. Ananda, it should be noted, did not gain
              awakening in the Buddha’s lifetime and is said to have wept upon learning
              of the impending death of the Buddha. Ananda asked:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Sariputta
              my friend, even if there were change &amp; alteration in the Teacher would
              there arise within you no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Could
              Sariputta hold it together even with the death of the Buddha? In the West,
              there is a sort of long-standing mentality of accepting feelings like pain,
              distress, and despair. We even sometimes exalt them. The ethos, found again and
              again in the early texts however, plays them down at the least and points to a
              complete elimination of them as a goal. Here we find Sariputta responding:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              if there were change &amp; alteration in the Teacher, my friend, there would
              arise within me no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair. Still, I
              would have this thought: ‘What a great being, of great might, of great prowess,
              has disappeared! For if the Blessed One were to remain for a long time, that
              would be for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out
              of sympathy for the world; for the welfare, benefit, &amp; happiness of human
              &amp; divine beings.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              with the loss of the teacher: no sorrow, etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But,
              nonetheless he would recognize the loss, he would acknowledge it. He would see
              that someone precious for their ability to remove suffering and bring happiness
              to many beings is gone.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              sutta concludes with Ananda remarking that:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Surely
              it’s because Ven. Sariputta’s I-making &amp; mine-making and obsessions with
              conceit have long been well uprooted that even if there were change &amp;
              alteration in the Teacher, there would arise within him no sorrow, lamentation,
              pain, distress, or despair.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              points to the last fetter of one who is on the road to awakening – the repeated
              “I-me-mine” tendency in the mind. This is the last fetter because it is so
              subtle, so deeply ingrained in us. And it is also that which can turn us away
              from concern for others and instead toward self-directed feelings.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is worth chewing on this, at the least, as one goes through one’s day, noticing
              the arisings of change that give rise to sorrow, distress, and so on. And
              noticing, too, what narratives are attached to those feelings.</span></p>
