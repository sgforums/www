            <div class='col-md body'>Since we are on this topic of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, I have heard it said once too many times (including members of the monastic) that it is not wise (even wrong) to worship a statue of Ksitigarbha in a home.<br><br>This being so because it is argued that since he liberates sentient beings from the hell regions, all hellish or ghostly beings will enter your home for refuge. Their presence thus will have evil influences in your lives.<br><br>I have never subscribed to this view, and hope this can be cleared up from knowledgeable members of E-Sangha.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>That is not true at all! Any statue or image of Ksitigarbha is wonderful. Infact, I have an image of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva in my altar. Any teaching of Lord Shakyamuni should be highly regarded, and should not be thought of as dangerous. Especially, with Ksitigarbha's great compassion, do you think if you were to venerate him, he would let demons and ghosts harm you? I don't think so. Dharma Master Heng Lyu, current abbot of City of ten thousand Buddha's did a lecture on the Ksitigarbha sutra, and he did mention that some people have superstitious belief that this sutra can bring evil into our homes, but he clarified that as being slanderous, and very untrue. Infact, bringing Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva into our home, will bring great blessings and merit, if you are to recite the Ksitigarbha sutra, you will purify much karma.<br><br>Hope that helped<br><br>Nam Mo Dia Tang Vuong Bo Tat! _/\_<br></div>

According to yet another opinion, ghosts and poltergeists are "recordings."<strong> When there is a powerful emotion,</strong> sometimes at death and sometimes not, a recording is believed to be "embedded" in a place or, somehow, in the "fabric of time" itself. This recording will continue to play over and over again until the energy embedded disperses.<br><br><span style="color: red;">However some poltergeists have had the ability to articulate themselves and to have distinct personalities, which suggests some sort of self-awareness and intent. Practitioners of astral projection have reported the existence of unfriendly astral life forms, which Robert Bruce called "negs" (whom we might also identify with elementals). If they exist, these may well have the ability to affect the physical world.[citation needed]</span><br><br></div>
