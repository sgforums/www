            <div class='col-md body'>Just for sharing<br><br>I have also experienced the obstacles in learning and practising the dharma. While in the process of overcoming these obstacles, one can still learn and practise the dharma.<br><br>For example, i was sharing a cab with my friend to attend a chanting ceremony in a temple at 7pm. We were worrying that we would be late so we took a cab down but then there was a traffic jam. My friend was anxious and disappointed, she had told me that whenever she attended such buddhist ceremony, she will face some obstacles.<br><br>From another perspective, one can learn to deal with this sort of crisis with a calm and peaceful mind by practising mindfulness. We can practise to be mindful of our mental state; learning to overcome habit of agitation, worrying ,grasping and other unwholesome mind state. We are already practising the dharma now.<br><br>Wisdom is required to distinguish: If there is something we can do about it, we do but if there is really nothing we can do about it, then we should learn to accept that. Even when we can't have what we want, it's okay. No need to be grossly upset over it and try to make the best out of it.<br><br>Back to my story, It ended up that we had made a blunder. The ceremony was actually at 7.30pm and not at 7pm! Hahaha.. Even if we are really late, there is really nothing we can do. It might be just bad karma but my point is we can still take the initiative to practise dharma at every moment, even now, be mindful while u type or reading tis.<br><br>so if you think you don't have the affinity with venerables, patiently acquiring the affinity then. If you think you do not have the merits, patiently accumulating the merits. It is already a blessing that you get to know buddhism in this lifetime.<br><br>Sharing dharma is also a form of practising dharma. Of course u have to be mindful of what dharma and how and whom you are sharing to.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

'main' teacher is Old Master Chin Kung, though i also listen to other masters.<br><br>how did i get to know Buddhism? well, ever heard of the the story of Elders Shariputra, Mahamaudgalyayana? they start from cults(wai dao) before discovering Buddha's Dharma. from young , i was interested in fengshui, i-ching, astology, etcs. at that time, my house prayed to Guan Yin Pusa. later don't know why i believed in a 'cult' of Raelism.<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raelism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raelism</a><br><br><blockquote>The message dictated to Rael during his encounter with the Elohim states that the Elohim contacted about forty people to act as their prophets on Earth, among which are those who founded the world's major religions (Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, etc.)</blockquote>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>then a Christian friend brought me to think that they are satan's idea. he said about eternal hell, satan collecting souls etcs. then i went into studing of Bible, God,  Revelations and all sorts of End of the World stories..etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>but, i was not satisfy with the ideas. then i went into Tao De Jing, ch'an and later move on into Buddhism(basic hinayana knowledge). from then i find that Buddhism is more complete and satisfing. i listened to commentries by Master Chin Kung and other masters and move into mahayanism, before i stay put in Pureland School as the main specialization. but all and all, i follow Buddha's dharma as One Vehicle/Complete Teaching(Yuan Jiao) without discriminations of sects.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>ps: born with Guan Yin, ended still with Guan Yin's helped. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>/\<br></div>

I too find Pali texts (the Pali texts are found in Mahayana canon as well as Agamas) direct and applicable.<br><br>Mahayana texts are also very direct and applicable, if you are interested you may want to read more about them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> -- perhaps Lankavatara Sutra, Diamond Sutra, and some other Sutras would be a good read.. I find that there are nothing contradictory between Theravada and Mahayana texts -- Mahayana texts can be a valuable addition to a practitioner of Theravada. Likewise Mahayana practitioners should also read the Nikayas (i.e Agamas) as they also contain very important instructions.<br><br>You said, <span style="font-style: italic;">"I find the translated (English) text on taking the vows "very elaborate and strict and sometime pretty extreme".</span><br><br>Can you tell us exactly which vow did you find extreme?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Anyone who mis-interprate the sutra may miss the spirit and followed them by the book thus missing the essence of the teaching. thus i find them not suited to me.</span><br><br>I agree with your first sentence, and that is partly why Mahayana came about, it emphasizes more on the Spirit/essence of the Buddha's teachings.

That's very good zaxis. Chanting is also a very good way to cultivate. Do you study Sutras? Some Sutras are quite interesting, such as the Surangama Sutra, Sutra of the Wise and the Foolish and Earth Store Bodhisattva's Vows. Do feel free to ask us if you have any problem!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cherrio</div>

If you have an affinity with Buddhism, you will surely encounter it. It will look for you. I believe you have an affinity with Buddhism since you are able to wander in here, which is not by chance and you are born in a Buddhist family. The question is just how strong your affinity is.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But the important thing is, do more good deeds.
