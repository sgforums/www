I am very fortunate to be able to take refuge at the age of 2 or 3 (in fact I cannot recall my refuge ceremony as I was too young then). I was a late learner then and while usually most others are able to talk fluently in sentences by that age, I could only speak in broken words.. my master (ven shen kai) smiled when he saw me, just touched my head as blessing and then from that day on I could talk in fluent sentences <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> That was I think 1992 or 1993, and unfortunately was the last time I met him.<br><br>But I didn't get to really know Buddhism until a few years ago about 12 years old I become more interested in the teachings... that's about it, I have little experience as a Buddhist and I am not very knowledgeable as well so if anything I have said in this forum is inadequte or wrong or whatsoever do correct me.<br><br>My Buddhist Master received the Zen (Lin Ji/Rinzai) lineage, he got two teachers, one is a Pure Land master which he learnt while in China, later he moved to Taiwan and learnt from a Zen master. At first he taught Pure Land Buddhism but he started to teach 'Ren Cheng Buddhism' to the west due to the conditions and needs, initially not under any sect name (Buddhism in the beginning did not separate into different sects as well), but later due to people's requests and so on, he gave it a name, "Wei Fo Zhong" or "Buddha-only Sect". As you can see the name is quite general, but points to the highest, ultimate goal that a Buddhist should aim to attain..<br><br>See:<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/jencbuddhism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/jencbuddhism.htm</a><br><br>Although the Five Vehicles of Buddhism are means through which one attains Buddhahood, they were expediently taught by Sakyamuni Buddha according to the capabilities of the sentient beings. In reality there is only one vehicle that leads to Buddhahood as is stated in the Lotus Sutra, "In the domain of the Buddhas of the ten directions, there is only One Vehicle of Buddha-dharma, not two nor three, for the rest were taught expediently by the Buddha."<br><br>The world that we live in is centred around human beings. We are human beings and so are the practitioners of the other vehicles of Buddhism. The Bodhisattvas are also human beings. Sakyamuni Buddha became Buddha by cultivating as a human being. Not only did Sakyamuni Buddha attained Buddhahood as a human being, so did the previous four Buddhas of this earth. Maitreya Bodhisattva, the Buddha to be, and the remaining nine hundred and ninety-five Buddhas will also<br><br>become Buddhas by cultivating as human beings. Thus, Jen Chen Buddhism or the Humanity Vehicle Buddhism, is that vehicle that leads humanity to the Supreme Enlightenment.<br><br>Jen Chen Buddhism pays homage to its founder, Sakyamuni Buddha, and practises the deeds of all the Bodhisattvas. It promotes the teachings of Sakyamuni Buddha and emphasises the purity of our thoughts, speech and actions as the fundamental of cultivation. The corner stones of Jen Chen Buddhism are to observe the Five Precepts, the Ten Virtuous Deeds, the Noble Eight-fold Path, and to conduct our lives with dignity and morality so that we may be reborn in the human realm to advance our cultivation, life after life. It is only in the human realm that we have any hope of becoming enlightened.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/venmast.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/venmast.htm</a><br><br>Venerable Shen-Kai was born in the year 1918 in Kui-Zhou, China. In his early years he studied many religions, but he was so inspired by what the Buddha taught that he decided to promote Buddhism and became ordained as a Buddhist monk.<br><br>Venerable Shen-Kai perceived that many people had difficulty understanding the BuddhaÂ’s teachings because they were often treated with mystery and complexity. As a result, they are apprehensive about it. Buddhism became neglected on one hand, or treated as a subject of academic research on the other. The general public could not attain the maximum benefit that Buddhism has to offer. In view of the situation, Venerable Shen-Kai felt that there is an urgent need to correct this misconception by presenting the BuddhaÂ’s teaching in a way that is easily acceptable to the people. Since the Supreme Enlightenment or Buddhahood is attained by cultivating from the human realm, Venerable Shen-Kai emphasises that as human beings we need to embark on the Vehicle of Buddhism that is most suited for human beings if we are to be realistic about being enlightened ourselves. That vehicle is the Humanity Vehicle Buddhism. Thus, he founded World Jen Chen Buddhism.<br><br>The Venerable vows to return to this world life after life to promote Jen Chen Buddhism so that we can purify our mind, and create a bright and blissful life. In his effort to uphold the morality and dignity of humanity, he travelled widely to deliver Dharma talks in many countries He illustrates that the principles of Jen Chen Buddhism are compatible with the natural capacities of humanity and also fulfill the needs of the modern times. Through these efforts, the Venerable hopes that we all can benefit from the teachings, unfold our wisdom and follow the practices of all Bodhisattvas until we become Buddha ourselves.<br><br>As the teacher of World Jen Chen Buddhism, Venerable Shen Kai, encourages one and all to seek enlightenment, and to work in unison to guide every human being to emulate the Bodhisattvas, to be Bodhisattvas themselves, and to promote the Bodhisattva-Humanity Vehicle Buddhism to all sentient beings life after life.<br><br>Venerable Shen-Kai departed from this world on August 4, 1996 in California, USA. He left a legacy of books and publications on the teachings of Jen Chen Buddhism for humanity, dozens of Jen Chen Buddhism promotion missions and many disciples, both members of the Sangha and lay-Buddhists to continue to promote a Bliss Culture for humanity around the world.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i do encounter certain tradition and teachings that suit my capacity and learning level but there isn't one which ultimately finalize my choice. I'm still a newbie just started to properly learn about buddhism a year ago. before that were just hear say and at times got impressed by the "chimalogy" of some phrases from the buddhist teaching my friends shared with me. now when i have the ripen affinity to embrace buddhism, i feel that there are many ways to go about that actually ultimately leads to one same point and that is liberation. but i still wouldn't say its a "point" or destination all practioners aim to achieve because there is really no where that we are actually going to look for ultimately and that's why it is also a goal towards liberation from sufferings. i do follow closely to some tradition of cos (mahayana, zen, dzogchen especially) and its also like when you walk down the street, you'll also get to see many different kinds of people and things that make up the complete fullness of living life. i get the chance to learn but i don't settle down on anything. i always maintain an open mind when teachings from any tradition is transmitted. i'm different from some of you who has a "home" or a "raft" to take on but i am the same with you all in one tradition towards enlightenment.</div>

I find the cultivators of Hinayana to be more strict in terms of their conducts and practises in Dharma.<br><br>Eventhough I had been practising for 3 years plus, I know I am lacking in merits to further my studies in the Dharma. Lacking in a sense where sometimes I would not understand anything from 1 single page of The Threefold Lotus Sutra or the Surangama Sutra. Now I just want to earn more merit and pray so I could just understand alittle more as I just know so little.<br><br>Cherrio</div>
