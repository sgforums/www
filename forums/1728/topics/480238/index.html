Unless one forks up more cash out front, it has become near impossible for people who wish to learn Buddhism and hear the dharma without relating to monetary sponsorship.<br><br>Recently, even to learn the Heart Sutra and Buddhist teachings, the temple charges a fee for all who wants to hear the dharma.<br><br>I can agree if skill courses that the temple organises such as vegetarian cooking , flower arrangements , taichi, yoga ...all these activities related to well being and skills can be charged to cover costs.<br><br>However, charging fees for the learning of Buddha Dharma and participation in puja have restricted these activities to the rich and wealthy.<br><br>What has become of a leading Asia monastery, behaving like a multinational profiteering organisation, where marshalls for events are outsourced to contractors, paying them salaries etc.<br><br>On the issue of human resource, the temple has more than 200 salaried staff, whereas the temple is only active on certain days for special events.<br><br>I am deeply concerned over this recent commercialisation, and worry that other leading temples may follow suit.<br><br>Could Buddhist Channel TV, have a discussion and thoughts on these developments?</span></p>

I believe this practice of charging participants for attending dharma classes have being going on for years now. </span></span></p>

If it is these groups using Bright Hill premises that are levying a charge to cover their cost for conducting activities there; then it would be best that Bright Hill Temple comes out to clarify the whole issue instead of allowing this kind of misunderstanding to develop giving a bad impression for the temple and Buddhism as a whole. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

We were told that we needed to pay to enter the shrines. Paid members get special passes, by class categories before admission.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Why the exhorbitant charges to enter the Inner Shrine if one wants to earnestly join the Puja? What is this rationale?<br><br>Did Amitahba and Other Buddhas of the past, Boddhisattvas, charge a fee to listen to the DharmaorattendmorningPuja's?<br><br>If someone do not have money, can she join in the Puja? Or will she be turned away? Clearly the temple do not know much about a Jataka story where a devotee cut her hair so that she could buy oil to light a lamp. It was her oil lamp that burnt the brightest. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Practice from the heart that costs nothing. Taking advantage of wealthy Singaporeans, I suppose, is the only rationale for such charges.<br><br>And why the need to define "Inner Shrine"? I do no know much about Mahayana Buddhism, but can any reader enlightment us, on these charges for Pujas? May be the Abbot have a clear answer for these?<br><br>How much are being charged to enter the Inner Shrines? We hear that its from as low as $ 1,000 per person, up to as much as hundreds of thousands. And what about the status of category for Dharma chanting listed by color codes? Are they indicator of how much a person has paid?<br><br>So if my family of 8 (wife, 2 kids and my 2 parents ) were to join the such pujas at $1000 per person, I would have to fork out $ 8000 minimum to join such puja. If this is not commercialisation, then may we ask what is?<br><br>Did Buddha teaches based on "Class of Category" in offering of Pujas? Buddha taught us give give up everything, be selfless. How ironic.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Also with the increased entry fees to join PUJAs, there are limits to entry pass was reduced by half to such prayer events ?<br><br>Can the KONG MEN SANG Monastery show a record history of how fees are charged by number of times over the past years and also restricting devotees allocation to puja?<br><br>In addition, the monastery also produces various quality Dharma publications that are distributed freely to members of the public to read and learn more about the Dharma. Many of these, we understand, are often paid via donations of devotees, inviting devotees.<br><br>It is also open secret the monks in monastery in ther annual alms day are given the best as offering, for examples robes costing more that $ 120 and give Tee shirts costing like $ 20 or more each, totalling each few hundreds.<br><br>Why are such necesscities becoming a branded items an issue in alms giving? Giving the novice monks the bests in brands, branded bands, branded clothing, and branded food stuff? <br><br>Are we leading them in the wrong directions or worldly materialisation and greeds? </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Didn't Buddha teach us to dress in robes, made from dye of tree barks, and accept non-monetary alms?<br><br>Even engaging services of private companies for traffic directions of festivals? Certainly this can do good with volunteers right?<br><br>Other Singapore Buddhists organisations garner 2,000 to 100,000 participants open fully to public at Singapore Expo, without a single cent to participate too. Bring your heart and mind is all it takes.<br><br>We may laugh at Christians churches scamming and skimming from their church members, but unfortunately so is Buddhism in Singapore.</span></span></p>

She said at least the bible indicate 10% of tithes are to be given back to Church.<br><br>Monkey see monkey do.

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Based on their reply, it is admitted that
                      these Dharma based activities are not free.<br> <br> Few years ago, many of my friends and myself were turned away at
                      the temple when we attempted to attend this Puja. We were told that
                      we needed to pay to enter the shrines. Paid members get special
                      passes, by class categories before admission.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Why the exhorbitant charges to enter the
                      Inner Shrine if one wants to earnestly join the Puja? What is this
                      rationale?<br> <br> Did Amitahba and Other Buddhas of the past, Boddhisattvas, charge a
                      fee to listen to the DharmaorattendmorningPuja's?<br> <br> If someone do not have money, can she join in the Puja? Or will she
                      be turned away? Clearly the temple do not know much about a Jataka
                      story where a devotee cut her hair so that she could buy oil to
                      light a lamp. It was her oil lamp that burnt the
                      brightest.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Practice from the heart that costs nothing.
                      Taking advantage of wealthy Singaporeans, I suppose, is the only
                      rationale for such charges.<br> <br> And why the need to define "Inner Shrine"? I do no know much about
                      Mahayana Buddhism, but can any reader enlightment us, on these
                      charges for Pujas? May be the Abbot have a clear answer for
                      these?<br> <br> How much are being charged to enter the Inner Shrines? We hear that
                      its from as low as $ 1,000 per person, up to as much as hundreds of
                      thousands. And what about the status of category for Dharma
                      chanting listed by color codes? Are they indicator of how much a
                      person has paid?<br> <br> So if my family of 8 (wife, 2 kids and my 2 parents ) were to join
                      the such pujas at $1000 per person, I would have to fork out $ 8000
                      minimum to join such puja. If this is not commercialisation, then
                      may we ask what is?<br> <br> Did Buddha teaches based on "Class of Category" in offering of
                      Pujas? Buddha taught us give give up everything, be selfless. How
                      ironic.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Also with the increased entry fees to join
                      PUJAs, there are limits to entry pass was reduced by half to such
                      prayer events ?<br> <br> Can the KONG MEN SANG Monastery show a record history of how fees
                      are charged by number of times over the past years and also
                      restricting devotees allocation to puja?<br> <br> In addition, the monastery also produces various quality Dharma
                      publications that are distributed freely to members of the public
                      to read and learn more about the Dharma. Many of these, we
                      understand, are often paid via donations of devotees, inviting
                      devotees.<br> <br> It is also open secret the monks in monastery in ther annual alms
                      day are given the best as offering, for examples robes costing more
                      that $ 120 and give Tee shirts costing like $ 20 or more each,
                      totalling each few hundreds.<br> <br> Why are such necesscities becoming a branded items an issue in alms
                      giving? Giving the novice monks the bests in brands, branded bands,
                      branded clothing, and branded food stuff?<br> <br> Are we leading them in the wrong directions or worldly
                      materialisation and greeds?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Didn't Buddha teach us to dress in robes,
                      made from dye of tree barks, and accept non-monetary alms?<br> <br> Even engaging services of private companies for traffic directions
                      of festivals? Certainly this can do good with volunteers
                      right?<br> <br> Other Singapore Buddhists organisations garner 2,000 to 100,000
                      participants open fully to public at Singapore Expo, without a
                      single cent to participate too. Bring your heart and mind is all it
                      takes.<br> <br> We may laugh at Christians churches scamming and skimming from
                      their church members, but unfortunately so is Buddhism in
                      Singapore.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">My wife is a christian, and always I have
                      tried to invite her to Buddhist temples and often we debate over
                      such commercialisation of both Churches and Temples. She said at
                      least the bible indicate 10% of tithes are to be given back to
                      Church.<br> <br> Monkey see monkey do. No wonder many temples are equating money

              <p>I think the puja in question is the "Grand Prayer that Blesses and Benefits all Sentient Beings", or "æ°´é™†æ³•ä¼š“ in Chinese (literally means Puja of Land and Water). Its tradition dates back to Liang dynasty, when it was commissioned by Emperor Liang"</p>

              <p>The puja is a very large scale one. The whole ceremony lasts 7 days and 7 nights of chanting of various important texts, and is divided into 7 altars or shrines. There is an inner shrine and 6 outer shrines, and they require 59 Bhikkus to lead the chanting in all 7 shrines. Other helpers are needed to help out with reception, cooking, admin, etc, and close to 100 people in total are required to organize such a large scale puja. Furthermore for the puja, for all 7 shrines, there needs to be many offerings such as oil lamps, flowers, fruits, vegetarian food, etc, and need to be replenished everyday for 7 days.</p>
              <p>The cost of organizing such a grand puja is huge, considering the costs of tentage, the large amount of offerings required, and the amount of manpower involved. Typically (and historically), the cost of all 7 shrines are borne by a few sponsors from the laity for benefit of everyone who wishes to participate in the puja. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The reason why the inner shrine is restricted to few people is to minimize interruptions from having too many people moving in and out of the shrine, as the chief master presiding over it has to perform complex visualizations during the puja and requires full concentration. That is why only few people are allowed in the inner platform, and for expediency reasons only sponsors are allowed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The outer shrines do not have such a restriction and people are free to attend them to dedicate merits to the deceased or to their families and friends. The outer shrines are free because of the donations of the sponsors. There is no difference in merits accrued from the outer or inner shrines.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Of course, one way to avoid misunderstanding is to disallow anyone into the inner shrine other than the presiding monks. But that also defeats the purpose, as most people (sad to say) would not want to sponsor the puja if there is no such privilege. So out of expedient means, and to be able organize the puja to benefit all sentient beings whether they have the means to sponsor or not, the tradition is to allow just the few sponsors into the inner shrine. This achieves two goals: to minimize the disruptions in the inner shrine as explained earlier, and to be able to conduct such a large scale puja to benefit all sentient beings.</span></p>
