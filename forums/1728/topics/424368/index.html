              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">"A" is "not-A", "not A" is "A"</span><br><br>In
                   the Avatamsaka Sutra, the Buddha, speaking from within the enlightened 
                  state, elucidates the nature of reality in an elaborately metaphorical 
                  expression that envisions the totality of existence as an “ocean” in 
                  which all the myriad dharmas are viewed as “reflections.” In his, Kaiin 
                  Zammai (Ocean-reflection Samadhi), Dogen assimilates the traditional 
                  account and, drawing on some unsuspected implications of the doctrine, 
                  manages to push the whole vision to a new, more dynamic level.<br><br>In
                   the sutra, the Buddha describes his “body” as consisting of the 
                  “arising” and “vanishing” of myriad dharmas. He also asserts that he 
                  does not “speak of this body,” which is the arising and vanishing of 
                  myriad dharmas, as “the arising and vanishing of an ‘I’.” Here, Dogen 
                  quotes the Buddha as going on to explain that:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">“A
                   preceding thought-moment and a succeeding thought-moment do not 
                  anticipate each other; a preceding dharma and a succeeding dharma do not
                   oppose each other. This is known as the ocean-reflection samadhi”<br>Shobogenzo, Kaiin-zammai, Hee-Jin Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, p.166</span><br><br>For
                   one thing, Dogen’s viewpoint differs significantly from the standard 
                  Huayen model in his emphasis on the unity of existence and time (uji; 
                  existence-time). This is seen in the present case by Dogen’s attention 
                  to the fact that preceding and succeeding “moments,” and “dharmas,” do 
                  not anticipate each other – thus the nondual nature of moments (time) 
                  and dharmas (existent forms) are underscored.<br><br>Dogen explains that
                   although Buddhas and ancestors actualize various kinds of enlightenment
                   (e.g. original, acquired, initial, etc.), there is more to Buddhas and 
                  ancestors than that. The “body” that the Buddha spoke of as consisting 
                  of the “integrated form” of myriad dharmas should not be hastily 
                  regarded as a “single unified form” (of undifferentiated oneness). 
                  According to Dogen, this “oceanic-body” does not contain the myriad 
                  forms, nor is it made up of myriad forms – it is the myriad forms 
                  themselves. The same instruction is provided at the beginning of 
                  Shobogenzo, Gabyo (pictured rice-cakes) where, he asserts that, “as all 
                  Buddhas are enlightenment” (sho, or honsho), so too, “all dharmas are 
                  enlightenment” which he says does not mean they are simply “one” nature 
                  or mind. On that line from Gabyo, Hee-Jin Kim comments:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">All
                   Buddhas and all things cannot be reduced to a static entity or 
                  principle symbolized as one mind, one nature, or the like. This guards 
                  against views that devaluate the unique, irreplaceable individuality of a
                   single dharma.<br>Hee-Jin Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, p.257</span><br><br>In
                   Kaiin Zammai, the “arising” of dharmas, says Dogen, is the 
                  actualization of a specific moment of time. “Existence,” being 
                  coessential and coextensive with “experience,” the “arising of dharmas” 
                  is synonymous with our experience here and now. The arising of myriad 
                  dharmas is itself authentic practice-enlightenment.For Dogen, “zazen” is
                   the archetypal symbol of this “practice-enlightenment.”<br><br>Zazen is
                   “mustering the whole body-mind (the whole of existence-time, inclusive 
                  of “A” and “not-A”) to look at forms and listen to sounds,” which is 
                  described by Dogen as “direct experience.” This “direct experience” is 
                  not only hearing, seeing, etc.; it is the arising of an ‘I’.” As in 
                  Shobogenzo, Genjokoan, “The myriad things advance and confirm the self.”
                   <br><br>Thus, the “arising of dharmas” (the myriad particular things of
                   experience) is itself “the one” totality of existence-time which is 
                  itself the whole, real, ever advancing body-mind of Buddha at each (and 
                  every) particular moment of existence-time. In other words, the totality
                   of “myriad” dharmas right now are - as they are - the “one” body-mind 
                  of Buddha right now. This “body-mind” is immediately “cast off” and the 
                  new totality of myriad dharmas is fully exerted as the one body-mind of 
                  Buddha, which is immediately cast off as the “body-mind of Buddha” 
                  ceaselessly advances into novelty – This! Now this! Now this! Now this! <br><br>The
                   “body-mind” of the Buddha (or Universe) that is manifested or 
                  actualized with each now total exertion “contains” or is “inclusive of” 
                  all previous total exertions (body-minds of Buddha) which, being “real 
                  dharmas” occupy dharma-positions (specific coordinates of 
                  space-and-time; uji, existence time), and therefore are “one of the 
                  myriad dharmas” that constitute the body-mind of Buddha here and now 
                  (i.e. their particular instance of existence forms part of the “fabric” 
                  of this particular instance of existence). Also, the “body-mind” of the 
                  Buddha here and now “contains” or is “inclusive of” all future total 
                  exertions (body-minds of Buddha) which, being “real potentials” are, and
                   must be “real dharmas,” hence, actually present here and now. Thus, 
                  Dogen’s teaching, “Nothing in the whole universe has ever been 
                  concealed.”<br><br>One thing this means is that the body-mind of Buddha 
                  is directly perceptible here and now. The Buddha (thus our “self”) is 
                  nothing more, or less, than each and every particular thing and event of
                   our experience here and now. As the masters say, “Truly seeing a mote 
                  of dust is truly seeing the whole universe.” In Dogen’s terms, “When one
                   side (a dust mote) is illumined, the other side (the totality of space 
                  and time) is dark” (“dark” as in “shadowed,” or “eclipsed” – thus “dark”
                   denotes presence not absence).<br><br>This (and every) instant of 
                  existence-time (dharma-position) is the “self” or the “I” which can be, 
                  and is, confirmed in (and as) “zazen” (authentic 
                  practice-enlightenment). Thus Dogen says: [Note: Nearman translates 
                  “dharmas” as “elements”]<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">‘Arising’
                   invariably refers to the arrival of a specific moment, for time is what
                   arises. Just what is this ‘arising’? It must surely be arising in and 
                  of itself. This arising is already a moment in time. Never did He say 
                  that it fails to expose what Skin and Flesh, Bones and Marrow really 
                  are. Because this is the arising of ‘being composed of ’, it is this 
                  body of His that arises, it is an ‘I’ that arises, and it is ‘merely 
                  being various elements’ that arises. It is not only hearing sounds and 
                  seeing forms and colors; it is also the arising of an ‘I’. It is this 
                  arising of an ‘I’ that one does not speak about. ‘Not speaking about 
                  something’ does not mean ‘not expressing something’, for being able to 
                  express something is not the same as being able to put it in words. The 
                  time of arising is synonymous with the appearance of ‘these elements’; 
                  it does not refer to the twenty-four hours of a day. These elements are 
                  what the time of arising is, and they do not compete with each other 
                  within the three worlds of desire, form, and beyond form. As an Old 
                  Buddha once put it, “Suddenly, fire arises.” Through this expression, He
                   was saying that there is no waiting about for this arising. <br>Shobogenzo, Kaiin Zammai, Hubert Nearman</span><br><br>After
                   commenting on this, Dogen cites a Zen koan and asserts that “we need to
                   discern the real meaning” of the “ceaselessness of this process,” 
                  underscoring that “the myriad dharmas” is “the one” body-mind (Buddha, 
                  true self) – as it is - and “the one” body mind is “the myriad dharmas.”
                   Then he reminds us that nonduality indicates “unity” not 
                  “identification” by describing this (inclusiveness of “A” and “not-A”) 
                  as the “lifeblood” of Buddhas and ancestors, pointing out that, “the 
                  ‘you’ is the who that arises and vanishes.”<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Another
                   Old Buddha once said, “What is this ceaseless time of arising and 
                  vanishing?” Thus, in that this arising and vanishing is our experience 
                  of the arising of an ‘I’ and our experience of the vanishing of an ‘I’, 
                  the process is unceasing. In entrusting the Matter to Him, we need to 
                  discern the real meaning of His stating the ceaselessness of this 
                  process. We continually chop up this unceasing time of arising and 
                  vanishing, which is the very lifeblood of an Ancestor of the Buddha. In 
                  the unceasing time of arising and vanishing, who is it that arises and 
                  vanishes? As to the ‘who’ that arises and vanishes, it is the ‘who’ that
                   is on the verge of being able to realize enlightenment within this 
                  body. That is, it is the ‘who’ that manifests this body, the ‘who’ for 
                  whom the Dharma is expressed, the very ‘who’ in the past who was unable 
                  to grasp what Mind is. It is “You have gotten what my Marrow is,” and it
                   is “You have gotten what my Bones are,” because the ‘you’ is the who 
                  that arises and vanishes.<br>Shobogenzo, Kaiin Zammai, Hubert Nearman</span><br><br>After
                   exploring and illuminating the significance of the implications of 
                  this, Dogen concludes Kaiin Zammai, by citing and commenting on a Zen 
                  koan that directly relates to our discussion on the unity of “A” and 
                  “not-A” in the infinite and eternal nature of “existence-time.” Here is 
                  the koan as translated by Hubert Nearman:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sozan
                   Honjaku was once asked by a monk, “I have heard that it says in the 
                  Scriptures that the great ocean does not give lodging to corpses. Just 
                  what kind of an ocean is this?”<br><br>The Master responded, “One that contains all that exists.”<br><br>The monk then asked, “Then why doesn’t it give lodging to corpses?”<br><br>The Master replied, “What has ceased to breathe is not connected with It.”<br><br>The monk asked, “Given that it contains all that exists, why is something that has ceased to breathe not connected with it?”<br><br>The Master said, “The functioning of all that exists is something other than ceasing to breathe.”<br>Shobogenzo, Kaiin Zammai, Hubert Nearman</span><br><br>After
                   pointing out that the “great ocean” in the koan is the same as in the 
                  Avatamsaka Sutra, Dogen defines “a corpse” as “dead ashes” and describes
                   this as a being (dharma) whose “mind does not change no matter how many
                   times it encounters springtime.” This is a remarkably creative 
                  expression; Dogen depicts “a corpse” as a dharma (thing, being, etc.) 
                  that seems to defy his own teachings on what “dharmas” are. First, 
                  according to Dogen, all dharmas arise and perish ceaselessly. Second, 
                  all authentic dharmas are said to be real insofar as they are 
                  experienced by sentient beings, and thus undergo ceaseless change. But 
                  here Dogen defines “a corpse” as a dharma that remains unchanged (no 
                  matter how many times it encounters springtime). Saying “a corpse” is 
                  unchanging, Dogen seems to contradict himself. However, this is actually
                   a beautiful example of Dogen’s unconventional use of convention – out 
                  pops the rabbit:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What he called ‘a corpse’ is something that no one has ever experienced, and that is why they do not comprehend what it is.<br>Shobogenzo, Kaiin Zammai, Hubert Nearman</span><br><br>We
                   know that for Dogen, existence is experience and experience is 
                  existence (i.e. to exist is to be experienced, to be experienced is to 
                  exist). Thus, all real (existent) dharmas are “experienced dharmas.” 
                  Thus, saying “a corpse” is something that “no one has ever experienced,”
                   in light of this teaching is the same as saying that “a corpse” is 
                  something (a dharma) that “has never existed.” With this in mind, the 
                  rest of Kaiin Zammai is fairly straightforward.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
                   Master’s saying, “One that contains all that exists,” expresses what 
                  the Ocean is. The point he is making is not that there is some single 
                  thing that contains all that exists, but rather that It is all contained
                   things. And he is not saying that the Great Ocean is what contains all 
                  existing things, but rather that what is expressing ‘all contained 
                  things’ is simply the Great Ocean. Though we do not know what It is, It 
                  is everything that exists for the moment. Even coming face-to-face with a
                   Buddha or an Ancestor is a mistaken perception of ‘everything that 
                  exists for the moment’. At the moment of ‘being contained’, although it 
                  may involve a mountain, it is not just our ‘standing atop a soaring 
                  mountain peak’, and although it may involve water, it is not just our 
                  ‘plunging down to the floor of the Ocean’s abyss’. Our acts of 
                  acceptance will be like this, as will our acts of letting go. What we 
                  call the Ocean of our Buddha Nature and what we call the Ocean of 
                  Vairochana are simply synonymous with ‘all that exists’.<br><br>Even 
                  though the surface of the Ocean may not be visible to us, we never doubt
                   its existence in our daily conduct of ‘swimming about’. For example, 
                  the monk Tafuku—one of Joshu’s Dharma heirs—once described a grove of 
                  bamboo as, “One or two canes are crooked, and three or four canes are 
                  aslant.” Although his daily monastic conduct led him to see all that 
                  exists as a bunch of errors, why did he not say, “A thousand crooked 
                  canes! Nay, ten thousand crooked canes!” Why did he not say, “A thousand
                   groves! Nay, ten thousand groves!” Do not lose sight of the underlying 
                  principle that is present like this in a grove of bamboo. Sozan’s 
                  expression, “One that contains all that exists,” is synonymous with ‘all
                   that exists’.<br><br>Although the monk’s question, “Why is something 
                  that has ceased to breathe not connected with it?” might be viewed, 
                  albeit mistakenly, as arising from doubt, it could have been just what 
                  his mind was concerned with. When Master Rinzai said about Fuke, his 
                  elder brother in the Sangha, “I have long had my doubts about that 
                  fellow,” he was simply recognizing who ‘the person’ was about whom he 
                  had long held doubts. In what exists, why is something that has ceased 
                  to breathe not connected with It and how can It not give lodging to 
                  corpses? Herein, why something that has ceased to breathe is not 
                  connected with It is that It already contains all that exists. Keep in 
                  mind that ‘containing’ does not mean ‘keeping’ and that ‘containing’ is 
                  synonymous with ‘not giving lodging to’. Even if all that exists were a 
                  corpse, it might well be that not giving lodging to it would forthwith 
                  span ten thousand years, and it might well be that ‘not belonging to It’
                   is this old monk Dogen playing one stone in a game of Go.<br><br>What 
                  Sozan said is, “The functioning of all that exists is something other 
                  than ceasing to breathe.” In other words, whether all that exists ceases
                   to breathe or does not stop breathing, a corpse would still be 
                  unconnected with It. Even though a corpse is a corpse, if it had 
                  behavior that was in harmony with all that exists, it would contain 
                  all—it would be containment. The journey before us and the journey 
                  behind us, which is part and parcel of all that exists, each have their 
                  own functions, and ceasing to breathe is not one of them. In other 
                  words, it is like the blind leading the blind. The fundamental principle
                   of the blind leading the blind includes ‘one blind person leading one 
                  blind person’ and ‘a mass of blind people leading a mass of blind 
                  people’. When a mass of blind people are leading a mass of blind people,
                   all contained things contain all contained things. Further, no matter 
                  how many Great Ways there are, They are beyond ‘all that exists’, for we
                   have still not fully manifested our meditative practice, which is the 
                  meditative state that bears the seal of the Ocean.<br>Shobogenzo, Kaiin Zammai, Hubert Nearman</span><br><br>While
                   Dogen’s most articulate critiques are those refutations of the 
                  non-Buddhist Indian teaching of Senika, his disparagement of all dualism
                   permeate his works. All so-called antitheses only become “antitheses” 
                  when we fail to abide by the Buddhist principles of nonduality which 
                  asserts that mind and matter, Buddhas and ordinary beings, delusion and 
                  enlightenment, practice and realization, self and other, etc. are 
                  united, not identical, they are not two, not one.<br><br>When we 
                  conceptually posit a gap between existence and experience, we divide 
                  existence from time. Authentic Zen practice requires us to perceive 
                  existence (sees what we are seeing), thus to perceive existence-time. 
                  Dogen frequently reminds us that we only experience (perceive) real 
                  dharmas and at specific places (of existence) and definite moments (of 
                  time). As “time” is inherent to all experiences, “place” (or space) is 
                  inherent to all existences. This principle corresponds to Dogen’s 
                  refrain about the unity of true form and true nature, activity and 
                  expression, appearance and essence, emptiness and form. For Dogen, every
                   particular expression of Buddha nature is a manifestation of 
                  existence-and-experience, thus of existence-and-time. More specifically 
                  every dharma (thing, being, instance, etc.) is a particular 
                  manifestation of the whole of existence-time (uji), not existence “plus”
                   time, but a singular unit of existence-time. <br><br>Dogen, like all 
                  Mahayanists, firmly denied the existence of an eternal, unchanging self.
                   But Dogen also pointed out that the matter did not end there:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
                   is constantly saintly is impermanent and what is constantly ordinary is
                   impermanent. The view that those who are just ordinary people and not 
                  saintly ones, and thus must lack Buddha Nature, is a foolish opinion 
                  held by some folks who are small-minded; such a view constitutes a 
                  narrow perspective which their intellect has conjectured. For the 
                  small-minded, ‘Buddha’ is a body and ‘Nature’ is its functioning, which 
                  is the very reason why the Sixth Ancestor said, “What is impermanent is,
                   of course, Buddha Nature.” <br><br>What seems constant has simply not 
                  yet undergone change. ‘Not yet undergone change’ means that, even though
                   we may shift our perspective to our subjective self or shift it to the 
                  objective, outer world, in both cases there are no signs of change to be
                   found. In that sense, it is constant. As a consequence, grasses and 
                  trees, as well as thickets and forests, are impermanent and, 
                  accordingly, they are Buddha Nature. It is the same with the human body 
                  and mind, both of which are impermanent and, accordingly, they are 
                  Buddha Nature. The mountains and rivers in the various lands are 
                  impermanent, so, accordingly, they are Buddha Nature. Supreme, fully 
                  perfected enlightenment is Buddha Nature, and hence it is impermanent. 
                  The Buddha’s great entry into nirvana was impermanent, and hence it is 
                  Buddha Nature.<br>Shobogenzo, Bussho, Hubert Nearman</span><br><br>Hee-Jin Kim in his Flowers of Emptiness, elucidates this line thus:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">That
                   is, permanence means the steadfast quality of the Buddha-nature which 
                  exerts itself totally and drops itself off completely in each and every 
                  situation. In this respect, the impermanent is permanent, the permanent 
                  is impermanent.<br>Hee-Jin Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, p.91</span><br><br>“A”
                   and “not-A” are the nondual actualization that is the (one) universe 
                  ceaselessly exerting its totality (as the myriad dharmas), casting it 
                  off, exerting, casting off, in and as each and every particular thing 
                  time and event in and as the totality of existence-time. “A” is “not-A”,
                   “not-A” is “A.”<br><br>Peace,<br>Ted</p>

              <div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">
              <div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">Judith Blackstone, 'The Empathic Ground':<br> <blockquote>"Although nondual realization is considered, in Asian 
              spiritual traditions to be an advanced level of spiritual attainment, I 
              have found that for many people it is easily accessible. It is important
               to understand that nondual realization is a process. Complete nondual 
              realization is said to be extremely rare, if it is possible at all. But 
              an initial realization requires between one and three years of 
              consistent practice intention."</blockquote><br> I saw this quote in your forum thread <a href="420774?page=4">Any living enlightened Master?</a> I wonder why you quoted it, it doesn’t seem relevant.   Nevertheless 
              with the recent insight into anatta, I am sure you no more concur with 
              Judith Blackstone that “Complete nondual realization is said to be 
              extremely rare, if it is possible at all.”  In fact not only is complete
               non-dual possible, it is simply the beginning.  In the realm of 
              no-mind, all experiences are implicitly non-dual and effortless.  This 
              should not be a mystery to you by now.<br> <br> The purpose of bringing up Judith Blackstone quote is not to boast about
               one’s achievement but to convey an additional point in practice.  That 
              is in addition to experience and realization, you have to embrace the 
              ‘right view’.  I have mentioned to you in the article <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/09/realization-and-experience-and-non-dual.html">Realization and Experience and Non-Dual Experience from Different Perspectives</a>, I will re-iterate it here: <br> <br> <blockquote>To mature this realization, even direct experience of the 
              absence of an agent will prove insufficient; there must also be a total 
              new paradigm shift in terms of view; we must free ourselves from being 
              bonded to the idea, the need, the urge and the tendency of analyzing, 
              seeing and understanding our moment to moment of experiential reality 
              from a source, an essence, a center, a location, an agent or a 
              controller and rest entirely on anatta and Dependent Origination.</blockquote><br> Therefore despite the clear realization and right experience, 
              seamlessness and effortlessness of non-dual experience will not be 
              smooth without ‘right view’.  The reason though obvious is often 
              overlooked; if deep at the back of a practitioner’s mind he still hold 
              the dualistic and inherent view, how is it possible to have seamless and
               effortless experience of in seeing, just scenery; in hearing, just 
              sound?  How unreserved, open and seamless can a practitioner be in 
              transcending the self altogether into the transience?  Hence equip 
              oneself with a view that can integrate with the realization and 
              experience, it will help practitioners progress more smoothly.   
              Understanding the impact of view in practice is what I find lacking in 
              many of your posts.  You may want to look into it.  <br> <br> With regards to the attachment of view, it does not apply to 
              practitioners that have gone pass certain phases of insights.  
              Practitioners after certain phases of insights are constantly abolishing
               ground and are clear that whatever pith instructions and views are 
              merely provisional.  There are masters that caution practitioners and 
              there are students that parrot their masters’ advices, so do not follow 
              blindly. In fact if understood correctly every deepening of view is a 
              giving up.  In the case of anatta, it is the total elimination of Self.<br> <blockquote>"Bhikkkhus, as purified and bright as this view is, if you 
              covet, cherish, treasure and take pride in it, do you understand this 
              Dhamma as comparable to a raft, taught for the purpose of giving up 
              [i.e. crossing over] and not for the purpose of grasping?" "No, 
              venerable sir." "Bhikkhus, as purified and bright as this view is, if 
              you do not covet, cherish, treasure and take pride in it, would you then
               know this Dhamma as comparable to a raft, taught for the purpose of 
              giving up [i.e. crossing over] and not for the purpose of grasping?" 
              "Yes, venerable sir."</blockquote><a href="http://www.leighb.com/mn38.htm">source: http://www.leighb.com/mn38.htm</a><br> <br> Coming back to your practice, there are 3 experiences that you should be familiar:<br> <br> 1.  Frequent occurrences of mini absorption states in sensory experiences of the 6 entries and exits. <br> <br> 2.  Getting grounded in the ‘here and now’.<br> <br> 3.  Occasional brief moment of experiencing oneself being transcended 
              into ceaseless activity (This is the beginning of maha 
              interconnectedness aka ä¸€å�ˆç›¸ according to your dharma grand master).<br> <br> I would like to hear from you the followings:<br> <br> 1.  How is 1,2 and 3 related?<br> <br> 2.  What in your own opinion is your next natural progression?<br> In your Taiwan teacher's reply, he pointed out to you about seeing the 
              equality of all dharma and all appearances.  Is this your next natural 
              progression?  If in a flash moment you are able to intuit what your 
              Taiwan teacher is pointing at, then all gaps are filled and transmission
               beyond verbal inadequacies is attained; otherwise there is no rush for 
              experience and realization. The mind has not given up enough to rid 
              itself of artificialities to intuit what that is plainly simple, gapless
               and direct.  <br> <br> <blockquote>Whatever arises dependently originates.<br> Life is so, Death is so.<br> This is so, That is so.<br> Here is so, Now is so.<br> Therefore no life, no death, no this, no that, no here, no now.<br> No Self to create the hierarchy to complicate matters.<br> Marvellously simple, primordially pure.<br> Diverse yet equal!</blockquote><br> 3.  Is grounding in the ‘here and now’ something to seek after?  Relate this to Ted’s article and the article on <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/04/stainlessness.html">Stainless</a>.  You have written a <a href="390582?page=14">post </a>about
               relinquishing attachment to the 'here and now'.  The improvement is 
              indicative of   the increase in understanding and expression of no-self.<br> <br> 4.  How and why does the experience of ä¸€å�ˆç›¸ (the experience of 
              interconnectedness) arise and and why only occasionally unlike your 
              non-dual experience?<br> <br> 5. How is your Taiwan teacher’s reply related to Ted’s article?<br> <br> <br> Lastly, I want to comment on the following 3 points found in Ted's article <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2011/03/is-not-not-is.html">"A" is "not-A", "not A" is "A"</a>.
                They are related to the questions above and is a little beyond you at 
              this point in time.  Take your time to refine your understanding and 
              experience in army.  I will update it along the way.<br> <br> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=3225985453951330898&amp;postID=5120543991924393510#Self">1.

The myriad things advance and confirm the self</a></span><br> <blockquote>Zazen is “mustering the whole body-mind (the whole of 
              existence-time, inclusive of “A” and “not-A”) to look at forms and 
              listen to sounds,” which is described by Dogen as “direct experience.” <span style="font-weight: bold;">This
               “direct experience” is not only hearing, seeing, etc.; it is the 
              arising of an ‘I’.” As in Shobogenzo, Genjokoan, “The myriad things 
              advance and confirm the self.</span>” </blockquote><br> The whole article would be beautiful without the above texts quoted in 
              bold.  This emphasis is no difference from the need to find ground in 
              the ‘here and now’.  There is another article posted by you in the blog <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/genjo-koan-actualizing-fundamental.html">Genjo Koan: Actualizing the Fundamental Point</a> that in my opinion provides a more accurate translation: <br> <blockquote>To carry yourself forward and experience myriad things is 
              delusion. That myriad things come forth and experience themselves is 
              awakening.<br> ….<br> ….<br> To study the buddha way is to study the self. To study the self is to 
              forget the self. To forget the self is to be actualized by myriad 
              things. When actualized by myriad things, your body and mind as well as 
              the bodies and minds of others drop away. No trace of realization 
              remains, and this no-trace continues endlessly.</blockquote><br> If “the myriad things advance and confirm the self”, then practitioners 
              will be leaving trace.  This also reminds me of my conversation with 
              Gozen (a Soto Zen teacher) in dharmaoverground: <br> <blockquote>24. RE: The mind and the watcher<br> Apr 7 2009, 5:46 PM EDT | Post edited: Apr 7 2009, 5:57 PM EDT<br> "I AM: Paradoxically, one feels at the same time that one is both 
              essentially untouched by all phenomena and yet intimately at one with 
              them. As the Upanishad says "Thou are That."<br> <br> 1.a. Body and Mind as Constructs: Another way to look at this is to 
              observe that all compound things -- including one's own body and mind --
               are **objects to awareness.** That is to say, from the "fundamental" 
              point of view of primordial awareness, or True Self, even body and mind 
              are **not self.**"<br> <br> Ha Gozen, I re-read the post and saw **not self**, I supposed u r 
              referring to anatta then I have to disagree...:-). However I agree with 
              what that u said from the Vedanta (True Self) standpoint. But going into
               it can make it appears unnecessary complex.<br> <br> As a summary, I see anatta as understanding the **transience** as 
              Awareness by realizing that there is no observer apart from the 
              observed. Effectively it is referring to the experience of in seeing, 
              only scenery, no seer. In hearing, only sound, no hearer. The experience
               is quite similar to “Thou are That” except that there is no sinking 
              back to a Source as it is deemed unnecessary. Full comfort is found in 
              resting completely as the transience without even the slightest need to 
              refer back to a source. For the source has always been the manifestation
               due to its emptiness nature.<br> <br> All along there is no dust alighting on the Mirror; the dust has always 
              been the Mirror. We fail to recognize the dust as the Mirror when we are
               attached to a particular speck of dust and call it the ”Mirror”; When a
               particular speck of dust becomes special, then all other pristine 
              happening that are self-mirroring suddenly appears dusty.<br> <br> Anything further, we will have to take it private again. :-)</blockquote><a href="http://www.blogger.com/%20http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/04/emptiness-as-viewless-view.html">source : Emptiness as Viewless View and Embracing the Transience</a><br> <br> Therefore to see that all dusts are primordially pure from before 
              beginning is the whole purpose of maturing the insight of anatta.  The 
              following text succinctly expresses this insight:<br> <blockquote>...According to Dogen, this “oceanic-body” does not contain 
              the myriad forms, nor is it made up of myriad forms – it is the myriad 
              forms themselves. The same instruction is provided at the beginning of 
              Shobogenzo, Gabyo (pictured rice-cakes) where, he asserts that, “as all 
              Buddhas are enlightenment” (sho, or honsho), so too, “all dharmas are 
              enlightenment” which he says does not mean they are simply “one” nature 
              or mind. </blockquote><br> Anything falling short of this realization cannot be said to be 
              Buddhist's enlightenment and it is also what your Taiwan teacher Chen 
              wanted you to be clear when he spoke of the "equality of dharma" as 
              having an initial glimpse of anatta will not result in practitioners 
              seeing that phenomena are themselves primoridally pure.<br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="OceanSamadhi" href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=3225985453951330898&amp;postID=5120543991924393510">2.

              <br> The Libya war, Japan earthquakes, tsunami and nuclear crisis have caused
               much turbulence to the world and its economy.  The past few weeks have 
              been a difficult period to cope (in business).  It is a very tough 
              period for those businessmen having businesses that are closely linked 
              to Libya and Japan and I can understand the fear, anger and frustrations
               in them.  I have friends that are badly affected but amid this 
              difficult time, let us also not forget that thousands of lives have been
               lost and tens of thousands more are still suffering now…<br> <br> I sincerely hope that all beings in this crisis be free from danger, mental and physical suffering .....<br> _/\_<br> 
              <hr>
              <br> The term ‘Ocean-Seal Samadhi (æµ·å�°ä¸‰æ˜§)’ seems to originate from Flower 
              Adornment Sutra.  I am not familiar with flower Adornment Sutra and 
              therefore know very little about æµ·å�°ä¸‰æ˜§.  When Amitayus48 first posted an 
              article about æµ·å�°ä¸‰æ˜§ by å®£åŒ–è€�å’Œå°š in your forum, I did an internet search on 
              æµ·å�°ä¸‰æ˜§ (in Chinese characters) and what gathered were the explanations (in
               Chinese) by many masters from non-dual substantialists perspective.  It
               was quite a disappointment. <br> <br> What that rekindled my interest in Ocean-Seal Samadhi is the following description:<br> <blockquote>The Buddha said, "It is just the dharmas that combine to 
              form this body. When it arises, it is simply the dharmas arising; when 
              it ceases, it is simply the dharmas ceasing. When these dharmas arise, 
              [the bodhisattva] does not state, 'I arise'; when these dharmas cease, 
              he does not state, 'I cease'." "In prior thought moments and subsequent 
              thought moments, the moments do not relate to each other; in prior 
              dharmas and subsequent dharmas, the dharmas do not oppose each other. 
              This is called the the ocean seal Samadhi.</blockquote><br> I wonder where Dogen got this wonderfully expressed quote but I am 
              unable to locate it in Flower Adornment Sutra.  The quote appears to be a
               piece-together from two different sutras -- Vimalakirti Sutra and (Zen 
              Grand Master) Hui Neng Sutra.  If that is the case, Ted is right in 
              saying that Dogen has indeed creatively shed new light into the profound
               meaning of æµ·å�°ä¸‰æ˜§.<br> <br> In my opinion the quote is not about an expression of a perfectly 
              transparent and clear state of mind where object and subject collasped 
              into an undifferentiated oneness reflecting myraid forms.  This would 
              just simply be a non-dual state; rather it is a perfection in insight of
               seeing what that is truly happening in this instantaneous moment of 
              suchness.  The myriad forms are presenting themselves in plain 
              simplicity and the myraid forms have always been what we called ‘mind’. 
               The texture, the fabric, the shape, the vivid colors, the myraid 
              appearances in primordial purity has always been 'mind' itself! Yet do 
              not mistake that 'mind' is the one substance that made up the myraid 
              forms for this is a distorted inherent view.  It is simply a label 
              denoting this instantaneous moment of vivid arising that entails the 
              total exertion of the universe.  This 'total exertion' is not by way of 
              'effort' and no amount of 'effort' will lead to 'total exertion'; this 
              'total exertion' is by way of realizing the 2 fold empty nature of 
              whatever arises. <br> <br> Therefore To study the mind is to study the myriad forms.  To study the 
              myriad forms is to study the dependently originated appearance at this 
              instantaneous moment. To study this instantaneous moment is to 
              understand the full exertion of the 'interconnected universe' and this 
              full exertion is expressed without reserved as this vivid moment of 
              arising sound...this breath...this passing thought...this obviously 
              clear scenery...<br> <br> and <br> <br> Instantly Gone!<br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Unsupported" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/">3. Do not anticipate, Do not oppose</a></span><br> <br> The previous section is essentially realizing that the "Ocean" is 
              something extra, in actuality it does not exist.  However the arising 
              insight of "no agent" does not naturally lead to the realization that:<br> <blockquote><br> “A preceding thought-moment and a succeeding thought-moment do not 
              anticipate each other; a preceding dharma and a succeeding dharma do not
               oppose each other."</blockquote><br> You have written a <a href="http://budddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/390582?page=14">post</a> relating to this matter where you spoke of the difference between the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">first and second stanza.</a> I think it is more relevant then seeing it as the total exertion in an
               instantaneous moment as presented by Ted. This arising moment of myriad
               appearance is the full embodiment of past, present and future 'total 
              exertion', hence "existence-time" is an invaluable insight but relates 
              more to the experience of maha.<br> <br> For the purpose of your practice, before going deeply into 'total exertion', it is advisable to first directly experience the '<strong>releasing from the chain </strong>(of
               birth and death)' by realizing that thought moment "do not anticipate 
              each other and dharma do not oppose each other".  In my opinion, without
               <strong>this de-linking the chain of thought-moment</strong> and seeing that 
              manifestation is continuously springing up non-dually, non-locally and 
              unsupported, the 'Samadhi' of the Ocean-Seal will not be adequately 
              understood.<br> <br> Also in between ”seeing the Ocean as extra” to directly experiencing the
               “total exertion in the ceaselessness of this ongoing activity”, a 
              process of maturing the insight of anatta is necessary.  By maturing I 
              am referring to the ending of any reification of mind-objects be it 
              "Self/self", "here/now", "mind", "body", "weather"... -- there is no 
              "Self/self", only changing aggregates; no "body", only changing 
              sensations; no “here and now” besides changing phenomena; no "weather" 
              besides changing clouds, rain and sun shines.  If this insight can be 
              thoroughly extended to whatever arises then the interconnectedness and 
              total exertion of this moment will become clear and obvious.  So much so
               that when eating an apple, the universe tastes it! -- the full exertion
               of the apple, the hand, the taste, the throat, the stomach, the 
              everything of everything is completely transcended into this simple 
              action of suchness where nothing is excluded.  Here again, do take note 
              that this "total exertion" is not the result of being fully 
              concentrated; it is the natural outcome when practitioners have 
              adequately embraced the 'view' of 2 fold emptiness.<br> <br> In summary I think this is an excellent article written from deep 
              experiential insight.  However the article seems to emphasize more “A” 
              than “not A”.  Although there is the mentioning of the “casting off”, it
               is quickly overshadowed by the emphasis of “total exertion”, the 
              grounding in the “here and now” and the affirming of the ‘Self’ in the 
              arising and ceasing. <br> <br> “Here” and “Now” are simply impressions formed by the senses.  
              Fundamentally there is nothing truly ”here”, nothing truly “now” and 
              nothing truly “self”.  Though the universe (with all causes and 
              conditions) is fully exerting to make this moment possible, it is 
              nothing real.  In my opinion <a href="424358">the recent post written by Pegembara</a> in your forum provides a good balance to Ted’s insight of “total exertion”.<br> <br> Just my 2 cents. :)</div>
