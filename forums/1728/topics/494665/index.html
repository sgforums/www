              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">My Buddhist friends and I</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Ro Mayyu Ali September 20,
              2017 Dhaka Tribune</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Children
              don't see religious differences. A Rohingya activist wonders where it all went
              wrong</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since
              I was in kindergarten, Rakhine students and Rohingya students have been sitting
              together in the same seats in the classroom. We have been playing together in
              the same playground in our school. We have been drinking water from the same
              metal pot with a small thick plastic cup. Our school is situated in Maungdaw,
              Northern Rakhine State.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              desks and chairs in our school are not for individual students, but rather,
              long worn out wooden benches and desks. We used to sit, three to five students
              per desk. Boys and girls sat separately in the classroom during the lesson, but
              there was no separation by ethnicity. Perhaps this is where we were first
              taught the values of friendship and togetherness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              I was in grade two, I can vaguely recall that I had a Buddhist boy who sat at
              the same desk as me in the classroom. I have trouble recalling his name now,
              but I vividly recall his face, always red-nosed. He was the beloved son of a
              military Investigation Officer. His parents relocated to our village and he
              joined our school. I remember he was the best dressed and most stylish boy in
              our classroom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Neither
              of us could understand each other’s language. He didn’t know my language, and I
              couldn’t understand his Burmese accent at that age. But we found other ways to
              understand each other. I could help him when I understood his needs. It was
              simple when we were that young, even without words. We were too young to fear
              each other, and the idea that we were a threat to each other had never occurred
              to us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since
              secondary classes, I have had some close Rakhine classmates. They were Aung
              Naing, Soe Min, Zaw win and Ma Ninn Wai. All of them are from my village. When
              there were sports matches in our school we took the lead roles together. We
              enjoyed our time together during festivals and wedding ceremonies of our
              siblings. We freely visited each other’s homes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              never argued over anything greater than our sitting arrangements for first-row
              seats in our classroom. Perhaps we used to tease each other, but harmlessly,
              never bullying. We all had our own dreams. Aung Naing and I wanted to be
              schoolteachers. Soe Min and Zaw Win wanted to be in the armed forces. Ma Ninn
              Wai never told us what she wanted to be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              more we grew, the stronger our friendships became. We grew close enough to
              share more with each other. We felt secure in front of each other. We used our
              exchanges and knowledge to help each other. During our exams we helped each
              other study. Our friendships were pure, even when we were not.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">With
              a vigorous might and bonding we stayed friends all the way to our matriculation
              exams. We studied the same subjects and attended the same tuition classes. We
              never had to feel different while we were together in school.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              the results came in, Aung Naing and I passed the exam. Soe Min, Zaw Win and Ma
              Ninn Wai were studying again for the next academic year. We were preparing for
              our higher education. Yet, nothing pushed us apart at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A time to dream</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Aung
              Naing and I were on the same path. We shared the same dreams or our lives, and
              he came from a less privileged family, like mine. We were not able to join Day
              University. He worked at a goldsmith shop in the market and I ran a tuition
              class on my town. We both were bookworms and loved learning and reading new
              books. We shared a passion for writing down quotes, poems and essays. We both
              were soft spoken, gentle. We were similar in many ways, but that Aung Naing was
              fatter than me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              2011 I joined Distance University of Education in Sittwe for my first year
              hoping to obtain a B.A. in English. During this time, my friend Aung Naing was
              studying his final year in Physics. Our friends who failed the matriculation
              still took their exams in the next academic level. Luck, however, did not
              favour them. When we were in our village we often met each other. We’d sit in
              the teashop together watching movies. Everything was simple and fair in our
              relationship.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              our results were announced I passed my first year. Aung Naing became a graduate
              in B. SC, Physics. It was time for him to chase his dream, as it was for me and
              my dream to finish my studies. He had already applied to be a school teacher. I
              enrolled for a second year. Time moved quickly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One wave, two shores</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              June 2012, sectarian violence broke out. There were deep tensions between the
              Rakhine people and my Rohingya people. We believe now it was manipulated by the
              government, to pit our peoples against each other. The violence pitted the
              Buddhists against the Muslims in our state. With the destruction and loss of
              property and life came the destruction of the relationship between our
              communities. Love and kindness between our peoples were replaced by distrust
              and tension.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Time
              separates us. Circumstances marginalise us. We have lost the bonds that kept us
              together as we once were, and our loyalty and closeness is not what it once
              was. Our coexistence is incomplete. Now, we are not who we were.<strong></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since
              then no Muslim student has been allowed to attend Sittwe University. At the
              same time, no restrictions have been placed on the Buddhists. My Buddhist
              classmates can all still pursue their dreams. When I see them now, they all
              look quite different. Aung Naing became a school teacher. Soe Min became a
              Border Guard Police. Zaw Win is a policeman now. I, however have had to remain
              incomplete. How can a wave crash in two directions on the same shore? I
              wondered often.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Five
              years later I’m waiting to rejoin my university. I had hoped to be teaching a
              classroom in school by now. Even though I am qualified, I have applied but have
              been rejected for not being Buddhist. My dreams and hope have been lost to this
              conflict, and I find myself also lost in it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              though my dream is the same as Aung Naing’s, we are different in faith. Aung
              Naing is Buddhist and I am Muslim. In my country this distinction matters, and
              it has crushed the dreams of my younger self.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Now, we are not who we were </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Today,
              my heart breaks when I see the Rakhine I was friends with in childhood – Aung
              Naing in his school teacher’s uniform and Soe Min and Zaw Win in their armed
              forces uniforms. I feel lost and worthless. In my young age I faced the many
              ways a human can suffer on this planet. I had all the potential to achieve my
              dreams, but lost them as soon as they should have become reality. It is a suffering
              I think few can understand in this world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              though we are still friends since we have known each other since childhood –
              since our births really, some external factors divide us. Time separates us.
              Circumstances marginalise us. We have lost the bonds that kept us together as
              we once were, and our loyalty and closeness is not what it once was. Our
              coexistence is incomplete. Now, we are not who we were. We are not children who
              were peaceful and happy together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              then should we do now? Should we look at our childhood to learn? How we once
              were the same and supported and understood each other? Should we see we were
              born on the same soil and grew together? Should we remember we were taught in
              the same school, and to this day survive in the same place?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Then
              why now can we not sit together again at the tea shop? Why can’t we watch
              movies together as we once did? No longer can we enjoy each other’s’ festivals
              and ceremonies. We could have this time again. We could revive this once more.
              My friend and childhood friends! We could once again live peacefully together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              we only allow ourselves to! So drop down the rope of this distrust and tension.
              A new peaceful future which looks like our past is waiting for us. We have
              nothing to pain more but much to gain.</span></p>
