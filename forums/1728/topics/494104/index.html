              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Happiness is awakening to the question</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> “Who is happy, who is unhappy, who lives, and who
              dies?” True happiness is uncaused, arising from the very nature of being
              itself. We seek happiness only when we are asleep to our true nature—dreaming
              that enlightenment is over there, somewhere else. But we are all, already, what
              we are seeking. Buddhas seeking to be Buddhas. Ha! How ridiculous.</span></p>

              and Advaita Vedanta</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We’re
              always trying to free ourselves from misery but we go about it the wrong way.
              There are a lot of small sweetnesses in life that we ignore because they’re so
              fleeting. It’s very important to look at what lifts our spirits and brings us
              happiness—to cherish those moments and cultivate appreciation. Happiness comes
              from being receptive to whatever arises rather than frantically trying to
              escape what’s unpleasant.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">—Pema Chödron</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, from True Happiness, a Sounds True CD set</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Society
              teaches us that suffering is an enemy. We are constantly encouraged to reject
              what is unpleasant, disappointing or difficult. “What’s all this suffering?
              Let’s be happy! Have fun!” But our suffering is not our enemy. It is only
              through a relationship with my pain, my sadness, that I can truly know and touch
              the opposite—my pleasure, my joy, and my happiness.</span></p>

              soldier’s Journey from War to Peace</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Happiness
              is primarily a matter of work that is fulfilling. There are many other factors,
              of course—a nice marriage or relationship, economic security, intellectual and
              artistic stimulation, and so on—but if the job is unsatisfactory, nothing else
              can really compensate.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Isn’t
              is funny?—I have been studying happiness for at least forty years, but I still
              don’t have a definition of it. The closest one would be that happiness is the
              state of mind in which one does not desire to be in any other state. Being
              deeply involved in the moment, we do not have the opportunity to think about
              anything but the task at hand—hence, by default we are happy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">—Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, director, Quality of Life Research Center, Claremont
              Graduate University, and author, Flow: The Psychology of Optimum Experience</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Studies
              my colleagues and I have conducted consistently show that when people focus on
              money, image, and status, they experience less happiness, vitality, and life
              satisfaction, and more depression and anxiety. Whereas materialistic pursuits
              tend to alienate people from their true selves, from others, and from the world
              at large, “intrinsic” pursuits encourage people to become who they really are
              and to deeply connect with other people and the broader world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">—Tim Kasser</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, Associate Producer of Psychology, Knox College, and
              author, The High Price of Materialism</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Usually,
              when we use the word “happiness,” it refers to how we feel when things appear
              to be going our way. This kind of happiness is superficial and ultimately
              unsatisfying. During the fourteen years I served in a maximum security federal
              prison, it was clear that things did not appear to be going my way. Practicing
              the Buddhist path, grounded in meditation, study, precepts practice, and
              service, I discovered an abiding cheerfulness and even joy. This kind of
              happiness is worth pursuing.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              think the best way to think about happiness is that it comes not from the
              inside or outside but from between. We can best find happiness by getting the
              conditions of our lives right, conditions that allow us to connect with others,
              with projects, and with something larger than the self, be it God, a social
              movement, or a profession with an ennobling tradition, such as teaching, art,
              medicine, or science.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">—Jonathan Haidt</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, associate professor of psychology, University of
              Virginia, and author, The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient
              Wisdom [Basic Books, January 2006]</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">My
              teacher, Tsoknyi Rinpoche, uses an image I like: “happiness for no reason.”
              When I think of that I think of being at home in one’s body and mind, in life
              as it is. That feeling of belonging is quieter than a lot of the flash we try
              to experience, but it is ours, not someone else’s to give us or to take away.
              It is steadfast and supportive, unbroken when conditions change. It can
              flourish in the face of obstacles, it can be there for us when everything else
              seems to fail, and it reminds us that each moment of life, delightful or
              painful, is precious.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">—Sharon Salzberg</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, co-founder, Insight Meditation Society, and author,
              “The Force of Kindness” [Sounds True, September 2005]</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ultimately,
              happiness is equanimity. While we all seek to be happy, we need to reduce
              suffering to get there. Neuroscience offers a biological metaphor: the brain
              areas most active during happiness, in the left prefrontal cortex, contain the
              neurons that silence disturbing feelings, allowing us to recover from states of
              emotional suffering more quickly or be less thrown off balance.</span></p>
