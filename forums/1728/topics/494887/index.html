              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Rita M. Gross SPRING 2013 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The heavy cost of literalism</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Years ago, at the Brooklyn Museum, I was looking at a Tibetan
              statue of a multi-armed figure when a middle-aged white couple stopped to view
              the statue, and as they did, one said to the other, “What is that about? Do you
              suppose they were trying to portray a freak who was born that way?” Then,
              before I could say anything, they moved on. As I, or anyone else familiar with
              the Indian cultural milieu, might have told them, the multiple arms were not
              intended to be a photograph-like portrait. Their intent is symbolic not
              literal. They symbolize the deity’s multiple abilities and capabilities. Only
              if one were completely blind to symbolism could one so completely misread the
              meaning of the statue’s multiple arms, imagining that they were intended to be
              an accurate physical representation of an actual person born with many arms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While the speculations of that couple in Brooklyn might
              sound, to a Buddhist audience, terribly naive, their error is really not that
              uncommon. Many modern Buddhists understand traditional narratives and practices
              in much the same way. What I mean is that for many modern Buddhists, the
              symbolic meanings contained in traditional forms are approached with an outlook
              steeped in the worldview of the European Enlightenment, in which truth and
              value lie mainly with empirical facts. Truth, in this case, is found as a
              result of impersonal, objective observation, and it can be duplicated by anyone
              with proper training under the same circumstances. There is little room in this
              view of things for affirming meaning as it is communicated through symbolic
              forms or for the understanding that, for some purposes, the value of symbolic
              meaning can override empirical facts or even that sometimes factual information
              is irrelevant to symbolic meaning. By the literalist standard, the only reason
              to sculpt a figure with multiple arms is to portray someone born with a tragic
              abnormality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One finds in Buddhist tradition a distinction between “words”
              and “meaning,” which are often very different from one another, and we would do
              well to consider the traditional advice—whether we are looking at statues or
              interpreting teachings—to pay attention to symbolic meaning and not be limited
              to literal meaning. Traditional people recognize that what is known through
              imagination, whether or not it can observed empirically, is worthy of
              portrayal. We moderns, however, though we think ourselves incomparably more
              sophisticated than traditional people, have little understanding or
              appreciation of symbolic experience and, having committed ourselves to an
              empirical worldview, we live within its narrow confines. For us—or at least for
              many of us—a multi-armed deity is just a portrayal of a “freak.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The same insights pertain to narratives. One can find in
              traditional narratives virtually any event one might imagine: virgin births,
              resurrections from the dead, interplanetary travel, simultaneous appearance of
              historical and nonhistorical characters, and so forth. But what did the
              original authors of these stories intend? Did they think they were recording
              factual history? I suggest that just as the sculptor of the multi-armed statue
              knew what he was doing, so these traditional authors knew what they were doing.
              These stories are primarily about communicating meaning, not recording facts.
              Virgin births, for example, are quite common in the stories of heroes. A virgin
              birth signifies an extraordinary person, someone who will accomplish great
              things with her or his life. That, and not the claim that the normal processes
              of human conception and birth have been contravened, is the main message of the
              story.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The modern person of a literalist mind-set will, however,
              focus on the unusual conception or birth and thus miss the story’s meaning. Not
              only that, but such a person, if religiously inclined, would likely insist that
              it is only by interpreting the events literally that one can be a faithful and
              true practitioner of that particular tradition. Often, they will even claim to
              be better practitioners than those who focus on the meaning of the story and
              who discount the likelihood that the story’s more improbable events occurred
              empirically. On the other hand, another kind of literalist will reject the
              whole story outright as worthless because it is pure fantasy. In both cases,
              the modern literal interpreter may well be much more naive about the main
              messages of such stories than are those who hear them in a traditional manner.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Religions, Buddhism included, are almost entirely about
              symbolic meaning rather than facts. Indeed, to have religious meaning, even a
              fact must become a symbol. Religious people have always known this intuitively.
              But in the modern context, we face a new and particular challenge, a different
              twist on the matter of truth. We modern people must differentiate clearly and
              carefully between facts and symbols, between history, which is an empirical
              discipline, and the traditional stories whose purpose is primarily symbolic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Many religious people resist giving up literal
              interpretations of their most valued stories, because they think, erroneously,
              that they must either accept such stories as factual accounts or reject them
              entirely. But this dualistic assumption is the most dangerous conclusion people
              could draw regarding the relationship between fact and symbol, between narrative
              and history. A narrative can be both true and false at the same time—factually
              false yet symbolically true. It is not at all necessary either to edit
              traditional narratives to make them conform to modern sensibilities or to
              insist, against all common sense, that unless they happened literally as
              presented they have no truth value. We can learn to interpret traditional
              stories symbolically while simultaneously holding a modern attitude of
              discernment toward the events they recount.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It can be upsetting to hear that a treasured religious story
              simply is not historically accurate, but it need not be so. In our everyday
              lives, we routinely approach the world with a flexible attitude, knowing that
              the metaphors we use to communicate, while perhaps not literally true, serve
              well to describe things. We still say, for example, “the sun rose,” even though
              it has long been common knowledge that it is not the sun that rises but the
              earth that turns. We know what we say is not accurate, yet we also know what we
              mean when we say it. This same flexibility toward our descriptions of the
              world, which is so common a feature of everyday life that we seldom even notice
              it, can be easily applied to those descriptions of the world that we label
              “religious.” What is so difficult about that? Why doesn’t such flexibility come
              naturally to speech about traditional Buddhist narratives and claims?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We modern people must differentiate clearly and carefully
              between facts and symbols, between history, which is an empirical discipline,
              and the traditional stories whose purpose is primarily symbolic. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One example of how such flexibility can be applied to
              traditional claims concerns traditional Buddhist “flat-earth” cosmology, which
              is still used in ritual, and empirical geography. The traditional Buddhist map
              of the world describes a flat earth at the center of which is Mount Meru.
              Surrounding Mount Meru are four continents, each of which is flanked by two
              islands, and these lands are surrounded by the great oceans. All of this is
              encircled by a ring of iron mountains. In the absence of physical exploration
              of the globe, such a world-picture is not nonsense. Until it was proved that
              one does not fall over the edge of the world if one continues traveling the
              same direction but rather eventually comes back to one’s starting point, most
              people simply assumed that the earth is flat. After all, it looks flat, just as
              it looks from our vantage point as if the sun rises above the earth’s horizon.
              Given that high mountains are found to India’s north, it is also easy to see
              why India was imagined to be the southern continent among the four, with a
              giant mountain to its north. All these, and many others, were at one time
              sensible conclusions. But once they have been proven false empirically, it is senseless
              to try to hold onto such assumptions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The geographical exploration of the physical world that
              revealed a very different map caused consternation to Buddhists. Many Buddhists
              continued to hold to the traditional view, which cost some of them their trust
              in Buddhist teachings altogether. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Christian
              missionaries—who no longer believed in a flat earth even though they continued
              to reject more recent discoveries about the age of that earth—in Asian Buddhist
              countries routinely peppered their anti-Buddhist polemics with references to
              the fact that no explorer had ever found Mount Meru anywhere on the globe. Even
              while they continued to reject new European knowledge about the earth,
              Christian missionaries argued that if Buddhist texts were so wrong about the
              physical description of the earth, they must be untrustworthy in other ways as
              well. On such bases, Buddhists were encouraged to convert to Christianity, and
              some certainly did. In this case, actually both the Christian missionaries and
              the Buddhists continued to insist on a literal reading of their texts. But for
              Buddhists, that literal reading destroyed their confidence in Buddhism as a
              whole. Thus, we see how dangerous it can be to cling to either-or dualism
              regarding traditional texts, claiming that if they are not literally accurate
              in every way, then they are false and useless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tibetan Buddhists continued to accept the traditional
              flat-earth geography until well into the 20th century. The Buddhist teacher Ken
              McLeod, one of Kalu Rinpoche’s translators, tells an instructive story of
              accompanying a traditionally trained Tibetan lama to northern Canada during the
              summer. They arrived in the afternoon and settled in for the night. The next
              morning, the lama was troubled that during the night it had not become dark.
              McLeod used apples and oranges to show him how the sun does not set in the
              summer in northern regions because of the earth’s roundness, the way it tilts
              on its axis, and the way it rotates around the sun. The lama replied that he
              had heard the claim that the earth is round when he came out of Tibet, but he
              had dismissed it as another crazy Western idea, contrary to both common sense
              and his traditional training. McLeod recounts that though the lama was
              dispirited for some days, he came to accept this new information and returned
              to his usual cheerful demeanor. In the end, the lama’s experience of nights
              without darkness was more powerful than his inherited beliefs about the
              flatness of the earth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Going a little further, in his book The Universe in a Single
              Atom, the Dalai Lama recounts his excitement and joy at first seeing a
              photograph of the earth taken from space:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One of the most powerful visions I have experienced was the
              first photograph of the earth from outer space. The image of a blue planet
              floating in deep space, glowing like the full moon on a clear night, brought
              home powerfully to me the recognition that we are indeed all members of a
              single family sharing one little house.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Here there are no worries that a traditional Buddhist claim
              has been disproved, that the earth is not flat, and that Mount Meru is nowhere
              to be found. Instead, easily adjusting to a more complete, and, in this case,
              more accurate geography, the Dalai Lama draws out ethical implications from his
              new knowledge.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Flat-earth cosmology continues even in the present day to
              figure into Vajrayana Buddhist ritual. The traditional map of the world
              continues to have spiritual meaning when we understand its symbolic
              significance to be psychological rather than geographical. The ritual mandala
              offering, done daily, utilizes the traditional map of the cosmos. The short
              form of the liturgy reads:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The earth is anointed with perfumed water and strewn with
              flowers. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is adorned with Mount Meru, the four continents, the sun
              and the moon. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By offering this visualized as a Buddhafield, </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">May all beings enjoy that pure realm.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Earlier generations of Vajrayana Buddhists would have assumed
              that this liturgy involves an accurate picture of the physical world. But
              contemporary Buddhists who do not believe the liturgy literally continue to
              recite it because of its spiritual meaning, which concerns primary Buddhist
              virtues such as generosity and the wish that all beings might prosper and be
              happy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While contemporary Buddhists seem to have little trouble
              distinguishing between literal and symbolic meaning in some situations, in
              others this flexibility is less often found. People seem to really hold tight
              to their traditional stories, for instance, when it comes to the various
              accounts of how their particular school developed. These stories are often
              highly sectarian and historically inaccurate, yet because they speak to issues
              of authenticity, they retain a great deal of dogmatic power.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For example, according to Mahayana legend, the Buddha
              secretly preached the Mahayana teachings to only a select group of disciples
              who were ready to hear what is said to be a higher teaching than what had come
              before. As a matter of history, we know that this is simply not accurate, yet
              it can be very difficult for contemporary Mahayana Buddhists to accept this.
              This difficulty stems from the traditional but no longer plausible idea that
              authentic Buddhist teachings must be the direct teachings of the Buddha. If the
              Mahayana teachings, or any other teachings, are not those of the historical
              Buddha, it is feared that they are inauthentic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">From a historical perspective, Mahayana Buddhism displays
              many of the features of a new religious movement. There are, for example, very
              few references to the Mahayana in the texts of older Buddhist schools. That
              these Buddhists rarely bothered to refute Mahayana teachings indicates that the
              older schools did not perceive them to be much of a threat. Mahayana texts,
              however, constantly justify themselves by contrasting themselves, in a very
              positive light, with the older, more established schools, which they label as
              “Hinayana”—the inferior, cast-off yana, or vehicle. Both tendencies occur
              commonly when a new religious movement is emerging. Jews, for example, did not
              spend a lot of time or energy denouncing the new Jesus movement, but the
              Christian New Testament is full of claims about the inadequacy of Judaism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Even the Mahayana account of its own origins betrays that it
              is a new religious movement. When it is claimed that the historical Buddha
              taught the Mahayana, it is also claimed that those disciples who followed the
              earlier teachings were greatly shocked, and the Buddha realized that his
              community would not be ready to hear the Mahayana dharma until it had a few
              hundred years to mature. The Buddha then hid the teachings among the nagas,
              serpent-like mythical creatures, for some 400 years, at which time they were
              retrieved by the great master Nagarjuna. As it happens, legend and history
              correspond on this point. Both agree that the Mahayana teachings appeared on
              the human plane about 400 years after the life of Shakyamuni Buddha. To me,
              this indicates that early Mahayanists may well have been fully cognizant that
              their dharma was something previously unheard. In fact, that is precisely what
              many Mahayana sutras claim. They claim that the Buddha is now teaching
              something that he previously had not revealed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">That the early Mahayanists felt they must attribute their
              teachings to the historical Buddha is not surprising. When people innovate
              within an established tradition, they always claim direct inspiration from the
              teachings of the founder. I and other Buddhist feminists, for example, often
              claim that if the Buddha were alive today he would surely support gender equity
              and equality. But it would be untenable to rewrite Buddhist history to support
              this claim. Similarly, it is untenable, from a historical perspective, to
              assert that stories told in Mahayana scriptures were actual conversations
              between the historical Buddha and a special group of disciples. We can though,
              and we should appreciate them as imagined conversations between a prototypical
              Buddha and his prototypical disciples on topics of import to practitioners in a
              new historical situation. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Even the Dalai Lama concedes that point. As he says:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When we examine the Mahayana scriptures themselves, we find
              statements that seem problematic in various ways. For example, the Perfection
              of Wisdom sutras state that they were taught by the Buddha at Vulture Peak in
              Rajagriha to a vast congregation of disciples. However, if you have visited the
              site in present-day Rajgir, it is obvious that it is impossible for more than a
              few people to fit onto the summit. So we have to understand the truth of these
              accounts at a different level, a level beyond the ordinary one confined by
              conventional notions of space and time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This is precisely what I advocate. Give up on even trying to
              read traditional texts as factual history. Then, as separate but intertwined
              projects, take up discerning an accurate history of Buddhism, as much as you
              can, but also interpret the symbolism and meaning of traditional narratives on
              a level beyond ordinary space and time. But don’t conflate and confuse the two!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Seeing the difference between history and the stories of
              legend need not diminish the latter of their meaning and value. In fact, I
              believe it can enhance them. My own teacher, Jetsun Khandro Rinpoche, told me
              as much, when she said that learning that many of her traditional beliefs were not
              historically accurate only made her think more deeply about their spiritual
              meaning. This is really the point. When we cease to confuse history and
              stories, when we look at traditional stories outside the context of literal
              truth and sectarian debate, we are freer to appreciate the imaginative truths
              they convey. When we fail to see the issue discerningly, such stories are
              spoiled in every way. They are not accurate history, but they are no longer
              good stories either. They become completely wooden as the attempt to take them
              literally robs them of all their whimsy, humor, and playfulness.</span></p>
