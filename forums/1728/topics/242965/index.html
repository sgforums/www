There are many similarities in the 'pantheon' of devas/deities between Buddhism and Hinduism. And yes, different deities have different weapons I think. However Buddhists generally do not worship these deities although we may pay our respects to them, and these deities are also known to be part of samsara and are also students of the Buddha.<br><br><blockquote>Really asking as their seems to be certain similarities between Hinduism and Buddhism, especially in terms of spirituality and self realisation.</blockquote>In some aspects we are similar, in some aspects we are different. I have an interest in some teachings of Advaita Vedanta but even then there are some differences. The main difference is that Emptiness as Interdependent Origination is not taught in Hinduism, and furthermore we do not posit an ultimate reality as Self or Atman. Although both Atman and Buddha Nature refers to our pure luminosity aspect, the nature of it may not be realised. These are the main differences.. maybe in future we can discuss more if you're interested.</div>

Non-violence and compassion is very important in Buddhism.<br><br>I think more importantly we have to severe evil from its roots - the mind. This is also known as mind purification. However mind purification does not only mean eradicating evil thoughts, it means eradicating the root ignorance within sentient beings. The root ignorance is the belief and attachment to the ego/false self. From it springs all the 5 poisons (craving, anger, jealousy, pride and ignorance) that leads sentient beings to degeneration and creating more evil and misfortunes.<br><br>And what does the sword of manjusri symoblise? Exactly this.. to cut the bonds of ignorance so that one can gain wisdom. Manjusri Bodhisattva symbolises Great Wisdom.</div>
