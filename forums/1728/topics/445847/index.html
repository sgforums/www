              </div>
              <p>I’ve just read yet another assertion that tries to slip a 
                      ‘cosmic consciousness’ Nibbana into the Suttas. In these kinds of 
                      arguments the same mistakes are made again and again, and you should 
                      beware of them.</p>
              <p>One popular argument is based on the famous passage:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>viññÄ�á¹‡Ä�á¹� anidassanaá¹� anantaá¹� sabbato pabhaá¹� </em></p>
              <p>‘Consciousness non-manifest, infinte, radiant all around.’</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This is sometimes said to be a term for Nibbana, although since it is
                       an obscure poetic passage of dubious meaning we should not infer any 
                      major conclusions from it.</p>
              <p>This obscure passage has been often exalted to the revelation of the 
                      highest teachings of Nibbana. One of the arguments one hears is that <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> normally means ‘separative consciousness’, and that this has been 
                      revalued to refer to an infinite awareness. This argument is wrong.</p>
              <p>The etymology of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> is invoked to justify this conclusion. ‘<em>Vi</em>’, so the story goes, means ‘separation’, and ‘<em>ñÄ�á¹‡a</em>’ means ‘knowing’, so <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> means ‘separative knowing’ (as opposed to the universal cosmic consciousness of Nibbana.)</p>
              <p>But you cannot derive the meaning of a word by adding up a root with a
                       prefix. Words derive meaning from context. This is especially true in 
                      the case of words in abstract philosophical use.</p>
              <p>In any case, the etymology of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> does not mean ‘separative consciousness’. The prefix ‘<em>vi</em>’ has many different meanings, which you can check up on in the <a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:1281.pali">Pali Text Society’s dictionary</a>. If you don’t want to read the entire entry, the applied meanings it gives are four:</p>
              <p>1. expansion, spreading out</p>
              <p>2. disturbance, separation, mixing up (opp. <em>saá¹�</em>)</p>
              <p>3. the reverse of the simple verb, or loss, difference, opposite</p>
              <p>4. in intensifying sense</p>
              <p>Obviously, there is no requirement to read <em>vi</em> in its separative sense here.</p>
              <p>There are many terms formed from the root ‘<em>ñÄ�</em>’ in Pali that all refer to knowing in some way (‘know’ is in fact the English cognate): <em>aññÄ�</em>, <em>ñÄ�á¹‡a</em>, <em>pariññÄ�</em>, <em>paññÄ�</em>, <em>paá¹­iññÄ�</em>, <em>saññÄ�</em>,
                       and so on. In some cases these words are interchangeable, in some cases
                       usage tells us that they carry different nuances. In no cases can we 
                      simply infer the meaning from adding prefix + root.</p>
              <p>Given that <em>vi</em>- is probably the second most common prefix in 
                      Pali, and has an extremely wide variety of implications – including in 
                      some cases not affecting the meaning at all – we can’t say anything 
                      meaningful from the etymology.</p>
              <p>Even if we did look to the etymology, we can come to all sorts of different conclusions. In some cases, <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> is clearly a synonym of <em>paññÄ�</em>, ‘wisdom’ (e.g. Sutta NipÄ�ta 92-3). Here the implication could be that <em>vi</em>- means ‘intensive’, or ‘clear’ (as it does, say, in <em>vipassanÄ�</em>).</p>
              <p>It is true that the Buddha often presented <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> in an 
                      analytical way as the consciousness of the six senses. But this tells us
                       nothing about what the word means. He also used plenty of other terms 
                      related to the six senses: <em>vedanÄ�</em>, <em>phassa</em>, or <em>saññÄ�</em>,
                       for example. The fact that a word is used in an analytical sense does 
                      not mean that the basic meaning of the word is analytical.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, what the ‘<em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> = Nibbana’ school overlook is that <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> is in fact used very commonly in the sense, not of ‘separative 
                      consciousness’, but of ‘infinite consciousness’. This is, of course, in 
                      the standard passage on the formless attainments. This samadhi meaning 
                      is directly applicable in the case of the so-called ‘Nibbanic 
                      consciousness’, as they are both described as ‘infinite’ (<em>anantaá¹�</em>).</p>
              <p>The Buddhist texts strongly suggest that this idea is pre-Buddhist. 
                      And we do indeed find the phrase ‘infinite consciousness’ in the 
                      pre-Buddhist Upanishads. But more on that later. First let us survey the
                       use of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> briefly in the oldest Upanishad, the 
                      Brihadarannyaka. This probably pre-dates the Buddha by a century or so, 
                      and many of its ideas and turns of phrase can be felt in the Suttas.</p>
              <p><em>ViññÄ�á¹‡a</em> is used in the ordinary sense of ‘sense consciousness’:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>jihvayÄ� hi rasÄ�n vijÄ�nÄ�ti</em> || BrhUp_3,2.4 ||</p>
              <p>For one knows tastes through the tongue.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>More commonly it is found as the final of the four terms, ‘seen’, 
                      heard’, ‘thought’, ‘cognized’, a set that is frequently found in the 
                      Suttas. In this context it is said that ‘how can one cognize the 
                      cognizer’, a means of pointing beyond limited sense experience to the 
                      true Atman.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>kaá¹ƒ vijÄ�nÄ«yÄ�t yenedaá¹ƒ sarvaá¹ƒ vijÄ�nÄ�ti taá¹ƒ kena

              <p>Through what should one know that owing to which all this is known ? 
                      This self is That which has been described as ‘Not this, Not this’. It 
                      is imperceptible, for It is never perceived; undecaying, for It never 
                      decays; unattached, for It is never attached; unfettered – it never 
                      feels pain, and never suffers injury. Through what, O Maitreyi, should 
                      one know the Knower?<br> BrhUp_2,4.14<br> See also BrhUp_3,4.2, BrhUp_2,4.5</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The self is defined in terms of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em>.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>katama Ä�tmeti — yo ‘yaá¹ƒ vijñÄ�namayaá¸¥ prÄ�á¹‡eá¹£u há¹›dy antarjyotiá¸¥ puruá¹£aá¸¥</em></p>

              </blockquote> <blockquote>

              <p>BrhUp_4,4.5</p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p><em>yo vijñÄ�ne tiá¹£á¹­han vijñÄ�nÄ�d antaro yaá¹ƒ vijñÄ�naá¹ƒ na

              <p>He who inhabits the <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em>, but is within it, whom the <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> does not know, whose body is the <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em>, and who controls the <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As in Buddhism, <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> is closely associated with rebirth. In the following passage, the phrase <em>ekÄ«bhavati</em> refers to the withdrawal of the sense at the time of death – which is 
                      interesting since in Buddhism the same term is used to mean samadhi. <em>ViññÄ�á¹‡a</em> has two meanings here: in the first use it refers to 
                      sense-consciousness (because others realize that the dying person no 
                      longer hears or responds). Later it refers to the conscious self that 
                      takes rebirth.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>ekÄ«bhavati na vijÄ�nÄ�tÄ«ty Ä�huá¸¥ | tasya haitasya

              <p>He becomes united; then they say, ‘He does not have <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em>’.
                       The top of the heart brightens. Through that brightened top the self 
                      departs, either through the eye, or through the head, or through any 
                      other part of the body. When it departs, the vital force follows; when 
                      the vital force departs, all the organs follow. Then the self has <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em>, and goes to the body which is related to that consciousness. It is followed by knowledge, kamma and past experience.<br> BrhUp_4,4.2</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>But the most directly applicable passage is the following. Like 
                      several of the above it is the teaching of YÄ�jñavalkya, who should be 
                      recognized as the father of the teachings of consciousness as the great 
                      Brahman. Notice the simile of the lump of salt, also familiar in 
                      Buddhism. The passage from which this is taken is full of such 
                      parallels, as I discussed in <em>A History of Mindfulness</em>.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>evaá¹ƒ vÄ� ara idaá¹ƒ mahad bhÅ«tam anantam apÄ�raá¹ƒ 
                      vijñÄ�naghana eva | etebhyo bhÅ«tebhyaá¸¥ samutthÄ�ya tÄ�ny evÄ�nuvinaÅ›yati | 
                      na pretya saá¹ƒjñÄ�stÄ«ty are bravÄ«mi | iti hovÄ�ca yÄ�jñavalkyaá¸¥</em> || BrhUp_2,4.12 ||</p>
              <p>As a lump of salt dropped into water dissolves with (its component) 
                      water, and no one is able to pick it up, but from wheresoever one takes 
                      it, it tastes salt, even so, my dear, this great, endless, infinite 
                      Reality is but sheer mass of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em>. This comes out from these elements, and is destroyed with them. After this it has no more perception (<em>saññÄ�</em>). This is what I say, my dear. So said Yajnavalkya.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Compare with the Buddhist line above. Both describe <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> as ‘infinite’ (<em>anantaá¹�</em>). Both use the philosophical term <em>mahÄ�bhÅ«ta</em>, although in different sense: in the Buddhist context it is a word for the four elements which the state of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> described goes beyond, whereas here it is the Great Reality itself. The
                       Upanishadic passage describes the infinite consciousness as having 
                      disappeared or become non-manifest like salt dissolved in water, just as
                       the Buddhist passage describes <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> as ‘non-manifest’ (<em>anidassana</em>). The Buddhist passage speaks of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> as ‘radiant’, just as elsewhere the self that is <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> is said to be the ‘light in the heart’.</p>
              <p>The parallels are by no means arbitrary. In fact the Buddhist passage
                       appears in a specifically Brahmanical context. The text is the Kevaddha
                       Sutta (Digha Nikaya 11: text <a href="http://studies.worldtipitaka.org/tipitaka/6D/11/11.4/11.4.1">here</a>, translation <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html">here</a>, parallels <a href="http://suttacentral.net/disp_correspondence.php?division_acronym=DN&amp;sutta_number=11.0&amp;sutta_coded_name=Kevaddha%20%5BKeva%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADa%5D&amp;volpage_info=DN%20I%20211&amp;sutta_id=11">here</a>.) A monk wants to find out where the four Great Elements (<em>mahÄ�bhÅ«ta</em>)
                       end, and goes to Brahma for the answer. Brahma, however, doesn’t know, 
                      and he sends the monk back to the Buddha. The Buddha rejects the 
                      original question, and tells the monk how it should be reformulated.</p>
              <p>The basic idea is clear enough. Brahma’s realm extends as far as 
                      jhana, as Buddhists assume that the Brahmanical philosophy was based on 
                      jhanic experience (at best). So Brahma doesn’t know what lies beyond 
                      this, while the Buddha does.</p>
              <p>The problem is that, apparently, what lies beyond is a kind of 
                      consciousness. Given the evident connections between this description 
                      and the Brahmanical conception of the higher atman as a form of infinite
                       consciousness, the most obvious inference is that it refers to the 
                      formless attainments, specifically that of ‘infinite consciousness’, 
                      where the ‘four great elements’ don’t find a footing.</p>
              <p>It is in the next lines of the verse, which are usually overlooked by the <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> = Nibbana school, that the Buddha’s true position is stated. With the cessation of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> all this comes to an end. The ‘infinite consciousness’ is merely the 
                      temporary escape from the oppression of materiality, but true liberation
                       is the ending of all consciousness.</p>

              <p><em>Tatra veyyÄ�karaá¹‡aá¹ƒ bhavati— </em><br> For that the explanation is:</p>
              <p>‘<em>ViññÄ�á¹‡aá¹ƒ anidassanaá¹ƒ, </em><br> <em>Anantaá¹ƒ sabbatopabhaá¹ƒ; </em><br> <em>Ettha Ä�po ca pathavÄ«, </em><br> <em>Tejo vÄ�yo na gÄ�dhati. </em></p>
              <p><em>ViññÄ�á¹‡a</em> non-manifest<br> Infinite, radiant all-round<br> There water and earth<br> fire, air do not find a footing</p>
              <p><em>Ettha dÄ«ghañca rassañca, </em><br> <em>Aá¹‡uá¹ƒ thÅ«laá¹ƒ subhÄ�subhaá¹ƒ; </em><br> <em>Ettha nÄ�mañca rÅ«pañca, </em><br> <em>Asesaá¹ƒ uparujjhati; </em><br> <em>ViññÄ�á¹‡assa nirodhena, </em><br> <em>Etthetaá¹ƒ uparujjhatÄ«’”ti.</em></p>
              <p>There does long and short<br> Small, gross, fair and ugly,<br> There does name and form<br> Without remainder cease:<br> With the cessation of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em><br> There this ceases.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The problem is not so much the interpretation of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> as 
                      such, but the syntax of the verses – which is one reason why poetry 
                      should not decide doctrine. The Buddha rephrases the original question, 
                      but his rephrasing has three question words and two verbs. It may be 
                      read as a single complex question, but this assumes that the two verbs 
                      mean the same thing (which they don’t: <em>na gÄ�dhati</em> means ‘does not find a firm footing’, like a man crossing a ford, while <em>uparujjhati</em> means ‘ceases’) – and that <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> means ‘infinite consciousness of Nibbana’ in the first occurrence and ‘separative sense consciousness’ in the second.</p>
              <p>It is simpler and more natural to read the verses as asking two questions, with the verb <em>uparujjhati</em> (ceases) acting as a ‘lamp’ to apply to both the preceding clauses. In 
                      that case the syntax of the answer would be expressed thusly:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Water, earth, fire, air do not find a footing in <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> that is non-manifest, infinite, radiant all-round.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>(i.e., the four material elements cease temporarily in the formless 
                      attainments, which is the highest reach of the Brahmanical teachings – 
                      even this much Brahma, being a deity of the form realm, did not know.)</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Long and short, small, gross, fair and ugly, name and form cease without remainder with the cessation of <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a.</em> This is where this all ceases.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>(i.e., the Buddha’s real teaching is not to temporarily escape 
                      materiality, but to reach an ending of suffering. And since all forms of
                       <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a</em> (<em>yaá¹� kiñci viññÄ�á¹‡aá¹�</em>…) are said countless times to be suffering, even the infinite consciousness has to go.)</p>
              <p>In this reading, the reason for the Buddha’s reformulation of the 
                      original question becomes clear. The errant monk had asked where the 
                      ending of the four elements was – which is of course the formless 
                      attainments. But the Buddha said the question was wrongly put, as this 
                      would merely lead beyond the form realm of Brahma to the formless 
                      realms. The real question is what lies beyond that, with the cessation 
                      of consciousness. It is not enough for matter to be transcended, one 
                      must also transcend mind as well. If not, one ends up, apart from all 
                      the other philosophical problems, with a mind/body dualism.</p>
              <p>And one ends up with a description of the Buddhist goal which is not 
                      merely indistinguishable from the Brahmanical Higher Self, but is quite 
                      evidently the same thing. A description that was meant to critique the 
                      inadequate conception of the Brahmanical goal is turned into a 
                      description of the Buddhist goal. Meanwhile, the hundreds of times when 
                      the Buddha explicitly and definitively refuted this idea (<em>viññÄ�á¹‡aá¹� aniccaá¹�</em>…) are explained away with a trivial etymological mistake. And so it goes…</p>

This clinging and craving bring to us a great deal of pain, suffering and stress and also at time some happiness and satisfaction as well, but always never on a permanent basis. In short, the state of Nibbana is arrived at when this false notion of ‘Self’ is abandoned. Of course, as a person we will still continue to exist until our parinibbana. </span></span></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>When worldly people see existence, they think that there is a real existence. When they see cessation, they think that it has really ceased. This is the perverted view of the two extremes. By compassion the Enlightened Ones, when they see Dharma arising, know that it is not nothingness, while at the same time not becoming attached to it as something real. When they see the Dharma disappear, they do not become attached to its extinction nor at the same time do they think that the extinction is real and means nothing at all. This is because, according to the Law of Dependent Origination, when there is a cause there will be an effect. When the cause ceases, the effect ceases. The Dharma is alive. It can exist or cease, rise or fall. If it is something real that has a permanent identity, then it should not cease and become extinct. If it is nothing, then it should not rise and exist. The Dharma rises and ceases, it can exist and become extinct. If we investigate the core of all things, we will realize that everything is conditioned and has empirical names. Things have<strong> no permanent identity</strong>, existence, extinction, rise or fall. Their nature is empty and silent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, when we talk about emptiness, we do not deny the rising, falling, existence and extinction of all phenomena. In fact, emptiness explains the truth of rising, falling, existence and extinction. This is the main teaching of the Tathagatha. Do not misunderstand Circulation and Cessation as two separate identities. From these Laws of Circulation and Cessation, we can see the creation and extinction, rising and falling of all phenomena and hence realize the truth of emptiness in all things. This is the Principle of Emptiness of the Middle Path, the ultimate explanation of the Middle Path. It is also the special characteristic of Buddhism — the Truth of Emptiness and of Dependent Origination. This is also "the immediate moment is empty" that is always mentioned by Mahayana scholars.</p>
              <p>....</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">From the rising and falling, existence and extinction of 
              conditioned phenomena, one should<strong> eliminate the idea of an absolute, 
              independent, permanent identity.</strong> Once we are able to realize the nature of 
              emptiness, we will be liberated. To realize the nature of emptiness through the 
              understanding of Dependent Origination is a penetration to the core of things. 
              It is not a superficial understanding only. This is the truth of the Buddha’s 
              explanation of the Circulation and Cessation of human life. It can be used to 
              identify our own religion, and to distinguish it from the other religions. This 
              is the speciality of Buddhism.</span></p>
