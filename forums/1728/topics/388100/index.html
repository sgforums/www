              <p>Mahayana and Vajrayana do 'chao du'. I don't know whether Theravada do chao du or not, but dedication of merits, whether through chanting, dana (giving), etc, is common to all traditions. It is in hope that the merits dedicated will have a positive effect on the person's rebirth into a better realm.</p>
              <p>Goddess of Mercy in Buddhism is not a goddess, but a Bodhisattva. He/She known as Guan Yin Pu Sa, is not a goddess, because goddess and gods are still beings in samsara and subject to suffering and cycles of rebirth.</p>
              <p>Guan Yin is already above rebirth but she can emanate out of her powers to lead people to enlightenment. He/She is not limited to any particular form, though in China she is depicted as female, in Tibet he is depicted as male, (because Guan Yin manifest in different ways to different people) and can manifest in countless other non-human forms as well.</p>
              <p>Pure Land is not a heaven, because heaven are still part of the 6 realms of samsara.</p>
              <p>The 6 realms:</p>
              <p>3 lower realms: hell, ghost, animal</p>
              <p>3 higher realms: asura, human, deva/heaven</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beings from hell to heaven are still subject to rebirth and suffering. Even if heaven is pleasurable, after their long lifespan finish they still will reborn again, possibly in lower realms.</p>
              <p>Pure Land is different, it is not a heaven purely for enjoyment but a manifestation by Amitabha to create a conducive environment for beings to attain enlightenment.</p>

              <p>What Buddha taught is the nature of phenomena, and the very fact that all phenomena continue to be impermanent after Buddhism dies out testifies to the fact that the nature of phenomena is eternal. Also, Buddha-Nature is not a static thing. As Zen Master Dogen says, Impermanence is Buddha-Nature.</p>

              <p>What Buddha taught is the nature of phenomena, and the very fact that all phenomena continue to be impermanent after Buddhism dies out testifies to the fact that the nature of phenomena is eternal. Also, Buddha-Nature is not a static thing. As Zen Master Dogen says, Impermanence is Buddha-Nature.</p>
              <p>I keep erasing your post because of your blatant disrespect for Buddhism and Buddhists here, and your posts' contribution to the topic title is always basically 0, and you often suffer from delusion of grandeur as shown in your current post.</p>
              <p>Basically, you are not interested in constructive discussion, only trolling, and hence your posts are always of no value at all and I will delete them anytime.</p>

              <p>This is not a hearsay but the person directly involved (the piano teacher) told me her father's story.</p>
              <p>My nephew's piano teacher comes from a Christian family, her father was a Christian since young. After her father passed away (more than 49 days), she saw her father's spirit in her house. Luckily one of her mother's friend who is a Buddhist advised them to chao du. One night, she saw a ray of bright light flowing out from her house. Since then, she did not see her father's spirit. She and her mother are Buddhists now.</p>
              <p>I believed her story because there is no reason for a Christian to tell me this kind of story.</p>

              <p>Assuming you have encountered stupidity in Buddhism, that you have read any Buddhist literature that directly requires minds to be closed, or inadvertently caused people's minds to be closed. This would have been a revelation! If you are kind enough, I am willing to take a look at it! </p>
