              Aren’t in Conflict—They’re Doing Different Things</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">November 28, 2016 Arpan
              Bhattacharyya Big Think </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Commonplace critiques of religions conflicting with science
              do not stand up to scrutiny when applied to Buddhism. Rather, science and
              Buddhism embody processes that aim to understand fundamentally different
              things, with neither requiring the blind faith of practitioners.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Few are as qualified to discuss the differences between
              science and Buddhism than Matthieu Ricard. The son of the renowned French
              philosopher Jean-François Revel and the painter Yahne Le Toumelin, Ricard had
              an intellectually and culturally dynamic upbringing. As a young man, he worked
              with the Nobel Prize-winning scientists François Jacob and Jacques Monod and
              earned a PhD in molecular biology. Then, he abruptly left academia to study
              with Buddhist teachers in India and Tibet. Now, he is a Buddhist monk and the
              French interpreter for the Dalai Lama. He has become popular as a speaker and
              as a writer who teaches about Buddhist ideas, mindfulness practices, and
              meditation. Through the popularization of his work, he has earned the
              nickname “happiest person in the world.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ricard discusses supposed conflicts between Buddhism and
              western conceptions of life, spirituality, and knowledge in a book co-written
              in dialogue-form with his father titled The Monk and the Philosopher. Much of
              the second chapter—“Religion or Philosophy?”—is spent navigating tensions
              between Buddhism and science and negotiating the role of faith (or lack
              thereof) in Buddhism. Some of the concerns raised by Revel are Buddhists’
              belief in the self being illusory, Buddhist ideas regarding consciousness,
              claims made by Buddhists that elude the scientific method, and practitioners’
              need for “blind faith.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To make sense of criticisms made against Buddhism, it is
              helpful to understand the heart of many Buddhist teachings. During an abstract
              discussion of the nature of consciousness and the self, Ricard provides a brief
              overview:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There’s a natural feeling of self, of ‘I’, which makes you
              think ‘I’m cold, I’m hungry, I’m walking’, and so forth. By itself, that
              feeling is neutral. It doesn’t specifically lead to either happiness or
              suffering. But then comes the idea that the self is a kind of constant that
              lasts all your life, regardless of all the physical and mental changes you go
              through. You get attached to the idea of being a self, ‘myself’, a ‘person’,
              and of ‘my’ body, ‘my’ name, ‘my’ mind, and so on. Buddhism accepts that there
              is a continuum of consciousness, but denies any existence of a solid,
              permanent, and autonomous self anywhere in that continuum. The essence of
              Buddhist practice is therefore to get rid of that illusion of a self which so
              falsifies our worldview. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The essence of Buddhism, according to Ricard, is to reduce
              suffering through realizing misconceptions about the nature of ourselves and of
              the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ricard’s description of Buddhism, as rendered above, may seem
              utterly farfetched and unscientific. Being Buddhist seems to require both a
              belief in the absence of a nonmaterial “self” and a belief in a “continuum of
              consciousness” that is beyond our individual bodies. On the surface, this may
              seem not only esoteric but also about as unscientific as one can get. And all
              this from an accomplished biologist, no less! Understandably, then, Revel has
              difficulty accepting or understanding what Ricard means and how his claims
              could be justified. He asks, for instance, how one could identify the kind of
              consciousness that he describes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ricard responds to the questions of how Buddhists can justify
              claims about the nature the self and consciousness by describing their approach
              in contradistinction to that of scientists. He explains:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The problem here is one of methodology. From a scientific
              point of view, an experiment is said to be valid if it can be reproduced by
              other experimenters. It’s presumed that the same means of investigation are
              available to all concerned…But when it’s a question of training the mind, it’s
              much more difficult to recognize any results and to acknowledge that it might
              be possible to attain a degree of mastery over the mind just as exceptional as
              the physical mastery of an athlete.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The spiritual investigations of Buddhism, as Ricard
              described, neither contradict nor conflict with the process of scientific
              inquiry. Rather, their respective subjects necessitate different methodologies.
              Kadam Morten Clausen, a spiritual teacher in New York, puts it another way and
              describes Buddhism as a “science of the mind” in which “you’re the scientist.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> One might accept that spiritual inquiry and scientific
              inquiry are distinct and still question whether Buddhist monks like Ricard and
              his teachers ought to be given any credence with respect to the latter. Indeed,
              deferring to Buddhist teachers for spiritual guidance may seem like embracing
              the same kind of faith that critics of other religious traditions resist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In response to such concerns, Ricard distinguishes such blind
              faith from a reasonable kind of trust. Reflecting on his experiences studying
              and practicing with numerous lamas, Ricard describes:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">How can we be sure of their accounts? By means of indirect
              evidence, and evaluating all sides of their character. There’s no smoke without
              fire. I spent twenty years with some of these teachers who say that there is a
              nonmaterial consciousness and that it is possible to perceive another being’s
              stream of consciousness. These are people I never heard lying, who never misled
              anyone, in whom I never detected the slightest harmful thought, word, or deed
              against anyone. To believe what they say therefore seems more reasonable to me
              than to come to the conclusion that they’re telling tall stories.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ricard observes that committed practitioners of Buddhism have
              hardly any plausible reasons to lie about their experiences. Furthermore, many
              of their experiences and insights have been similar and consistent for
              thousands of years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Indeed, Ricard suggests that the kind of “faith” or trust is
              consistent with how individuals negotiate their daily lives as well as
              scientific findings. Hey notes:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">[I]n everyday life, we’re continually being impregnated with
              ideas and beliefs that we take as true because we accept the competence of
              those who provide the information. They know what they’re doing, it works, so
              it must be true. That’s where confidence comes in. But most of use would be
              incapable of proving scientific truths by ourselves. Quite often, too, such
              beliefs – like that of the atom seen as tiny solid particles orbiting an atomic
              nucleus – continue to influence people’s views of things long after they’ve
              been abandoned by the scientists themselves. We’re ready to believe anything
              we’re told as long as it corresponds to an accepted view of the world, and to
              be suspicious of anything that doesn’t. In the case of the contemplative
              approach, the doubt that many of our contemporaries feel about spiritual values
              is due to the fact that they haven’t put them into practice.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The kind of confidence Ricard has in Buddhist teachers under
              whom he studied is comparable to the confidence many have in scientists whose
              research they neither witnessed nor necessarily understood. Such trust – as
              opposed to mere faith – provides structure and direction into our own inquiries
              and journeys. For those inclined to investigate their own mind, then, taking a
              cue from some Buddhist monks and nuns may well be a good way to start. </span></p>
