On the Buddhist path to Emancipation, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">each individual is considered responsible for his own fortunes and misfortunes. Each individual is expected to work his own deliverance by his understanding and effort.</span> Buddhist salvation is the result of one's own moral development and can neither be imposed nor granted to one by some external agent. The Buddha's mission was to enlighten men as to the nature of existence and to advise them how best to act for their own happiness and for the benefit of others<br><br>Consequently, <strong>Buddhist ethics are not founded on any commandments </strong>which men are compelled to follow. The Buddha advised men on the conditions which were most wholesome and conducive to long term benefit for self and others. <strong>Rather than addressing sinners with such words as 'shameful', 'wicked', 'wretched', 'unworthy', and 'blasphemous' He would merely say, 'You are unwise in acting in such a way since this will bring sorrow upon yourselves and others.' </strong><br><br><strong>BTW</strong> Did u read up the info provided by <strong>An Eternal Now</strong>.<br>Have u by  now understand why buddhism reject the theory of soul?<br><br>Well my fren we would like to share wf u and try to clear all ur doubts &amp; misconception as possible as we can.<br><br>may u be happy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
