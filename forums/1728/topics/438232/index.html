              <p>I think it's necessary to explain some basic meanings of buddhist rituals, esp. for those beginners who are into buddhism.</p>
              <p>In
                                                               making offerings to the Buddha, most buddhist will probably know you 
                                                              need to burn 3 incense, make two palms together and then make 3 kowtows.
                                                               In modern times, some buddhist temples have reduced to 1 incense partly
                                                               due to reasons of environmental protection. However, in most dharma 
                                                              services, the tradition is still 3 incense.</p>
              <p>Not all buddhist know the significant meaning about the 3 incense, palms together and 3 kowtows. Let me explain.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3 Incense</strong></span></p>
              <p>In Mahayana Buddhist practice, the 3 incense represents "<strong>Precepts incense</strong>" (æˆ’é¦™ï¼‰, "<strong>Concentration Incense</strong>" (å®šé¦™ï¼‰and "<strong>Wisdom Incense</strong>"
                                                               ï¼ˆæ…§é¦™ï¼‰. It coincides with Mahayana Buddhist's spiritual practice towards 
                                                              enlightenment, particularly the 3 learning ä¸‰å­¸ï¼šPrecepts 
                                                              (æˆ’ï¼‰ï¼Œã€€Concentration (å®šï¼‰, Wisdom (æ…§ï¼‰. Precepts are laid down to cut off 
                                                              all evils, to prevent bad karma from rising, to purify bad karma, in 
                                                              order for one's Bodhicitta to develop and for good karma to arise. If a 
                                                              person's mind is full of impediments and bad karma, it will continue to 
                                                              create obstacle to a person's spiritual practice, it will continue to 
                                                              create trouble and sufferings for him. With such obstacles and bad karma
                                                               in a person, a person will not be able to subdue his own mind, let 
                                                              alone develop concentration. Therefore, beginners in buddhism typically 
                                                              focus on practising precepts to prevent bad karma from rising, to cut 
                                                              off all evil, to allow all good karma to rise up. And without creating 
                                                              any more bad karma, a bodhicitta pure mind can progress towards the next
                                                               stage (particular in meditation) such as concentration (at the 
                                                              intermediate level) and the last stage wisdom (at the more advanced 
                                                              level) as the highest level of full enlightenment.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Palms Together (å�ˆå��</strong>ï¼‰</span></p>
              <p>Holding
                                                               two palms together. The Chinese buddhist term for this is called "<strong>He Shi å�ˆå��</strong>" (literally "10 
                                                              together") represents putting 10 fingers together. Typically, it's 
                                                              angled about 45 degree to the body.  Palms together is not just a 
                                                              typical ritual in making offerings to the Buddha, it's also a typical 
                                                              practice of greeting amongst buddhists, to venerables, to buddhist 
                                                              masters etc.</p>
              <p>It has an internal effect of subduing one's internal
                                                               mind and creates an impression of peace and humility. When we feel 
                                                              nervous, trouble, angry, holding the palms together allow us to feel 
                                                              internal peace, serenity and mind concentration. Although it looks 
                                                              simple, it is known in Buddhism to able to subdue a troubled mind.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Palms on top of each other (æ“�æ‰‹ï¼‰</strong></span></p>

                                                               involves putting two palms horizontally on top of each other and known in Chinese as "<strong>Chao Shou æ“�æ‰‹</strong> " In common
                                                               practice, the right palm should be on top of the left palm, with both palms facing top. The two 
                                                              palms should be put around the front of abdomen. The position should be 
                                                              in a relaxed position.</p>
              <p>This is a common practice in dharma 
                                                              services, sometimes in chanting, but usually after chanting esp. when 
                                                              listening to venerable's talk (known as Kai Shi é–‹ç¤º in Chinese). It has 
                                                              an effect of remaining calm and relaxation.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ritual of Finger tips (triangular position/shape) on head (å•�è¨Šï¼‰</strong></span></p>
              <p>The Chinese buddhist term for this ritual is called "<strong>Wen Xun å•�è¨Š</strong>"</p>
              <p>First of all, put your two palms together but focus your eye attention on your finger tips. Then bow 90 degree
                                                               together (without kneeling down) to the Buddha with your two palms 
                                                              together. However when you come up, you need to change your palm signs. 
                                                              Basically,  the thumb and 2nd finger of each left and right hand palm should form a triangular position/shape). The rests of other fingers should laid one after each other.</p>
              <p>This
                                                               palm position signifies the meaning of a lotus flower waiting to be 
                                                              blossom (it's shaped like a lotus flower), just like offering flowers to
                                                               the Buddha and Bodhisttava.</p>
              <p>When you rise up, put through your 
                                                              chest and rise your triangular palm signs on top of your head to your 
                                                              eye brow, but not touching the forehead. This presents offering to the 
                                                              buddha and bodhisattva to the top and is a form of respect, reverence 
                                                              and humbleness.</p>
              <p>After this, slowly raise your palm back to the chest position and then change it to the palms together position.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3 kowtows (æ‹œä½›ï¼�ç¦®ä½›ï¼‰</span><br> </strong></p>
              <p>The entire ritual of kowtow in Chinese Buddhism is known as "<strong>bai fo æ‹œä½›ï¼�li foç¦®ä½›" (pay respect to Buddha/offering to Buddha) <br></strong></p>
              <p>Kowtows (ç£•é ­ï¼‰ involve palms together, two legs slowly together 
                                                              (forming the Chinese word å…« shape). The distance between the legs should
                                                               be around 5 cm. One then slowly kneel onto the ground. The right hand 
                                                              should touch the ground first followed by the left hand, then let your

                                                              your knee should not move. Slowly let your head your head and hands down

              <p>In common practice, it's 3 kowtows to the Buddha.</p>
              <p>The 3 kowtows to the Buddha typically means the following:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1st kowtow </span>- <em>pay respect to the Buddha</em></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2nd kowtow</span> - <em>seek refuge in Buddhism and express the wish to learn the dharma from the Buddha</em></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3rd kowtow </span>- <em>repentence for one's own wrong-doing, past bad karma and vow never to commit any more evils.</em></p>

              <p>Dedicating merits usually come in the form of a verse where one chants after chanting. A common verse is as follow:</p>
              <p><span class="st"><em>æ„¿ä»¥æ­¤åŠŸå¾·</em>ï¼Œåº„ä¸¥ä½›å‡€åœŸã€‚ </span></p>

              <p><span class="st">è‹¥æœ‰è§�é—»è€…ï¼Œæ‚‰å�‘è�©æ��å¿ƒã€‚ </span></p>

              <p>Translation:</p>
              <p><em>May I dedicate my good merits, to dignifiy the buddha pureland <br> </em></p>
              <p><em>To repay the 4 kindness on top, to save the 3 sufferings below</em></p>
              <p><em>If any person hear this, may one vow a mind of bodhicitta</em></p>
              <p><em>With this, I repay my body, to be born together in the pureland</em></p>
              <p>Some verse can simply be:</p>
              <p><span class="st"><em>æ„¿ä»¥æ­¤åŠŸå¾·ï¼Œã€€å›žå�‘çµ¦ã€€....(name of person)</em></span></p>
              <p>May I dedicate this good merits to ....name of person</p>
              <p>Dedicating merits can be categorized into common (<span class="st"><em>ä¸€èˆ¬å›žå�‘ï¼‰</em></span>, personalã€€ï¼ˆå€‹äºº<span class="st"><em>å›žå�‘ï¼‰</em></span>, greatï¼ˆå¤§<span class="st"><em>å›žå�‘ï¼‰</em></span>,

                                                              dedicating merits typically involve  great and mass dedication. Common 
                                                              dedication of merits is usually used for common merits. Personal dedication is 
                                                              individual dedication of merits to a particular person, to past debtors,
                                                               karmic haters of you, to diminish disaster, to someone who is suffering
                                                               etc. Great dedication involves massing all the powers of compassion and vows 
                                                              together to dedicate for all the sentient beings. Mass dedication basically 
                                                              follows the dedication of Samanthabra Bodhsittavaã€€æ™®è³¢è�©è–© (symbolizing 
                                                              great action) to all sentient beings. Final dedication is the last stage
                                                               of dedication, usually done at the end of big dharma services and sometimes 
                                                              held at the end of year in buddhist temples.</p>

              <p>Just to further explain the following text:</p>
              <p><span>ä¸ŠæŠ¥<strong>å››é‡�æ�©</strong>ï¼Œä¸‹æµŽ<strong>ä¸‰é€”è‹¦</strong>ã€‚</span></p>

                                                                                      below. This is a common text at the end of Mahayana sutra chanting, esp. in dedicating merits.<br></em></p>
              <p>What does <span>å››é‡�æ�© (4 kindness/favour) and </span><span>ä¸‰é€”è‹¦ (3 sufferings) mean? </span></p>
              <p><span>In Chinese Mahayana buddhism, the  </span><span>å››é‡�æ�© "</span><span>4 kindness" (favours) refers to the kindness that you receive in your realm of humans (i.e. in your present life). They result in what you're today:</span></p>
              <p>1. Parent's Kindness çˆ¶æ¯�æ�©</p>
              <p>2. Country's Kindness åœ‹å®¶æ�©</p>
              <p>3. All Sentient Being's Kindness è¡†ç”Ÿæ�©</p>
              <p>2. Triple Gem (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha)'s kindness ä¸‰å¯³æ�©</p>
              <p>Mahayana Buddhist typically tries to practise gratitude (thankfulness) æ„Ÿæ�© by repaying back the 4 kindness received. For parents, it's a practice of filial piety. For country, it's a practice of loyalty. For all sentient beings, it's a practice of compassion. For triple gem, it's a practice of devotion and respect.</p>
              <p><span>The 3 sufferings ä¸‰é€”è‹¦ refers to the sufferings in the 3 lower realms of existence such as realm of animals, realm of hungry ghost, realm of hell.  Mahayana buddhist typically also tries to practise helping the sentient beings in these 3 realms relieve their sufferings, as their sufferings are even greater and more painful than that in the realm of humans. It's part of the compassion practice in the buddhist daily life. </span></p>
              <p><span>Many dharma services in temples generally serve the purposes of relieving the sufferings in the lower realms (or in fact the 6 realms of existence). One example of a dharma service held in many buddhist temples that help to relieve the sufferings in the realms of hell and hungry ghost is the <em>Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Dharma Service (åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è–©æ³•æœƒï¼‰- usually held during the Hungry ghost festivals (Ullambama festival). </em>Another big major dharma service held once a year in many buddhist temples  is the <em>Dharma Service of Land and Water æ°´é™¸æ³•æœƒ (in fact it's the largest dharma service in Chinese mahayana Buddhism). </em> They are done to relieve the sufferings for the sentient beings in all realms of existence. <br></span></p>

              <p>According to buddhism study, é˜¿éš¾é—®äº‹ä½›å�‰å‡¶ç»�is extremely delightful for beginner. Buddhists should not be overwhelm by mundane environmentlist. Being vegetarian, compassion and love is true enviromentalists.  Vegetarian is also in line with the compassion of all religions, vegetarianism / veganism society for world peace.   é˜¿éš¾é—®äº‹ä½›å�‰å‡¶ç»� is the basic and supreme for all buddhsts, it goes beyond logic while in logic, it goes beyond love while in love. It does eliminate the fear on the dichotomy emtreme between fear and love in mayan 2012, and reasearch had shown that only love and meditation save the solar sysyem in mayan astronomical study. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc-55p1Al9k&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddha sakyamuni personally did not hold incense sticks.  Incense burning was from å¤–é�“then which buddha skilfully applied the true objective of incense burning in the form of teaching to liberate them. As human tend to attach on rituals regardlessly, it did serve to remind them on the right perception of incense burning then. Optimusly dharma lecture,  meditation and nianfo are key tenets to wellness. Rituals are s expediency and secondary, it is to draw heart into concentration as Buddha did to the å¤–é�“then.

              <p>Usually, it's one time é—®è®¯ (wenxun) followed by 3 kowtows and then  é—®è®¯ (wenxun) again.</p>
