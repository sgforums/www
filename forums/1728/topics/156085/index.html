            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>What do you guys think of the potential of Buddhist Uniformed CCA groups in spore schools. Primary and secondary schools to be exact.<br><br>From what little I notice, Buddhists are increasingly looking forward to other religions, esp Christianity in devising methods to spread the Dhamma. This is what we have currently<br><br>1. Youth Ministries / Divisions belonging to specific Buddhist centers<br>2. Buddhist Societies (BS) in tertiary institutions<br><br>If we look at Boys Brigade, Girl Guides and Pari Rovers they are fundamentally still Christian and for more or less, religious studies are still conducted within these groups. We can learn from them the good points and model it to something that is more Buddhism<br><br>So why not a Buddhist Uniformed Group? It will open a new channel for Buddhism to spread into spore youths. And hopefully it can make its way into non-Buddhist schools and appeal to non-Buddhist to come and learn the Dhamma. And eventually make it internationally available<br><br>According to a survey by the Malaysian Buddhist Missionary Society the  No.1 reason that cause the decline in Buddhist population is "Lack of opportunity to study Buddhism". Followed by "Passive Missionary Work". The survey targeted Buddhist youths age b/w 20 to 25<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

And even if its not a uniformed group, why not a BS at secondary level? Turn it into something that relies on less fund. Refer to the Di Zang Sutra for a list of what layman can do.<br><br><blockquote><br>unless u can raise up a big amount of $ and many excellent teacher over there which i think it is hard<br></blockquote>Walking the Bodhi Path is much more difficult than that. But have you given up? I'm sure you are also steadfast on the Buddha's words.<br><br>Refer to the Lotus Sutra Chapter 14. An Le Xing Pin. It details out how we, as Layman should conduct ourselves so as to spur others to earness into Buddhahood.<br><br><blockquote><br>many of my fren who are Buddhist practitioner and join the teaching career ,were sent to christian school or mission school<br></blockquote>They can contribute not as teachers then, but as individuals who do behind the scene planning and sai kang warriors.<br><br><blockquote><br>understand MOE first b4 we look at this issue ....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></blockquote>Understanding ourselves is more important than understanding the outside world.<br><br>And MOE is tolerant to religious pursuits after curiculum hours.<br><br>Imho, SAF is much much worst than MOE. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> And yet so many of us actually survived that. I myself left SAF with a perm injury but I still love my country and would still defend it when the need arise.<br><br>Futhermore refer to Lotus Sutra Chapter 14 An Le Xin Pin or Chapter 25 Pu Men Pin (GuanYin Pusa). It covers how the Bodhisattva should conduct when dealing with kings, governmental officials and other people of different social status, professions, thinking and habits<br><br>Pratising Buddhism means overcoming ourselves. Adverse conditions are very much needed for spiritual improvement. The Bodhisattva never gives up during difficult times. And is ever earness in subdueing his own mind and benefitting others. With this common compassion, the Bodhisattva yearns for common Attaintment with all.</div>
