              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Eunsahn Citta 24 September
              2017 progressive buddhism</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              don't pretend to understand all the nuances of whatever the circumstances
              regarding Myanmar, Rakhine state, or the Rohingya. My bet is that among the
              many people who have an opinion about this don't know anything more than what
              they've read on the internet. I'm curious about how many could find Myanmar on
              a map or could give its former name. This piece in fact, only tangentially
              involves that situation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              this does involve is the drum beating about “Buddhist Violence” and “Buddhist
              Terrorism,” and the assumptions behind that. Western Buddhists (at least the
              most visible ones) seem to think that these “other” Buddhists should “know
              better.” We seem to have an odd attitude about our quaint little fellow
              Buddhists on the other side of the world, as if we have a better handle on the
              Buddha’s teachings than they do. To be charitable, let's call it the “zeal of
              the convert.” To be less charitable, it's another example of Western
              Superiority, of neo-colonialism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I'll
              make a few broad statements here: countries tend to have armies. Armies tend to
              be armed with weapons. Weapons used by armies by definition are implements
              designed to inflict harm upon another person. Even “majority Buddhist”
              countries have armies, and they're armed with weapons. And their having weapons
              implies that their intent is that they will be used either defensively or
              offensively, to inflict harm on other people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Without
              going too deeply into history, Buddhists have used weapons against other
              Buddhists and non-Buddhists. I tried looking up some facts about South and East
              Asian wars just since 1900, and the list was lengthy to say the least. Overall,
              a good number of these countries have at one point or another been ruled by
              “military dictatorships,” which is a euphemistic way of saying, “Fellow
              countrymen, agree, submit, or die.” In some cases, this was extended to
              “Conquered countrymen…” sometimes to “Invader…”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              no particular order, there were wars between the Japanese and Russians, Chinese
              against other Chinese, Koreans against Koreans, Koreans against Japanese,
              Chinese against Japanese, indochinese against Japanese, Vietnamese against
              Vietnamese, Cambodian against Cambodian, Laotian against Laotian, Burmese
              against Burmese, Sri Lankan against Sri Lankan, Thai on Thai, Chinese against
              Tibetan, Nepalese against Nepalese, Bhutanese against Bhutanese, and any number
              of the above against ethnic minorities and/or separatists within their own
              borders, and seemingly everyone against the French, British, and/or Americans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That
              long sentence should point out that the “peaceful Buddhist” is an illusion. To
              return to Myanmar/Burma for a moment, think back to how “brutal” the military
              dictatorship was, as seen in the film Beyond Rangoon, pretty ruthless. It
              shouldn't be too much of a stretch to think that they're not “over it,” or more
              or less Buddhist than they ever were. Admittedly, I'm curious about what Suttas
              Ashin Wirathu and the 969 Movement read that said that inciting violence was a
              good idea, but I also look at them as representative of the Monastic Order as
              the Westboro Baptist Church is of Christian churches.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Buddhism”
              as teaching is Lovingkindness, Joy, Equanimity, and Compassion. “Buddhists” as
              humans, are as liable to hate, become violent, become enraged, and commit acts
              of violence as the rest of humanity. That doesn't mean when we see atrocities
              that we don't protest them or call the perpetrators on their deeds. But let's
              not do it out of some sense of superiority or stereotype. Let's do it not
              because we're Buddhists, but because that is a reflection of ALL beings’ True
              Nature, not just a “Peaceful Buddhist,” as if there was a monolithic, uniform
              “Peaceful Buddhist.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“....Subhuti,
              when I talk about the practice of transcendent patience, I do not hold onto any
              arbitrary conceptions about the phenomena of patience, I merely refer to it as
              the practice of transcendent patience. And why is that? Because when, thousands
              of lifetimes ago, the Prince of Kalinga severed the flesh from my limbs and my
              body I had no perception of a self, a being, a soul, or a universal self. If I
              had cherished any of these arbitrary notions at the time my limbs were being
              torn away, I would have fallen into anger and hatred.”</span></p>
