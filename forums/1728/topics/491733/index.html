              April 22nd the 2nd Race and Buddhism Conference will be held at Harvard
              Divinity School. This is a unique gathering of academics, dharma teachers and
              activists meeting to explore how engaged responses to the problems of racism
              within the dharma world can be developed, as well as how dharma can be a
              response to heal the pain and suffering that racism creates in a more general
              sense. On a personal level, this much needed conference will be a place through
              which I can continue to explore and share my responsibility to exercise a
              greater sense of inquiry to see where it is that I am operating from as a white
              vajrayana dharma teacher. This is also a way to continue in my relationship to
              exploring how to better remain open to others, and a way to continue to honor
              the engaged approach to practice demonstrated by my root teacher.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">My
              root teacher was a Sikkimese Tibetan Buddhist nun, who while well known to
              those who met her, was not well known by the common standards of measuring fame
              in the Buddhist world. She had no nunnery, although one was created in her
              memory posthumously, and she lived in a small apartment in Gangtok, Sikkim
              where she spent her time in semi-retreat, dedicated to her practice, and
              available to those who came to see her for instruction and clarification. She
              wasn’t always a nun, in fact she had a Master’s Degree in English Literature,
              was very cosmopolitan and was very much in love with the world. She was
              particularly in love with the dharma, very passionate about it in an engaged,
              individuated way. Like many a practitioner before her, she decided that after
              experiencing her share of suffering, to ordain as a Tibetan Buddhist nun and go
              into retreat. I came to learn that while there was an authentic experience of
              world-weariness that had been part of the reason for ordaining, much of what
              informed her decision was that as a lay Himalayan woman she was much less
              likely to receive the teachings that she desired and that even as an ordained
              nun it would be an uphill battle in some cases to receive the lineage teachings
              that she desired to connect with. Indeed, some years later, after she had taken
              me as a student and her health was declining rapidly, she told me, “you look at
              me and see a nun. I am not a nun.” I have to admit that at the time I was too
              enthusiastic and fastidious to understand what she was telling me, and that I
              had to go through my own process of struggling with my identity and practice to
              understand her. Ani Zangmo was not a nun, she appeared as one, but to hold onto
              that form was to brutally trap her, to deny her realization, and to classify
              her in a world of seemingly ever-shifting hierarchies and worldly knowledge
              that while useful for some things, often clouds our direct open experience of
              one another and the world around/within us. This was one pointing out
              instruction that was a time-release type of teaching, a seed that was slow to
              germinate and grow.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Ani
              Zangmo showed how the heart-practices of mahamudra and chöd are related to the
              reduction of the dissonance of biased perception. By directly confronting bias,
              becoming aware of it (through the matrix of shamatha/vipassana) and resting in
              where the experience of awareness of my particular racism, sexism, homophobia,
              classism, etc. arises, there is an opportunity to experience the clarity that
              underpins the emotional/conceptual anxiety/fear/ignorance of difference. When
              treated as temporary “adventious stains” upon the stainless mirror of the mind,
              to quote the 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje, in his<span> </span></span><em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Mahamudra Aspiriation Prayer</span></em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">, we are
              able to deeply engage this form of discursive ignorance without falling prey to
              over-identification or self-affirming identity in any particular direction.
              When we discuss the inequity, violence and lack of diversity within many
              sanghas across the country it is important to remember that we are discussing
              identity within a context that begs us to confront and give up self-cherishing,
              ego-clinging and patterned conceptuality. So how do we, as dharma communities
              do that? How do we hold the pain and suffering that arises simultaneously with
              the unchecked violence that occurs with unconscious, semi-conscious and
              deliberate bias? How do we simultaneously confront mindless aggression and
              allow for healing?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">During
              this conference Lama Rod Owens and I hope to workshop a tsok ritual that we are
              writing in collaboration towards, exploring the notion of feeding, pacifying
              and also subjugating the demons of racism using the metaphor of chöd and
              various protector practices. This is a means of engaging our tradition and
              bringing the practice techniques (and blessings) of White Tara and Tröma
              respectively to our own experiences of victim and oppressor so that we can
              further develop the ability to directly experience all beings for what they
              are: diverse reflections of awakened mind.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              am reminded of how issues around identity and representation are occasionally
              pushed aside by senior Tibetan Lineage holders as “American problems”, yet when
              we read the stories of why Arya Tara chose rebirth as a woman, or of the
              systemic prejudice that Machik Labdron had to endure as a woman and as a
              mother, and of how Phadampa Sangye was considered ugly because he was “dark
              skinned”, let alone the whiteness of our sanghas, and the unfair division of
              the genders, we see that these problems are neither ours alone, nor a result of
              a western emotional hypochondria, but rather human problems which are causes of
              (and rooted in) untold suffering. No one group holds the keys to the cessation
              of suffering more than anyone else, and we should heed the Tibetan proverbial
              warning to not hand over our “nose-rope” to another, including our teachers who
              might minimize the effects of racism, sexism and homophobia.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The
              wonderful beauty of the vajrayana tradition is it’s wide range of methods
              through which we can cut through our limited patterned thinking and gross
              habitual reactions to the world around us. However, it is up to us to make use
              of our tradition, to breathe fresh life, our own fresh life, into these
              practices. We must apply these practices to our individual locations in
              relation to power and oppression, anger and resentment, fear and anxiety and
              perhaps the most insidious problem of all, the terrible demon of spiritual
              bypassing, in order to reclaim our own authenticity. We owe it to ourselves to
              deeply engage our heart-practices as a way to begin to address the specificity
              of the serious problems surrounding racism within the Buddhist community.
              Inherent in this level of practice has to be an examination of how we fail to
              see others outside of our projections of who we believe them to be. For just as
              Ani Zangmo was not merely a ‘nun’, no one around us is merely the product of
              our patterned biased perceptions, even though we time and again fall prey to
              our temporary ignorance of the other.</span></p>

              hope to share portions of this tsok here as well as some of the larger
              takeaways from what looks to be a powerful gathering at Harvard Divinity School
              in the coming weeks.</span></p>
