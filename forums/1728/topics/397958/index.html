              <p> </p>
              <p>AHMEDABAD, India (AFP) - – A team of military doctors backed by India's national defence research centre is studying an 83-year-old holy man who claims to have spent seven decades surviving without food or water.</p>
              <p>The long-haired and bearded yogi, Prahlad Jani, has been sealed in a hospital in the western city of Ahmedabad where he is under 24-hour observation by 30 doctors and will be subjected to a series of medical tests.</p>
              <p>"The observation from this study may throw light on human survival without food and water," doctor G. Ilavazahagan, director of India's Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS), told AFP.</p>
              <p>The DIPAS is part of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, India's state defence and military research institute also behind a grenade packed with chilli powder that recently hit headlines.</p>
              <p>"This may help in working out strategies for survival during natural calamities, extreme stressful conditions and extra-terrestrial explorations like future missions to the Moon and Mars by the human race," Ilavazahagan said.</p>
              <p>The tests on Jani include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, measuring brain and heart activity with electrodes and other neuro-physiological studies, in addition to blood tests.</p>
              <p>The experiment started on April 22 and will take 15-20 days. Since the beginning, Jani has neither eaten nor drunk and has not been to the toilet, Ilavazahagan said.</p>
              <p>"The exercise of taking this yogi under the medical scanner is to understand what energy supports his existence," he added, explaining that soldiers could benefit from his apparent ability to survive.</p>
              <p>"Jani says he meditates to get energy. Our soldiers will not be able to meditate, but we would still like to find out more about the man and his body," he said.</p>
              <p>Neurologist Sudhir Shah, who studied Jani in 2003 and is part of the new experiment, said that the extremely skinny but apparently active man faced round-the-clock observation.</p>
              <p>"Two stationary 24-hour video cameras have been set up in his room, while a mobile video camera follows him whenever he needs to step outside," he said.</p>
              <p>Jani, who dresses in red and wears a nose ring, grew up in Charod village in the Mehsana district in Gujarat and claims to have been blessed by a goddess aged eight, which has enabled him to survive without sustenance.</p>
              <p>Shah said that Jani told him the key to his survival was a mystical and unexplained process by which he receives drops of water through a hole in his palate.</p>
              <p>Analysis of data, to determine his secret or expose his fraudulence, will take at least two months, the doctors said.</p>
              <p>Fasting is a part of Indian culture, made famous by independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, who brought himself to the brink of death on several occasions by refusing food and water to protest against colonial rule.</p>
              <p>A monk from India's minority Jain religion -- devout followers of which undertake frequent fasts, sometimes to death -- claims to have deprived himself of food for one year, which is believed to be a record</p>
              <p>"If you're busy with something you don't feel hunger, thirst, or the heat and cold," said Sri Sahaj Muni Maharaj, who took daily glasses of warm water during his fast which ended on May 1998.</p>
              <p>"I'm busy contemplating the infinite," he told India's Outlook magazine one month before the end of his experiment.</p>

              <p>Oh thanks for posting this up, I've been thinking of posting the article also. It's very interesting.</p>
              <p>There's a video report:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Hi Friends,<br> <br> I just came across this piece on BBC News' web site:<br> <br> A Hermit is admitted to hospital and being surveyed by medical doctors 
                  in India based on his claim that he has not had food nor water for no 
                  less than 70 years. I am sure many of you will also find this report 
                  intriguing:<br> <br> <a class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8652837.stm">http://news.bbc.co.u...sia/8652837.stm</a> <br> <br> For starters the doctors are impressed that he is so far 108 hours into 
                  his admission without ingestion, urination or defecation. Will be 
                  interesting to follow as more time goes by.<br> <br> The Hermit is said to be a Holy Man of the Jain Religion - anybody know 
                  much about this?<br> <br> Best regards,<br> -matt</p>

              <p>Reminds me of "Buddha Boy", a 16 year old boy who decided to enter a 6 year meditation retreat also without food, excretion, rest, etc. Just meditating all the way. Discovery Channel did a documentary on him and I recommend watching that, quite fascinating. He is many years into the retreat.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More recently, the Discovery Channel did record 
                  Bomjon's meditation on a 96-hours non-stop video, and for those total of
                   4 days, Bomjon didn't eat, drink, or move. Doctors interviewed in the 
                  documentary were stunned, and noted that for an explanation of Ram's 
                  activities, the science textbooks must be rewritten. The documentary was
                   later packed in the special show of 'The Boy with Divine Powers'.</p>

              <p>Leave the meat and vegetables at room temperature for 12 hours, you will notice meat will stink and decompose but vegetables will not. Thus, vegetables are better for health. Eating meat is like eating carcasses (corpses). Just to point out there is nothing wrong for your mum to be vegetarian.</p>
              <p>Animals have feelings like human beings, they also have organs and senses (eyes, nose, mouth e.t.c.) like human beings while bacteria and germs do not have.</p>
              <p>Eat less meat.</p>

              <p>The "best" buddhist diet is also about having a balanced diet and knowing what to include in your diets. For example cutting down on mock meat and taking in more vegetables because mock meat has literally nil nutrients.</p>
              <p>I guess the best diet is when you feel good abou it. Some people become a vegetarian because they wants to help reduce suffering of other animals. Being a vegetarian also helps to save the environment which is also a good thing esp nowadays...</p>
              <p>Consuming too much meat is not really healthy - when you eat the meat - you are also consuming toxic of the animals. When the animals are slaughtered, they also releasing a kind of body toxic due to experiencing tremendous stress before slaughter. .so in other words, you are also indirectly consuming the toxic chemical.</p>
              <p>Waybe you can negotiate with your mother. Just a note that buddha did not make it a compulsory for buddhist to be vegetarian though i will say it is highly encouraged.  </p>

              <p>AHMEDABAD, India (AFP) - – A team of military doctors backed by India's national defence research centre is studying an 83-year-old holy man who claims to have spent seven decades surviving without food or water.</p>
              <p>The long-haired and bearded yogi, Prahlad Jani, has been sealed in a hospital in the western city of Ahmedabad where he is under 24-hour observation by 30 doctors and will be subjected to a series of medical tests.</p>
              <p>"The observation from this study may throw light on human survival without food and water," doctor G. Ilavazahagan, director of India's Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS), told AFP.</p>
              <p>The DIPAS is part of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, India's state defence and military research institute also behind a grenade packed with chilli powder that recently hit headlines.</p>
              <p>"This may help in working out strategies for survival during natural calamities, extreme stressful conditions and extra-terrestrial explorations like future missions to the Moon and Mars by the human race," Ilavazahagan said.</p>
              <p>The tests on Jani include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, measuring brain and heart activity with electrodes and other neuro-physiological studies, in addition to blood tests.</p>
              <p>The experiment started on April 22 and will take 15-20 days. Since the beginning, Jani has neither eaten nor drunk and has not been to the toilet, Ilavazahagan said.</p>
              <p>"The exercise of taking this yogi under the medical scanner is to understand what energy supports his existence," he added, explaining that soldiers could benefit from his apparent ability to survive.</p>
              <p>"Jani says he meditates to get energy. Our soldiers will not be able to meditate, but we would still like to find out more about the man and his body," he said.</p>
              <p>Neurologist Sudhir Shah, who studied Jani in 2003 and is part of the new experiment, said that the extremely skinny but apparently active man faced round-the-clock observation.</p>
              <p>"Two stationary 24-hour video cameras have been set up in his room, while a mobile video camera follows him whenever he needs to step outside," he said.</p>
              <p>Jani, who dresses in red and wears a nose ring, grew up in Charod village in the Mehsana district in Gujarat and claims to have been blessed by a goddess aged eight, which has enabled him to survive without sustenance.</p>
              <p>Shah said that Jani told him the key to his survival was a mystical and unexplained process by which he receives drops of water through a hole in his palate.</p>
              <p>Analysis of data, to determine his secret or expose his fraudulence, will take at least two months, the doctors said.</p>
              <p>Fasting is a part of Indian culture, made famous by independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, who brought himself to the brink of death on several occasions by refusing food and water to protest against colonial rule.</p>
              <p>A monk from India's minority Jain religion -- devout followers of which undertake frequent fasts, sometimes to death -- claims to have deprived himself of food for one year, which is believed to be a record</p>
              <p>"If you're busy with something you don't feel hunger, thirst, or the heat and cold," said Sri Sahaj Muni Maharaj, who took daily glasses of warm water during his fast which ended on May 1998.</p>
              <p>"I'm busy contemplating the infinite," he told India's Outlook magazine one month before the end of his experiment.</p>
