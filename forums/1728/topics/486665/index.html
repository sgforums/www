                  is the thin edge of a wedge that, if inserted deeply enough into our minds,
                  will open them to wisdom. Whether or not this actually happens, however,
                  depends on various causes and conditions.</span></p>

                  say the process is natural and inevitable, that once the practice of
                  mindfulness is taken up its power of transformation is inexorable. This can
                  sound similar to the monkeys-and-typewriters theory, though, and indeed there
                  is usually a footnote in small print invoking countless lifetimes over multiple
                  aeons. Most others acknowledge that mindfulness is a tool whose effectiveness
                  requires such things as right view, diligent practice, long-term retreats, the
                  guidance of a good teacher, a strong ethical base, and a karmic, if not
                  genetic, predisposition for spiritual progress.</span></p>

                  is considerable enthusiasm for mindfulness these days, as long as it does not
                  threaten to make us wise. Corporate tycoons would like to bring mindfulness
                  into their world to help them achieve a competitive edge, as long as they do
                  not have to spend too much of their valuable time meditating, and only if they
                  can be reassured that they will not lose their killer instincts and get all
                  mushy and compassionate. And they are interested in training their workers in
                  mindfulness, as long as it makes employees more accepting about what they are
                  required to do and does not raise troublesome ethical questions or throw their
                  workers into a midlife crisis that leads them to drop out in order to do
                  something more meaningful with their lives.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>The
                  military are always likewise interested in producing a more effective soldier.
                  You have to be careful, though. I knew a guy who quit his job as a police
                  officer after getting involved with mindfulness meditation because he realized
                  that now he would hesitate to shoot if he had to draw his weapon. This was a
                  threat to his fellow officers, he knew, and so he resigned. His personal
                  transformation was part of a larger engagement with Buddhist thought and practice,
                  but still—if this is the effect of mindfulness training, it clearly will not do
                  for the armed forces. Yet we know how effective such training was for the
                  samurai, and ethical difficulties did not seem to intrude at the critical
                  moment when launching an offensive war in the middle of the last century.
                  Perhaps the wedge can be used to pry things open a little, without allowing the
                  process to go too far.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>When
                  “mindfulness” is defined in contrast to “mindlessness,” it roughly means
                  “attention,” and this is the sense in which the word is most commonly used
                  outside Buddhist circles these days. In an age when attention is a rare and
                  precious commodity, even as it is spread around so promiscuously, training in
                  attention skills is an understandably popular program. The ability to hold
                  awareness upon a chosen object with some stability or to return it to a primary
                  object once it has strayed, and to do so without agitation, self-blame, or
                  frustration, is a useful skill to learn. It is also the leading edge of the mindfulness
                  wedge as described in the classical Buddhist texts.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>But
                  the crux of mindfulness training is found in the chorus that repeats 16 times
                  in the brief <em>Satipatthana
                  Sutta</em>, “The Establishment of Mindfulness Discourse”: “One abides
                  independent, not clinging to anything in the world.” True mindfulness training
                  involves learning to entirely disengage from, disidentify with, and become
                  non-attached to the phenomena under review. Neither favoring nor opposing,
                  neither liking nor disliking, the Great Way is not difficult for one with no
                  preferences (to cite the later Chinese text <em>Trust in Mind</em>). Such disengagement is incompatible with
                  corporate, military, and many other secular applications of mindfulness
                  training, however, since it is the very move that opens the way for wisdom.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>The
                  mind is habitually caught up in some very deep reflexes of craving and
                  aversion. Wanting what pleases us and wanting to do away with what causes us
                  distress is part of a primordial operating system that has served all creatures
                  on this earth quite well for aeons. Buddhism is pointing to an evolutionary
                  step requiring us to abandon this reflex and replace it with a more mature
                  mental state: equanimity. Classical mindfulness, unlike popular mindfulness, is
                  all about the cultivation of equanimity. One is able to experience both
                  pleasure <em>and</em> pain without clinging to anything in the world. One can be aware of what is
                  gratifying <em>and</em> distressing, and still abide independent, not needing things to be other than
                  they are.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>According
                  to Buddhist analysis, reflexive craving and aversion keep us bound up with
                  suffering. Any moment of desire, by definition, is a moment of dissatisfaction,
                  because desire is an experience of lacking something. And the desire can never
                  be satisfied, for even when our wishes are granted it is always in the next
                  moment. Look for the truth of this in your own experience. Even when it feels
                  like we get what we want, we immediately worry it will slip away, yearn for
                  more of it, or move on to wanting the next thing.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>No amount
                  of attention training is going to help us escape this cycle. In fact,
                  incomplete mindfulness practice, focusing on attention but neglecting
                  equanimity and the insights it brings, may serve only to strengthen the bonds
                  that bind us. When King Menander asks about this, the sage Nagasena tells him,
                  “Goats, sheep, cows, buffalos, camels, and donkeys have attention, but they do
                  not have wisdom.” He goes on to offer this analogy: “As a barley-reaper grasps
                  a handful of barley in the left hand and a sickle in the right and cuts it off
                  with the sickle, even so does the earnest student, taking hold of the mind with
                  attention, cut off the defilements with wisdom” (<em>Milinda Panha</em> 2.1.7–8).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">Paying
                  close attention to what is happening under our gaze is an important first step,
                  but let’s not get stuck with a handful of barley and our backsides up in the
                  air. Attending with an unattached attitude that allows us to understand the
                  impermanent, interdependent, and selfless nature of it all is what cuts the
                  attachment and is truly transformative. Not everyone is ready for such a
                  transformation, so handle this tool with care.</span></p>
