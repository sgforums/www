                 Cao dai seems to match all religous practices in order to gain insight and their HQ is in vietnam, anyone knows about the religion, It was formed in 1920's and respect budhas, jesus, confucius...as their masters.

              <p>Interesting, but I find its description contradictory.</p>
              <p><em>According to Cao Dai, before God existed, there was the <a title="Tao" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">Tao</a>, that nameless, formless, unchanging, eternal source referenced in the <a title="Tao Te Ching" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">Tao Te Ching</a>. Then, a <a title="Big Bang" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">Big Bang</a> occurred, out of which <a title="God" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a> was born (<a title="Emanationism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanationism">emanationism</a>). The universe could not yet be formed and to do so, God created <a title="Yin and yang" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang">yin and yang</a>. He took control of yang and shed a part of himself, creating the <a title="Goddess" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddess">Goddess</a> to preside over yin. In the presence of yin and yang, the universe was
                  materialized. The Goddess is, literally, the mother of the myriad of
                  things in the Universe. Thus, Caodaiists worship not only God, the
                  father, but also the Goddess, literally refer to as the Mother <a title="Buddhahood" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhahood">Buddha</a>.
                  Note that God's importance and role is higher than that of the Mother
                  Buddha. Also, the Mother Buddha is male, as are all buddhas. The Mother
                  Buddha only oversees yin and is not a part of yin, which is female.</em></p>
              <p><em>There are 36 <a title="Plane (metaphysics)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28metaphysics%29">levels</a> of <a title="Heaven" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven">heaven</a> and 72 planets harboring intelligent life, with number one being the closest to heaven and 72 nearest to <a title="Hell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell">Hell</a>. Earth is number 68. It is said that even the lowest citizen on planet 67 would not trade place with a king on 68 and so forth.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First it says that there is this formless source, and then God emerges from this source. If God is the creator, and if he emerged from this source, then he can't be God. The formless source is the true God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, Buddhism cannot accept and does not believe in a personal creator.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding personal God does not exist according to Buddhism, I have posted this
                                          before regarding Buddhism and God (now updated a little):<br> <br> ------------------<br> <br> First of all Buddhism does not accept the Judeo-Christian or other
                                          theistic religions' idea that there is a personal Creator, means
                                          the Old Testament kind of God that has a personality of its own..
                                          and you can actually meet him up for coffee Mr. Green. If there is
                                          a personal Creator it brings a lot of questions into mind.
                                          Therefore, Albert Einstein supposedly said (though whether he
                                          really said it I do not know),<br> <br> "Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a
                                          cosmic religion for the future: it transcends a personal God,
                                          avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural &amp;
                                          spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the
                                          experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful
                                          unity"<br> <br> and..<br> <br> Â“If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific
                                          needs it would be Buddhism.Â”<br> <br> Regarding the question of Personal God in Buddhism,</p>
              <p><strong>Quote:</strong><br> Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br> <br> Slightly edited from the first topic in our forum regarding
                                          Creationism: How the Brahma believed He was God?<br> <br> In Buddha's days there were many many different teachings, one
                                          popular one was Brahmanism. In fact the Brahma was still worshipped
                                          nowadays. Brahma was known to be "The Supreme One, the All-mighty,
                                          the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator,
                                          the Chief of All".<br> <br> In Buddhism, the Mahabrahma resides in the 1st Jhana plane, the
                                          first plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There were higher realms
                                          above where he lives that he was unaware of, and above it all,
                                          beyond the 8 Jhanic planes and all Samsaric planes, is Nirvana.
                                          Nevertheless all the devas below the 1st Jhana planes considered
                                          him as the Creator God. Buddha did not subscribe to the belief of
                                          such a notion that the Universe and its Inhabitants were the
                                          Creation of the Mahabrahma. He met with the Brahma, asked him
                                          questions which he could not answer. Eventually he has taken refuge
                                          in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.<br> <br> The Buddha was also known to have said this,<em><br> <br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Why does he order such misfortune<br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br> And he such inequity and injustice create?<br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br> Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</em><br> <br> When the previous universe was destroyed and this universe was
                                          formed, the Mahabrahma was first to be reborn. Other subsequent
                                          brahmas/devas were to be reborn.<br> <em><br> 'On this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to
                                          himself: " I am Brahmà, the Great Brahmà, the Supreme One, the
                                          Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the
                                          Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the
                                          Ancient of days the Father of all that are and are to be. 'These
                                          other beings are of my creation. And why is that so? A while ago I
                                          thought, 'Would that they might come!' And on my mental aspiration,
                                          behold the beings came." DN 1 2:5</em><br> <br> In reality, the universe works by the law of Karma and he has no
                                          control over the system of karma.<br> <br> The Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk
                                          of the first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the
                                          powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He
                                          states that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of
                                          transformations, he cannot actually create independent creatures,
                                          change the kammic law of cause and effect, or keep anyone from
                                          growing old or dying. Brahma can use his special powers to
                                          transport a man to the brahma plane for a short visit, but he
                                          cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.<br> <br> from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm:">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm:</a><br> <em><br> When he came to know about Sakyamuni Buddha in the human world who
                                          speaks of the universal truth, he was curious and arrived at the
                                          human world with the intention to debate with the Buddha. The
                                          Buddha, with his ability to know another's mind, knew his intention
                                          and asked, "You claim to be the creator of the human race and all
                                          things in the universe, is this a fact?"<br> <br> The king replied, "Yes, it is."<br> <br> Buddha continued to question him, "Since you created life, why did
                                          you also create death? Is death created by you too?"<br> <br> The king paused for while, and thinking that everyone loves life
                                          and nobody welcomes death, he replied, "I did not create
                                          death."<br> <br> Buddha asked him again, "All human beings experience sickness, did
                                          you create sickness also?" The king knew that nobody likes to be
                                          ill, and he replied, "I did not create illness."<br> <br> Buddha asked many questions in succession, but the king denied that
                                          he created them. Eventually, he admitted that he did not create the
                                          universe and all things in it, and certainly not the human race.
                                          The king of heavens was full of regrets and he felt ashamed.
                                          Finally, he accepted Buddha as his teacher and invited Him to
                                          spread the Dharma in the heavens.</em><br> <br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mahindarama.com/e-library/whybuddhism2.html">http://www.mahindarama.com/e-library/whybuddhism2.html</a><br> <br> <em>"To those who talked about the first cause of this world, the
                                          Buddha responded by saying that it is impossible to find a first
                                          cause since everything is changing, interdependent and conditioned
                                          by other things. Something that acts as the cause in the present
                                          may become the effect in the future. Later that same effect may
                                          again become the cause. Such phenomenon continues ad infinitum. It
                                          is called the universal law of Anicca or

              <p><br> <br> Therefore in Buddhism, the question of God is irrelevant and not
                                          given importance. Instead, like a scientist, the Buddha encouraged
                                          the Buddhist practitioners to find out for themselves the truths
                                          that the Buddha said, to put it to test, and to see for ourselves,
                                          and to get enlightened. Buddhism does not encourage any blind
                                          belief and dogmas (see Kalama Sutra), and also encourages
                                          analytical questioning -- whether this teaching actually helps
                                          us.</p>

                                          the words of the teaching, but on the<br> spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not
                                          believe in anything simply because you<br> have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been

              <p><br> There are countless enlightened persons from Buddha's times till
                                          today, some of them even posting in this forum (not me), who have
                                          awakened to the ultimate reality and seen for themselves the truths
                                          that the Buddha taught. Beliefs in divine etc are not important and
                                          irrelevant in Buddhism, Buddhism being a man-centered (means having
                                          great love and compassion for all sentient being, as well as to
                                          practise for one's own spiritual development) rather than
                                          God-centered teaching, which is a reason why it is the only
                                          religion that does not have a history of having fought religious
