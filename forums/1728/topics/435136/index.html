              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">You know, when I talk about supernatural powers, maybe 4 out of 5 times it is to discourage people from getting too interested in them - since they are usually a distraction from the development of true wisdom.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But to break some people's materialistic, narrow-minded belief that there is no such thing as supernatural powers, I have to speak differently to counter such assertions.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In this thread, I am asserting that 'supernatural powers' exist. And they are not really 'supernatural' - they are simply feats of mind, but it is nothing mysterious to us Buddhists, in fact Buddhists have very detailed teachings even on how to develope and experience these powers. We have hands on manual and indepth instructions on these things. In fact it can get very technical, hardcore, geeky stuff - Buddhism is just very precise, systematic and scientific in so many ways.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">And in fact it is nothing peculiar to Buddhism (except the supramundane siddhi of enlightenment and liberation which I digress).</p>

              <h3><span style="color: #ff00ff;">THE SIX SUPERNATURAL POWERS OF BUDDHA </span></h3>
              <p><strong>Ma Tin Hla, M. A</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Vol. III, Nos. 4 &amp; 6,
              1958 </strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>        It can be said that there is
              hardly a parallel in any religious history, ancient or modern, to Gautama
              Buddha a most compassionate spiritual leader and indefatigable worker who
              dedicated himself to an enormous task of promoting universal well-being for
              full forty-five years. When the world was enveloped in darkness and looking for
              the way of Deliverance, it was He, the Enlightened One, who discovered the
              "Four Noble Truths" through His supreme knowledge as the harbinger of
              peace, prosperity and happiness to mankind. This will be proved at the outset
              by the best advantageous result and all the blessings derived from the ethical
              disciplines embodied in the Mingala Sutta a short treatise on morals, if
              carefully observed.</p>
              <p>        Truly, the Buddha can be called
              the "Light of the Universe" and His teaching called the Dhamma are
              the emblems of peace and security pacifying human consciousness, remedying
              human ills and stirring emotional sensibility towards the ultimate aim of life.
              "The real goal is liberation or absolute freedom from bondage. That
              bondage is within ourselves in the form of greed, hatred and delusion which
              must be extirpated" says the Buddha. Through analytical knowledge, the
              Buddha teaches the structure of human mind, the function of our mind and the
              perfect method as to how the mind can be systematically cultivated and
              developed in order to realise the 'Deathlessness', how to transcend all
              conditioned life and change by the attainment of final Salvation (Nibbana) even
              in this very life.</p>
              <p>        Along with this supra-mundane
              consciousness, all psychic powers arose one after another in the Buddha as a
              perfect whole. In the doctrine, are mentioned nine epithets for the Buddha by
              virtue of His highest attributes and they are as good as His words, deeds and
              thoughts absolutely pure and stainless. Of these, the word "Vijjasarana
              Sampanno" signifying literally 'Possessing knowledge and virtuous
              morality" mainly concerns the subject matter we are now dealing with.</p>
              <p>        Now, before we come to the
              supernatural powers of the Buddha, some of the causal factors leading to the
              achievement of these noble qualities may require a few comments for comparative
              study or general information. It may also be noted that without a clear
              exposition in the early teachings of the Buddha, none either terrestrial or
              celestial would be able to fully comprehend the mind (citta) mental
              concomitants (citasika), material qualities (rupa) and Nibbana which are too
              profound, subtle and abstruse.</p>
              <p>        In the creed of the Buddha, the
              word 'Resurrection' never occurs. The Scriptural text says that Buddha appears
              once in one world cycle (Thara Kappa), and sometimes not even once for aeons
              and aeons of time <em>(Sunna Kappa)</em>. Hence, to a Buddhist it is a most
              felicitous and rarest of coincidence for a living being to be reborn in the
              human world while the Buddha. His teachings (Dhamma) and His Arahats (Perfect
              Arahants) are existing for the purpose of saving mankind submerged in the mire
              of suffering and woe.</p>
              <p>        As a most Perfect Arahant, a
              foremost Philosopher of a class by himself, a social Reformer of first
              magnitude, a Blessed One and All-knowing endowed with supernatural powers,
              Buddha Gautama is undoubtedly a Superman (Uttama purisa) who never allied to
              any divinity. Unlike ordinary man, his thirty-two major signs and one hundred
              and eight minor signs are physiognomically marvellous. These most extraordinary
              features or attributes were acquired through the result of previous excellent
              Kamma as conditioned by countless meritorious deeds in complete fulfilment of
              highest virtuous life in all his previous existences.</p>
              <p>        The gods of different grades were
              his regular worshippers frequenting to listen the Dhamma and to ask questions
              on most intricate problems of life which were beyond the scope of their
              intellect to fathom. They, of course, with better intuition and clearer insight
              than the earthly beings should naturally have better faculty of understanding
              to realise the Four Noble Truths comprising the "Law of Kamma", the
              "Doctrine of Rebirth", the "Law of Dependent Origination",
              the "System of Co-relation", the "Theory of Psychic Factors and
              Material Qualities" and several others embodying the whole phenomena of
              existence. These heavenly beings had themselves experienced individually the
              good result of spiritual dynamics that elevated them to enjoy the bliss of
              higher realms. But it must, however, be noted that the ultimate aim of a
              Buddhist aspirant is not to gain into heavenly Kingdom but to attain Nibbana
              and nothing less, as heaven itself is not the highest good.</p>
              <p>        By way of elucidation, the Lord
              Buddha enjoined thus "O Monks, if wandering ascetics and members of
              another sects were to say to you "Sirs, is it in order to be reborn in the
              world of the gods that monk Gautama leads a holy life?" Would ye not, O
              Monks, if that question were put to you, be distressed at, ashamed of, and
              loathe the idea?</p>
              <p>        "Yes, Venerable Sir"
              replied the monks. The Lord then continued "So it appears, O Monks, that
              you are distressed at, and loathe the idea of life in heaven, heavenly beauty,
              heavenly happiness, heavenly glory, and that ye are distressed at, ashamed of,
              and loathe the idea of heavenly power. But much more, O Monks, should ye be
              distressed at, ashamed of and loathe doing evil with the body be distressed at,
              ashamed of and loathe doing evil with the voice and be distressed at, ashamed
              of and loathe doing evil with the mind." (Anguttara Nikaya, iii, 18)</p>
              <p>        So, it is well to understand that
              it is the purity of mind and the merit of benevolent actions that count in the
              register of previous life without any divine interference. Some of the gods and
              Brahmas such as Hari, Ishavara, Baka, Sahampati etc. are so powerful that
              people on earth regard them jointly or severally as the Almighty Creator and
              Arbitor of all things and happenings in the human world. Buddhism repudiated
              this concept by exposing categorically that all living beings, whether a
              Brahma, god, man or animal or purgatory inhabitants are of transient nature
              evanescent and subjected to rounds of rebirth (Samsara) thereby undergoing
              repeated changes, sufferings and pains throughout. In short, they are bound to
              carry their past until and unless Nibbana is attained as the final
              emancipation. On this point, ample proofs are forthcoming for the purpose of
              vindicating that the physical and mental powers of even the highest god or
              celestial being fall far too short of those acquired by the Buddha at the time
              of His Enlightenment in 529 B.C.</p>
              <p>        Here we find an illustration from
              the scriptural text as authority on the subject of dispute concerning their
              emulation.</p>
              <p>        In the Anguttara Nikaya (iii, 37)
              it was mentioned that Sakka, the leader of gods while admonishing his retinue
              of 'Tavatimsa' pronounced the following stanza:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>        "Come, tell me
              where's the man like me,</p>
              <p>        The Fourteenth day, the fifteenth
              day,</p>
              <p>        And eke the eight of each half
              month,</p>
              <p>        To celebrate as days of fast,</p>
              <p>        And keep the vows in number
              eight,</p>
              <p>        Through all the months of
              residence."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>        The Buddha hearing this declared
              "This stanza uttered by the Sakka was inapposite, ill-spoken, and
              unbefitting because the Sakka was not free from passion, hatred and
              infatuation. The stanza was fit to be chanted by a monk who is a Arahant, who
              has lost all depravities, led a holy life, has done what is behooved him to do,
              has laid aside the burden, has achieved the supreme good, has destroyed every
              fetter and released by perfect knowledge."</p>
              <p>        The Lord further pointed out that
              the Sakka is not released from birth, old age, decay, death, sorrow,
              lamentation, misery, grief arid despair, whereas, an Arahant is released from
              birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief and despair; in
              short, he is released from all misery and suffering.</p>
              <p>        <strong> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Thus a
              Arahant is superior to the gods.</span></strong></p>
              <p>        Again the Akankeyya Sutta of
              Majjhima Nikaya contains an interesting episode relating to a question raised
              by a Bhikkhu, who, having entered upon Samadhi, found 'Iddhi-vidha' in the
              composure of his mind and also the path to the deva-regions. The question which
              appeared to him was in this form "Where do the four primary elements,
              earth, water, fire and air entirely cease? No doubt, it afforded a ground to
              test the talent of heavenly beings. "It was first put to the devas in
              Catumaharaj, Tavatimsa, Yama and Vasavatti, but none was able to give any
              answer. The Bhikkhu next approached the Retinue of Brahma (Brahmaparisajja i.e.
              the 3rd grade in the 1st Jhana) for a solution and he was referred to their
              Lord the Great Brahma (1st Grade in the same Jhana). The Bhikkhu enquired where
              the Great Brahma was to be found and he was given a significant reply thus:</p>
              <p>        "We do not know, Bhikkhu,
              where, by what means or whence is the Great Brahma, but when there appear the
              omens by the light that arises and when his bodily lustre is visible, then will
              the Great Brahma appear."</p>
              <p>        Not long after, the Great Brahma
              became manifest. The Bhikkhu approached him and asked "Where friend, do
              the four primary elements earth, water, fire, air entirely cease?. The great
              Brahma replied rather boastfully "Bhikkhu, I am Brahma, the Great Brahma,
              the Conqueror, Unvanquished, the All-seeing, wielding power, the Lord, the
              Unborn, the Excellent, the Creator having Mastery, the Father of all Pasts and
              Futures. The Bhikkhu replied "Friend, I am not asking you concerning your
              status. I am asking you where the four primary elements of earth, water, fire
              and air entirely cease". The Great Brahma gave the same reply as before.
              When the Bhikkhu put the same question again for the third time, the Great
              Brahma, taking the Bhikkhu by the arm and leading to one side said "The
              gods of the retinue of Brahma (Brahma parisajja) believe that there is nothing
              unseen by the Great Brahma. I did not therefore answer in their presence.
              Bhikkhu, I actually do not know where the four primary elements cease entirely.
              You have made a mistake when you by-passed the Exalted One and searched
              elsewhere for explanation of that question. You better go to the Exalted One
              and put it to him, and whatever answer he gave, shall abide."</p>
              <p>        The Bhikkhu then immediately
              returned to the Buddha and put the same question to Him. The Lord gave the
              following reply. "It is not so, Bhikkhu, that the question should be set.
              It should be thus:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>        (1) Where do water,
              earth, fire, air find no place?</p>
              <p>        (2) Where do (the ideas) long and
              short, fine and coarse, pleasant and unpleasant not occur?</p>
              <p>        (3) Where are mind and body,
              mental and physical states entirely stopped?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>        And the answers to these are:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>        (1) Where the
              consciousness that makes endless comparisons is entirely abandoned.</p>
              <p>        (2) Here 'long and short', 'fine
              and coarse', 'pleasant and unpleasant' do not occur.</p>
              <p>        (3) Here with the dying away of
              consciousness, these things cease.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>        They are indeed profound and
              highly philosophical even for, celestial beings.</p>
              <p>        The supernatural powers of the
              Buddha are manifold and of these, our present article is confined to Chalabinna
              which literally means six super-knowledge or powers. Knowledge itself is power
              in the sense that the latter arises spontaneously by application of knowledge
              or, wisdom which is capable of knowing or clearly understanding the way or
              method attainment. Lord Buddha very seldom exercised those power as an
              instrument for conversion. Only when occasions arose on the immediate need of
              the moment, He sparingly applied them. He also forbade His disciples to effect
              conversion by marvels and miracles as such things would not enhance any
              prestige in the eyes of unbelievers holding wrong Views.</p>
              <p>        In the seventh year of the
              Enlightenment, it is said that the Buddha gave a wonderful display of 'Iddhi'
              by walking to and fro in the sky an path stretching from horizon to horizon,
              emitting streams of fire and water (Yamaka-patihariya) displayed the six-rayed
              halo which reached even the 'Chakkavala' or space curve returning again to the
              Buddha's person. Such a marvellous feat was incomprehensible and looked
              superstitious in the opinion of the materialists until the genius of Albert
              Einstein enunciated the possibility by his theory of relativity thereby
              conforming- the Buddhist doctrine on this point specifically.</p>
              <p>        It may be necessary to mention
              that the Buddha should have given an exhibition of wonderful powers immediately
              after He had broken the sandalwood bowl which the Venerable Pindola had gained
              by display of Iddhi. But what the Buddha reprehended was not Iddhi but its way
              of employment, for the purpose of material gain and therefore He reserved to
              Himself the right to give such displays, which, although by the Lord's estimate
              is the lowest form of teaching, can be an effective means of winning the
              attention of vast multitude. It is said that after the display of Iddhi, the
              Buddha ascended to Tavatimsa, the abode of Thirty-three Devas and preached the
              Abhidhamma to the Holy Mother who was reborn as one of the devas named
              Santussita.</p>
              <p>        Here was enacted a great cosmic
              drama as devas from countless millions of world systems came round to pay
              homage to the Buddha. The Holy Mother was enthroned to the right hand of the
              Buddha high above the devas and the Brahmas whose splendour and radiance were
              superior to the combined brilliance of solar planets.</p>
              <p>        Again in Kevaddha Sutta, we find
              a narration which may be reproduced here as follows: On one occasion while the
              Buddha was staying at Nalanda in a mango grove which was later the site of a
              Great Buddhist University, a certain young householder named Kevaddha
              approached Him. He suggested the Buddha that as the Buddha had a great
              following in the city of Milanda, He should command a Bhikkhu to perform
              superhuman acts in the form of 'Iddhi' (miracles). The idea behind that
              suggestion seems to be that such a display would yet further enhance the
              Buddha's prestige and reputation and pave the way for easier conversion of the
              unbelievers.</p>
              <p>        The Buddha replied thus "It
              is not thus I preach the doctrine to the Bhikkhus telling them to perform
              superhuman acts, the iddhi miracles". Kevaddha repeated his suggestion
              twice and finally he received the following reply.</p>
              <p>        "There are three Kinds of
              miracles I have known, having understood them and experienced them for myself.
              They are (1) the miracle of Iddhi, (2) the miracle of discerning another
              persons's mind and (3) the miracle of instruction." It must be understood
              that these three miracles refer only to those acquired by an Arahant and that
              they would appear as the natural result of perfection in the Samatha section.</p>
              <p>        The Lord further amplified thus:</p>
              <p>        (1) "In the miracle of
              Iddhi, Iddhipatihariya (Superhuman power) the Bhikkhu experiences various kinds
              of power. From one form he becomes many, and from many he becomes one again; he
              becomes visible or invisible, passes through wall and rocks without touching
              them, as if they were space. He dives into and emerges from the earth as if it
              were water, and walks on water without disturbing the surface as if it were
              land; sitting crossed-legged, he moves in the sky like a bird. The Moon and the
              Sun in all their majesty, he touches and strokes with his hand, continuing with
              his body up to the realm of Brahma. When trusting person sees the Bhikkhu
              perform these acts, he relates it to some sceptic saying "The power and
              majesty of the Samana are stupendous. I saw him transforming himself from one
              form into many and so on." Then the sceptic says "That is the
              'Gandhara charm' making the Bhikkhu perform those acts. What do you think,
              Kevaddha, would not the sceptic say so to the trusting one?" Kevaddha
              replied "He would, Sir." Thereupon, the Buddha warned "Well,
              seeing this advantage of the iddhi miracles, I am vexed with them; I deplore
              them and am disgusted with them".</p>
              <p>        Next the Buddha said:</p>
              <p>        (2) "What is the miracle of
              discerning the state of another person's mind? (Adesana patihariya). Here the
              Bhikkhu points out the state of consciousness, mental concomitants, initial and
              sustained application of the mind of another person saying "This is your
              mind, your mind in this way, thus is your state of consciousness." When a
              trusting person sees that Bhikkhu performing the act, he relates it to some
              sceptical person saying "The mystic power and majesty of Samana are
              stupendous. I saw the Bhikkhu reading the mind of another person etc."
              Then the sceptic says "That is the 'Manika charm' making the Bhikkhu do
              that." Therefore, seeing the disadvantage of the miracles of discerning
              the minds of others, I am vexed with them, I deplore them and I am disgusted
              with them."</p>
              <p>        The Lord continued:</p>
              <p>        (3) "What is the Miracle of
              Instruction? (Anusasani patihariya). Here Kevaddha, the Bhikkhu advises
              "Let the initial application of your mind to an object be in this way and
              not in that; pay attention in this way and not in that; renounce this; having
              attained to that, remain in it." This is called the Miracle of
              Instruction."</p>
              <p>        The Buddha also discouraged this
              form of controlling power over the mind of other persons. This kind of power
              seems to be the most advanced stage of hypnotism, mesmerism, telepathy,
              occultism etc. which we so often find being exercised by magicians and
              conjurers of the present day.</p>
              <p>        The present article relating to
              all these psychic powers of Arahats is only a prelude before we come to the six
              supernatural powers of the Buddha, and Eight Great Victories over His most
              formidable adversaries consisting of gods, men, woman and ferocious beasts.</p>
              <p>        Amongst the great attributes of
              the Buddha, that made him so revered universally were his penetrating wisdom
              into all phenomenal existence in the entire Universe, his iron will-power, all
              pervading compassion, self-less service, marvellous power of renunciation,
              unsullied purity in his words, deeds and thought. They were the embodiment of
              the noble virtues he acquired and taught humanity, in his spotless exemplary
              life. His tolerance in imparting profound ethico-religious and philosophical
              teachings, the most harmless and blameless methods employed by him to establish
              his Kingdom of righteousness and universal peace, his subtle doctrine of loving
              kindness and non-violence, evoked general applause wherever the Dhamma was
              preached.</p>
              <p>        In his own words, he was a man, a
              superman who attained perfection in all spheres quite independently through his
              Supreme Enlightenment. His teaching was not a Revelation and his injunction not
              commandments, but precepts, the ethical code of conduct for the willing if
              anyone volunteers to observe for his own edification. Without any monopoly or
              any dictatorial tone, the Buddha gave to every man freedom of thought and the
              right to think by himself. Thus he roused man's intellect and reason and set
              him on his feet to work out for his own Salvation without divine help or
              interference.</p>
              <p>        Buddha Gautama was not an Indian
              God, nor had he any alliance to divinity. Though godless, he was most godlike
              and far superior to any heavenly being. He attained all his supernatural powers
              or supernormal heights by his own efforts quite independent of the traditional
              way of the time. The marks of a "Great person" (Maha-purisa)
              distinguished him from other morals, and miracles gathered round in his life
              and activities. With the acquirement of six powers or rather the penetrating
              knowledge of All things, fifteen holy practices (Sarana) peculiar to him which
              enable him to possess omniscience and to adjust his ideal conduct, speech and
              mind properly in all matters, and the assurances that made him know positively
              that he has attained the saving knowledge entitled to many distinguished titles
              or epithets such as Jina, Sugata, Tathagata, Bhagava, Sayambhu etc., the Buddha
              was entitled to claim that he had come in a line of succession of Buddhas. This
              began from the time of Buddha Dipankara under whom the present Buddha, then
              known as Sumeda, had taken a vow that he would dedicate his life to the weal of
              humanity and by whom Supreme Enlightenment was solemnly predicted for, him as
              Gautama Buddha, the World Saviour.</p>
              <p>        The journey to final illumination
              takes countless number of years: it is long and arduous and it needs Ten
              Paramitas (Virtues), namely, charity, morality, renunciation, wisdom, energy,
              forbearance, truthfulness, determination, loving-compassion and equanimity
              which are the gateway to human Perfection.</p>
              <p>        Now, coming to Chalabinna, the
              six supernatural powers of the, Buddha, the enumeration may be given thus. (1)
              Iddhividha, (2) Dibbasota. (3) Cetopariya, (4) Pubbenivasa, (5) Dibba-cakkhu
              and (6) Asavakkhaya. They require amplification in the light of doctrinal
              concept.</p>
              <p>        In the Akankheyya Sutta of the
              Majjhima-Nikaya, a detailed explanation for each of them is given by the Buddha
              Himself in the form of instruction as to how they may be acquired.</p>
              <p>        <strong>1. IDDHIVIDHA - THE POWER OF
              TRANSFORMATION. </strong></p>
              <p>        The Buddha said "If a monk
              should frame a wish as follows: "Let me exercise the various magical
              powers, let me being one become multiform., let me being multiform become one,
              let me become visible, become invisible, go without hindrance through walls,
              ramparts or mountains as if through air, let me rise and sink in the ground as
              if in the water, let me walk on the water as if on unyielding ground, let me
              travel cross-legged through the air liked a winged bird, let me touch and feel
              with my hand the moon and the sun mighty and powerful though they are, and let
              me go without my body even up to the Brahma world," then must he be
              perfect in the precepts (Sila), bring his thoughts to a state of quiescence
              (Samadhi), practice diligently the trances (Jhana), attain to insight (Panna)
              and be frequenter to lonely places."</p>
              <p>        <strong>2. DIBBASOTA - CELESTIAL
              HEARING.</strong></p>
              <p>        The Enlightened One expounded
              thus: "If a monk should frame a wish as follows: Let me hear with a
              divinely clear hearing, surpassing that of men, sounds both celestial and"
              human, far and near," then he must be perfect in the precepts, bring his
              thoughts to a state of quiescence, practise diligently to the trances, attain
              to insight and be a frequenter to lonely places.</p>
              <p>        <strong>3. CETOPARIYA. - THE POWER OF
              DISCERNMENT OF THE MIND OF OTHERS.</strong> The Omniscient One amplified thus:
              "If a monk should frame a wish as follows:- "Let me by my own heart
              investigate and discern the hearts of other beings, the hearts of other men,
              let me discern a passionate mind to be passionate, let me discern a mind free
              from passion to be free from passion, let me discern a mind full of hatred to
              be full of hatred, let me discern a mind free from hatred to be free from
              hatred, let me discern an infatuated mind to be infatuated, let me discern a
              mind free from infatuation to be free from infatuation, let me discern an
              intent mind to be intent, let me discern a wandering mind to be wandering, let
              me discern an exalted mind to be exalted, let me discern an unexalted mind to
              be unexalted, let me discern an inferior mind to be inferior, let me discern a
              superior mind to be superior, let me discern a concentrated mind to be
              concentrated, let me discern an unconcentrated mind to be unconcentrated, let
              me discern an emancipated mind to be emancipated, let me discern an
              unemancipated mind to be unemancipated" then must he be perfect in the
              precepts etc. (as mentioned above).</p>
              <p>        This power may be far superior to
              the highest form of modem thought-reading now largely practised all over the
              world.</p>
              <p>        <strong>4. PUBBENIVASA - POWER OF
              KNOWING </strong>PREVIOUS EXISTENCES. The All-knowing One further elucidated thus:
              "If a monk should frame a wish as follows:- Let me call to my mind many
              previous states of existence, to wit one birth, two births, three births, four
              births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births,
              fifty births, one hundred births, one thousand births, one hundred thousand
              births, many destructions of a world cycle (Kappa), many renovations of a world
              cycle, many destructions and many renovations of a world cycle: I lived in such
              a place, had such a name was of such a family, of such a caste, had such a
              maintenance, experienced such happiness and such miseries had such a length of
              life. Then I passed from that existence and was reborn in such a place. There
              also I had such a name, was of such a family, of such a caste, had such a
              maintenance, experienced such happiness and such miseries, had such a length of
              life. Then I passed from that existence and was reborn in such a place. There
              also I had such a name, was of such a family, of such a caste, had such a
              maintenance, experienced such happiness and such miseries, had such a length of
              life. Then I passed from that existence and was reborn in this existence."
              Thus let me call to my mind many former states of existence and let me
              specifically characterise them," then must he be perfect in the precepts
              etc. -</p>
              <p>        This power is sorely attributable
              to the expounding of the "Theory of Rebirth" and 'Samsara' by the
              Buddha for all living beings in the entire Universe.</p>
              <p>        <strong>5. DIBBA-CAKKHU - CELESTIAL
              VISION.</strong></p>
              <p>        The Blessed One also amplified
              thus: "If a monk should frame a wish as follows :- "Let me with a
              divinely clear vision, surpassing that of men, behold beings as they pass from
              one existence and spring up in another existence, let me discern the base and
              the noble, the handsome and the ugly, those in a higher state of existence and
              those in the lower state of existence undergoing the result of their deeds, so
              that I can know as follows:- 'Alas! these beings, having been wicked of body,
              wicked of voice, wicked of mind, slanderers of noble people, wrong in their
              views, acquirers of false merit under wrong views, have arrived after the
              dissolution of the body, after death, at a place of punishment, a place of
              suffering, perdition, hell; or again, these other beings, having been righteous
              of body, righteous of voice, righteous of mind, not slanderers of noble people,
              right in their views, acquirers of merit under right views, have arrived, after
              the dissolution of the body, after death, at a place of happiness, a heavenly
              world." Thus let me with a divinely clear vision, surpassing that of men,
              discern beings as they pass from one existence and spring up in another
              existence; let me discern the base and the noble, the handsome and the ugly,
              those in a higher state of existence and those in a lower state of existence
              undergoing the result of their deeds," then he must be perfect in the
              precepts etc. This refers to the power of knowing the 'Law of Karma'.</p>
              <p>       <strong> 6. ASAVAKKHAYA -
              SUPRA-MUNDANE KNOWLEDGE OR POWER RELATING TO DESTRUCTIONOF ASAVAS AND THE
              RECOGNITION OF THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS. </strong></p>
              <p>        The Compassionate One further
              illustrated thus:</p>
              <p>        "If a monk should frame a
              wish as follows;- Let me through destruction of depravity, in the present life
              and in my own person, attain to freedom from depravity, to deliverance of the
              mind, to deliverance by wisdom, then he must be perfect in the precepts (Sila)
              and bring his thoughts to a state of quiescence, (Samadhi) practise diligently
              the trances (Jhana), attain to insight (Panna) and be a frequener of lonely
              places."</p>
              <p>        It must, however, be understood
              that the Buddha did not consider every trance to be necessarily good, for it
              must aim at the right end. He, however, realised that there were those who
              devoted to yogic exercises to acquire supernatural powers. So the Buddha
              refined the practice by telling them that even such powers could be acquired
              only through the practice of righteouaness and wisdom. (<span style="font-size: small;"> Akankheyya Sutta, S. B. E. Vol. XI, </span>) Acquisition of supernatural powers
              does not confer any spiritual advantage. It was for this reason that the Buddha
              forbade his disciples to work miracles for display. Here it would not be out of
              place to mention that the yogic beliefs of Buddhism are not to be seen clearly
              in the Lamaism of Tibet. Craving for supernatural powers and taking delight
              therein after acquirement do not help us to free ourselves, from lust, hatred
              and ignorance. This has to be guarded against by those striving in the path of
              holiness for final liberation only and nothing else.</p>
              <p>        This Asavakkhaya Nina is the most
              important of all being the knowledge or the way for complete elimination of
              both physical and mental defilements and thereby reaches the ultimate goal of
              life (Nibbana). To know its original meaning, the word 'Asavakkhaya" is
              derived from Asava (A+Sru corresponding to Sanskrit Asrava. cp. Asrava) i.e.
              certain specified ideas which intoxicate the mind; and the word Khaya denotes
              extinction. Thus freedom from "Asavas" constitutes Arahatship and the
              fight for extinction of Asavas forms one of the main duties of a human being.
              The four kinds of Asavas may briefly be enumerated as follows:-</p>
              <p>        (1) Kammasava - Sensuality
              (craving for sensual pleasures)</p>
              <p>        (2) Bhavasava - Rebirth (lust for
              life)</p>
              <p>        (3) Ditthisava - Speculation
              (Random mental view)</p>
              <p>        (4) Avijjasava - Ignorance
              (Without knowledge of what is right and what is wrong).</p>
              <p>        In many instances, the Buddha had
              valiantly encountered the challenges of mighty spiritual and earthy adversaries
              ranging from hostile gods right down to ferocious beasts. On account of Iddhis,
              the buddha was practically invulnerable and he triumphed all the time
              comfortably after taming them or converting them. Out of the innumerable tests
              of wisdom, power and prowess, the most notable are his "Eight
              Victories" during the ministry for forty-five years. They are:</p>
              <p>        1. Mara, the god of Vasavatti;</p>
              <p>        2. Alavaka, the giant of Alavi
              (near Himalayas);</p>
              <p>        3. Nalagirii, the War-elephant of
              Rajagriha;</p>
              <p>        4. Ahimsaka (a) Angulimala, the
              ruffian of Savatthi;</p>
              <p>        5. Cincmanavika, the shameless
              termagant of Savatthi;</p>
              <p>        6. Kuthadanta (a) Siccaka
              Paribbajaka, the renowned sophist of Vesali;</p>
              <p>        7. Nandopananda, The Serpent
              King;</p>
              <p>        8. Baka, the Brahma of the
              highest grade in 1st Jhana.</p>
              <p>        Almost in every religion,
              biographical accounts of the Founder largely contain laudatory tributes to his
              marvellous feats and miracles. They, in fact, pale into insignificance when
              compared to those of Lord Buddha who never coveted them. All living beings
              whether a god, king or his subject are equal before Him. From the supra-mundane
              aspect, how can one assume that the highly paid pilot of a big flying fortress
              is in any way superior to a poor labourer inside the colliery? This can only be
              realised from the three characteristics of life as shown in Buddhism and no
              other. In the words of the Buddha, these three characteristics are enunciated
              thus:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>        (1) Whether Buddha
              arise, O priests, or whether Buddhas do not arrise, it remains a fact and the
              fixed and necessary constitution of being, that all its constituents are
              transitory (anicca). This fact a Buddha discovers and masters, and when he has
              discovered and mastered it, he announces, teaches, publishes, proclaims,
              discloses, minutely explains, and makes it clear, that all the constituents of
              being are transitory.</p>
              <p>        (2) Whether Buddha arise, O
              priests, or whether Buddhas do not arise, it remains a fact and the fixed and
              necessary constitution of being, that all its constituents are misery (dukkha).
              This fact a Buddha discovers and masters, and when he has discovered and
              mastered it, he announces, teaches, publishes, proclaims, discloses, minutely
              explains, and makes it dear, that all the constituents of beings are misery.</p>
              <p>        (3) Whether Buddha arise, O
              priests, or whether Buddhas do not arise, it remains a fact and the fixed and
              necessary constitution of being, that all its elements are lacking in an Ego
              (Anatta). This fact a Buddha discovers and masters, and when he has discovered
              and mastered it, he announces, teaches, publishes, proclaims, discloses,
              minutely explains, and makes it clear, that all the elements of being are
              lacking in an Ego.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Anguttara Nikaya (iii, 134).</p>
              <p>        It cannot be denied that they are
              inevitable and inexhorable laws as three great warnings for all beings whether
              terrestrial or celestial. The reflections or constant awareness of these
              characteristics surely opens our mental access for clearer vision., intuitive
              insight and supra-mundane consciousness penetrating into the thick veils of
              ignorance and the depth of world illusions. Along with it, the absolute reality
              of life-process, direct perception of truth, complete detachment, inner
              calmness, peace, tranquility, supreme bliss and deliverance emerge as
              beneficial results. Without the highest clarity of insight, one cannot see
              things as they really are, and not what they seem to be. (Yatha bhutam nanam
              pajanati). It is The finding of reality of all things that destroys the barrier
              of separation.</p>
              <p>        Besides the Great Victories
              mentioned above, the attempts of Devadatta on the life of the Buddha are the
              vivid illustrations of the powers of the Buddha that made him practically
              invulnerable. According to the scriptural text, the story runs thus: Devadatta
              went to King Ajatasattu and proposed that he himself would kill the Buddha
              while Ajatasattu should kill his father Bimbisara. He having received skilful
              archers from Rajagariha put one on a certain path by which the Buddha would
              come, two on another, four further up, and so on up to sixteen with strict
              instructions to kill the Buddha with poisoned arrows. But when the first man
              approached the Buddha, he became terrified and his body became stiff and unable
              to raise his hand. The Buddha told him not to fear and the man threw down his
              weapons and confessed his nefarious purpose. Thereupon the Buddha preached to
              him, converted him and sent him back by a different route.</p>
              <p>        The next two archers not seeing
              the man, followed up and found the Buddha seated beneath a tree. They
              approached the Buddha but could not shoot, and like the first archer they
              became converted. The same happened to all the rest, and thus all attempts
              became abortive much to be disappointment of Devadatta who then decided to kill
              the Buddha himself.</p>
              <p>        While the Buddha was walking
              along the path in the shade of Gijjhakuta Hill, Devadatta in execution of his
              well devised plan hurled a big boulder down the hill. It was stopped by two
              peaks and only some splinters struck the Buddha's foot causing blood to flow.
              The Buddha looked up and said "Great demerit, evil man, have you produced
              for yourself in that, with murderous thought, you have caused the blood of
              Tathagata to flow." This was the second frustrated attempt to take the
              life of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>        The monks wished to have a guard
              provided for the security of the Buddha. But He pointed out that it was
              impossible for anyone to deprive Him of life, for the Tathagatas attain
              Parinibbana in the ordinary course of time.</p>
              <p>        On this point, the authority
              found in the Scriptural text (<span style="font-size: small;"> Nalagiripesana, pp: 356-357, 6th
              Council Version </span>) runs as follows:</p>
              <p>        "Atthana me tam, bhikkhave
              anavakaso</p>
              <p>        Yam parupakkamena Tathagatam
              jivita</p>
              <p>        Voropeyya Anupakkamena, bhikkhave</p>
              <p>        Tathagata parinibbayanti ."</p>
              <p>        Meaning,</p>
              <p>        O monks, impossible it is to take
              the life</p>
              <p>        of a Tathagata as myself through
              the effort</p>
              <p>        of an outside agent. Free from
              such efforts,</p>
              <p>        O monks, the Tathagatas enter
              Parinibbana (in the ordinary course).</p>
              <p>(Cullavagga).        </p>
              <p>        The third attempt of Devadatta
              was also proved futile. He caused the - elephant keepers of Ragagriha to let
              loose a fierce war-elephant Nalagiri on the road by which the Buddha was to
              come. The monks warned the Buddha of the impending danger but he refused to
              turn back pointing out that it was impossible for him to be killed. As the
              animal rushed on, the Buddha suffused it with waves of loving thought-force. It
              knelt down before the Buddha and became thoroughly subdued.</p>
              <p>        It is therefore said that neither
              on any account nor under any circumstances or policy, either by nature or
              phenomena, precedent or accident, spiritual or terrestrial, can the Buddha or
              Buddhas ever meet any Ignominious form the death due to the aggression of an
              enemy agent.</p>
              <p>        It is well to bear in mind that
              the original source of powers that make the Buddha practically invulnerable
              lies in the "Ten Virtues towards perfection" (Paramitas) with which
              to confront and overcome the forces of evil. Next comes the "Sila"
              (Morality) the keeping of which include the arising of confidence and the
              disappearance of fear against any danger. After that, it is followed by
              'Samadhi which deals with a complete system of the guarding of the door of
              senses, mindfulness, concentration, awareness, contentment of simplicity, the
              search of solitude - and the abandonment of Five Hindrances to the development
              of mind and vision. The third group (Panna) concerns the Higher Spiritual
              Powers and the vision of supra-mundane type relating to the destruction of
              Asavas and the recognition of the "Four Noble Truths."</p>
              <p>        In Buddhism, there is a definite
              and perfect system of mind-control and mind-purification, and that system
              primarily leads one to analytical knowledge and the power of discrimination
              between the right and the wrong. Later by inclination, this knowledge develops
              to Higher Wisdom which is the governing factor in life's activities. Further it
              serves well to acquire the Highest Wisdom that can penetrate into the natural
              phenomena both mental and material, visible and invisible as the most potent of
              weapons.</p>

And they are not really 'supernatural' - they are simply feats of mind, but it is nothing mysterious to us Buddhists, in fact Buddhists have very detailed teachings even on how to develope and experience these powers. We have hands on manual and indepth instructions on these things. In fact it can get very technical, hardcore, geeky stuff - Buddhism is just very precise, systematic and scientific in so many ways.</p>

              <p>1. I think it is your mistaken notion that people are distracted from the development of 'true' wisdom when they question the 'supernatural powers' of Buddha or boddhisattva or in Buddhism.  You started by flooring everyone first!  That is rather sinister.</p>
              <p>2. On one hand you contended that there is supernatural power in Buddhism and on the other hand you say the power is not supernatural.</p>
              <p>3. I am questioning supernatural power.  I am not asking about natural abilities or capabilities - physical or mental.  There are people with muscle power - physical strength.  There are people who can run very fast but they can never outrun a cheetah because a cheetah has that natural power or ability.  Therefore, I am aware of people who may have certain ability beyond that of others, like the ability to come up with complex mathematical equations.</p>
              <p>4. That the Buddha has a mental faculty far superior than ordinary folks was never in doubt.  Just as they are people with extra-ordinary academic capability we don't say they have special power or supernatural power.</p>
              <p>5. So, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you have conceded there is no supernatural power</span>, just feats of the mind. There are many people with such mental feats and are not into Buddhism.  And you said mental feats are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not peculiar to Buddhism</span>.  That being the case how do you arrived at this sweeping statement: "But to break some people's materialistic, narrow-minded belief that there is no such thing as supernatural powers, I have to speak differently to counter such assertions."</p>
              <p>6. You just shot your own foot: people say there is no such thing as supernatural powers and those who say this are materialistic, narrow-minded, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what did you just say?  Differently?</span></p>

              <div style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">So whether those powers are supernatural, depends on how you define 'beyond explanation by natural laws'. From the perspective of Buddhism, we have quite a good understanding of supernatural powers, of the kinds of supernatural powers and how they are being developed or can be developed. They also do not contradict our basic doctrine, since we do not posit inherent existence (i.e. emptiness teachings), and we understand dependent origination and the holographic universe principle (which in fact is a teaching on dependent origination).</div>

              <div style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Because they can be explained in Buddhism, they are not beyond the natural laws of dharma, hence are not supernatural from the perspective of Buddhism, but may be supernatural from the perspective of classic physics (with laws such as things being unable to surpass the speed of light, etc), but may be acceptable from quantum physics, holographic universe theory, etc.</div>

              <div style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">You should buy the book 'The Holographic Universe' as it provides a scientific explanation on how supernatural powers are possible (but it is not a book just about supernatural powers, that is just a small but well explained portion of it).</div>

              <p><em> <span><strong>Aspect and his team discovered that under

                                                          It doesn't matter whether they are 10 feet or 10 billion miles apart.</strong> Somehow each particle always seems to know what the other is doing. The
                                                          problem with this feat is that it violates Einstein's long-held tenet

                                                          one must first understand a little about holograms. A hologram is a
                                                          three-
                                                          dimensional photograph made with the aid of a laser. To make a
                                                          hologram,
                                                          the object to be photographed is first bathed in the light of a laser
                                                          beam.
                                                          Then a second laser beam is bounced off the reflected light of the
                                                          first
                                                          and the resulting interference pattern (the area where the two laser
                                                          beams
                                                          commingle) is captured on film. When the film is developed, it looks
                                                          like
                                                          a meaningless swirl of light and dark lines. But as soon as the
                                                          developed
                                                          film is illuminated by another laser beam, a three-dimensional image of
                                                          the original object appears.</span> <br> <span>The three-dimensionality of such images is not
                                                          the only
                                                          remarkable characteristic of holograms. If a hologram of a rose is cut
                                                          in half and then illuminated by a laser, each half will still be found
                                                          to contain the entire image of the rose. Indeed, even if the halves are
                                                          divided again, each snippet of film will always be found to contain a

                                                          of a hologram contains all the information possessed by the whole.</strong></span></em></div>

              <p>Firstly, gods do not possess 'omniscience'. Only a Buddha does.</p>
              <p>Secondly, as I have explained, supernatural powers are achievable by human beings, not just gods. In fact a trained yogi can develope siddhis far surpassing celestial beings. Therefore it is not supernatural in the sense of surpassing human feats; being of the realm or deeds of gods, nor is it supernatural in the sense of being unexplainable in terms of dharmic laws - they certainly are explainable.</p>
              <p>The only way it can be called 'supernatural' is perhaps that it might not be explainable in terms of classic materialist scientific views. But it can be explained by quantum physics, holographic universe theory, etc, which I have already mentioned.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, I have no reason to believe that gods cannot exist - why should I be so naive to think humans are the only beings in the whole universe? Furthermore, there are countless reports from not only Buddha but many yogis, practitioners, some of my teachers, who have witnessed these beings, but I digress for now.</p>

              <p>I have already answered about the small gods. As for fake yogis, whatever tricks they do, I don't think they can do something like sitting out in the open motionless for years without food and water.
                                                      
                                                      Also, that boy is not getting any monetary benefits - he is not a guru, he is very seclusive, reclusive, he doesn't need clothes, food, water, shelter, jewelleries, cars, houses, whatever. He simply wants to meditate quietly. Fake yogis probably just want to con people's money, why would they want to sit for six years starving to death, they'd rather enjoy cars and girls and whatever. It is much easier to be a fake guru.</p>
              <p>Buddha only taught what ends suffering, the nature of all experience (i.e. luminous and empty, dependently originated), and what is helpful and beneficial to us spiritually. Obviously he does not teach 'everything that science does not know now' - he does not teach us how to build a spaceship to Jupiter, or whether there are aliens in planet Pluto of course (but he does mention there are countless other worlds with intelligent beings on them)! Certain things are simply beyond the range of what he wants to teach.</p>

              <p>if you are really keen to debate and learn, be free to continue to pose questions.</p>
              <p>but if you have not tasted the fruits of practice, and do not know anything about direct experience and realization, pls exercise some discretion when commenting. many of your questions can actually be answered by yourself if you have the courage to just sit and practice vipassana with a qualified teacher.</p>
              <p>if you have done so, you would be asking more constructive questions. as for what you want to ask so far, just google it.</p>

              <p>hahaha, trying to lob me off this thread? I am sitting while posing the many questions here.  and there are many gurus, meditators and teachers here.  can they answer my questions?</p>
              <p>I read between your lines: you don't like the line of my questioning, therefore you said "you would be asking more constructive questions". Indirectly, you are saying my questions are not constructuve, and go Google?</p>

              <p>I call you a fake because you are thoroughly confused about supernatural powers.  What a trick answer you gave: Buddha ate so as not to give the impression he had supernatural powers.  Who are you trying to kid?  The boy who can go for years without food by meditating?</p>
