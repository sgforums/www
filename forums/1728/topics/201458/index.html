            <div class='col-md body'>I'm new to Buddhism and live in Perth, Australia. I have access to some Buddhist books at the Mission but I would very much appreciate a list of good books to read. I have Eckhart Tolles " Power Of Now" on my list so far.<br><br>Also, as many Buddhism books appear to be printed and distributed in Singapore,  Malaysia, etc, and are not commercially available here I would like some recommendations to weblinks to online bookstores in Singapore etc that sell Buddhism books.<br><br>Thank you for your time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are currently 3 books I know to be the most popular introductory books to Buddhism, not in any particular order:<br><br><img src="http://www.omsakthi.org/books/covers/buddhism_plain_and_simple.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Buddhism Plain and Simple<br>Steve Hagen</span><br><br><img src="http://www.wisdom-books.com/Covers/6806.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Awakening the Buddha Within: Tibetan Wisdom for the Western World<br>Lama Surya Das</span><br><br><img src="http://www.parallax.org/books/heartteachsc/front.jpg"><br><span style="color: darkred;">The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching<br>Thich Nhat Hanh</span><br><br>As for the publishing, most of these popular dharma books can be found in Australia, there is no need to find it in Malaysia or Singapore... But in any case, there is only one local online bookstore in Singapore: <a href="http://www.acmamall.com" rel="nofollow">www.acmamall.com</a>.<br><br>Most english titles however can be found on <a href="http://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you for the list. I recently purchased "Awakening the Buddha Within: Tibetan Wisdom for the Western World" by Lama Surya Das, so I'll make sure I get stuck into that one first.<br><br>I'll seek out the other two as well.<br><br>The books on Buddhism available in Perth are mostly the popular books eg books by The Dalai Lama, or those Buddhism for Dummies/Idiots books. Neither of which I particular gather information from. The Dalai Lama doesn't "speak to me" the way Dr K Sri Dhammanda (for example) does. The books written by people from USA, Australia, England, etc, I haven't learnt from as much as the books from Asia. Some of the 'Anglo' books I have read compare Buddhism to Christianity and as I don't have a background in Christianity the comparisions are lost on me. If that makes sense. Thank you for the link to the online bookstore. I will go exploring.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, since the introductory books probably cover the same kind of topics, you may want to explore more indepth into the different Buddhist traditions to see which one suits you best, as different traditions have different practises and approach. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Then after that, it is best to stick to one path... and join a Sangha (see <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/aus_dir/bawaorg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/aus_dir/bawaorg.htm</a>).<br><br>Oh yes another thing is, even if dharma books are not available in local bookstores, I believe it will definitely be available in your local Sanghas so you may check them out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I go to Australian Buddhist Blisss Culture Mission. I adore it there. They have a small library of books in English. About three shelves worth, which I'm plowing through. My problem is I don't speak nor read Mandarin. There are racks and racks of books in Mandarin. I noticed most of the books from the Mission orginated in Singapore or Malaysia, that is why I am seeking more books  from there (in English).<br><br>It has taken me a while to be able to tell the difference between Mahayana and Theravada books, but I think I can pick out some of the differences now.<br><br>Thank you for the link.</div>

I am also from Jen Chen Buddhism and knows Ven. Jue Ru <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> In Singapore, most of our Jen Chen books remains Chinese, but I am aware that recently they have been doing more and more translations of the Chinese materials into English. There have been two new books from Jen Chen in English, I think it's probably in Perth too, "Awakening our Sleeping Minds", "The Earth People". Many more are to come gradually.. however I do not think they are sold online.<br><br>As for Theravada, I do have much respect for some Theravada masters, for example there is a famous Theravada master in Perth called Ajahn Brahmavamso. He often visits Singapore and I have listened to some of his talks from internet, he is of great insights. However the path that he teaches is quite different from Ren Cheng. For instance, his path emphasizes developing Jhanas, which is a form of meditative absorption. Our practise does not require us to go through the different stages of jhanas.<br><br>Just wondering, have you heard Missionary Chen Ming An's talks? I think he goes to Perth to give speech every few years. He talks in Chinese, so I'm wondering if you can understand him.</div>

In fact regarding the 8 jhanas, if you have the opportunity to listen to the Chinese audio files by Venerable Shen Kai, you will have heard about him saying that Jen Chen Buddhists do not need to go through the path of jhanas, and also described the various jhanas. Jhana is a form of meditative absorption of deep bliss, meaning the mind is absorbed in deep meditative joy, each stage characterised by different forms of meditative joy.<br><br>Basically there are 8 jhanas (meditative absorptions),<br><br>(notes:<br>vitakka	  -  	thinking; directed thought; initial attention<br>vicara	  -  	pondering; applied thought; sustained attention<br>piti	  -  	delight, rapture, euphoria, ecstasy; interest<br>sukkha	  -  	joy, happiness<br>ekaggata	  -  	one-pointness of mind)<br><br>Rupa Jhanas<br><br>1. "Quite secluded from sense desires, secluded from unwholesome states of mind -- one enters and remains in the first Jhana which is with vitakka and vicara and is filled with piti and sukkha born of seclusion.<br><br>2. "Further, with the stilling of vitakka and vicara, by gaining inner tranquillity and unification of mind, one enters and remains in the second Jhana which is free from vitakka and vicara and is filled with piti and sukkha born of concentration.<br><br>3. "Further, with the fading away of piti, remaining imperturbable, mindful, and clearly aware, one enters the third jhana and experiences within himself the sukkha of which the Noble Ones declare, "Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness."<br><br>4. "Further, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain -- as with the earlier disappearance of joy and sorrow -- one enters and remains in the fourth Jhana which is beyond pleasure and pain; and purified by equanimity and mindfulness.<br><br>Anguttara Nikaya V.28<br><br>Arupa Jhanas<br><br>5. "With the complete transcending of bodily sensations, with the disappearance of all sense of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of diversity, thinking, 'space is infinite,' one enters and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Space.<br><br>6. "With the complete transcending of the Sphere of Infinite Space, thinking, 'consciousness is infinite,' one enters and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness.<br><br>7. "With the complete transcending of the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, thinking, 'There is no-thing,' one enters and remains in the Sphere of No-thingness.<br><br>8. "With the complete transcending of the Sphere of No-thingness, one enters and remains in the Sphere of Neither Perception nor Non-perception."<br><br>Digha Nikaya 15<br><br>----<br><br>There are the 4 Form jhanas and the 4 Formless jhanas, each jhana linked to an individual celestial/heavenly planes. The first 4 jhanas still have 'physicality'/'forms', the last 4 jhanas is beyond form, it is formless. But there is still a mental consciousness existing, we have not transcended Samsara. Below the jhana heavens, there are also 6 heavens belonging to the Sensual plane, enjoying sensuous pleasures. Jhana heavens transcend sensuous pleasures, their joy is a form of meditative absorption as shown above. Those who is skilled in entering Jhanas in meditation can at death, be reborn in the Jhana heavens.<br><br>However even reaching 8th Jhana does not mean you are liberated from samsara as a subtle mental consciousness still exist that binds you towards samsara, and when the karmic seeds ripen, you may even fall down into the lower realms from there again. Therefore even the highest heavens are not a safe place for refuge. Although Jhanas are not the ultimate goal of Theravada, jhanas are used as a means to attain certain amount of calmness in order for Insights to develope. However in Ren Cheng, we practise a more direct path that does not need to go through the various stages of jhanas.<br><br><blockquote>I haven't heard Missionary Chen Ming An's talks.

I've also heard about the Global Conference <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Was interested to find out the conversations on certain topics but could not find it on the net, so nevermind. Missionary Chen Ming An is a Taiwanese teacher in charge of giving important dharma teachings to Jen Chen disciples around the world, so in a sense he is the dharma successor of Venerable Shen Kai. I don't think he has an english name.<br><br><blockquote>Thank you for your time.
