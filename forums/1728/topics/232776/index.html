If you practise the Four Immeasurables, next life you will be born with good conditions, luxury, etc. A Buddhist should cultivate all the good mental qualities, cultivate blessings, wisdoms, and conditions. If you really practise hard as a human.. even if you are reborn in Deva realm you will still get to know the Dharma. Why? The seeds of dharma is deeply rooted in your consciousness, and you have a strong karmic affinity with the Triple Gems -- Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. The Dharma is also taught in the heavens, there are a lot of records in Sutras of Devas attaining Stream Entry or higher. There are many Bodhisattvas teaching there as well. In Tushita Heaven especially, Maitreya Bodhisattva is teaching in the Tushita's Inner Courtyard, until it is time for him to come to Earth to attain Buddhahood. There are many famous practitioners throughout history who aimed to be reborn in Tushita's Inner Courtyard to continue their practise and learning from Maitreya Bodhisattva.<br><br>If you are practising the path to Arhatship, aim to attain at least Stream Entry (1st stage, and at most 7 lifetimes before Arhatship) this lifetime! If you are practising the path of Bodhisattva, aim to attain at least 1st Bhumi this lifetime! Then your path is somewhat "set" already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> It is not all that impossible, there are quite a lot of enlightened people even today, some of them are even posting in the forum. But lastly don't be satisfied with whatever attainment and continue to full enlightenment.. hehe..</div>

Can we still practise the dharma there?<br><br>What are the conditions for one to be reborn into the<br>Tush-ita Heaven's inner courtyard .. anyone knows?<br><br>Thx<br></div></blockquote>No, attaining first jhana does not necessarily mean we will be reborn in first Jhana realm. I also have certain jhanic experiences but I really doubt that I am heading for heaven now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Why? Firstly, Jhana experiences are temporary meaning after you're out of your jhana, life goes on as normal. In the human realm it is impossible to function in the world at the Jhanic level of consciousness, except in deep meditation. If you go to the Jhanic realms in the afterlife, you will be able to sustain the level of jhanic bliss throughout your life as a Brahma.... but NOT in the human realm.<br><br>What this means is you can cultivate very high jhanas and continue to do evil things (although less likely for a mind with stability). This will probably remind you of Devadatta, Buddha's cousin. He tried to kill Buddha four times (and failed) and tried to create a schism in the Sangha. He also mastered the Jhanas and psychic powers, but because of his heavy karma he still had to fall into hell for his wrongdoings.<br><br>The Buddha was omniscient.. so the question is why would he allow devadatta to enter his Sangha and create all these sort of problems? The reasons was that the Buddha did indeed foresee all these, however, he knew that by allowing Devadatta to enter the Sangha, he will be able to attain Pratyekabuddhahood after his "visit to hell". So the Buddha prophecised that Devadatta, due to his jhanic attainments and cultivation, will be able to attain Pratyekabuddhahood in the future.<br><br>Then how to attain Jhana rebirth? Firstly, the basics must be there -- you must avoid all bad karmas, keep the 5 precepts, do the 10 virtuous deeds, practise generosity, be filial to your parents, also practise the mental qualities like the 4 immeasurables, loving kindness and so on... I also suspect at the time of death, you must be in the state of jhana to begin with.. then there is a likelihood that you might be reborn in the jhana realms. That means, not only must you attain jhanas a few times, but you must master the art of entering jhana easily at any given moments, this requires very strong samadhi/samatha skills.<br><br>Lastly.. I am not too sure about the practise of being reborn in Tushita Court as I do not practise that... perhaps someone can fill you in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Isis:<br>For one whom has attained first jhana, can easily go into first jhana at any moment.. even at the moment of death?</blockquote>No, please read my post again. I mean, if you can attain first jhana, it does not mean you can attain first jhana again easily, or even at will, it requires practise and mastery to be able to enter it "at your will".<br><br><blockquote>I heard it was actually encouraged to attain first jhana...<br>can practise dharma there too?<br><br>of course in the long run, we should all practise and strive for enlightenment.</blockquote>Depends on which teacher. The reason why some teachers would teach that entering at least first jhana is very helpful, is because it stabilises the mind a lot. Some teachers teach Insight straight, etc.<br><br>Dharma Dan said,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As concentration improves, it is as though the mind Â“seesÂ” the first jhana and grabs on to it. Having an idea of what you are looking for, i.e. something enjoyable and steady, can be helpful for this. It has the five primary factors of applied and sustained effort or attention, rapture, happiness and concentration. Thus, it is great fun, feels good, but takes consistent effort to sustain. The attention is focused narrowly, as though one were looking at a small area of this page. This state can be quite a relief from the pain and discomfort of sitting meditation and can temporarily quiet the mind somewhat. As with all the concentration states, it is generally quite easy to concentrate on something that is very enjoyable. Thus, oneÂ’s concentration skills may improve rapidly and easily after attaining the first jhana and tend to basically flounder until one has a attained the first jhana. Thus, attaining the first jhana is really, really important.</span><br><br>And anyway yes, you can practise Dharma at the first jhana too. Why? From what I know, the Brahma King, Maha Brahma, is also a Buddhist (quite obviously, he invited Buddha to teach, and took refuge under him, and invited him to the heavens to teach), he is an Anagami (3rd stage Arhat).<br><br>My Master and teachers however, do not recommend any particular jhanic cultivation.</div>

I learn it during meditation retreat and also some years ago, I attended meditation class, with my mum and wife (gf at that time)  on Sundays in a Buddhist temple in Bukit Timah. The teachers said that i was a very good meditator and it is a pity that i did not took refuge. But for years there was no progress so I quit going to the class.<br><br>For me, jhana meditation was not enough. Without insights and realisations, I was not able to understand the working of mind and consciousness. It was a series of realisations that allowed me to better understand consciousness and work around the limitations imposed by the 'sense of self'.  For that I am grateful to the guidance offered by several teachers.<br><br>My point is... with <strong>the proper understanding and practice</strong>... realisations and progress along the enlightenment path is shorter than one usually expect. Certainly it is less than one kalpa <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>One of the major pitfall is in reading up and absorbing all kinds of informations, regardless of whether they are from religious sources or not. It must be understood that many informations maybe culturally bias. Even if the informations are true, those realised masters wrote from a state that is different from the average readers'. As such, these readers conjure up 'imaginations' and 'speculation' that impede progress. Yes, speculations impede progress. In fact, they are what constitute most of my obstacles.... I spend more time unlearning them instead <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>These are my experiences and I hope this is helpful.<br><br></div>

Any mental state is still within the realm of consciousness, as long as there is no awakening to the truth of <strong>no-self, emptiness</strong>, there is still dualistic consciousness, 7th consciousness.<br><br>To put it in another way... enlightenment means awakening to the truth of what always IS. It is literally waking up from the dream of what never existed, into the real... but yet reality is not any "thing", being of the nature of emptiness itself, ungraspable. Just a form of wisdom.<br><br><blockquote><strong>"Â“Virtuous man, one who practices Complete Enlightenment of the causal ground of the Tathagata realizes that [birth and extinction] are like an illusory flower in the sky. Thus there is no continuance of birth and death and no body or mind that is subject to birth and death. This nonexistence of [birth and death and body and mind] is so not as a consequence of contrived effort. It is so by its intrinsic nature.<br><br>Â“The awareness [of their nonexistence] is like empty space. That which is aware of the empty space is like the appearance of the illusory flower. However, one cannot say that the nature of this awareness is nonexistent. Eliminating both existence and nonexistence is in accordance with pure enlightenment.<br><br>Â“Why is it so? Because the nature of empty space is ever unmoving. Likewise, there is neither arising nor perishing within the Tathagatagarbha. [8] It is free from conceptual knowledge and views. Like the nature of dharmadhatu, which is ultimate, wholly complete, and pervades all ten directions, such is the Dharma practice [of the Tathagata] of the causal ground."</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Manjusri, you should know<br>that all Tathagatas,<br>from their original-arising causal ground,<br>use wisdom to enlighten<br>and penetrate ignorance.<br>Realizing that ignorance is like<br>a flower in the sky,<br>they are thus liberated from the continuance<br>[of birth and death].<br>Like a person [seen] in a dream who<br>cannot be found when [the dreamer] awakens,<br>awareness is like empty space.<br>It is impartial and equal, and ever unmoving.<br>When enlightenment pervades all ten directions,<br>the Buddha Path is accomplished.<br>There is no place where illusions vanish,<br>and there is no attainment<br>in accomplishing the Buddha Path,<br>for the intrinsic nature is already wholly complete.<br>By this, bodhisattvas<br>can give rise to the bodhi-mind.<br>Sentient beings in the Dharma Ending Age<br>through this practice will avoid erroneous views.</strong></blockquote>~ The Sutra of Complete Enlightenment</div>
