              <p>Last time my parents were trying to conceive a boy (I have a sister who is 6 years older than me). They couldn't somehow... so my mom went to this very famous temple in Penang called the snake temple. That time my mom is still not a Buddhist.</p>
              <p>(The temple was built circa 1850 in memory of <a title="Qingshui (monk)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingshui_%28monk%29">Chor Soo Kong</a> (ç¥–å¸«å…¬), by a <a title="Buddhism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhist</a> <a title="Monk" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk">monk</a>.
                              <strong>Qingshui</strong> (<a title="Chinese language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a>: <span lang="zh">æ¸…æ°´</span>; <a title="Pinyin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">pinyin</a>: <em>QÄ«ngshuÇ�</em>; <a title="PeÌ�h-Å�e-jÄ«" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB">PeÌ�h-Å�e-jÄ«</a>: Chheng-chúi; 1047-1101), also known as <strong>Chor Soo Kong</strong> (<a title="Chinese language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a>: <span lang="zh">ç¥–å¸«å…¬</span>; <a title="PeÌ�h-Å�e-jÄ«" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB">PeÌ�h-Å�e-jÄ«</a>: ChóÍ˜-su-kong), born <strong>Chen Zhaoyin</strong> (é™³æ˜­æ‡‰, <em>Tân Chiau-èng</em> in <a title="Hokkien" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien">Hokkien</a>) was a Northern <a title="Song Dynasty" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Dynasty">Song Dynasty</a> <a title="Zen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen">Chan</a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="Buddhist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist">Buddhist</a> <a title="Bhikkhu" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhu">monk</a> from the region of <a title="Anxi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxi">Anxi</a> County in <a title="Quanzhou" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanzhou">Quanzhou</a>, <a title="China" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a>. He
                               was very serious about spiritual attainment and was ordained at a young
                               age. He was said to have gained supernatural powers gained through his skill in speaking the <a title="Dharma (Buddhism)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma_%28Buddhism%29">dharma</a> and meditation.<sup id="cite_ref-tan_1-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingshui_%28monk%29#cite_note-tan-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Through this, he is said to have saved the town of Anxi during a period
                               of drought, bringing rain as he went from place to place. In reverence,
                               the villagers built shrines to him and hence became a <a class="extiw" title="wikt:deify" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deify">deified</a> person in <a title="Chinese folk religion" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion">Chinese folk religion</a>. </p>
              <p>Legend has it that Chor Soo Kong, who was also a healer, gave 
                              shelter to the snakes of jungle. When he died at the age of 65 after a 
                              lifetime of good deeds, he was bestowed the honorific title Chor Soo, 
                              meaning an eminent historic figure continuously revered by a community 
                              generation after generation. After the completion of the temple, snakes 
                              appeared on their own accord.)</p>
              <p>Every year during the patriarch Qing Shui's birthday, all the snakes will actually cross the street by themselves from all directions to enter the temple. There will be so many of them that unfortunately some will die by car accident when crossing the street.</p>
              <p>Anyhow, my mother prayed to Qing Shui zhu shi for a boy, and through divination picked the Qian which told her that for fulfill her wish, she needs to chant Amitabha Sutra for 12 days. She was told that she needs to bring the child back to the temple every year for the first 16 years if she did conceive of this child, and make the child become the god son of Master Qing Shui. She did just that and afterwards I was conceived, my mom had a strange dream, anyway when I was born my mom brought me back.</p>
              <p>The funny thing is, after three times of divination (throwing the block: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaobei">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaobei</a>) it seems that the Qing Shui zhu shi resolutely refused to take me as his godson. The medium then said, maybe Guan Yin will take me as godson. So they checked and that seems to be the case, so I became Guan Yin godson.</p>
              <p>Later my mom became a Buddhist and took refuge under the Venerable Master Shen Kai. She conveyed a question to him, whether she needs to bring me back to the temple to pray every year. He said if you feel you need to then do it, but said that it is not necessary. As we became Buddhists, my mom stopped visiting these temples.</p>
              <p>Then as a Buddhist, even now, I still find a strong affinity with Guan Yin. I also found out that Guan Yin - who is actually a Buddhist Bodhisattva called the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, is the bodhisattva of compassion. She 'saves' all beings without discrimination, her compassion for all beings is without discrimination.</p>
              <p>For example, he does not 'protect' his godsons and goddaughters more than he/she 'protects' anyone else. His/her compassion is unconditional. If you mentally recite the name of Guan Yin if say you are facing danger to life, whether you are Buddhist, Taoist or Christian, you will be helped. There is no need to form a 'special relationship' like asking to be guan yin's godson. If we take refuge in the triple gems - the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, that would suffice as it creates a strong causal connection.</p>
              <p>The Lotus Sutra states:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.fodian.net/world/0262_25.html">http://www.fodian.net/world/0262_25.html</a><br> <em><br> I shall now tell you in brief, <br> That for those who hear his name or see him, <br> And who are mindful of his name unceasingly, <br> He can extinguish the suffering of all realms of existence. <br><br> If someone is the victim of another's harmful intent, </em> <em><br> And is pushed into a pit of fire, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> The pit of fire will turn into a pool. <br> If someone is being tossed about in the great sea, <br> And is surrounded by the dangers of dragons, fish, and ghosts, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> The waves will not drown him. </em></p>
              <p>etc etc</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a Buddhist, we do not practice superstition. We do not go 'æ‹œæ‹œ' with a superstitious mindset, but we do venerate and bow to the images of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.</p>
              <p>We do this out of respect and veneration, not out of superstitious thought. But not only that, we should practise to be like the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>You know there is this form of Avalokitesvara called the qian shou guan yin - thousand armed avalokitesvara?</p>
              <p>This means that each of us can become an 'arm' of avalokitesvara. We should practise to be as compassionate as Guan Yin, we should attain enlightenment ourselves and save all suffering beings in samsara. In this way, we carry out the work of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. We ourselves become bodhisattvas, and we too will attain Buddhahood.</p>

              <p>Also, I suspect that I recited a Avalokitesvara mantra in my past life as a Tibetan Buddhist (this life I'm not Tibetan Buddhist, haha)</p>
              <p>Because in one of my dreams, I dreamt of a dakini telling me to recite the the green tara mantra, but in a very strange tune that I cannot find elsewhere. When I woke up and chant I had a very strange experience of entering into an intense state of bliss and felt very strong devotion to the green tara (a female emanation of Guan Yin).</p>
              <p>I seldom ever chant in this life (if I do I would chant Namo Da Ci Da Bei Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa å�—æ— å¤§æ…ˆå¤§æ‚²è§‚ä¸–éŸ³è�©è�¨), and I don't chant mantras. I mostly do meditation.</p>

                  Buddhism? Buddha means awareness and enlightenment, enlightening oneself as well as
                  others. Having attained the highest level of enlightenment, one becomes Buddha. Because
                  all sentient beings are blinded by ignorance, confusion, worries and sufferings, it is
                  only through the practise of Buddhism that we can liberate ourselves from these sufferings
                  and worries, and attain the real happiness and bliss. Sakyamuni Buddha is the teacher of
                  our Saha world. There are also many Buddhas in the many other worlds. Sakyamuni Buddha
                  lived in this world for 81 years, of which he spent 49 years expounding over 300
                  discourses on the Dharma. Of the Dharma which he expounded, the Humanity Vehicle Buddhism
                  or Jen Chen Buddhism is most relevant and most suitable for humanity. <br> </strong></span>

                  is the orthodox Dharma that Sakyamuni Buddha has expounded to humanity, that is, the Jen
                  Chen Buddhism. Because the Buddha manifested in the human form to attain Buddhahood, and
                  we are all human beings, we therefore promote Jen Chen Buddhism. This is the Buddhism for
                  humanity.<br> <br> Because human beings live in a world in which sufferings are created by emotions, passions
                  and lusts, they become confused. Thus, the enlightened and compassionate Buddha expounded
                  the Dharma to bring salvation to humanity and to lead them from confusion to realization.
                  Realization means enlightenment, and it is only through enlightenment that we can liberate

                  to be a Buddhist. Yet, it is also not easy. A verse from the Buddhist sutra reads:
                  "Avoid all evils; do all that are good; purify one’s mind. These are the
                  teachings of all Buddhas." One may ask about the difference between Buddhism and
                  Christianity, or indeed the other religions. The majority of us have the concept that all
                  religions are the same: they all teach us to be good. Indeed, most religions teach to
                  avoid all evils and do all that are good. However, purifying one’s mind is the
                  underlying tenet of Buddhism. In general, other religions are still within the
                  transmigration of the six realms - the realm of celestial being, human being, asura,
                  animal, ghost and hell, and within the fiery of the Three Planes of existence - world of
                  sensuous desires, world of forms and world of formless. Buddhism is different from all
                  other religions. <br> <br> How to be a Buddhist? First of all, we need to understand that Buddhists are categorised
                  into those who believe in the Buddha, and those who learn from the Buddha. Those who
                  believe in the Buddha are believers of Buddhism. This category is further subdivided into
                  those who believe blindly, that is, being superstitious, and those who exercise wisdom in
                  their beliefs. Learning Buddhism, however, is different. In learning Buddhism, we
                  cultivate to correct our conduct and habits, we carry out religious duties, and promote
                  the Dharma for the good of sentient beings. We follow the Buddha in his cultivation and
                  practices. That is learning Buddhism.</strong></span>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;">How does one start? The best way to start is to take refuge in the
                  Three Treasures - the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. Only then, is one really a
                  Buddhist. While on the path of learning Buddhism, there are many things that we ought to
                  do. The most basic of which is to be aware of our self serving and evil habits, and to
                  eradicate these habits. When our mind is impure, we need to purify it. When we are pure
                  and everyone in the family is pure, then our society is pure. When every society is pure,
                  then the entire humanity is pure. In this way, the world becomes a pure land.</span></strong></p>
